 UNITED KINGDOM
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a longstand-
 ing constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government. A lower
 legislative chamber (the House of Commons), the center of parliamentary power, is
 elected in periodic multiparty elections. An upper chamber (the House of Lords),
 with power to revise and delay implementation of laws, is made up of hereditary
 and life peers and senior clergy of the established Church of England. There is an
 independent judiciary, but Parliament may overrule its decisions through legisla-
 tion.
 Throughout the United Kingdom, police forces are responsive to, and under the
 effective control of, civilian officials. Since"1996 the intelligence agency MI-5 has
 had the authority to act in support of other law enforcement agencies in the preven-
 tion and detection of serious domestic crime. In some areas of Northern Ireland, be-
 cause of the continuing threat of terrorist and other violence, army units operated
 to reinforce the Northern Ireland police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
 Although the security forces generally respected human rights and the rule of law,
 members of the police force committed some human rights abuses.  -
 A highly developed, diversified market-based economy provides most residents
 with a high standard of living. Certain geographic areas, particularly older indus-
 trial areas including Northern Ireland, suffer from higher than average unemploy-
 ment rates. In addition, unemployment tends to be higher among some demographic
 groups, such as youth and racial minorities. The Government provides comprehen-
 sive social welfare services, including a national health system, housing and family
 benefits, and heavily subsidized higher education.  -
 The Government generally'respected the human rights of its citizens, but there
 were problems in some areas. Police occasionally abused detainees. Prison over-
 crowding remains a problem, and the number of prisoner suicides rose to 83 in
 1998. The Government continued to take steps to combat violence against women.
 
 
 1593
 
 Societal discrimination against women, nonwhite minorities, and the Traveller com-
 munity are problems.
 In November the Government passed the Human Rights Act of 1998, which incor-
 porates articles of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into British
 law. It requires all public bodies to act in a manner compatible with the ECHR and
 allows citizens to take cases involving of ECHR provisions to British courts for reso-
 lution.
 On April 10, Good Friday, representatives of the major political parties of North-
 er Ireland agreed to new political and constitutional arrangements for Northern
 Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement, the culmination of almost 2 years of negotia-
 tions, was approved in a May 22 referendum by 71 percent of the voters in Northern
 Ireland. Constitutionally, the agreement provides that Northern Ireland is to re-
 main a part of the United Kingdom unless a majority of its-people decide otherwise.
 The agreement set up the framework for a devolved Northern Ireland assembly,
 elections for which were held on June 22. It also provided for north-south and Brit-
 ish-Irish councils to enhance cross-border consultation and cooperation. The Good
 Friday Agreement was given legislative form by Parliament in the Northern Ireland
 Act of 1998.
 The Good Friday Agreement/Northern Ireland Act contains a number of specific
 human rights provisions. The Standing Advisory Commission on Rights (SACHR)
 was replaced by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. The Northern
 Ireland Fair Employment Commission, Equal Opportunities Commission, Commis-
 sion for Racial Equality, and Disability Council will all become constituent bodies
 of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland when the Northern Ireland Act is
 implemented formally in the spring of 1999. An independent Police Commission en-
 visaged by the agreement was established in June and is scheduled to present a re-
 port in mid-1999 on the future of policing in Northern Ireland.
 Some paramilitary dissident groups in Northern Ireland engaged in acts of vio-
 lence aimed at disrupting the peace process. Paramilitary groups in Northern Ire-
 land were believed to be responsible for 55 deaths, 210 shootings, and 126 bombings
 during the year. Both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups continued to en-
 gage in "punishmenV' attacks. Churches and religious organizations in Northern
 Ieand were the object of 25 sectarian attacks through July.
 A May 29 Parades Commission decision to reroute a July 5 Orange Order parade
 away from the Garvaghy road in a nationalist area of Portadown led to serious and
 widespread public disturbances throughout Northern Ireland. The ensuing standoff
 led to rioting and was linked to the deaths of three young boys in a sectarian bomb-
 ing attack on a suburban house near Ballymoney.
 In support of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government in September began
 to release prisoners affiliated with paramilitary organizations whose political rep-
 resentatives were party to the peace process and that maintain a complete and un-
 equivocal cease-fire. About 230 paramilitary prisoners, from both republican and
 loyalist organizations, were paroled by year's end, with parole for some 200 more
 to follow by May 2000.
 Several British Army units in Northern Ireland have been withdrawn, leaving the
 Army's presence at its lowest level since the 1970's, around 15,000 troops.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government.
 In January police shot and killed James Ashley of East Sussex during a raid on
 his apartment. Ashley was thought to be responsible for drug trafficking and a stab-
 bing in Hastings. In May the independent Police Complaints Authority ruled that
 there was no evidence linking Ashley to the stabbing. Eight members of the Sussex
 police subsequently were suspended on full pay.
 The Prison Service reported 133 deaths in custody during the year, of which 83
 were self-inflicted, 45 were due to natural causes, 4 were considered homicide, and
 one remained under investigation. The Prison Service has implemented policy
 changes in an attempt to curb the rise in prisoner suicides. Changes include evalu-
 ating prisoners upon entry and, depending upon the level of risk, providing counsel-
 ing or placing prisoners in easily monitored cells. The nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) Prison Reform Trust endorsed the measures taken by the prison service.
 A June Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) review of the case of Nigerian asylum
 seeker Shiji Lapite, who died in December 1994 after a struggle with police in north
 London, resulted in a determination that insufficient evidence existed to prosecute
 any officer for Lapite's death. A 1996 inquest into the case had determined the kill-
 
 
 1594
 ing' to be unlawful. Earlier in the year, three officers were charged with man-
 slaughter for causing the death by asphyxiation of Irishman Richard O'Brien in
 1994. The officers were awaiting trials, which were scheduled forJune 1999.
 On September 2, the Government released Scots guardsmen Mark Wright and
 Jim Fisher, who were convicted of the Setember 1992 killing of Peter McBride, a
 young Catholic man from Belfast. Mcbri e had been stopped by a military patrol
 and was shot as he ran from the patrol. The soldiers claimed that they believed that
 the bag McBride carried contaied explosives.
 The Police Complaints Authority completed a report on the death of-Dairmud
 O'NTeill that has not yet been published. O'Neill was killed in 1996 when police raid-
 ed. his London apartment during a counterterrorism operation. Human rights groups
 charge that O'Nei, who subsequently was found to be unarmed, was denied needed
 immediate medical treatment by p.olice. In 1997"'the CPS agreed to review the case
 of Derek Treadaway,' whom police officers suffocated to unconsciousness with plastic
 bags in 1992. In February it found that there was inisufficibnt evidence to prosecute.
 The case of Ibrahima Sey, who died at the llford police station in 1996 after being
 sprayed by tear gas, was 'zereferred following an inquest's finding of unlawful killA
 ing. On review, the court decided not to prosecute. In 1998 a court ruledthat there
 would be no new inquest in-t the death of Briah Douglas. Douglas, ancAfr-Carib-
 bean man, suffered a fractured skull -after a confrontation with two .batn-equipped
 police officers. In March 1997his family had won the right to challenge an inuest
 jury's decision that his 1995  deat-wa d   w  de to misadventure.
 heIn  Apri the  CPS  decided  that no  prosecution-would  occur  as  a-result  of Dermot
 McShane's death. McShane was killed during the 1996 disturbances in Londonderry
 when he was run over by an armored personnel 'carrier. No' information was avail-
 able on the status of the case of Jim McDonnell, who died in 1996 in Northern Ire-
 land's Maghberry prison (fellow-prisoners charged-that-he was beaten by prison
 staff) or the retrial of the police officer charged with the. 1996 killing of David Ewen.
 In January the Government established a new judici inquiry into6 the events Of
 January 30,- 1972---"Bloody Sunday"'--when 14 unarfned civil rights demonstrators
 in -Londonderry were killed by'British soldiers, but for which no member, of the secu-
 rity'forces was held accountable. The decision was made s a result of new ballistic
 evidence and eyewitness accounts. The inquiry began its preliminary hearings. A
 full inquiry is schedld to begin in the spring of 1999 with' a repdrt to follow at
 some point in 2000.
 o Despite declarations of cease-fires-by the main paramilitary groups, killings by
 both republican and loyalist groups in Northern Ireland continued, although' the
 number of incidents diminished. Republican paramilitary groups include the Provi-
 sional Irish republican-Army (PIRA), the "Real"- IRA, -the Continuity IRA-(CIRA),
 and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Loyalist paramilitary groups in-
 ude the Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters (UDA/UFF), the Ul-
 ster Volunteer Force (UVF), and the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).
 The December 27, 1997, murder of LVF leader Billy Wright in the high-security
 Maze prison sparked a series of violent incidents during the eariy part of the year.
 In October INLA members Christopher McWilliams, John Kennaway, and John
 Glennon, all serving sentences in the Maze prison, were given life sentences for
 Wright's murder. On January 10, Catholic Terry Enright was killed in a drive-by
 shooting as he worked as a doorman at a central Belfast nightclub. On January 18,
 Catholic Fergal McCusker was shot in the head in County Londonderry The LVF
 was blamed for both attacks. On January 19, the INLA killed Protestant Jim
 Guiney at his shop at Kingsway in Dunmurry. The-same day, Catholic taxi driver
 Larry Brennan was killed while sitting in his car in Belfast. On January 21, Catho-
 lic Benedict Hughes was killed in the Sandy Row area of Belfast. The UFF claimed
 responsibility for both the Hughes and Brennan killings. The LVF was responsible
 for the January 23 killing of Catholic gas worker Liam Conway and the January
 24 killing of Catholic taxi driver John McColgan. -     a
 On February 9, Direct Action Against Drugs (DAAD), an alleged Provisional IRA
 cover organization, was blamed for the death-of Brendan Campbell, a Belfast drug
 dealer. On February 10, Protestant Robert Dougan. a loyalist with links to the UFF,
 was killed as he waited to pick up a friend in Dunmurry. On February 18, the body
 of Catholic Kevin Conway was found; he had been killed with his hands bound in
 a County Antrim farmhouse. The RUC suspected that a republican group carried
 out the killing. -          -
 On March 3, two gunmen killed Protestant Philip Allen and Catholic Damien
 Trainer in a bar in Poyntzpass, County Armagh. The LyF was blamed for the at-
 tack on the two friends. On March 15, David Keys, one of four men charged with
 the attack on Trainor and Phillips, was killed in the LVF Section of the Maze pris-
 on. Keys was found hanged in what police initially thought was a suicide. Later,
 
 
 1595
 
 the RUC determined that he was killed because he was about to cooperate with the
 RUC investigation into the Allen-Trainor murders. Two LVF prisoners were charged
 with his murder. On March 27, Cyril Stewart, a former RU officer, was murdered
 outside a supermarket in County Armagh by the INLA. On April 24, Catholic Adri-
 an Lamph was killed in Portadown, County Armagh. Catholic Ciaran Heffron was
 killed on April 26 in Crumlin, County Antrim. Both killings were blamed on the
 LVF. On June 22, a British soldier, Corporal Gary Fenton, was killed after being
 hit by a truck at an army checkpoint in South Armagh.
 On July 11, Jason, Mark, and Richard Quinn, three brothers all under the age
 of 10 died after their house in Ballymoney, County Antrim, was the target of an
 arson attack. RUC investigators arrested a man with loyalist ties in connection with
 the murders. On July 19, Catholic Andy Kearney was dragged out of his home in
 north Belfast and shot in both legs; he subsequently bled to death. The RUC consid-
 ered the killing a revenge attack directed and carried out by a Belfast PIRA figure.
 In October RUC Constable Frank O'Reilly died from head injuries received the
 previous month when a blast bomb was thrown at police during loyalist rioting in
 Portadown. O'Reilly and other police officers came under attack during protests
 against the authorities' refusal to allow Orangemen to walk along Garvaghy Road.
 In December the court of appeal overturned the conviction of Danny McNamee
 after hearing new evidence in the case of the IRA Hyde Park bombing in which four
 soldiers died in 1982. McNamee was freed in November under the Good Friday
 Agreement after having served 11 years of a 25-year sentence. McNamee's convic-
 tion was based in part on limited fingerprint evidence, which according to his coun-
 sel was the result of his work at an electronics factory. Prosecuting authorities with-
 held fingerprint evidence of the involvement of another person, a convicted IRA
 bomb-maker. While ruling that this withholding of evidence made his conviction un-
 sound, the judges said there was still strong evidence he had been involved in the
 bombing.
 On October 31, two gunmen in north Belfast killed Brian Service, a 35-year-old
 Catholic. The "Red Hand Defenders," a little-known renegade loyalist group, claimed
 responsibility
 The Real RA, a splinter republican group, took responsibility for the August 15
 car bombing in Omagh, County Tyrone, which killed 29 persons, including children,
 and injured several hundred more. The bombing was condemned by every political
 party in Northern Ireland, including Sinn Fein, and caused widespread revulsion
 throughout the community. Police indicated that the attackers deliberately planted
 the car bomb in an area where there would be a large number of people. After
 Omagh the Government, in close coordination with the Republic of Ireland (see Sec-
 tions 1.d. and i.e.), passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act.
 The 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, counsel to many IRA suspects, remained a
 disputed case. In a civil suit, Finucane's widow alleged government negligence in
 his wrongful death, and the unresolved status of the case has been interpreted by
 a number of human rights organizations as evidence of collusion between govern-
 ment officials and loyalist paramilitary groups. In April in a report to the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission that resulted from an October 1997 visit to
 Northern Ireland, the United Nations (U.N.) Special Rapporteur on the Independ-
 ence of Judges and Lawyers called on the Government to reopen the Finucane case
 under the Commissions of Inquiry Act. The U.N. report stated that precedent for
 a reexamination was established by the reopening of the Bloody Sunday case. The
 Government ruled out such an inquiry, stating that there was no justification to re-
 open the case in the absence of new evidence.
 Coroners do not have the power to compel those suspected of involvement in
 extrajudicial killing to testify at inquests, and the relatives of the deceased receive
 no advance disclosure of evidence. In Northern Ireland, coroners are permitted to
 inquire only into "how"'--that is "by what means"--the deceased died, rather than
 into the broad circumstances of death. Human rights groups argue that this narrow
 definition shields wrongdoers, including soldiers and police officers, and unneces-
 sarily keeps family members from learning the truth of the circumstances regarding
 their relative's death.
 Former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London in October
 under a warrant issued by a Spanish judge that sought his extradition to Spain to
 stand trial for the torture and murder of over 3,000 people during his time in office.
 The High Court's ruling that Pinochet had sovereign immunity from arrest was
 overturned by the Law Lords in November in a 3 to 2 verdict, in which they con-
 cluded that there should be no immunity for crimes against humanity. Extradition
 proceedings began in December. However, the Law Lords set aside their decision in
 December when Pinochet's lawyers contended that one of the judges who ruled
 against Pinochet failed to disclose his substantial links to Amnesty International,
 
 
 1596
 which was represented in the case. A rehearing of the appeal was- to begin in Janu-
 y1999.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Investigations continued into at least 14 terrorist-perpetrated disappearances that
 date back to 1972, although there is no longer a dedicated investigative team. The
 victims, usually members of the'security forces, suspected informers, or petty crimi-
 nals are thought to have been murdered and buried in secret locations. Throughout
 the year there were indications that the IRA would disclose the locations of remains
 of persons abducted and killed by its members. However, by year's end no disclo-
 sures leading to the recovery of remains were made.   �
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; however,
 police occasionally abused detainees. Human rights organizations report that such
 abuse, while not widespread, is a matter of serious concern. The NGO Inquest states
 that injuries and illnesses result more often from neglect or misdiagnosis than from
 physical attack, although there have been incidents of police brutality (see Sections
 l.a. and 5).
 Detainees who claim physical mistreatment have the right to an immediate medi-
 cal examination. A trial judge must examine such i claim. Confessions obtained by
 abusive treatment are not admissible in court, and judges can exclude even vol-
 untary confessions.
 Complaints of sexual harassment and some criminal conduct within the London
 metropolitan police force continued Police officials initiated investigations in several
 hundred cases and remain committed to rooting abusive treatment and corruption
 out of the police force.
 The Police Complaints Authority issued a report in December cautioning the po-
 lice that- the use of longer and heavier U.S.-style batons resulted in an increased
 number of complaints. The report urged the police to draw up new training pro-
 grams to bring baton use in line with British practices.
 Corporal punishment remains on the statute books in several Caribbean depend-
 ent territories, although it is rarely practiced. The Government continued to ask  the
 governments of dependent territories to bring their laws in line with those of the
 U nited Kingdom.
 The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, who assumed the responsibilities of
 the Independent Commissioner for Police Complaints, supervises police investiga-
 tions of complaints in Northern Ireland filed against the police, or referred to the
 Commission by the RUC Chief Constable, the Police Autthority, or the Northern Ire-
 land Secretary of State. The Ombudsman automatically supervises cases involving
 deat or serious injury, and can direct the Chief Constable to bring charges against
 police officers. The Commission reported that through August it had received 1,987
 complaints. Of the 1,579 cases processed (some pen ding from previous years), inves-
 tigations led to informal disciplinary action in 42 cases and to formal charges in 10
 cases.
 On June 3, the Government established the Independent Commission on Policing
 with a mandate to evaluate the future policing structures and arrangements in
 Northern Ireland. The Commission's goal is to recommend proposals ensuring that
 the police service in Northern Ireland enjoys widespread support from the commu-
 nity as a whole. Both sides of the community generally recognized the experience
 and impartiality of the members of the Commission, which is to issue its report in
 mid-1999.
 In 1993 the Northern Ireland Secretary named an Independent Assessor of Mili-
 tary Complaints to deal with complaints of abuses committed by the army. The
 Independent Assessor is responsible for coordinating investigations into abuses.
 During the first 7 months of 1998, 51 formal and 530 informal complaints were re-
 ceived, primarily for harassment or abuse.
 In 1992 the Government appointed a senior barrister as Independent Commis-
 sioner for Holding Centers in Northern Ireland, with the authority to make irregu-
 lar, unannounced visits to any holding center, observe interrogations, and interview
 detainees. There were 176 visits to the 3 Northern Ireland holding centers in 1997
 by the Commissioner and his deputy. Through the end of July, 72 visits had taken
 place. The number of allegations, generally for verbal harassment or "technical as-
 sault," has dropped substantially.                     ,w
 Police in Northern Ireland continued to use plastic bullets, particularly in connec-
 tion with violence that erupted during the summer marching season (see Section
 2.d.). RUC reports indicated tha 83 pla ble    wrforeinthe first 2 weeks
 of July, compared with 2,51 in the same period in 1997. According to RUC rules,
 plastic bullets should be aimed at the lower half of the body; serious head and upper
 body injuries nevertheless resulted from plastic bullet use during the year.
 
 
 1597
 Plastic bullet use in Northern Ireland is severely criticized by human rights mon-
 itors, although the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1984 that using them
 to quell serious riots did not contravene the European Convention on Human
 Rights. The U.N. Committee Against Torture, the European Parliament, Human
 Rights Watch/Helsinki, and other NGO'S have called for a ban on their use. The
 Government has said that alternatives have been considered but that most options
 have been found to be either more dangerous or inaccurate. By year's end no results
 were announced from a nationwide policy review of plastic bullet use that was com-
 missioned by the Government in September 1997.
 Both human rights groups and the Independent Commissioner for Holding Cen-
 ters for Northern Ireland repeatedly recommended the closing of the Castlereagh
 Detention Center, which remains open despite persistent complaints of police impro-
 priety in the interrogation process. In February video recording equipment was in-
 troduced in interrogation sessions in all three Northern Ireland holding centers.
 Groups representing prisoners cite the video equipment as a significant deterrent
 to police impropriety. Human rights groups continue to call for audio recording to
 be introduced. The Government published a draft code of practice for audio record-
 ing in October and invited public response by December, as a prelude to legislation.
 Through the end of September, the armnedforces registered a total of 415 formal
 complaints. Of these, 263 were sexual complaints, 94 were racial complaints, and
 58 were for bullying or other harassment. A complaint procedure was fully imple-
 mented in October 1997. Service personnel also have the right to submit complaints
 to employment tribunals. In March the services entered into a 5-year partnership
 agreement with the Commission on Racial Equality (CRE) to promote racial equality
 practices.
 Paramilitary groups opposed to the peace process in Northern Ireland continued
 violent campaigns targeting buildings and economic centers, as well as police, the
 military, and civilians. In addition to the deadly attack on Omagh and other killings
 (see Section L.a.), numerous other bombings and attacks damaged property and
 caused injuries but did not lead to a loss of life. These incidents included bombings
 in Enniskillen, Moira, Markethill, Portadown, Banbridge, Belfast, Londonderry, and
 Carrickfergus. Mortar attacks were conducted in Newry and against RUC stations
 in Armagh. In June persons allegedly associated with the Real IRA were arrested
 in London and in the Republic of Ireland for possession of bomb-related devices
 when police foiled a planned attack.
 Both loyalist and republican terrorists in Northern Ireland continued to carry out
 'punishment" attacks. These often were carried out to settle scores within para-
 military groups, and loyalists often, but not exclusively, targeted members who
 broke ranks. However, such vigilante attacks also were targeted against so-called
 "antisocial activities," such as drug dealing, particularly by the republicans and
 were used to extend paramilitary control and influence in the wider community. The
 attackers beat their victims with iron pipes, baseball bats, sledgehammers, and
 spiked clubs; dropped concrete blocks on exposed limbs; impaled persons on fence
 spikes; and shot victims in the knees and legs. During 1998 the RUC recorded 86
 loyalist assaults, 34 loyalist shootings/kneecappings, 50 republican assaults, and 38
 republican shootings/kneecappings. The corresponding figures in 1997 were 72 loyal-
 ist assaults, 48 loyalist shootings, 78 republican assaults, and 24 republican shoot-
 ings, respectively. However, the statistics may not fully describe the extent of these
 attacks, since some victims are reluctant to approach the police.
 Prison conditions generally met minimum international standards, but both the
 Prison Service and the NGO Prison Reform Trust have identified overcrowding as
 a serious issue. According to the Prison Service, prisons in England and Wales are
 at 108 percent of capacity. Local prisons, which tend to be old and small, are typi-
 cally the most overcrowded. The Government, in its comprehensive spending review
 released in July, recognized the Prison Service's reports and allocated increased
 funding for prison maintenance and construction. Separate and distinct prison re-
 gimes exist for Northern Ireland and Scotland, administered through the Northern
 Ireland office and the Scottish Office.
 To reduce overcrowding, the Crime and Disorder Act of 1998, which was passed
 in July, contains provisions for the early release of prisoners who participate in the
 electronic tagging program. Prisoners serving sentences between 3 months and 4
 years may be released up to 2 months early if they consent to wear an electronic
 location indicator for the remainder of their sentences.
 Human rights groups were particularly critical of special security units (SSU's)
 used to hold those persons deemed to pose an exceptional risk of escape. SSU in-
 mates are not told how long they are to be held in SSU's, nor are they involved in
 annual reviews of their detentions or informed when such a review is taking place.
 Citing small group isolation, the lack of adequate exercise, work, educational oppor-
 
 
 1598
 
 tunities, and natural daylight, as well as strict enforcement of noncontact visits
 through a glass barrier, human rights groups have condemned SSU imprisonment
 as violating international standards. A 1996 government inquiry concluded that pro-
 longed incarceration could lead to mental illness. Only three prisoners remain in a
 solitary SSU at Whitemoor Prison, the only remaining facility that uses SSU's.
 The Prison Service is in the process of reviewing its policy on the holding of
 women under the age of 18: its report is due early in 1999. Young women are being
 housed in prison facilities separate from older Women until the policy review is con-
 cluded. New Hall and Holloway prisons are developing young offender units that are
 to deal with the unique concerns presented by the incarceration of young women.
 New, more restrictive guidelines concerning the use of restraints on pregnant
 women were introduced by the Prison Service in July, in part because of the settle-
 ment of a 1995 case in which pregnant prisoner Annette Walker was restrained
 while in labor. A civil suit brought against the prison service by Walker was settled
 out of court in June.
 Faced with a large increase in the number of asylum seekers, the Government
 housed approximately half of immigration detainees in regular prisons, where they
 were normally held separately from convicted prisoners. According to human rights
 groups, 28 regular prisons house some immigration detainees. The chief inspector
 for prisons for England and Wales repeatedly has called upon the Home Office to
 establish specific guidelines for the treatment of asylum seekers in detention centers
 and prisons, as no such guidelines currently exist. The U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other groups also cited a lack of specialized skills among
 regular prison officials in dealing with immigration detainees. The UNHCR regu-
 larly visits detention centers and has excellent relations with the Government and
 detention center officials; however, it criticizes the Government's "expectation of
 noncompliance" by asylum seekers.
 The Prison Service stated that 18 prisoners convicted of terrorist-related offenses
 were transferred from prisons in England and Northern Ireland to the custody of
 the Republic of Ireland during the year. Only one prisoner convicted of terrorist of-
 fenses remains in prison in England. His requests for repatriation to the Republic
 of Ireland or transfer to Northern Ireland are under consideration.
 In March the Home Secretary decided not to extradite to Germany and released
 suspected terrorist Roisin McAliskey, who was arrested in 1996 in connection with
 an IRA attack in Osnabruck, Germany. The Home Secretary based his decision on
 the state of McAliskey's health. McAliskey's doctors believe that she developed
 osteoporosis while in prison as well as suffering mental trauma (she had been held
 in an SSU for 6 months while pregnant).
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons and immigration
 detention centers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The authorities can and often do make
 arrests or detain suspects without judicial warrants, especially in Northern Ireland,
 when they believe that they have reasonable cause to suspect wrongdoing. The
 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 allows police officers to stop and
 search vehicles and pedestrians if a police officer of at least superintendent rank
 (or a chief inspector if no superintendent is available) "reasonably believes" it is ex-
 pedient to do so to prevent acts of violence. The authorization is limited to a 24-
 hour period, but is renewable under certain circumstances.
 The 1991 Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act (EPA) permits a soldier on
 duty, a member of the Royal Irish Regiment, or a police officer, to arrest and detain
 for up to 4 hours "a person who he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or is about to commit any offense."
 The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (PTA) allows the police
 to arrest without a warrant anywhere in the UK persons they have reason to sus-
 pect of being involved in terrorism. The authorities may detain such persons (even
 those under the age of 18) for up to 48 hours without legal representation or judicial
 review. Suspects may be interrogated during this time, and confessions obtained
 may be used in subsequent court proceedings. Under the PTA, detainees are granted
 the right to have lawyers present during interrogation in England or Wales, but not
 in Northern Ireland. Detention without charge may be extended up to a further 5
 days on the authority of the Home Secretary, or in Northern Ireland, the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland. Extensive PTA detention powers were held in breach
 of the ECHR, which led to a derogation by the Government in 1988 (see Section
 i.e.).
 The PTA is the most reviewed piece of legislation in the United Kingdom. It ex-
 pires every 2 years and, due to the changing security situation, is amended or al-
 tered to account for those changes. Provisions for indefinite internment without trial
 
 
 1599
 were eliminated in the 1998 reauthorization of the PTA. Nevertheless, critics charge
 that the annual review is superficial.
 In England, Scotland, and Wales suspects arrested without warrants must be re-
 leased within 24 hours (or 36 hours if a serious offense is involved) unless brought
 before a magistrates' court. The court may authorize extension of detention by 36
 hours, and on further application by another 24 hours, versus the 48-hour scheme
 extant in Northern Ireland (see Section I.e.).
 Defendants awaiting trial have a statutory right to bail unless there is a risk that
 they would abscond, commit an offense, interfere with witnesses, or otherwise ob-
 struct the course of justice, or unless they were on bail when the alleged offense
 was committed. Defendants who are remanded in custody are protected by statutory
 custody time limits, which restrict the period for which they can be held while
 awaiting trial to a maximum of 182 days, unless the court grants an extension. As
 of December 31, a total of 23,853 defendants were awaiting trial, 25.4 percent in
 custody. Of those in custody, 84.4 percent had been awaiting trial for less than 24
 weeks, while 3.3 percent had been waiting longer than 48 weeks. These statistics
 are slightly lower than the comparable 1997 statistics. The Crime and Disorder Act
 (1998) passed in July includes measures which aim to reduce delays in criminal pro-
 ceedings by introducing procedural reforms and making better provision for limiting
 the time allowed for the prosecution of cases.
 The High Court ruled in July that the Home Secretary has the power to detain
 risoners past the expiration of their maximum time limits if the Home Secretary
 believes the prisoner is likely to commit a serious offense if released.
 The law gives administrative detention power to immigration officers. There is no
 time limit to such detention and no right to have it reviewed by a court. At an
 given time, up to 800 asylum  seekers are detained (approximately 2 percent ofaZ
 asylum seekers), either in immigration detention centers, regular prisons (where
 they are held separately from convicted prisoners), or occasionally police cells if for
 no more than 48 hours and pending removal from the UK or transfer to another
 accommodation (see Section 1.c.). Of the detainees, 35 percent are held for less than
 1 month, 20 percent for 1 to 2 months, 34 percent for 2 to 6 months, 9 percent for
 6 to 12 months, and 2 percent for over 12 months. Unlike those accused of criminal
 offenses, asylum seekers are given no written statement about why they were de-
 tained, although the practice is to provide them with updates on the status of their
 claims and the time required for their adjudication. Asylum seekers do not have an
 automatic right to apply forbail, and bail application, whiclh can be made to immi-
 gration appellate authorities, requires a relatively high level of surety. The Home
 Office states that detention is authorized only where there are good grounds to an-
 ticipate noncompliance with the terms of temporary admission, and that the practice
 does not affect more than approximately 1.5 percent of asylum seekers at any given
 time.
 The Government does not practice exile (also see Section 2.d.).'
 Terrorist organizations continued to threaten individuals and families to compel
 them to leave Northern Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and provides citizens
 with a generally fair and efficient judicial process.
 The UK has several levels of courts. The vast majority of criminal cases are heard
 by magistrates' courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their deci-
 sions may be appealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases requir-
 ing a jury trial, or to the High Court. Crown Court convictions may be appealed to
 the Court of Appeal, which may in turn refer cases involving points of law to the
 House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which consists of
 senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm) is the final court
 of appeal. In 1997 the Government established the Criminal Cases Review Commis-
 sion (CCRC), which operates as an additional appellate body to investigate sus-
 pected miscarriages of justice in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It considers
 cases after the judicial appeals process has been exhausted and where there is sig-
 nificant new evidence that casts doubt on the conviction. In Scotland similar appeals
 may be made to the Scottish office.
 The law provides for a fair trial, and the authorities respect and enforce the law
 in this regard. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, the
 right to question witnesses against them, and the right to appeal to successively
 higher courts.
 In November the Government passed the Human Rights Act of 1998. The Human
 Rights Act incorporated Articles 2-12, 14, and 16-18 of the European Convention
 on Human Rights into British law. Under the Human Rights Act all public bodies
 must act in a manner compatible with the convention. The act also allows British
 citizens to take alleged violations of the convention into British courts. In November

 1988, the European Court of Human Rights held that the United Kingdom had vio-
 lated Article 5(3) of the convention, dealing with prompt resolution of a case after
 arrest or detention. As a result, in December 1988 the United Kingdom submitted
 a derogation of Article 5(3). This- derogation also applies to the Human Rights Act.
 Nongovernmental -organizations repeatedly criticize the Government about the dero-
 gation. The Human Rights Act is to take effect in the year 2000, after courts have
 had an opportunity to become familiar with the European convention.
 In September, during a special session of Parliament called in the wake of the
 Omagh bombing, the Government passed the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Con-
 spiracy) Act. Under the new legislation, the testimony of a senior police officer may
 be introduced-as prima facie-evidence of a suspect's membership in a proscribed ter-
 rorist organization. The Act also introduces provisions criminalizing a conspiracy
 conducted within the United Kingdom to commit terrorist acts outside the country.
 The act also allows for the seizure of property of a person convicted of membership
 offenses under the act, if used in furtherance of the activities of the organization.
 Human rights organizations have expressed concern that the act violates certain
 fundamental rights, such as the right to silence and the rights to freedom of expres-
 sion and association.
 Under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, judges'have the power
 to instruct juries that they may draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's re-
 fusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial, although no conviction can
 be based solely on such an inference. Human rights groups and the U.N. Human
 Rights Committee sharply criticize this provision, which they consider an abrogation
 of the right against self-incrimination. A similar provision is in effect in Northern
 Ireland.
 Indigent defenders have the right to free counsel of their choice, with some excep-
 tions. Criminal proceedings must be held in public except those in juvenile court
 and those involving public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets
 Act, the judge may order the court closed, but sentencing must be public.
 In Northern Ireland, special "emergency" restrictions affect due process. Under
 the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1991 (EPA), trials for certain ter-
 rorist-related offenses are automatically tried in "Diplock courts" without a jury un-
 less they are specifically "scheduled out" to ordinary jury courts. Diplock courts were
 established to avoid cases being heard by juries that might make decisions along
 sectarian lines, as well as to protect jurors from intimidation by terrorists. If judges
 decide to convict, they must justify the decision in a document that becomes part
 of the court record. An appellate court may overturn the decision on either factual
 or legal grounds. Through June, 34 persons had been tried in Diplock courts; 33 ei-
 ther pled or were found guilty. The Diplock courts have been widely criticized by
 human rights groups, as well as various U.N. committees. The 1998 EPA, enacted
 in April, increased the number of scheduled offenses which may be assigned at the
 Attorney Generals discretion, for trial by jury. This should reduce the number of
 cases considered by Diplock courts.
 The EPA does not exclude theuse of uncorroborated confessions, which in North-
 ern Ireland may, and have been, used as the sole basis for conviction. Additionally,
 the EPA permits police to prevent any suspected terrorist from contacting legal
 counsel for up to 48 hours after arrest under certain circumstances, at the request
 of a police officer with the minimum rank of superintendent. After a detainee has
 asked to see a lawyer and has done so, this period is renewable in subsequent 48-
 hour periods until the detainee is charged or released. Human rights groups have
 criticized these provisions, arguing that a detainee is most likely to need counsel
 in the first few hours; lack of counsel during that time makes false or coerced con-
 fessions and detainee abuse more likely. According to the Northern Ireland Office,
 through June 305 requests for access to lawyers were made, only 3 of which were
 delayed.
 The Criminal Procedures and Investigations Act of 1996 reduced defense lawyer's
 access to potential evidence held by the prosecution, including information as to how
 the evidence was collected. According to the Committee on the Administration of
 Justice, this practice may be contrary to U.N. guidelines on the role of prosecutors.
 Lawyers groups in Northern Ireland and elsewhere have expressed serious con-
 cern about threats of death and serious physical injury directed against defense law-
 yers by prison guards, relayed to them by their prisoner/clients. Solicitors continue
 to lodge complaints against the RUC but say that little is done to address their com-
 plaints. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Lawyers and Judges
 issued a report in March that called upon the Government to conduct independent
 and impartial investigations of all threats to legal counsel and, where there is a spe-
 cific physical threat to a barrister, to provide the necessary protection, investigate
 the threats, and bring the guilty party to justice. The Special Rapporteur also rec-
 
 
 1601
 ommended that lawyers lodge formal complaints, that the RUC organize training
 seminars for police officers, and that the Bar Council and the Law Society be more
 vocal in their defense of solicitors who have been subjected to harassment and in-
 timidation, entering into dialogue with the RUC on how best to address the prob-
 lem.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-War-
 rants normally are required for a police search of private premises. However, under
 the 1991 EPA members of the armed forces or police in Northern Ireland may enter
 and search "any premises for the purpose of arresting a person for an arrestable
 offense, but only if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the person
 being sought is on the premises." The Northern Ireland courts have interpreted the
 requirement for "reasonable" grounds broadly.
 In April the Government published a report on the treatment of enemy property
 in the UK during World War II. In June it appointed an independent advisor to set
 up a claims procedure for persons who had their assets confiscated and published
 on the Internet a list of 25,000 such persons and firms. The Government made
 available an initial $3.2 million (2 million) fund for compensation of victims of Nazi
 persecution who lost their UK-based assets during the War.
 The fear of intercommunal violence has, over the years, lead to a pattern of in-
 creasingly segregated communities in Northern Ireland. Protestant and Catholic
 families have moved away from mixed or border neighborhoods. This pattern contin-
 ued despite the Good Friday Agreement's hope for a more normal society.
 In Northern Ireland, paramilitary groups have attacked and threatened to attack
 the homes and families of police and politicians (see Sections L.a. and 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Strongly held common-law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and a democratic political system combine .to secure freedom of
 speech and of the press. Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented.
 The print media are dominated by a handul of national daily newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned and independent (though often generally aligned with a political
 party). About half the electronic media are run by the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys complete editorial inde-
 pendence. Corporations under renewable government license run the remainder.
 Press organizations and human rights groups continued to criticize the 1981 Con-
 tempt of Court Act, which allows courts to order a journalist to disclose a source
 if it is deemed to be in the interests of justice. The Police and Criminal Evidence
 Act (PACE) of 1984 also contains provisions that compel journalists to give evidence
 in cases where police can prove it is necessary to their investigation. In March a
 Norwich Crown Court upheld, on the grounds that the information was already in
 the public domain, reporter Adrian Galvin's refusal to reveal his sources after police
 had requested that he reveal them under PACE. The Official Secrets Act, another
 law cited by journalists as unduly restrictive, prohibits the defense that the informa-
 tion is already in the public domain or that its publication is in the public interest.
 A December 1997 White Paper (a proposed policy paper drafted in preparation for
 legislation) on freedom of information asserted that the Government would intro-
 duce legislation that would allow widespread public access to official information
 and documents, require public organizations to regularly publicize data, and im-
 prove individual access to personal information. NGO's welcomed the White Paper
 but criticized certain provisions that would grant wide-ranging exemptions to the se-
 curity services and law enforcement. The legislation is anticipated in 1999. The
 Data Protection Act, which covers the protection and disclosure of personal informa-
 tion in both electronic and paper form, was passed in July.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of peaceful assembly, but that right is limited routinely where it would impose a
 cost on public convenience. The annual "marching season" in Northern Ireland
 posed significant problems for the Government as the right of assembly conflicted
 with the concerns of local residents in some communities who perceived the marches
 as the celebration of Protestant "triumphs" in historical battles. Tensions ran par-
 ticularly high during several weeks in the summer, when some 100,000 members
 of the Orange Order and similar Protestant organizations staged traditional parades
 to celebrate their history and cultural identity. While few of the 3,100 parades held
 each year are contentious, about 40 have traditional routes that take them through
 Catholic neighborhoods, giving rise to tensions and occasional violence. Similar orga-
 nizations in the nationalist community also march during the summer, although the
 
 
 1602
 smaller scale of those parades has presented law enforcement authorities with fewer
 difficulties.
 The Parades Commission (a five-member body appointed by the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland that is designed to facilitate mediation of contentious parades)
 ruled that the July 5 Orange Order parade following a church service in Drumcree
 could not proceed down the Garvaghy road in a predominately nationalist area of
 Portadown. When the Orange Order insisted on its iight to walk down the public
 road, hundreds of police officers and soldiers were mobilized to block the march and
 barricade the road. This led to a standoff between police and Orange Order support-
 ers and to riots and over 400 attacks on RUC officers and families throughout
 Northern Ireland. Despite considerable pressure, the RUG upheld the Parades Com-
 mission decision and the rule of law. The standoff was linked to a July 11 arson
 attack in which three young boys were killed (see Section l.a.). On July 15, police
 raided the tent city that arose near the barricaded road and seized a number of
 weapons and explosive materials. Public revulsion against the deaths of the three
 young boys did much to convince Orange leaders to disperse the protesters. Al-
 though the massive loyalist protest in Drumcree ended, no resolution of the underly-
 ing issue had been reached by year's end. With Orange Order leaders insisting on
 their right to walk their traditional route and nationalist community leaders unwill-
 ing to consent to the unwanted parade, tensions continued in Portadown with spo-
 radic outbreaks of rioting and sectarian violence.
 The Parades Commission allowed another contentious Orange Order parade to
 proceed down the lower Ormeau road in Belfast on July 13. Local resident groups
 organized a peaceful protest against the march. The Apprentice Boys, a loyalist or-
 ganization, reached an agreement with residents' groups that allowed an August 8
 march on the city walls of Derry to occur. Although the event was largely peaceful,
 minor scuffles arose between nationalist protesters and loyalist supporters, with the
 RUC in the middie endeavoring to keep the gr oups separated
 The law provides for freedom of association, but that right is limited. Under the
 PTA, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may proscribe any organization
 that is involved in, promotes, or encourages terrorism connected to Northern Ire-
 land. Membership in proscribed paramilitary groups is punishable by up to 10 years'
 imprisonment, Supporting paramilitary groups is also an imprisonable offense, as
 is wearing clothing that arouses a reasonable suspicion that the wearer belongs to
 or supports a proscribed organization. Human rights monitors, while acknowledging
 the deterrent effects of proscription powers, argue for the repeal.of this law because
 it violates the fundamental right of freedom of association and an individual's right
 to express personal opinions and beliefs.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Governmental polcy and general practice ensure freedom
 of religion for traditional and nontraditional worshippers. Despite the existence of
 state religions (the Anglican Church of England and the Presbyterian Church of
 Scotland), members of all faiths and denominations enjoy freedom of worship. Dis-
 crimination on religious or political grounds is outlawed specifically in Northern Ire-
 land, although not in the rest of the country. Those who believe that their freedom
 to worship has been abrogated have the right to appeal to the courts for relief.
 Although not enforced, blasphemy with respect to Christian beliefs is still tech-
 nically illegal. Several religious organizations, in association with the Commission
 for Racial Equality, are attempting to either abolish the law or expand it to protect
 all faiths.
 By law government schools must hold an act of nondenominational Christian wor-
 ship each day. Teachers' organizations have criticized the practice and called for a
 government review of the practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citzefis enjoy freedom of movement within the country and in foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. In 1997 the Home Secretary revoked all exclu-
 sion orders preventing individuals linked to terrorism in Northern Ireland from
 traveling to Great Britain. When the Prevention of Terrorism Act was renewed in
 1998, it did not include provisions for exclusion orders. However, the Home Sec-
 retary has the power to activate dormant statutes implementing exclusion orders at
 any time.
 In May the Government granted all citizens of its Caribbean dependent territory
 of Monsterrat, approximately 11,000 people, permission to remain in Britain indefi-
 nitely. Approximately 3,500 Montserratians have moved to the country since the
 volcano crisis there in 1996.
 The Government cooperates closely with the UNHCR and other humanitarian or-
 ganizations in assisting refugees. First asylum is provided under a temporary pro-
 tection process started in 1992. As of June 30, the Government had received 18,525
 applications for first asylum, a 22 percent increase over the same period in 1997.
 
 
 1603
 
 Under the first asylum program, successful applicants are given 6 months' 'leave
 to enter the country" on arrival. They then can apply for an automatic 3 2-year ex-
 tension of their stay and may apply for refugee status at any time. Such applica-
 tions are considered in accordance with the criteria set out in the 1951 U.N. Con-
 vention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Some asylum seekers are detained while
 the Government reviews their cases (see Section 1.d.); some are detained in regular
 prisons (see Section 1.c.).
 The Asylum and Immigration Act of 1996 broadened the right of appeal for failed
 asylum seekers, introduced provisions to deter abusive asylum applicants and illegal
 entrants, and imposed restrictions on people subject to immigration control taking
 up employment and seeking housing and social security benefits.
 Of decisions taken on asylum applications in 1998, as of the end of June, 16.9
 percent were to recognize the applicant as a refugee and grant asylum and 11.5 per-
 cent were granted "exceptional leave to remain,' although the applicants were re-
 fused asylum. The remainder were denied.
 The Government issued a White Paper in July thatproposed methods to deal with
 the large backlog of asylum seekers as well as the refuorm of asylum and citizenship
 legislation. At the time of release of the White Paper, 52,000 asylum applications
 had yet to be reviewed for initial decision. Of those, 10,000 were over 5 years old.
 Also awaltin  governmental action were 32,000 immigration appeals and 96,000 citi-
 zenship applications.
 There were no reports that persons were forced to return to countries where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 inent
 Citizens have the right to change their government and freely exercise that right.
 The Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of Com-
 mons, which are contested in elections held at intervals not longer than 5 year.
 Participation in the political process is open to all persons and parties. All citizens
 18 years of age and older may vote. As in the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has
 city and district councils, but with fewer powers. England and Wales also have
 county councils. Northern Ireland elected a devolved assembly in June which is to
 assume powers in 1999 as the peace process proceeds. Scotland and Wales are to
 elect devolved bodies (Parliament for Scotland, Assembly for Wales) in 1999 that are
 to assume control over matters of regional importance such as education, health,
 and some economic matters. The Scottish Parament will have limited power to
 raise taxes; the Welsh Assembly is not to have such power. Foreign affairs and de-
 fense will continue to be the responsibility of the central Government. In May voters
 in greater London passed a referendum establishing an elected council and mayor,
 which are to be elected in 1999.
 British dependent territories have small populations (about 160,000 persons in
 total), with appointed governors or administrators assisted by executive councils
 (usually appointed), andlegislative assemblies or councils (partly elected).
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on voting or holding office.
 Women constitute 18 percent of the House of Commons and nearly 8 percent of the
 House of Lords. Seventeen members of minority ethnic groups serve in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigtion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights issues and cases. Gov-
 ernment officials are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 In 1973 the government established a Standing Advisory Commission on Human
 Rights to monitor human rights in Northern Ireland but has adopted few of its secu-
 rity-related recommendations. The Good Friday Agreement provides for the estab-
 lishment of a Human Rights Commission to replace the   ACHR; human rights
 NGO's have rd       e  new body's lack of investigative powers.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, are based in the UK.
 The Government cooperates fully with international inquiries into alleged violations
 of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Rce eRelations Act of 1976 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 nationality, or national or ethnic origin, and outlaws incitement to racial hatred;
 these protections were extended to Northern Ireland in 1997. Human rights groups
 claim that Travellers, nomadic populations consisting of Roma, Irish, and "new"
 
 
 1604
 Travellers, estimated to number some 100,000 persons, experience marginalization,
 educational discrimination, and police and societal harassment greater than that of
 the settled population. U.N. Committees on both the Rights of the Child and the
 Elimination of Racial Discrimination have expressed similar concerns.
 Discrimination on the grounds of religious or political opinion is specifically out-
 -lawed in Northern Ireland but not in Great Britain. Discrimination on the basis of
 religion only is illegal in Great Britain when its effect is to discriminate against a
 member of a minority ethnic group. The Government respects and enforces all anti-
 discrimination laws, which concentrate on employment and the supply of goods and
 services.
 Women.-Statistical and other evidence indicates that domestic violence con-
 stitutes nearly half of reported violent crime against women. In a recent home office
 survey, 23 percent of women said they had suffered domestic violence-including
 pushing or grabbing as well as more serious assaults-at some time in their adult
 lives. Surveys also indicate that domestic violence is the least likely violent crime
 to be reported to the police. The law provides for-injunctive relief, personal protec-
 tion orders, and protective exclusion orders (similar to restraining orders) for women
 who are victims of violence. The Government provides shelters, counseling, and
 other assistance for battery or rape and offers free legal aid to battered women who
 are economically reliant on their abusers. The Government actively prosecutes per-
 petrators of domestic violence. Section 33 of the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public
 Order Act abolished the requirement that judges warn juries that a victim's testi-
 mony alone should not be adequate for a rape conviction. The Protection from Har-
 assment Act of 1997 provides for prison sentences of up to 5 years for convicted
 stalkers. However, thus far the act has been used primarily to prosecute harassers
 of judges and political officials, although provisions for the protection of women
 exist.
 Criminal action for sexual harassment cases must be prosecuted under assault
 legislation since no law speciically prohibits sexual harassment. Women's groups
 have complained that civil suits concerning sexual harassment and discrimination
 on the basis of gender sometimes take up to 31/2 years to appear before an industrial
 tribunal.
 The law provides for equal opportunity between the sexes, but women experience
 some discrimination inpractice. The 1975 Sex Discrimination Act, as amended in
 1986, prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination in training, housing, and pro-
 vision of goods and services, as well as in employment. Women have equal rights
 regarding property and divorce. According to the Government's Equal Opportunities
 Commission (which supports persons who bring discrimination cases before indus-
 trial tribunals and courts and-produces guidelines on good practice for employers),
 there has been significant progress towards equal opponity for women since the
 Commission was established in 1975. However, according to the Commission women
 earn approximately 20 percent less than their male counterparts in similar posi-
 tions. NGO's indicated that progress towards equality of pay for equal work was the
 single largest problem confronting women, citing only an 8 percent increase in rel-
 ative pay in the past 25 years.
 Women's issues within the Government are represented at the cabinet level by
 the Minister for Women, who has established a small steering group to provide a
 dialogue with women, in addition to working with the established Women's National
 Commission, an umbrella forum of women's organizations that presents women's
 views to the government.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its systems of public education and medical care. The
 Government provides free, compulsory education up to age 16, and then to age 18
 if the student so desires. While there is no pattern of societal abuse directed against
 -children, indications are, despite a lack of reliable data, that child abuse is never-
 theless a problem. Police are continuing investigations of over 200 children's homes
 nationwide. Over the past 8 years criminal charges have been brought against over
 50 care workers.
 Various laws covering England and Wales stipulate that children have the right
 to apply for court orders, to give or withhold consent for medical treatment (for
 those capable of making an informed decision), to make complaints to the relevant
 local authority, to have their ethnic, linguistic, and religious background considered
 in decisions affecting them, to have reasonable contact with their families (usually
 applied in a circumstance where there has been abuse), and in general to be con-
 suited regarding their desires.
 In September the European Court of Human Rights found in favor of a 14-year-
 old boy who claimed that his stepfather beat him repeatedly between the ages of
 5 and 8. The unanimous judgment held that the beatings violated the boy's right
 
 
 1605
 to protection from "torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment." The
 British jury acquitted the child's stepfather on the grounds that the beatings con-
 stituted "reasonable chastisement." The Government, while deciding not to abolish
 corporal punishment, accepted that it should change the law and is drafting a con-
 sultation document on physical punishment. In July the School Standards and
 Framework Act of 1998 extended the ban on corporal punishment in state schools
 to private schools and nursery schools. Child welfare groups have called for the out-
 lawing of all corporal punishment of children.
 Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, police can arrest and detain children for
 up to 7 days.
 People With Disabilities.-The 1995 People with Disabilities Discrimination Act
 outlaws discrimination against disabled persons in the provision of access to public
 facilities by employers of more than 20 workers, service providers (apart from those
 providing education or running transport vehicles), and anyone selling or renting
 property. The 1993 Education Act imposes specific duties on local education authori-
 ties to make provision for the special educational needs of disabled children. Dis-
 abled rights groups continued to complain that the Government declines to create
 an enforcement body for the Discrimination Act.
 Rights Now, a consortium of over 50 independent organizations campaigning for
 laws to end discrimination on the grounds of disability, reported that employers
 were 6 times more likely to turn down a disabled person for a job interview than
 a nondisabled applicant with the same qualifications. Rights Now also reported that
 there are 400,00 to 450,000 people in need of wheelchair-accessible homes, but that
 only 80,000 such homes are available. Although wheelchair accessibility at voting
 sites improved since the 1992 elections when 88 per cent of the polling stations were
 inaccessible to physically disabled voters, 81 per cent of the 1997 sites posed two
 or more access problems (e.g., no wheelchair ramps, or voting booths that-were too
 high) for wheelchair-bound voters.
 Government regulations require that all new buildings meet the access require-
 ments of all persons with impaired mobility. In 1992 the Government promulgated
 similar regulations for sensory-impaired persons, and regulations require that all
 taxis be wheelchair accessible by 2000. However, while generally improved, access
 to many buildings remains inadequate. Many buildings and train stations are so old
 that they do not have elevators. According to the NGO Scope, 94 percent of polling
 stations in the 1997 election had one or more disability access problems.
 Religious Minorities.-Despite government efforts and the lowering of the overall
 unemployment rate in Northern Ireland, the unemployment rate for Catholic men
 remained nearly twice that of Protestant men. The Fair Employment (Northern Ire-
 land) Act of 1989, as amended, aims to end even unintentional or indirect discrimi-
 nation in the workplace, and a fair employment tribunal adjudicates complaints. All
 public-sector employers and all private firms with over 10 workers must report an-
 nually to the Fair Employment Commission on the religious composition of their
 work force and must review their employment practices at least once every 3 years.
 Noncompliance can bring criminal penalties and the loss of government contracts.
 Victims of employment discrimination may sue for damages. Although critics of the
 act asserted that its targets and tetables are too imprecise, most leaders of the
 Catholic community regard it as a positive step.
 In the March pubication of its White Paper, " Partnership for Equality," the Gov-
 ernment set out its responses to the 1997 SACHR report on fair employment legisla-
 tion. The Government accepted about two-thirds of SACHR'S recommendations and
 added others. Proposed legislation aims to ensure equality of opportunity for Catho-
 lics and Protestants, for men and women, and for people of different races, disabil-
 ity, and sexual orientation. It provides for oversight and enforcement by the new
 Equality Commission.
 There have been improvements in fair housing, education, and provision of goods
 and services; although, other than Northern Ireland, no specific legislation prohibits
 discrimination on the basis of religion.
 While the active recruitment of Catholics by the Northern Ireland civil service
 produced rough proportionality in overall numbers, the service acknowledges that
 Catholics remain significantly underrepresented in its senior grades. Service-wide
 employment cutbacks thus far have hampered efforts to overcome the imbalance.
 Government efforts to increase the recruitment of Catholics into the police force
 (currently 92 percent Protestant) and related security jobs in Northern Ireland have
 been hampered by IRA killings and death threats, as well as by widespread antip-
 athy in the Catholic community to the security forces. Despite recruitment efforts,
 the percentage of Catholic officers in the police force has not changed significantly.
 However, following the Good Friday Agreement, there was a surge in applications
 
 
 1606
 
 to the RUC by Catholics. Of the 3,200 applications, 23 percent were received from
 Catholics, up from 15 percent in previous years,
 In the aftermath of the Drumcree standoff, a number of Catholic churches were
 the target of arson attacks, and a number of Orange halls were targeted in sectarian
 reprisals.
 According to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, the number of anti-Semitic
 incidents in Britain declined in 1997 for the fourth consecutive year. A Jewish com-
 munal monitoring body recorded 218 anti-Semitic incidents, representing a 5 per-
 cent decrease on the 1996 figure of 228. The overall reduction was ascribed to more
 effective policing, more criminal prosecutions, and a more determined attitude on
 the part of the Jewish community.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Despite legal prohibitions against race dis-
 crimination, persons of African and Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, or Middle Eastern
 origin face occasional acts of societal violence and some discrimination. Incitement
 to racial hatred is a criminal offense punishable by a maximum of 2 years' imprison-
 ment. The Government strictly enforces the laws and regulations in this area.
 The NGO Statewatch released a report in July indicating that persons of African
 descent are eight times more likely, to be stopped and searched by police in Great
 Britain than whites. Other minority groups are also slightly more likely to be
 stopped by police.
 The government-appointed but independent Commission for Racial Equality
 (CRE) provides guidelines on good practice, supports persons taking court action
 under the Race Relations Act of 1976, and may initiate its own court action. After
 investigating a complaint, the CRE may issue a notice requiring that the discrimi-
 nation be stopped. The CRE then monitors the response to its notice for 5 years.
 In August 1997 the Government passed the Race Relations (Northern Ireland)
 Order of 1997, which for the first time gave specific legal protection to minority eth-
 nic groups there, including the Traveller community. In January the Government
 ratified the Council of Europe Framework Convention for Protection of National Mi-
 norities, which entered into effect on May 1. By mid-1999 the Government must
 publish a report indicating what legislative and other measures were taken to im-
 plement the convention.
 Repeated claims of police misconduct in the case of Stephen Lawrence, a black
 youth stabbed to death in South London in 1993, led to an inquiry into actions
 taken by police in the investigation of Lawrence's murder. In testimony in the in-
 quiry, police admitted that there were serious flaws in the investigation. When the
 inquiry called five white youths accused, but never convicted, of the murder, violent
 demonstrations began outside the London building housing the inquiry. London's
 police commissioner submitted a report to the inquiry outlining ways of improving
 police investigation and preventing racially motivated crime and plans for building
 an antiracist police service. A racial and-violent crime taskforce, headed by the dep-
 uty assistant commissioner, was created to provide oversight of all racially moti-
 vated crime for the metropolitan police, develop operating standards for investiga-
 tion and victim care, and develop appropriate training. At an October hearing of the
 Lawrence inquiry, the chief constable of the Manchester police acknowledged that
 his force was infected by institutional racism. The inquiry has completed taking tes-
 timony and is to issue a report assessing police responsibility in the case and pos-
 sibly other policing concerns with respect to race in February 1999.
 In January 1997 Michael Menson, a black musician, was found wandering dazed,
 almost naked, and suffering from severe burns. Menson died of his wounds 2 weeks
 later. Police believed he had set himself on fire. Menson's family complained that
 the police failed to act on information Menson provided while in the hospital that
 he had been followed and attacked by four white men. In September an inquest jury
 decided that Menson was unlawfully killed. In November the metropolitan police an-
 nounced that a team from the newly created race and violent crime unit would un-
 dertake a new investigation into Menson's death. In October the police commis-
 sioner agreed to launch a new investigation into the death of Ricky Reel, a young
 Asian found drowned in the Thames in 1997. Police concluded that he died acciden-
 tally, but his family believes he was the victim of a racial attack. In both cases, fam-
 ily members claimed that police failed to investigate the crimes properly.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. TheRight ofAssociation.-Workers have the right to form and join unions, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. Unions participate freely in inter-
 national organizations, and are free of government control. Like employers' associa-
 tions, they must have their accounts certified by the government. Senior union offi-
 cers must be elected by secret ballot. Additionally, the law mandates secret ballots
 before a strike call and prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a
 
 
 1607
 1eal strike call. The Labor Government's 1998 White Paper, "Fairness at Work"
 for the extension of protection to those campaigning for union recognition.
 No specific statutory "right to strike" exists, and voluntary cessation of work may
 be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities from prosecution
 for unions engaged in lawful industrial action was narrowed by acts of Parliament
 in the 1980's. These acts exclude secondary strikes and actions judged to have politi-
 cal motives; unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines and seizure of their
 assets. The legislation also tightly restricts the ability of unions to act against sub-
 sidiaries of prime employers with which they are in dispute when the subsidiaries
 are not party to the dispute and are the employers of record. In 1993 the Council
 of Europe (COE) determined that British labor law violated the European Social
 Charter by permitting an employer to dismiss all employees who take part in a
 strike and then, after 3 months, to rehire them selectively- The "Fairness at Work"
 White Paper includes measures to address this problem, and legislation is expected
 early in 1999. It is illegal to deny employment on the grounds that the applicant
 is not a union member. The Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of
 1993 set new procedural requirements for union strikes, dues collection, and mem-
 bership rules. It also made it possible for private citizens, when deprived of goods
 or services due to strike action, to seek damages and to obtain assistance in this
 effort from the government. Following the 1993 Act, in 1995, the House of Lords
 upheld a provision of the Employment Protection Act of 1978, as amended by the
 Employment Act of 1988, which allowed employers to offer workers financial induce-
 ments to give up union representation. In 1996 the Committee of Experts of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) found this law to be in substantial violation
 of Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively and asked the
 UK to amend its legislation. The Government's White Paper proposes to restrict em-
 ployers from paying more to nonunion employees but is ambiguous on how and to
 what extent it would address such discrimination.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While employers 'have no
 legal obligation- to bargain with workers' representatives, and labor-management
 contracts are not enforceable in the courts, collective bargaining is longstanding and
 widespread, covering about 40 percent of the work force. The Government's White
 Paper calls for employers to no longer legally be free to reject bargaining with work-
 ers representatives. The White Paper also proposes requiring bargaining in work-
 places where 40 percent of eligible members have voted for union representation
 (recognition would be automatic where a union already has a majority membership
 among the relevant work force). The British Trades Union Congress (TUC) contin-
 ues to press the Government for a simple majority test. Similarly, while the White
 Paper would extend such provisions to any employer with more than 20 workers-
 a major diversion from the Confederation of British Industry's preferred threshold
 of 50 employees-the TUC continues to argue for a lower figure on the grounds that
 the proposed limit would still exclude up to a quarter of the private-sector work-
 force.
 Workers who believe themselves to be victims of antiunion discrimination may
 seek redress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of
 indemnities and reinstatement. Contrary to ILO Convention 98 (and a 1993 ILO
 complaint), employers lawfully may circulate blacklists of union members seeking
 employment. The Government's White Paper calls for this practice to be outlawed.
 The Labor Government remedied another ILO complaint by allowing employees
 at GCHQ, a government agency, to reestablish their bargaining unit. However, the
 Government has given no indication that it plans to reverse the previous govern-
 ment's restriction on the Prison Officers Association's right to strike.
 There are. no export processing zones. However, the increased use of home-based
 and contract, "self-employed" workers following passage of the Employment Rights
 Act of 1996-which narrowly defined what constitutes an "employee"--bears many
 of the less desirable characteristics of an EPZ. For example, such workers lack many
 key benefits (e.g., vacation and sick pay, supplementary health coverage, pensions,
 tradesmen and workplace allowances, seniority benefits, as well as job security or
 severance pay) that regularly employed workers typically enjoy. They are not gov-
 erned by working-hours directives. Hourly wages are difficult to calculate, and many
 home-based piece-workers are suspected of working for substantially less than other
 employees. The White Paper commits the Government to reexamine the employ-
 ment terminology that governs the labor market.
 e. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited and is not practiced, although the
 ILO has raised questions about the situation in privatized prisons.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.--School at-
 tendance until age 16 is compulsory. Children under age 16 are not permitted to
 
 
 1608
 
 work in an industrial enterprise except as part of an educational course. Forced and
 bonded child labor is prohibited, and the Government effectively enforces this prohi-
 bition (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The first-ever minimum wage is to take effect
 in April 1999. At $5.90 (�3.60) an hour, it is expected to directly benefit the bottom
 10 percent of the workforce. In fact, most in that category saw their wages rise by
 year's end, as a competitive labor market forced employers to introduce the new
 standard in advance of the effective date. And, indirectly, the anticipated wage floor
 has already started to push up the wages of other low-paid workers. The minimum
 wage will provide a family with a decent standard of living in all cities except Lon-
 don, 'wherepersistent labor and skills shortages have kept entry-level wages signifi-
 cantly highere .                      A     d
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 stipulates that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. In practice the act is constantly being updated
 and modified. In 1998 the Government aboished theo industrial use of  white" asbes-
 tos, bringing to a conclusion an evolutionary legal process to outlaw all asbestos in
 the workplace. A Health and Safety Commission efectively enforces regulations on
 these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings in appropriate cases. Workers'
 representatives actively monitor enforcement of the act. Workers can remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment,, as provided
 in the European Union framework directive on safety and health.
