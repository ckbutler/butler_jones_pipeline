 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica has been a functioning constitutional democracy for
 almost four decades. The Government consists of independent
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Free and fair
 elections were held last in February 1986; some 80 percent of
 eligible voters participated. In the contest for president,
 Oscar Arias of the incumbent National Liberation Party (PLN)
 defeated the candidate of the opposition Social Christian
 Unity Party (PUSC). The President is constitutionally
 prohibited from succeeding himself, as are members of the
 Legislative Assembly. The 57 deputies in the Assembly are
 elected at the same time as the President and for the same
 4-year term. The two major political parties, PLN and PUSC,
 dominate the Assembly, holding 29 and 25 seats respectively.
 Two rival Communist parties, which freely participate in the
 political process, hold two seats.
 Costa Rica abolished its standing army in 1949. The country's
 security forces, which are subject to civilian control, are
 few in number and inadequately trained and equipped. Both
 police and national defense functions are performed by the
 Ministry of Public Security's Civil Guard and the Ministry of
 Government's Rural Guard in the countryside. With the
 persistence of troubled relations with Nicaragua and
 consequent fear of internal subversion, there is widespread
 popular support for upgrading the Civil and Rural Guards, but
 no significant public support for creating a professional
 armed force. The Judicial Police, charged with investigating
 crimes, is an agency of the judicial branch directly
 responsible to the Supreme Court. None of these entities has
 been associated with human rights violations.
 In Costa Rica's mixed economic system, the right to hold
 private property is legally protected, and approximately 70
 percent of the gross national product is produced by the
 private sector. Several government-owned autonomous agencies
 provide goods and services; the public sector is the nation's
 largest employer with around 20 percent of the work force.
 While inflation has been largely brought under control,
 unemployment and underemployment continue to be problems,
 especially among the young.
 Costa Rica has maintained its excellent human rights record
 over the past year. The Arias administration has expressed
 its strong commitment to the long-standing Costa Rican
 tradition of respect for basic human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Government nor any other official entity uses,
 abets, or condones political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of abductions,
 secret arrests, or persons held clandestinely by any agency of
 the Government.

 COSTA RICA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no known allegations of mistreatment. The
 Constitution states that "no one shall be submitted to cruel
 or degrading treatment or to life imprisonment. A statement
 obtained through violence shall have no value." These
 injunctions are respected in practice. Prisoners are treated
 humanely in Costa Rica.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no known violations in this area. There is no
 detention for the expression of dissenting opinions. Warrants
 are required for both searches and arrests; the Constitution
 requires that an arraignment take place within 24 hours of
 arrest. These requirements are strictly enforced. There is
 no preventive detention. Persons detained are entitled to a
 judicial determination of the legality of the detention. It
 is unconstitutional to exile a citizen. The independent
 judiciary is effective in ensuring that legal and
 constitutional safeguards are observed.
 The Constitution prohibits, and there are no known instances
 of, forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is widely recognized as fair. Accused persons
 may select their own attorneys; access to counsel is
 guaranteed, with free public counsel provided for defendants
 without means. The right to an open, impartial trial is
 guaranteed and honored in practice. The right to bail is
 provided for in law and is observed in practice. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reported instances over the past year of
 extralegal invasions of privacy conducted by, or with the
 knowledge of, agencies of the Government .
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees freedom of speech and
 press. These freedoms are fully respected in practice. Two
 Communist parties publish weekly newspapers, and the media
 report developments across the political spectrum. There are
 3 privately owned major newspapers, 3 privately owned
 television stations, and numerous radio stations, all of which
 pursue independent editorial policies. The media freely air
 differences with, and criticism of, the Government. There is
 no evidence of self-censorship or intimidation. Terrorist
 activities are fully reported. Foreign journalists have
 challenged the law requiring accreditation by the
 government-sponsored Costa Rican National Journalists
 Association in order to practice their profession. The
 Inter-American Court on Human Rights in 1985 declared the law
 incompatible with the Freedom of Information Guarantee of the
 Inter-American Human Rights Convention. The decision, which
 is consultative and nonbinding, was unanimous. The Government
 
 
 455
 COSTA RICA
 of Costa Rica has not yet taken any action to respond to the
 court's decision.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected in practice. A September 1986
 demonstration in San Jose by small farmers protesting
 government agricultural policies produced a clash between
 police and protestors when the latter ignored an order to stop
 blocking traffic. Some demonstrators and politicians later
 charged the police with excessive use of force--tear gas was
 employed--but most observers concluded that the action was
 prudent and appropriate under the circumstances.
 Workers have the right to organize. The right of organized
 labor to associate, as defined by the International Labor
 Organization, is fully honored. Unions are independent of
 government control and are free to maintain relations with
 recognized international bodies such as the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Several major unions,
 including those representing public service workers, are
 controlled by Communists.
 Procedures for collective bargaining and arbitration of labor
 disputes are prescribed in law and followed in practice. The
 country's labor code states that when one-third of the workers
 in an operation are union members, the employer must conclude
 a collective agreement, if requested. The code also permits
 employees to set up permanent grievance committees to handle
 both individual and collective disputes. When labor disputes
 arise, the first attempt at a solution is made by the
 presiding judge of the formally designated Labor Tribunal in
 San Jose; labor inspectors handle the dispute if it is outside
 the capital. If conciliation fails, the case goes to a labor
 court which must approve a planned strike or lockout before
 the strike legally can begin. Public sector strikes are
 illegal. Unions have complained that the process of having a
 strike declared legal is complicated, time-consuming, and
 often fruitless. In 1986 there were six strikes, including a
 brief walkout of public workers declared illegal by the
 Government. None was of major economic significance. Both
 democratic and Communist unions displayed their
 dissatisfaction with government-mandated price increases and
 delays in salary increases by participating in a number of
 peaceful demonstrations, including the traditionally
 antigovernment May Day parade.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Roman Catholicism is the official state
 religion, but other religious groups have significant numbers
 of adherents who participate without prejudice in the social
 and political life of the nation; a non-Catholic can be
 elected President of Costa Rica. Foreign missionaries and
 clergy freely enter Costa Rica. There are no restrictions on
 proselytizing,,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad. Emigration is not restricted. A citizen's right
 of return is guaranteed. Costa Ricans and foreigners are free
 
 
 COSTA RICA
 to live anywhere within the national boundaries. Costa Rica
 has supported multinational refugee programs and has accepted
 many refugees from Nicaragua, Cuba, other Central American
 countries, and South America. The continuing influx of
 Nicaraguan refugees has provoked government expressions of
 concern over strains on the economy and social fabric. As a
 result the Government in mid-1986 suspended processing of
 refugee applications and began to consider means of voluntary
 repatriation.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits the Government from
 repatriating any foreigner who may be subject to political
 persecution in his own country. Costa Rica has traditionally
 afforded political asylum to exiled dissident groups of
 various political orientations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Rica is ruled by a government elected by its people.
 The Constitution provides for a free, open, and competitive
 electoral system, and this provision is scrupulously honored
 in practice. The integrity of elections--generally regarded
 as unimpeachable--is overseen by the independent Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal. No political party is outlawed or
 excluded from the electoral process; no party has dominated
 the affairs of the nation; no eligible voter is deterred from
 participating in elections; no ethnic, economic, or other
 group dominates; no segment of the citizenry is excluded from
 the political process. Representative bodies can and do
 reject government policy. Individuals can and do petition
 their elected representatives for legislative redress and
 assistance with government bureaucracies.
 Women and minority groups participate freely in Costa Rica's
 elections. The nation's Second Vice President, the President
 of the National Legislative Assembly, and the Minister of
 Foreign Commerce are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A strong supporter of international and private human rights
 organizations, Costa Rica has extended a permanent invitation
 to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit
 whenever it wishes. Costa Rica was one of the first countries
 to ratify the American Convention of Human Rights. It has
 accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Institute
 Court of Human Rights, which is based in San Jose, and hosts
 the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights. Costa Rican
 government officials at the highest level participate in and
 actively support the human rights activities of both the
 Institute and the Court. Several major international human
 rights conferences sponsored by the Institute have been held
 in San Jose. Costa Rica is a member of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission. Overall, Costa Rica has been in the
 vangdard in the promotion of human rights institutions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government has special programs to improve the conditions
 of native Indians, people in depressed areas, and other
 disadvantaged groups, and does not practice or condone
 
 
 457
 COSTA RICA
 discrimination in the economic, social, or cultural spheres.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is not
 limited. women are represented in all professions, in the
 highest ranks of organized labor, in the private business
 sector, and in the Government.
 Costa Rica's population includes some 30,000 West Indian
 Blacks and 25,000 Indians. English is the second language of
 the country, primarily because it is spoken by the Caribbean
 Blacks. Most of the Indians speak Spanish and live in their
 traditional manner on 19 reserves throughout the country.
 Because most live in remote areas, they often lack access to
 schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The
 Government is currently involved in programs to provide
 primary education to the Indians and to buy out "islands"
 within the Indian reserves which are owned by non-Indians.
 Indians manage their own affairs through the National Indian
 Commission (CONAI). The CONAI Board elected in 1984, however,
 was charged with mismanagement and removed by the Government
 in late 1985. The ejected group denies the charges against it
 and asserts that the government of former President Monge
 intervened for political motives. The Arias Government has
 taken no decisive role in the dispute, which is now before the
 courts.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The 1949 Constitution defines the normal hours of the workday,
 remuneration for overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation
 rights. It specifies compensation for discharge without due
 cause, the right to a minimum wage, and special protection for
 women and minors. The minimum working age is 12, with special
 protections in force for workers under 15. A national wage
 board, composed of three members each from government,
 management, and labor, sets minimum wages and salaries for
 every occupation in every industry, including agriculture.
 The Constitution sets normal work hours at 8 hours for daytime
 and 6 hours for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and
 36 hours respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work
 not considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may
 not exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an
 overtime premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work
 performed in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural
 workers are not paid overtime if they voluntarily work beyond
 their normal hours.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace.
 Industrial, agricultural, and commercial firms with 10 or more
 workers are required to have a joint safety committee. The
 law allows the Government to inspect workplaces and to fine
 employers for violations. However, a shortage of labor
 inspectors, especially outside San Jose, limits the Ministry's
 ability to ensure that minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation are maintained.
