 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka's constitutional, multiparty form of government features a strong exec-
 utive presidency and a unicameral legislature elected by universal adult suffrage.
 In May President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga was chosen by Parliament to succeed
 assassinated President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The President's United National
 Party (UNP) holds a majority of the seats in Parliament. The violent ethnic conflict
 
 
 1387
 waged for over 10 years between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of
 Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an organization fighting for a separate state for the country's
 Tamil minority continued in 1993. An L'ITE suicide bomber assassinated President
 Premadasa and 23 others at a public rally on May 1.
 The 50,000-member police orce, which includes 3,000 commandos of the Police
 Special Task Force (STF), is responsible for internal security in most areas of the
 country. Army manpower has increased steadily over the pst 2 years. The 80 000-
 man army has the primary responsibility for conducting the war against the LTtE.
 The 8,000 to 10,000 paramilitary home guards provide security against LTI'E at-
 tacks for Muslim andSialese communties living in or near the war zone. The
 Government arms and equips up to 1,000 members of variou.s anti-LTTE Tamil mili-
 tias. These forces man ciheckpoints, provide intelligence, act as scouts, and some-
 times engage in military operations alongside the army. All security elements fight-
 ing in the war committed human rights violations in 1993.
 Sri Lanka's mixed economy depends heavily on exports of tea, textiles, and rub-
 ber. Despite a continuing fiscal drain caused by large military outlays (amounting
 to about 5 percent of gross domestic product), the economy grew by 4.5 percent in
 1992. This was partly due to continued economic reform, including the removal of
 most price controls and subsidies, the lowering of tariffs, and a reduction in the size
 of the government bureaucracy.
 Although the Government took further steps to institutionalize the protection of
 human rights in 1993, the pace slowed in the second half of the year, and its forces
 continued to commit serious abuses which went unpunished. More than 80 persons
 disappeared or died after being taken into custody by security forces, and govern-
 ment forces killed at least 250 civilians during mlitary actions.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the Emergency Regulations (ER),
 which give security forces wide powers such as preventive and incommunicado de-
 tention, remained in effect. The ER were revisedto afford some safeguards for de-
 tainees and to ease some, but by no means all, of the restrictions on freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, and association. Many Sri Lankans were detained without
 trial in 1993, though the number continued to decline. Torture and mistreatment
 of detainees were routinely practiced by both government forces and the LTTE. De-
 spite credible evidence implicating security force members in human rights abuses,
 no member of the security force was tried or convicted for human rights violations
 in 1993, thus wasnoragn te       to believe they are immune from prosecution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Government's security forces,
 the LTTE, and other militant groups continued to engage in political killings. The
 total number of such kiings declined significantly, and most noncombatant deaths
 were the result of indiscriminate use of force rather than deliberate targeting of spe-
 cific individuals (see Section 1.g.). Neverteless, all sides to the conflict were respon-
 sible for scattered cases of extrajudicial execution.
 For the first time in 3 years, there were no reports of Sinhaese or Muslim civil-
 ians being massacred by the LkTE, nor were there any reprisal massacres directed
 against Tamil civilians by the security forces. For the second year, there were no
 reports of the vigilante-style killings that plagued the country prior to 1992.
 In January army soldiers operating in conJUnction with irregulars from the Tamil
 Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), an anti-LTI'E militia allied with the Gov-
 ernment, reportedly lilled and beheaded two unarmed persons, suspected of being
 LTrE members, in the eastern village of Kaduwankerny. That same month, 9 civil-
 ians were reported to have been summarily executed by the army in the course of
 a military operation near Kanchurankudah, also in the east. In July the local press
 reported that the army had shot dead the chairman of a local citizen's committee
 in the eastern district of Batticaloa. At least 10 persons died of apparently violent
 causes while in the custody of the security forces, most  a result of mistreatment
 during interrogation. For example, in July a man arrested in the southern district
 of Galle died of injuries sustained while in police custody. A similar incident oc-
 curred in nearby Hbanteta District in April. In mid-October the body of a young
 Tami was discovered in a coastal town 20 miles north of Colombo. He was beieve
 to be 1 of many young Tamils who had been rounded up in Colombo.
 There were two high level political assassination believed to have been carried out
 by the LoftE. On May 1, an LTTE        suicide bomber assassinatod President
 Premadasa. A few weeks earlier opposition leader Lalith Athulathmudali was assas-
 sinated. The Government presented evidence suggesting that thc LTTE was respon-
 sible.
 
 
 1388
 The LTTE is thought to have executed a number of its opponents as well as
 Tamil civilians accused of helping the security forces. In January the LTTE publicly
 executed two alleged traitors andin February executed three civilians in Mullaittivu
 District for allegedly passing information to the security forces. In December the
 LT'E announced that it had executed nine more "traitors" in Jaffna.
 Action to bring to trial security force members accused of extrjudicial killings re-
 mained stalled despite repeated pledges by the Government to punish those respon-
 sible for such deaths. The trial, which began in October, of 23 soldiers accused of
 massacring 35 Tamil civilians in the village of Mailanthani in 1992 was moved from
 the majority Tamil town of Batticaloa to the majority Sinhalese town of
 Polonnaruwa. Tamil members of Parliament accused the Government of changing
 the venue to make it more difficult for witnesses--all Tamil-to testify. Court hear-
 ings were held in October and December at which witnesses ident-fied a number of
 soldiers responsible for the attack. Hearings are set to continue in 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-At least 12,000 people have disappeared in Sri Lanka since
 1983, most in the period 1987-91. Reports of new disappearances continued to de-
 cline in 1993, from 200 in 1992 to roughly 70 in the first 9 months of 1993. The
 vast majority of these disappearances took place in the war zones of the north and
 east and most were attributable to government forces. For example, on February 17,
 15 Tamils were reportedly detained by the army's Independent Brigade in the
 Batticaloa district. None has been seen since. At the instigation of the Batticaloa
 Peace Committee the army is said to have begun an investigation, but no progress
 has been reported. Three Tamil men were arrested by the security forces in Mannar
 district on July 4; witnesses saw the men in custody shortly after their arrest, but
 they have since disappeared.
 The Peoples Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), an anti-LTTE
 Tamil militia allied with the Government, is believed to be responsible for the dis-
 appearance of several persons in the northern district of Vavuniya. They were de-
 tained following an L  E attack on a security checkpint manned by the PLOTE
 and subsequent y disappeared.
 There were also credible reports of disappearances in Polonnarwa District, in the
 North-Central Province. Witnesses report that local police were responsible for up
 to 15 disappearances.
 Observers in the northeast reported that the L'ITE was responsible for a number
 of disappearances, but it was impossible to determine how many. In addition, hun-
 drds of poicemen captured by the LTrI'E in 1990 remain unaccounted for, and the
 LTTE has refused all requests for information concerning their fate.
 The Government's decision in 1989 to give the International Committee of the Red
 Crss (ICRC) unhindered access to de~ntion centers, police stations, and army
 camps has played an important role in reducing the number of disappearances at-
 tributable to the security forces, as has the work of the Human Rights Task Force
 (HRTF), a quasi-independent government body set up to register detainees held
 under the ER and the PTA and monitor their welfare. However, HRTF field offices
 outside of Colombo are hindered by a dearth of resources and their lack of assertive-
 ness in dealing with security forces, which sometimes fail to comply fully with the
 Government's instructions. Recent changes in the ER-mandating the issuance of
 receipts to families of detainees and notification to the HRTF of all arrests-have
 been largely observed in the breach. Full implementation of this reform would fur-
 ther reduce the number of disappearances.
 In the case of 32 high school-aged boys who disappeared from the southern town
 of Embilipitiya in 1989, the HRTF identified 10 soldiers implicated in the disappear-
 ances, but the Government has taken no action. In its 1993 report the HRTF
 named 4 army officers allegedly responsible for the disappearance of 158 people
 from a refugee camp at the Eastern University in Batticaloa district in 1990. "This
 incident," said the chairman of the HRTF (a retired Supreme Court Justice), "is a
 dastardly crime which cries aloud for proper investigation." Despite this statement,
 the Government has taken no action against the four officers.
 The Presidential Commission appointed to look into allegations of abductions and
 disappearances occurring after January 1991 has proven inadequate to the task. ft
 has completed work on only 38 cases of the 873 that fall within its mandate. Of
 these, the President has referred two to the Attorney General for prosecution. None
 has come to trial. In mid-1993, the mandate of the Commission was changed in an
 attempt to speed the process by which disappearances are investigated. Under the
 new mandate, the Commission will determine only whether a complaint of abduc-
 tion or disappearance is credible, after which the case will be sent to the President
 for a decision whether to refer the case for investigation and prosecution.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and mistreatment of detainees, particularly during interrogation, was com-
 
 
 1389
 mon during 1993. Reports of torture included near drownings, placing of insecticide
 or gasoline-filled bags over the head, and beating the soles of detainees' feet with
 metal rods. Suspected criminals as well as those detained under the ER are rou-
 tinely beaten during the initial phase of their detention. Severe beatings, sometimes
 resulting in broken bones or other serious injuries, were reported by many detain-
 ees.
 Although government officials privately acknowledge that torture is common, the
 Government has done little to address the problem. Most members of the security
 forces regard torture as routine and acceptable. The ER allow the use in court of
 confessions made to plice officers and place the burden of proof on the defendant
 to show that the confession was obtained under duress, there by encouraging the se-
 curity forces' tendency to use torture to extract confessions.
 In several cases, people who claimed to have been tortured filed cases in the Su-
 Court alleging that their rights had been violated. In one well-publicized case
 dating from 1990, a man whose teeth had been extracted with pliers during interro-
 gation was awarded nearly $600 in compensation by the court. The officer respon-
 sible was fned an additional $100 but not otherwise disciplined. Lesser amounts of
 compensation were awarded in several other cases in which detainees had been tor-
 tured or severely beaten. All cases in which compensation was awarded are from
 previous years since it invariably takes more than a year to move a case through
 the courts. According to reliable sources, there have been a handful of reported
 rapes while in detention; several cases are being investigated, and in one case a po-
 lice officer has been arrested.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under ordinary law, authorities must in-
 form an arrested person of the reason for his arrest and within 24 hours bring him
 before a magistrate, who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes, order continued
 detention. Persons detained under ordinary law are generally brought before a mag-
 istrate within a few days of arrest. A suspect may be detained without bail for up
 to 3 months, or longer if a court so rules.
 In practice the PTA, adopted in 1979, and the ER, which have been renewed
 monthly by Parliament since the emergency was declared in 1983, provide excep-
 tions, which have been widely used, to ordinary law on detention . Both the PTA
 and the ER permit preventive and incommunicado detention. A person held under
 the PTA may be detained without charge for up to 18 months, though there have
 been cases in which persons have been held longer. Most detainees are now held
 under the ER rather than the PTA. The number of people held under the ER and
 the PTA declined sharply in 1993, as many of those held for suspected involvement
 with the Janatha Vimukhti Peramunk (JVP), an extremist Sinhalese revolutionary
 group, were either released, charged with criminal offenses, or sent to rehabilitation
 camps in preparation for their release.
 Under the provisions of the ER governing preventive detention, a person may be
 held indefinitely under a detention order signed by the Defense Secretary without
 ever being charged with a crime or brought before a court of law. However, changes
 in the ER announced in February and June now make it mandatory for magistrates
 to visit places of detention on a monthly basis and post in their courts a list of all
 detainees. Officers in charge of places of detention must also, by law, submit lists
 of all detainees to the magstrate as well as to the HRTF. According to the law, offi-
 cials who do not follow these requirements are themselves subject to punishment
 under the ER. Despite these changes to the law, compliance with the revised ER
 is still far from complete, due to the lack of any effective enforcement mechanism
 and the refusal of superior officers to insist on compliance by their subordinates.
 Moreover, the requirement to report detentions to the HRTF applies only to those
 det.inees arrested on suspicion of an offense; detainees held in preventive detention
 are not covered.
 Persons held under the ER are ineligible for bail during the first 3 months of de-
 tention unless the Attorney General gives his prior written consent. After 3 months,
 courts may grant bail, but it is granted infrequently. Once charged, PTA detainees
 are ineligible for bail. Family visits and access to lawyers are sometimes restricted
 under these laws.
 Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during the initial period of deten-
 tion, sometimes lasting several days or weeks. The recent changes in the ER   -
 hibit the holding of detainees in unauthorized (i.e., secret) places of detention.  e
 Government has published a list of 345 authorized places of detention, most of them
 police stations, and has made it a criminal offense to hold detainees elsewhere. Re-
 ports continue that government security forces held people incommunicado for
 months or even years in previously undisclosed places of detention. There were also
 reports that TaMil irregulars, armed and paid by the Government, were operating
 their own detention facilities. A fundamental rights application was filed in the Su-
 
 
 1390
 eme Court against the leader of one such militia, the Eelam Peoples Democratic
 Party(EPDP), alleging illegal abduction and torture. In the latter part of 1993, Gov-
 ernment security forces and alleged Tamil militias began operating what many
 human rights monitors called "a parallel system of secret detention" in Colombo. Be-
 ginning in August, dozens of suspected LTTE sympathizers were picked up in un-
 marked vehicles and taken to undisclosed places of detention. Some were held for
 several months and many were tortured before eventually being transferred to an
 official detention center.
 Persons held under the ER and the PTA (or others acting on their behalf) may
 challenge the legality of their detention by filing habeas corpus applications in the
 Court of Appeals or by charging the Government before the Supreme Court with
 violating fundamental human rights. In recent years, the Supreme Court has sim-
 plified the procedures for initiating fundamental rights cases and waived the re-
 quirement that such cases be filed within 30 days of the alleged infringement. De-
 tainees may now initiate a fundamental rights case simply by writing a letter to
 the court. Anumber of legal aid groups, including the Bar Association of Sri Lanka,
 provide free legal assistance to detainees. Over 400 habeas corpus applications were
 iled on behalf of detainees in 1993, but only a few detainees were released as a
 result. During the same period, 762 fundamental rights cases were riled, with the
 result that over 150 people were released from detention, and 18 people whose
 rights were found to have been violated were awarded monetary compensation.
 As of the end of 1993, there were approximately 2,000 detainees being held under
 the ER, compared to roughly 5,000 at the end of 1992. Another 433 people were held
 in rehabilitation camps pending release, according to the Government.
 The HRTF continued its efforts to monitor conditions of detention and maintain
 a central register of detainees. In addition, the Supreme Court in 1993 instructed
 the HRTF to begin inquiring into the legality of individual cases of detention. The
 HRTF began hiring a legal staff and advising the Court on the release of detainees.
 In addition to the HRTF, the ICRC regularly visited over 400 places of detention.
 Tens of thousands of Tamils were rounded up by the security forces in and around
 Colombo in the second half of 1993, following President Premadasa's assassination
 by an LTTE suicide bomber. Most of them were released after an *identity check'
 lasting between several hours and several days, but a small number were placed
 under detention orders pursuant to the ER. Many Tamils claimed that the mass
 roundups were an unjustified form of harassment based solely on ethnicity.
 There were unconfirmed reports that the LITE was holding over 2,000 prisoners
 in the north. The LTTE does not give the ICRC or other humanitarian organizations
 access to its detainees, except for some 35 security force members, most of whom
 have been held since 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In ordinary criminal cases, defendants are ac-
 corded due process rights, but trials under the ER and the PTA lack several signifi-
 cant safeguards. Persons accused of criminal acts generally receive a fair public
 trial, are informed of the charges and evidence against them, and are represented
 by the counsel of their choice. Persons tried on criminal charges in the High Courts
 and the Court of Appeal are provided an attorney at government expense if nec-
 essary. The Government does not provide attorneys in other cases, although private
 legal aid organizations assist some defendants. Public trial by jury is the custom.
 Jury trials are not provided under the PTA on the grounds that jury members
 could be intimidated. Confessions are admissible in PTA and ER cases but not in
 cases tried outside the PTA and ER framework. Most ER and PTA convictions rely
 heavily on confessions, and the burden of proof of charges of torture and other forms
 of coercion rests on the defendant. Those convicted under the PTA or the ER have
 the same right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court as those
 sentenced in other cases. In practice, however, most people held under these acts
 have never been formally charged and therefore cannot make use of the appeals
 prcess.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the judiciary is inde-
 pendent in practice. The President appoints all judges of the Supreme Court, courts
 of appeal, and high courts. The Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges com-
 prise a Judicial Service Commission which appoints, transfers and dismisses lower
 court judges. Judges serve from time of appointment to mandatory retirement age
 (65 for Supreme Court judges and 62 for others).
 The Government alleges that all persons held under the ER and the PTA are
 members or suspected members of either the JVP or the LTTE. It is impossible to
 determine how many of the roughly 2,000 detainees it holds would properly be
 termed political prisoners, as defined in these reports (see Appendix A), and how
 many are held because of suspected involvement in terrorist activities.
 
 
 1391
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects individual privacy and the sanctity of the family and
 home, and the judiciary usually upholds privacy rights in cases that reach the high
 courts. Under ordinary law, sear& and arrest warrants are generally required to
 enter private premises and must be approved by a magistrate. However the ER and
 PTA permit members of the security orces to enter and search any place, vehicle,
 or vessel" and to "inspect and take possession of any movable property" in the
 course of investigating any suspected offense under the ER and PTA, without the
 need for a warrant. Oversight is provided by the Secretary of Defense. There is no
 judicial review or other means of redress.
 Government monitoring of telephones and correspondence is believed to occur on
 a selective basis. Mail to LTTE-controlled areas is routinely opened and banned
 items, including currency, are seized.
 g. ie of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE continued throughout
 1993. After a lull in the first 9 months of the year, fighting reached new levels of
 intensity in the 4th quarter, as both sides launched major offensives.
 There were no army massacres of Tamil civilians similar to the ones at
 Kokkadichcholai in 1991 and Mailanthani in 1992. However the Sri Lankan navy
 and air force were responsible for a number of civilian deatAs, many due to indis-
 criminate or excessive use of force. Over 250 civilians were killed in such attacks.
 One of the most notorious of these occurred on January 2, when the navy attacked
 a group of civilians crossing the Jaffna lagoon under LTTE escort and in defiance
 of military orders. At least 35 civilians were killed in the incident, in which navy
 patrol boats trained their spotlights on several small, makeshift passenger ferries
 and machine-gunned those on board. Altogether, at least 100 civilians died in this
 and similar incidents on Jaffna lagoon during the course of the year. Following
 army setbacks in October and November, indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets
 in the LTTE-controlled areas of the country increased. On December 8, 25 civilians
 were killed when the air force bombed a crowded public market in Jaffna. On No-
 vember 13, air force jet aircraft attacked the St. James Catholic Church in Jaffna,
 killing at least 10 and injuring dozens more. In all, at least 150 civilians were killed
 in bombing or artillery attacks.
 The LITE was also responsible for a number of violations. Fifteen civilians were
 killed when LTTE forces used innocent travelers as human shields in an attack on
 a crowded government checkpoint in June. At least seven civilians living near an
 army camp were killed when the LMrE attacked and overran the camp in July. The
 totalnumber of such killings attributable to the LTE probably amounts to several
 dozen, but no precise estimate was possible.
 The LTrE sometimes conscript high school-age children for work as cooks, mes-
 sengers, and clerks. There were also reliable reports of children being used as forced
 labor to build fortifications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and expression but permits these rights to be restricted by law in the interests of
 national security. There was, however, some improvement in the civil liberties cli-
 mate during the year. The provisions of the ER that restrict freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press were rescinded in June, then reimposed without explanation
 in December. Under the ER, sentences of up to 20 years in prison may be imposed
 for "inciting feelings of disaffection, hatred or contempt ofthe President or the Gov-
 ernment" or "creating discontent or disaffection among the inhabitants of Sri
 Lanka." Civil libertarians point out that these regulations could, in theory, be used
 to punish virtually any public criticism of the Government. However, the Wijetunga
 Government has so far shown itself to be far less likely to restrict freedom of expres-
 sion than was its predecessor.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain, although a vari-
 ety of independent newspapers and journals provide a range of viewpoints on for-
 eign affairs and domestic issues, including human rights, and openly criticize the
 ruling party and Government. Physical attacks on opposition journalists and politi-
 cians ceased with President Premadasa's death in May. Similarly, a previously se-
 cret organization headed by high-raing former police officers and charged with
 harassment and intimidation of Premadasa's political opponents, including journal-
 ists, was disbanded by President Wijetunga, and revelations about the unit's past
 operations were widely reported in the press. In the one major exception to this
 trend, a respected newspaper columnist received a death thrsat-reportediy from
 the now-retired ommander of the army-following a critical story he wrote about
 a major army offensive.
 
 
 1392
 Although the Government denies it, many journalists allege that the Government
 continues to exert pressure on the press by controlling permits for the import of
 newsprint and through placement of paid government announcements and advertis-
 Ing. In addition, the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act allows Parliament to
 impose an unlimited fine or up to 2 years' imprisonment on anyone who criticizes
 a member of Parliament. Although it is rarely invoked and was not used in 1993,
 journalists and civil libertarians complained that the Act, along with new guidelines
 that effectively prevent the reporting of incidents in Parliament that are not part
 of the official record of proceedings, were an unjustified infringement on freedom of
 the press.
 Several new, privately owned television and radio networks have begun operating
 but the Government maintains a monopoly on the broadcast of local news. Local
 networks that broadcast foreign-produced international news such as the Cable
 News Network and the British Broadcasting Corporation are obliged to delete any
 portions concerning Sri Lanka.
 For its part, the LTTE tolerates no freedom of expression. The print and broad-
 cast media in areas under its control are tightly regulated. The LTTE has been
 known to execute those who criticize it or disagree publicly with its policies. In the
 past, university professors, members of nonviolent Tamil opposition parties, and
 uman rights monitors have been among those killed.
 The LTTE holds numerous prisoners of conscience, including the poet and wom.
 en's activist Thiagarajah Selvanithy, who has been imprisoned since August 1991
 for her participation in a play critical of the LTrE. The group University Teachers
 for Human Rights (UTHR), a human rights group formerly based in the LTrE-con-
 trolled Jaffna Peninsula, has been the target of severe repression by the LTTE for
 its attempts to present a balanced picture of human rights violations in both LTTE-
 and government-controlled areas ofrSri Lanka.
 Although academic freedom is generally respected, political activities on univer-
 sity campuses are restricted under the ER. The Government has defended this ac-
 tion as necessary to ensure that student political activity, such as that used by the
 JVP to close the universities for 3 years, would not disrupt education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Freedom of association is res  din practice.
 The ER restricting the right to peaceful assembly were rescinded in 1993. Restric-
 tion of these rights is still possible under the PTA, but the act was not used for
 this purpose in 1993. There were no cases in which permits are known to have been
 denied for political reasons. An ER issued in 1990 prohibiting political and disrup-
 tive activity in schools and workplaces remains in effect. Under it, permission or
 meetings must be obtained from the head of an institution.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official re-
 ligion, which the Government must 'prtect and foster." It also provides for the
 rights of members of other faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, to
 practice their religions freely. Religious groups are free to maintain active ties with
 coreligionists in other countries, and many Sri Lankans perform religious travel
 each year.
 Religious publishing and proselytizing are allowed, and foreign clergy may work
 in Sri Lanka. For over 30 years, however, the Government has forbidden entry to
 new foreign Jesuit clergy, while allowing those in the country to remain.
 Evangelical Christians (who constitute less than 1 percent of the population) ex-
 pressed concern that the government commission set up to look into the activities
 of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) (see Section 4) has focused much of its
 attention on the activities of Protestant missionaries. These gups also report that
 their efforts to convert Sri Lankans are often met with hostility and sometimes vio-
 lence on the part of local Buddhist clergy or other groups opposed to such mission-
 ary work, and they accuse the Government of tacitly condoning the harassment.
 There is no evidence of active Government support for or protection of those respon-
 sible for the harassment of evangelical Christians- on the other hand, the Govern-
 ment made no effort to remedy the situation. A chauvinistic vernacular press con-
 tributes to the climate of intolerance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka."
 However, curfews, checkpoints, and other actions taken by both the Government
 and the insurgent forces have had the effect of inhibiting travel in large parts of
 the north and east. Strict security measures imposed in the wake of President
 Premadasa's assassination have also had the effect of restricting the freedom of
 movement of Tamils in general and young Tamil males in particular because of re-
 ports that the LiTE was planning additional assassinations.
 
 
 1393
 
 The Government does not restrict the travel abroad of its citizens.
 Sri Lanka does not permit the entry of refugees or displaced persons from other
 countries, nor does it help refugees who attempt to stay in the country while seek-
 ing permanent residence elsewhere. There were no instances of refoulement in 1993.
 There were 620,000 internally displaced persons living in Sri Lanka in 1993. Most
 lived in camps, primarily financed by the Government, in the northeast or adjacent
 provinces.
 At the beginning of the year there were over 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees
 living in refugee camps in Southern India. During 1993 nearly 7,000 of these refu-
 gees returned to Sri Lanka. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 operated freely in Sri Lanka, supporting government refugee relief efforts in the
 north and east and funding transit camps for persons returning from India. Over
 200,000 Sri Lankan Tamils have also migrated to or sought refuge in Western Eu-
 rope and North America over the last 10 years. Many of them have been denied asy-
 lum, and a few have been returned to Sri Lanka.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Sri Lanka has a
 vigorous pl"3: al opposition. Although 1993 was marked by two high-profile assas-
 sinations (--e Sectanon l.a.), organized harassment of the political opposition ceased
 with President Premadasa's death in May. A total of 26 parties are recognized by
 the Commissioner of Elections, and members of 12 of these hold seats in Par-
 liament. Although members of each ethnic community can be found in many of the
 political parties, the two most influential parties generally draw their support from
 the majority Sinhalese community. Historically, these two parties have alternated
 in power. Eighteen Tamils currently hold seats in the 226-member Parliament.
 In May provincial council elections were held in seven of the country's eight prov-
 inces; security conditions precluded a vote in the Northeast Province (a temporary
 merger of the war-trn Northern and Eastern Provinces). An opposition coalition
 won control of the Western Province, which includes the capital, Colombo. Despite
 scattered irre glarities, foreign and domestic election monitors judged this election
 to be largely free and fair.
 There are no de jure impediments to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but the social mores of some communities have the effect of limiting women's
 participation in activities outside the home. Although they are underrepresented,
 women serve at senior levels in both sectors. Eleven women hold seats in Par-
 liament; two are deputy ministers and one is the Minister of Health. The leader of
 the opposition, a former Prime Minister, is a woman.
 The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, number less than a thou-
 sand. There are no de facto or de jue 'restricti on their participation in the politi-
 cal life of the country. Preferring to maintain their traditional way of life, the
 Veddas have resisted government attempts to integrate them into Sri Lankan soci-
 ety.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Htuman Rights
 Several local NGO's, including the Movement for Interracial Justice and Equality
 (MIRJE) and the University Teachers for Human Righ~ts (UTHIR), monitor human
 rights, collecting information from families of victims or members of citizen commit-
 tees near the sites of alleged incidents. Other groups, such as the Civil Rights Move-
 ment (CRM) and the Law and Society Trust (ST), monitor civil and political lib-
 erties. The Government generally does not respond to their periodic reports and ap-
 peals. Unlike in previous years, there were no reports in 1993 of human rights mon-
 itors receiving death threats.
 A variety of international nongovernmental organizations are active in Sri Lanka,
 providing humanitarian relief services to those affected by the conflict in the north-
 east. The Government allows these organizations to operate unhindered, subject
 only to security considerations in the war zone.
 On December 22, President Wijetunga used the Emergency Re lations to pro-
 mulgate a law governing the activities of local and foreign NGO's, thereby bypassing
 normal parliamentry procedures. The law imposed financial reporting require-
 ments on all NGO's,but as of the end of the year it was not clear what additional
 practical effect the new law would have on NGO's operating in Sri Lanka.
 During 1993, the Government made prorss in implementing some of the 44 rec-
 ommendations it accepted from Ai nesty International (A) and the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary
 
 
 1394
 Disappearances, but this progress slowed in the second half of the year. For exam-
 ple, a zero tolerance" directive on human rights was issued by the Eastern Province
 Commander in March, and according to reliable sources, this has led to significant
 on-the-ground improvements. Emergency regulations governing issuance of receipts
 and reporting to the human rights task force have been issued, though, as noted
 compliance is spotty. Several new regional HRTF offices were opened and the HRTF
 is gradually making its presence flIt. The activities of paramilitary groups (e.g.
 home guards, Tamil militias) seem to be coming under better supervision. However,
 there was no discernible movement in implementing the recommendations to pros-
 ecute past human rights violators and investigate disappearances.
 At the 1993 meeting of the UNHRC, Sri Lanka pledged to continue implementa-
 tion of the Working Group's recommendations. It also pledged to "take appropriate
 measures to ascertain the whereabouts of persons referred to in the reports of al-
 leged disappearances" and "erosecute those responsible for disappearances and
 other human rights violations.
 The Government continued to provide the ICRC with virtually unrestricted access
 to its detention facilities, allowing the ICRC to register detainees and monitor their
 treatment. At the request of the Government, the ICRC also continued to oversee
 the transportation of government and donor-supplied food and medical supplies into
 the war zone and to supply human rights training and materials to the Sri Lankan
 security forces.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Sri Lankan women have equal rights under national civil and criminal
 law. However, questions related to family law, including marriage, divorce, child
 custody, and inheritance-are subject at the local level to the customary law of each
 particular ethnic or religious group. Muslims, for example, are guided by Islamic
 law in these matters. The Constitution guarantees equality in public sector employ-
 ment, but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sec-
 tor. In the private sector, women are sometimes paid less than men for equal work.
 Women's rights monitors say that domestic violence and sexual assault are com-
 mon in Sri Lanka, but that for cultural and social reasons Sri Lankan women are
 unlikely to report such abuse. According to women who work with victims, sexual
 assault, rape, and other forms of violence directed against female domestic servants
 is a particularly pernicious problem. Women's groups report that victims of rape and
 domestic violence must face police and judicial officials whose sympathies often lie
 with the accused rather than the victim.
 There are several organizations actively working to promote women's rights and
 greater awareness of women's issues generally and particularly to reform the laws
 governing rape and domestic violence. As a result, public awareness of the problems
 faced by women has increased, but the Government has yet to deal effectively with
 these issues.
 Children.-The Government is formally committed to protecting the welfare and
 rights of children, but its ability to do so in practice has been limited by its lack
 of resources.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse against children. There is, however, a signifi-
 cant problem of child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas. The majority of
 "hese prostitutes are boys, and the majority of their customers are said to be foreign
 tourists. The true extent of child sexual abuse is unknown, but several thousand
 children are thought to be involved. The Government has appointed a technical com-
 mittee to recommend possible new legislation to deal with the problem, and recent
 press reports indicate that such legislation is being considered. However, organiza-
 tions working with abused children believe that the problem lies not with the inad-
 equacy of existing legislation but with the law's enforcement, which is said to be
 lax.
 There are also reports of abuse of rural children working as domestics in urban
 households. There are allegations of starvation, beatings, burnings, sexual abuse,
 and forced prostitution. Enforcement of laws designed to protect these children has
 also been lax. (See also Section 6.c.)
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Tamils have long believed, with some jus-
 tification, that they suffer systematic discrimination in competition for university
 entrance, government employment opportunities, and other matters under govern-
 ment control. While official discrimination continues in some fields, there has been
 little evidence of overt discrimination in university enrollment or government em-
 ployment in recent years. However, many Tamils assert that more subtle forms of
 official discrimination persist. In 1990 the Government decreed that hiring for the
 public service would be based on ethnic groups' proportions in society. Upholding
 
 
 1395
 
 a suit filed by a Tamil public servant, the Supreme Court ruled in 1991 that pro-
 motions must be based on merit but did not address the hiring issue. Under the
 Constitution's 13th Amendment, enacted in 1987, Tamil and Sinhala were both
 made official languages and English the "link" language.
 There are approximately 1 million Tamils of comparatively recent Indian origin
 living in Sri Lanka. Of these, roughly 2-30,000 are not citizens of either India or Sri
 Lanka. Most of them live in the tea-growing highlands and continue to suffer dis-
 crimination, especially in the Government's allocation of education funds. They no
 longer        or citizenship under Indian law and were also denied Sri Lankan
 citizenship by laws adopted afer independence, making them essentially stateless.
 In 1988 the Government agreed to grant citizenship to all remaining stateless
 Tamils. In 1988 the Government eliminated processing delays by passing a law
 making extension of citizenship to those stateless persons automatic upon a simple
 request. However, the new legislation did not cover the nearly 85,000 Tamils who
 themselves or whose parents once applied for Indian citizen shi p but who now wish
 to stay in Sri Lanka. Whl  hey could legally be compelled to leave Sri Lanka, the
 Government has assured Tamil leades that none will be forced to do so.
 Religious Minrities.-As noted above, evangelical Christians have been attacked
 both phsically and in the press for their attempts to convert Buddhists to Chris-
 tianity. However, there is still no evidence of "official" persecution.
 The L E has expelled all Muslims from the areas of northern Sri Lanka under
 its control; expropriated Muslim lands, homes, and businesses; and threatened Mus-
 lim families with death if they attempt to return to their homes. The Tigrs also
 severely restrict the freedom of movement of Tamils living in areas under their con-
 trol, exacting a large "exit tax" from persons wishing to travel to areas under gov-
 ernment control and requiring them to leave all of their property in escrow. In order
 to ensure that people return, the Tigers often allow onlytone member of a family
 to travel at a time. The LlE does not allow internally displaced persons living in
 areas under Tigeat control to return to their homes in government-controlled areas.
 People with Disabilities.-The unique problems faced b)y the disabled in Sri Lanka
 have yet to become an issue of public-policy debate. Most disabled people who are
 unable to work are cared for by their families; those whose families are unable to
 care for them often resort to begging on the streets. There are no laws mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assoeiation.-The Constitution establishes the right of workers
 (except the military and police) to associate freely and to form or join labor unions.
 No prior approval from the employer is needed to form or to join a trade union. Any
 seven workers may form a union, draw up their charter, elect their own reresenta-
 tives, and publicize their views. This right is usually exercised in the industrial sec-
 tor, civil service, state owned enterprises, and plantation sector. Workers in
 nonplantation agriculture and most of those employed in small businesses are not
 generally represented by unions. Altogether 50 to 60 percent of the nonagricultural
 work force, equal tos25 to 30 percent of the total work force, is unionized.
 There are a number of independent trade unions; however, most large unions are
 affiliated with political parties andlay a rominent role in the political process.
 There are two trade unions affiliate with the ruling United National Party (UNP),
 while moe mthan 30 trade unions are affiliated to other political parties.
 During 1992, 154 new unions were registered with the Department of Labor,
 whereas registration of 206 unions were canceled. It is  statutory eirereent that
 unions submit their annual reports to the Department of Labor, and a failure to do
 so is the only -criteria for cancelation of registration.
 All workers other than civil servants and those in essential services, as classified
 by the Government, have the right to strike. In 1992 there were 103 strikes. Al-
 though civil servants have no right to strike, they may submit grievances to the
 Public Service Commission for relief but have no other legal recourse. Under the Es-
 sential Services Act (ESA), based on Emergency Regulation No. 1 of 1989, the Presi-
 dent can exercise the power to declare any sector an essential service, making the
 strike illegal. The law prohibits retribution against legal (non wildcat) strikers in
 nonessential sectors. The only grounds for dismissal is indiscipline.
 Taking note that the Government was preparing to remove export industries from
 the list of essential services where strikes are banned, the Committee on Freedom
 of Association of the International Labor Organization (ILO) observed in May that
 nonessential serc   ert Emergency Regulations Act should be limited to
 services where an interruption would endanger the life, personal safety, or health
 of the population.
 
 
 1396
 In June the Government amended the ER, restricting coverage to sectors it explic-
 itly defined as "essential services": government establishments; air, sea, port, rail,
 road, and other public transport services; services connected with the sale of foods
 and medicines; and the operations of tea, rubber, and coconut plantations. The gar-
 ment industry, which employs nearly 200,000 workers, was dropped from thelist
 of essential services. Even though illeal, strikes in sectors classified by the Govern-
 ment as essential services do occur  n fact, 86 of the 103 strikes in 1992 were in
 the plantation sector (tea, rubber, and coconut), which is still technically listed as
 an essential service. There were 78 strikes in 1993, of which 56 occurred in the "es-
 sential" plantation sector. A telephone workers strike became technically illegal
 when the Government classified telecommunications as an essential service follow-
 ing the outbreak of the strike but no action was taken against the strikers and the
 strike went on as scheduled. here was no retribution.
 Workers in the public enterprises and in the private sector, including those in the
 essential services may lodge complaints with the Commissioner of Labor, the Labor
 Tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect their rights.
 On September 29, the Emergency (Maintenance of Exports) Regulation No. 1,
 under which "anyone intimidating an employee to disrupt the activities of a com-
 pany commits an offense and willbe sentenced to a minimum of 10-years' imprison-
 ment," was rescinded. The President signed a regulation exempting disputes be-
 tween registered employers and unions from the emergency decree, provided 14
 days' notice is  ven to the Commissioner of Labor and the employer.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally, and various Sri Lankan trade union
 federations are affiliates of major international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Col.ctively.-Workers are expressly grant-
 ed the right under the law to bargain collectively, and it is fairly widely practiced.
 For those enterprises in which workers are represented by trade unions, the unions
 do the bargaining for the workers. Where unions are lacking, vwork councils--com-
 posed of employees, employers, and often a public sector representative-are the fo-
 rums for collective bargaining. Except in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ), work
 councils are not required in cases where unions do not exist. In the EPZ's, Board
 of Investment (BOI) regulations require the establishment of a work council, known
 as a Joint Consultative Council (JCC).
 However, Sri Lankan law does not compel management to recognize unions. There
 have been isolated cases where employers were hesitant to recognize the unions in
 their factories. The Labor Commissioner has intervened in these cases to try to per-
 suade the employers to do so. The employer's recognition of a union confers on the
 union the right of representation, allows payroll deduction of union dues, and per-
 mits the union to enter into collective bargaining.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law but is not always enforced or prac-
 ticed. When claims arise, they often result in protracted legal proceedings. Employ-
 ers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired
 for union activities, but reinstated workers are often transferred to different loca-
 tions. In some cases, employers have offered to pay compensation instead of rein-
 stating the worker.
 All public and private sector enterprises, including essential services, enjoy the
 right of collective bargaining. However, collective bargaining takes plae in an esti-
 mated 15 to 20 percent of businesses in the privwrie sector, and only a few large-
 scale private companies and banks sign collective agreements with their unions on
 pay increases and maintenance of the wage levels for a specific period. The primary
 mechanism for setting minimum wages and service conditions in the private sector
 is wage boards (see Section 6.e.). Remuneration tribunals also set wages in some
 cases. In addition, the Board of Investment sets minimum wages for workers in the
 EPZ's. These wages are higher than the national minimum wage.
 Workers have significant protection for the right to employment under the Termi-
 nation Act. Under the Act, no one may be f-ed without the permission of the Labor
 Commissioner. Outside of the essential-services area, dismissal may only be allowed
 on the grounds of disciplinary infractions. Should workers performing an essential
 service go on strike, management may legally terminate employment, and the strik-
 ing worker has no recourse. This power, however, has rarely been used.
 Workers in the EPZ's are free to join unions, but unionization in the zones has
 been traditionally discouraged by employers and the Government. Unions, to date,
 do not represent workers in collective bargaining or dispute resolution. Otherwise,
 workers in the EPZ's have the same rights as other workers, including the ig*it to
 strike. Workers in the EPZ's are represented by Joint Consultative Councils (JCC),
 which are established under BOI regulations. Fify percent of the JCC members are
 elected by EPZ workers, and 50 percent are appointed by management. They are
 chaired by the BOI, with most decisions being reached by consensus. Until recently,
 
 
 1397
 
 union officials were only permitted into EPZ's with an invitation from the JCC, an
 employer, or a group of employees. Now, the Government's Board of Investment
 (BOI is preparing office space and meeting rooms for use by unions in each of the
 EPZ's, as they no longer require invitations for entry. Two established trade unions
 have taken advntag of the June 1993 decision allowing entry into the EPZ's. How-
 ever, it is too soon to say whether they will be sucessful in forming branches there.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibitd by law. There is no conscription or fored recruitment.
 There are reports of abuse of children brought in from rural areas in debt bondage
 to work as domestic servants in urban househol  (see also Section 5). In the view
 oi" the National Employers Union (Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya), these children are
 not adequately protected, mainly due to the shortage of labor inspectors.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chiidren.-The basic minimum age for em-
 ployment in Sri Lanka is 14 yers. However, the employment of children  low the
 age of 14 by their parents or guardians in light agcultural or horticultural work
 for a limited period is legally permitted. Light work is also permitted in anyj school
 or institution for training purposes. Persons under 16 may not be employed in any
 public performance in whuch life or limb is endangered. Until recently, children
 under 14 years could be employed in the plantation industry, but with the adoption
 of ILO Convention 10, ratified b  the   vernment in November 1991, children
 under 14 years of age may no longer be employed on the plantations. Child labor
 is not used in the EPZ's or in the garment facries. About 85 percent of children
 below the age of 16 attend school, and the law provides that the employment of such
 persons is permitted for not more than 1 hour on any day before school. For the
 small percentage of children over the age of 14 who are not in school (and who are
 legally allowed to work), there is no explicit law that limits their working hours to
 less than those allowed for adults.
 Despite legislation, some child labor still exists. Some children work in the infor-
 mal sectors, including coir-making, which is the making of products, such as mats,
 from coconut fiber; industries; fishing; drying fish; wrapping tobacco; street trading;
 domestic service and on farms. Enforcement measures taken by the Department of
 Probation and Child Care Services, including inspections and penalties, have been
 unable to eliminate child labor, and the labor laws are used only to deal with ex-
 treme forms of it.
 Based on the recommendation of a committee of experts appointed by the Govern-
 ment to examine child labor, the Cabinet decided in September to enact laws to in-
 crease the minimum age to 15years in view of ILO conventions and to tighten child
 labor laws. Social and economic factors also help to control the problem of child
 labor in Sri Lanka. The country's gross national product, relatively high by regional
 standards, and its near-90 percent literacy level serve as a brke on the employ-
 ment of children. Virtually all children attend primary school and three-quarters of
 them go on to secondary school, according to government statistics.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but wg
 boards set minimum wae s and working conditions on a sector by sector basis.  e
 Wagoe Board, a legislated body under the Wage Board Ordinance of Sri Lanka of
 1941, is a tripartite body representing the employer, employee, and the Department
 of Labor. There are 38 bards covering more than 100 occupations in industry, com-
 merce, services, and ag  rculture. The current minimum wae   rates are $34 (1,166
 rupees) a month in industry and commerce, $33 a month in the service industry,
 and $1.50 a day in agriculture. Minimum wages in the industrial and commercial
 sectors also vary from trade to trade. In the garment industry, where nearly 20C.,000
 persons are employed, the minimum wage is $41.20 per month. While this minimum
 wage is considered insufficient for a worker to support the standard family of five,
 the overwhelming number of textile workers are young women whose incomes are
 supplementary to their families' main income. The Minimum Wage Law is effec-
 tively enforced by the Department of Labor.
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from
 working regularly more than 45 hours per week (a 5 2-day workweek). Such work-
 er also receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and some
 20 local holidays each year. Maternity leave is available for all female workers, per-
 manent or casual. Employers also must contribute an amount equal to 12 to 15 per-
 cent of a worker's wage to an employee s provident fund and 3 percent to an employ
 ees trust fund. If these contributions are not paid on time, the Government fines
 the employer.
 Safety and health of workers are protected under a variety of laws. The Depart-
 ment of Laber employs a small staff of technical officers to inspect workplaces, but
 the staff is inadequate for effective enforcement. The Department also provides na-
 
 
 1398
 tionwide worker education programs on health and safety issues in an effort to in-
 crease worker awareness.
 The graphite industry records the highest number of health hazards. In tea fac-
 tories, asthma and chronic bronchitis are common. Workers have the statutory right
 to remove themselves from situations that endanger their health, but much of the
 work force is either unaware of, or indifferent to, the risks involved in their work.
