 MEXICO
 The United Mexican States is a federal republic with a President elected to a 6-
 year term, a bicameral Congress, and a constitutionally mandated independent judi-
 cial branch. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has won every presidential
 election in the last 65 years, many of which involved credible allegations of fraudu-
 lent practices. However, the August 21 elections and the January 1 uprising in
 Chiapas were unparalleled events for human rights in Mexico. Bath highlighted
 progress and underscored issues still needing to be addressed in human rights prac-
 tices.
 In Chiapas the Government initially reacted with force, but in a significant depar-
 ture from historical practice, it soon adopted a plan which rejected a military solu-
 tion to end the insurrection of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN).
 With intense domestic and international media attention focussed on Chiapas the
 Government declared a unilateral cease-fire 2 weeks after hostilities began, and un-
 dertook face-to-face peace talks with the rebels in February. The military per-
 petrated many human rights abuses during the earliest phase of the conflict, and,
 as of year's end, authorities had prosecuted no one for those abuses. The talks broke
 off in mid-May; the Government, however, continued its offer to reestablish a dialog
 
 
 444
 with the EZLN. At year's end, hostilities had not resumed. President Ernesto
 Zedillo, who took office on December 1 renewed the call for negotiations and accept-
 ed a mediation role for the National Mediation Commission (CONAD. Direct talks
 resumed on January 15, 1995.
 The August 21 elections were a significant steop forward for Mexico's democratic
 process. 35.5 million people-nearly 78 percent of registered voters-cast ballots in
 the August 21elections. Despite wdesprea irregularities and the ruling PRIs abil-
 ity to benefit frm government resources and privilegd access to the news media,
 numerous independent observer groups, including the highly critical nongovern-
 mental umbrela group Civic Alliance and a joint delegation from the National
 Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, and the Carter Center,
 determined that these factors did not alter the outcome. The elections featured sev-
 eral innovations in the electoral system, including participation of mere than 80,000
 accredited domestic observers, government-invited foreign witnesses, and electoral
 organs under the control of nonpartisan, civilian directors.
 Mexican security forces, including the military, the federal and state judicial po-
 lice, federal highway police, and local police are under the control of elected civilian
 officials. However, the security forces, especially the police, continued to commit
 human rights abuses.
 Although economic reforms succeeded in reducin inflation and restructuring the
 economy, a currency devaluation and financial liqudity crisis at year's end will  -
 ly have a sharply negative impact on economic performance in 1995, including a fall
 in real wages. Serious income disparities and areas of severe poverty remain. The
 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Can-
 ada, and Mexico went into effect at the beginning of the year.
 Major human rights abuses included the violence and killings in Chiapas, as well
 as extrajudicial killings by the police, torture, and illegal arrests. Other abuses in-
 clude glaring prison deficiencies, discrimination and violence against women, and
 extensive illegal child labor in the informal economy. The Government attempted to
 end the "culture of impunity" surrounding the security forces through reforms in the
 Office of the Attorney General (PGR), continued support to the National Commis-
 sion for Human Rights (CNDH), and establishment of state-level commissions for
 human rights. By year's end, however, it had tried and punished few human rights
 abusers and abuses remained widespread.
 Fulfilling his pledges to implement political and judicial reforms, President Zedillo
 appointed a respected member of the opposition National Action Party (PAN), Anto-
 nio Lozano, as Attorney General with a mandate to implement reforms in law en-
 forcement. Zedillo also succeeded in enacting a package of judicial reforms designed
 to improve the performance and accountability of the Attorney General's office and
 the Supreme Court.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra *dicial Killing.-A number of political activists were
 killed in 1994, but a political motive was not clearly established in any of these
 killings. A lone gunman murdered Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling PRrs presi-
 dential candidate, at a political rally in Tijuana in March. The authorities arrested,
 tried, and convicted the gunman of murder at a trial held in a federal prison, out
 of public view. The public prosecutor, Miguel Montes, at one point declared that the
 murder was the result of a conspiracy. e later recanted this statement and subse-
 quently resigned.
 In September a gunman shot and killed Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the Sec-
 retary General of the PRI, on a Mexico City street. The police arrested and detained
 a suspect who was jailed pending trial, along with several co-conspirators. However,
 Manuel Munoz Roch     a PRI legislator and suspected intellectual author of the kill-
 ing, was still at large at year's end. Deputy Attorney General Mario Ruiz Massieu,
 the victim's brother, resigned his post in November, charging that PRI and govern-
 ment officials obstructed his investigation. The Attorney General's investigation into
 these charges did not find the evidence sufficient for subsequent prosecution.
 President Zedillo, saying that the Mexican people were not satisfied with the re-
 sults of the Government's inquiries into the Colosio and Ruiz Massieu killings, or
 the 1993 murder of Guadalajara's Cardinal Posadas, instructed Attorney General
 Lozano to intensify efforts to resolve these crimes. In December Lozano appointed
 a special prosecutor to look into all three murders.
 The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and to a lesser extent other
 opposition parties, asserted that there were political killings associated with the
 1994 election campaign. In July an unidentified car struck and killed a PRD cam-
 
 
 445
 paign organizer while he was jogging, and fled the scene. In August unidentified
 gunmen killed another PHD activist in Tapachula, Chiapas. In a possible assassina-
 tion attempt, the PRD's candidate for the governorship of Chiapas suffered severe
 injury in August when a trailer truck collided with his minivan. The candidate has
 fully recovered, but two other PHD officials died in the incident, and two more suf-
 ferd serious injury. The Attorney General's Office has not determined whether the
 incident was an accident or an assassination attempt.
 The PRD claims that, in the past 6 years, 275 party activists or members were
 the victims of political violene which, mn some cases, resulted in death. By mutual
 agreement wi   the PRD, the   DH dismissed 135 claims as unsubstantiated and
 proceeded to investigate 140 claims. These included 90 involving the murder of 115
 persons, and 17 involving serious injury. The CNDH investigation found violations
 of human rights by Government authorities in 67, or 47.8 percent, of the 140 cases.
 The CNDH findings included recommendations on redressing abuses. At year's end,
 the authorities had fully implemented 18 recommendations and partially imple-
 mented the remaining 49.
 Police and vigilantes acting on behalf of local landowners continued to commit
 extrajudicial killings while dislodging peasant squatters from rural lands in several
 states. The Government's response to squatter issues including these killings, has
 varied from state to state. To expand communal land holdings, peasants for decades
 have invaded private lands and petitioned for government recognition of the sei-
 zures. With recent constitutional agrarian reforms, the Government ceased distrib-
 uting new lands to 'ejidos" (government-owned communes); the invasions continue
 nonetheless.
 Police and vigilantes raided the Plan del Encinal community in Ixhuatlan de
 Madero, Veracruz state, on September 8, forcibly evicting residents and taking two
 community leaders into custody. The mutilated bodies of the two were found in a
 nearby river bearing numerous close-range gunshot wounds to the head and chest.
 The Veracruz state human rights commission and the Attorney General's office are
 investigating the case. Veracruz state officials blocked an attempt by a team of fo-
 rensic experts and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) to conduct autopsies on
 the victims. The NGO's have appealed to federal authorities for assistance.
 In January while searching for a suspect involved in another incident, the police
 allegedly shot and killed two farmers in Jalisco state. The authorities arrested the
 six police officers involved, pending further investigation. Proceedings continued
 against a local police officer accused of beating U.S. citizen Mario Amado to death
 in a Baja California jail in 1992.
 The Mexican military has not yet made public the resolution of charges against
 16 soldiers in the June 1993 killing of 5 suspected narcotics traffickers in Chihua-
 hua.
 Mexico is one of the countries cited by Amnesty International where gays and les-
 bians are most likely to be victims of abuse and violence. At least 12 homosexuals
 and 9 male prostitutes have been killed in Tuxtla Gutierrez since 1991. Gay rights
 advocates charged that police made little effort to solve these murders. An inde-
 pendent prosecutor was appointed in April, but authorities have not provided the
 prosecutor with adequate resources to carry out full investigations.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 ain 1994.
 The NDH     annual report contained 461 cases of missing persons in the Chiapas
 conflict alone, of whom 432 had been located by May. As of year's end, the CNDH
 believed no more than 10 persons were still missing, but due to large movements
 of people caused by the conflict, it was difficult to locate the remaining persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture continues to be a serious human rights problem, although the CNDH re-
 ported a 40-percent decline in torture complaints over the previous year. The CNDH
 as noted that 8 out of 32 jurisdictions (31 states and the Federal District) still do
 not have specific laws to prevent or punish torture. Poorly trained and equipped to
 investigate crimes, police officers continued to attempt to solve crimes by rounding
 up likely suspects and then exacting confession from them. Photographs of detainees
 with black-eyed, swollen faces still appear in the local press. Even high-profile sus-
 pect Mario Aburto, the accused gunman in presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
 olosio's assassination, claimed that police beat him, press photos and reports short-
 ly after his arrest lend credence to his claims. CNH representatives were present
 during his subsequent interrogations.
 The authorities punish few officials for torture, which continues to occur mainly
 because confessions are the primary evidence in many criminal convictions. The
 CNDH reported that in the period from May 1993 to April 1994, the authorities
 brought 53 cases against officals for the crime of torture; in 13 cases they declined
 
 
 446
 to execute the arrest warrant, and judges denied or canceled the arrest order in an-
 other 25 cases. By law the defendant must prove that a confession was forced; but
 even a forced confession is not automatically excluded from evidence. Many victims
 do not report, or do not follow through on, their complaints against the police for
 fear of reprisals.
 Three young indigenous women charged that 10 soldiers beat and raped them at
 a military checkpoint in Chiapas on June 4. The military immediately denied the
 accusation, but brought seven soldiers before a military court that is investigating
 the matter. The law does not require civil trial of soldiers involved in civil crimes,
 and the military continues to handle the case. The CNDH and some human rights
 advocates agree that the law gives the military jurisdiction over this case.
 On November 16, various peasant organizations comprised of Ch'ol and Tzeltal In-
 diana organized a demonstration in the main square of Palenque, Chiapas, in con-
 nection with a local land dispute. An armed group that reportedly included ranch-
 ers, local businessmen, and the Palenque municipal police forced the peasants from
 the square. The police and vigilantes fired tear gas at the demonstrators, burned
 their possessions, and transported some of them out of town in trucks. State govern-
 ment officials arrived later the same day and attempted to establish a dialog be-
 tween the two sides. CNDH investigators arrived on November 18. Although the
 CNDH received no complaints or reports of any missing persons, Amnesty Inter-
 national reported that approximately 70 persons disappeared. The captors released
 all the detainees after holding them for a month andafter beating all of them se-
 verely.
 On November 20, demonstrations and violence in Comitan, Chiapas, resulted in
 police tear-gassing demonstrators and the kidnaping of a municipal police officer by
 protester. Again, the CNDH did not receive any missing person complaints, but
 Amnesty International reported that unidentified forces abducted 10 persons and
 held them approximately a month as well, and then released them after being them.
 In both of these incidents in Chiapas, no authorities brought any charges of wrong-
 doing against either side, nor did any officials other than CNDHinitiate any inves-
 tigation. The CNDH continued to investigate these matter.
 In 1989 an elite group of antinarctics police was responsible for the kidnaping
 and rape of at least 19 women in Mexico City. Courts had sentenced only four of
 the dozen accused officers to prison at the end of 1993. The authorities released the
 remaining 8 officers after victims could not identify them.
 In some cases police officers whom one state dismissed find law enforcement em-
 ployment in another. The CNDH discovered that even when the authorities cen-
 sured some officers in one law enforcement job, they moved on to other positions
 and were subsequently charged again with human rights abuses. In an effort to
 remedy this situation, the CNDH publishes lists of censured public servants in its
 annual report and monthly newsletters.
 Many prisons are staffed by undertrained and corrupt guards, lack adequate fa-
 cilities for prisoners and are overcrowded, despite an early release program en-
 dorsed by the CNDH and legal reforms reducing the number of crimes that carry
 mandatory prison sentences. Prisoners complain that they must purchase food, med-
 icine, and other necessities from guards or bribe guards to allow the goods to be
 brought in from outside. Drug and alcohol use is rampant in prisons. Frequently,
 prisoners exercise authority within the prison, displacing prison officials. Conflicts
 between rival prison groups, often involved in drug traflicking, continued to spark
 lethal violence. While the authorities prosecuted a few prison officials for abusing
 prisoner it was more common to dismiss them or to charge them with only minor
 offenses. In response to these problems, the CNDH launched a nationwide campaign
 to improve prison conditions. Federal and state governments have begun to provide
 funding for the construction of modern installations and to improve existing facili-
 ties.
 Some prisons, contrary to law, do not separate male and female populations. In
 at least one prison, the authorities allowed male trusties access to women's cells,
 also a violation of the law. At this prison, officials sometimes encouraged women to
 form sexual liaisons with male prisoners and guards, as such relationships, accord-
 ing to a state prison official, enhanced the facility's peace and safety. In some cases,
 oficials coerced women into sexual relationships. The CNDH has 20 investigators
 dedicated to women's issues and has a program to inspect prisons (it has visited 502
 jails) and investigate prisoner complaints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention continued
 to be among the most common human rights ebuses. The authorities arbitrarily im-
 prisoned 21 persons at the Cerro Hueco prison in March. Only when the prisoners
 began a hunger strike to call attention to their plight did the CNDH intervene. In
 
 
 447
 the third week of the strike, the authorities acknowledged that they had no grounds
 for continuing the imprisonment, and released them.
 A study by the National Indigenous Institute (IND found that courts had not yet
 sentenced 70 percent of indigenous prisoners, half of whom the authorities held in
 pretrial detention for longer than allowed by law. Over the past 5 years, the INI
 was able to have 8,000 indigenous prisoners released from jails, but with new en-
 trants the current indigenous prison population stands at 5,400. The INI has suc-
 ceeded in convincing federal prosecutors to drop charges against first-time offenders
 accused of drug cultivation, arguing that indigenous defendants are often forced by
 drug traffickers to grow the crops and do not understand the legal significance of
 their actions.
 Many detainees report that officials ask them to pay bribes for release before for-
 mal arraignment; many of those arrested report that they are able to bribe officials
 to have them drop charges before they go before a judge. Corruption is rampant
 throughout the system. Some wealthy     gtraffickers have avoided arrests or jail
 sentences by paying off police officers and-judges. In July police officers detained
 a U.S. citizen and his son and drove them around Mexico City for several hours.
 The officers released them after they handed over their cash and valuables, warning
 them not to report the incident as the officers knew where the two lived.
 The Constitution provides that the authorities must present anyone detained be-
 fore a judge within 72 hours and must try the person within 4 months if the alleged
 crime carries a sentence of less than 2 years, or within 1 year if the crime carries
 a longer sentence. The law requires prisoners awaiting trial to be housed separately
 from those convicted. In practice, these time limits are frequently ignored. According
 to the CNDH and NGO's, the authorities often held criminal defendants with con-
 victed prisoners, and for longer than allowed by law before going to trial.
 To address these problems, the Government established the CNDH in 1990. The
 overall number of complaints filed with the CNDH increased by 16 percent in 1994,
 with 6,574 complaints filed from January to August. Its recommendations have re-
 suited in the sanctioning of 1,484 public servants, the vast majority members of
 public security forces. During the 12-month period from May 1993 to May 1994,
 CNDH efforts resulted in sanctions against 539 public servants, as follows: 119
 penal actions; 54 dismissals; 35 declared incompetent for public service; 86 suspen-
 sions; 56 reprimands or warnings; 1 arrest; 1 fine- and 190 investigations pending.
 The CNDH publishes the names of all sanctioned public servants. In some cases,
 authorities applied multiple sanctions, but CNDH statistics list cases under the
 most severe sanction applied. In Chiapas the Attorney General's office announced
 the dismissal of 60 percent of all state poice officers (510 of 850 agents) for crimes
 while in uniform or when working as police without proper registration.
 The law does not permit exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-Trial in the Mexican judicial system, which is
 based on the Napoleonic Code, is a series of fact-gathering hearings at which the
 court receives documentary evidence or testimony. In addition officials may add no-
 tarized documents to the official case fie without authentication. While these hear-
 ings must by law be open to the public, in practice the courts do not admit the pub-
 lic. Journalists covering a judicial proceeding rely on the statements of attorneys
 outside the courtroom as to what occurred inside. A judge alone in chambers re-
 views the case file and makes a final written ruling based thereon. The record of
 the proceeding is not available to the pubic; only the parties and, by special motion,
 the victim, may have access to the official file.
 In his first month in office, President Zedillo moved a package of judicial reforms
 aimed at improving the performance of the Mexican Supreme Court through the
 Congress and the 20 state legislatures needed to amend the Constitution. These re-
 forms included Senate confirmation of Supreme Court justices and relieving the
 Court of administrative duties.
 While there is a constitutional right to an attorney at all stages of criminal pro-
 ceedings, in practice many poor defendants are not adequately represented. Attor-
 neys are not always available during the questioning of defendants; in some in-
 stances a defense attorney will attempt to represent several clients simultaneously
 by entering different rooms to certify that he was present although he did not actu-
 ally attend the full proceedings. In the case of indigenous defendants, many of
 whom do not speak Spanish, the situation is often worse. The courts do not rou-
 tinely furnish translators for them at all stages of criminal proceedings, and thus
 defendants may be unaware of the status of their case.
 Some human rights gups claim that activists arrested in connection with land
 disputes and other civil disobedience activities are in fact politicalprisoners. The
 Government asserts that those charged in the sometimes violent land invasions are
 fairly prosecuted for common crimes, such as homicide and damage to property.
 
 
 448
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the rights to privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The
 law requires search warrants, but there were credible claims that unlawful searches
 without warrants are common. There were no known claims of forced political mem-
 bership and no substantiated claims of surveillance or interference with correspond-
 ence.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Chiapas uprising prompted many claims of human rights abuses. The
 CNDH issued an interim report in May finding that there was reason to believe that
 the military had injured or killed civilians in aerial attacks, and that there were
 summary executions, illegal detentions, and torture. The military denied any re-
 sponsibilty, and no military personnel or government officials have been sanctioned.
 The CH has not yet issued its final report on Chiapas.
 On January 4, army fixed-wing aircraft fired rockets and machine guns into vil-
 lages around San Cristobal de las Casas killing and injuring several noncombatant
 residents. Army personnel on the ground, untrained in managing close air support,
 made inaccurate target identification and contributed to the civilian casualties. The
 aircraft also fired on clearly identified journalists in the area who were displaying
 a white flag.
 One of the first photographs to come out of the conflict was a picture of five men
 apparently bound at the wrists and shot point blank in the head. The five were
 lying in a bloody pool on the floor of the market in the town of Ocosingo, some wear-
 ing what appeared to be EZLN uniforms-green pants and brown shirts. The federal
 Attorney General's Office determined in April that someone had indeed executed the
 five, but it exonerated the army, finding that the army was not in the market at
 the time of death. National and international human rights organizations widely
 criticized the PGR report, which disregarded evidence that the investigators could
 not have accurately fixed the time of death and that army elements indeed were
 in the market on the day the five died. Also in Ocosingo, the authorities later deter-
 mined that 11 bodies found in paupers' graves after the fighting ended included
 noncombatant hospital patients and visitors; some witnesses said the army gunned
 them down. Again, the military denied any involvement; the PGR investigated the
 case but has yet to charge anyone.
 In Morelia residents reported that the military entered a communal farm of 100
 families on January 7, forcing the men to lie face down in the village square while
 they led some away for questioning and beatings. Witnesses said they saw a mili-
 tary ambulance take away the bodies of three men, two of them in their sixties.
 Residents discovered the remains of the three on the outskirts of the community on
 February 10. The army denied any responsibility, claiming that the remains were
 not human and that no military troops were in Morelia on January 7. The army
 admitted, however, that troops were there on January 6. US. pathologists confirmed
 the identity of the remains, but the Government did not file charges and closed the
 case.
 There were also complaints that the EZLN committed human rights abuses. The
 CNDH declined to investigate the charges, since the EZLN is not a government en-
 tity. The EZLN kidnaped and held for 2 months a former governor of Chiapas, re-
 leasing him after a "people's tribuna" found him guilty of crimes against the people.
 At times the EZLN collected "war taxes" at road blocks in the areas it controlled
 and confiscated the private proprty and livestock of ranchers. The EZLN an-
 nounced in October t9at it woul welcome an investigation by NGO's into allega-
 tions that it had committed human rights abuses against civilians. The EZLN also
 said it was opening an office to train its soldiers and to receive complaints of human
 rights abuses.
 Some large landowners in Chiapas established private militias to defend their
 property from peasant land invasions. Loal authorities have not impeded establish-
 ment of these militias, which often employ police and military personnel.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. Since 1990, reforms and internal changes have made the media more
 professional, freer of the Government and more competitive. The Government relin-
 quished its control over newsprint, banned the practice of overtly paying for favor-
 able news coverage, and ceased to pay for journalists' travel expenses during trips.
 There remained significant restrictions on these freedoms. The Government used
 its control of a significant advertising budget, and its ability to reward favored jour-
 nalists by providing them access to officials, to discourage unfavorable reports.
 There continued to be some self-censorship by the media. The Government controls
 broadcast license renewals, and some have charged that the Government delayed re-
 
 
 449
 newing licenses for stations that are critical of the Government or the PRI. On at
 least four occasions, radio station owners preempted any possible problems with li-
 cense renewals by firing employees who had broadcast critical stories. Journalists
 are also reluctant to undermine their access to government officials by criticizing
 them too freely. Many media outlets depend heavily on government advertising and
 do not wish to prejudice such income.
 The media have also changed internally. Some new daily newspapers and maga-
 zines are demanding higher education levels from their reporters and paying them
 accordingly. Some print media are also implementing strict accounting procedures,
 making the acceptance of bribes more difficut. The electronic media are lagging be-
 bind their print competitors in the emphasis on .trainng..
 STo a surprisin .degre  both print and lectonic media prvided full coverage of
 te Chapas uprising. For example, a cable atevsion nework broadcast a lengthy
 interview of EZLN leader Subcomandante Marcos. A provicil radio station broad-
 cast the peace talks between the EZLN and the government team live, despite gov-
 ernment admonitions that it not do so. The EZLN also sought to control coverage
 of the talks and barred two television networks-one Mexican and one American-
 from its press conferences, claiming the networks were biased in favor of the Gov-
 ernment.
 The August election gave ournaliste an opportunity to demonstrate independence.
 Although only approximately 10 percent of the population regularly reads a news-
 or phap because of this) the move away from the traditional pro-PRI party
 line was more notable in the print media. Several independent studies found that
 the two primary opposition candidates for president received substantially more cv-
 erage during the 1994 campaign than during any other previous election. Still, the
 amount of coverage of the ruling party candidate greatly exceeded that of the oppo-
 sition, and its tone was more favorable. Studies of radio and televiion eleion cov-
 erage, which was justly criticized in the past as inequitable, found that electronic
 media coverae of the opposition also increased this year, although less dramaticaly
 than that of the print media. The coverage afforded the ruling party candidate was
 generally favorable; coverage of the opposition was far more negative.
 On election day, the main cable television company (controlled byTelevisa, the
 countys largest broadcaster and consistently accused of progovernment bias)
 blacked out foreign programming until all polling places were closed. The electronic
 media made some efforts to balance coveraway for example, Televisa gave equal
 amounts of free air and production time to all the presidential candidates near the
 end of the campaign period.
 Violence against journalists continued. Assailants killed three reporters in the
 state of Morels; all were severe critics of the departing state administration at the
 time of their deaths. Government authorities are investigating these cases, and the
 CNDH is also pursuing one. In 1990 the CNDH initiated a limited program to inves-
 tigate complaints of human rights abuses by government offcials against journal-
 ists; in 1994 the CNDH made it permanent. The program, consisting of three phases
 to date, involved a total of 100 cases through September 28. The complaints in-
 vlved abuses that ranged from unlawful termination of empoyent to murder. The
 CNDHconcluded all but four cases in thepthree phasesrof tc logram  many on
 administrative grounds). It resolved 9 cases to the satisfaction of the affected jour-
 nalist 21 others resulted in punishment of government officials for illegal acts, and
 the CnDH recommended that the Government take further action against the ac-
 cused official in 16 cases. The CNDH discontinued 25 cases because victims did not
 pursue their allegations.
 There continued to be incidents of outright intimidation. For example, armed in-
 truders invaded and ransacked the offices of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Ciudad
 Juarez in August. Because they took only a small amount of cash but left other
 valuables, it did na     totar tha thtive was robber . The event followed a meet-
 ing at which the Bishop had pressured the Attorney General to pursue the case of
 murdered Archbishop Posadas more rigorously.
 In late January, the curator of a Matahoros museum gave organizers of a photo-
 graphic display portraying the conflict in Chiapas 1 hore s notice to remove the dis-
 play after the commander of the Plaza Guard in Matamoros, Brig. Ge Gonzalez
 Gareia Siv  intimated his displeasure at the exhibit. The curator claimed that the
 expulsion was necessay in order to conduct a previousl scheduled fumigation, but
 the short notice and the coincidence with the General's visit indicate otherwise.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-Citiens have a constitutional
 right to assembly and association which they freely and frequently exercise. The
 only requirement for holding demonstration is that groups wishing to meet in pub-
 lic areas must inform local ioice authorities.
 
 
 450
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice, and the authorities generally respected this right. (However,
 see Section 5 concerning religious discrimination.) Mexican law bars clergy from
 holding public office and from advocating partisan political positions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not generally restrict movement into, out of, or
 within the country. However, military checkpoints remained in place throughout the
 year in areas around EZLN strongholds (see Section 1.g.). At the beginning of the
 year, the military at these checkpoints sometimes harassed volunteers with relief
 caravans carrying food and medicine to EZLN-held territory; the situation later im-
 proved somewhat. Similarly, the military delayed several US. citizens working with
 human rights groups at the checkpoints.
 The Government admitted 45,000 Guatemalan refugees fleeing from the civil war
 in that country and, as the Guatemalan conflict subsides, is steadily repatriating
 them. In 1994 Mexico agreed to accept Cuban refugees for the first time; only Cu-
 bans who have relatives in Mexico able to support them, however, are eligible. The
 Cubans would not be issued work permits. The authorities generally do not inform
 asylum seekers at the borders of their right to apply for asylum; the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that the authorities expel about 100,000
 aliens annually for illegally entering the country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Under the Constitution, citizens have the right to change their government
 through periodic elections. The PRI dominates Mexican politics and has controlled
 the Government since the party was founded in 1929. It has won every presidential
 election since then and has maintained power, in part, by relying on public patron-
 age, use of government and party organizational resources, and, in the past, elec-
 toral fraud.
 Mexico held nationwide federal elections on August 21, as well as state and local
 contests in seven states. Voters elected the PRI candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, with ap-
 proximately 50 percent of the vote. Diego Fernandez de Cevallo, the candidate of
 the right-of-center National Action Party, came in second with almost 26 percent of
 the vote, while Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolu-
 tion obtained 16 percent. The PRI holds 95 of a total of 128 Senate seats and 300
 seats in the 500-member Chamber of Deputies. Opposition parties increased their
 seats from 3 to 33 in the Senate and from 180 to 198 in the Chamber of Deputies.
 Two seats remained unfilled due to legal challenges to election results.
 The elections were generally peaceful and orderly. The Government spent hun-
 dreds of millions of dollars funding the operations of the quasi-independent Federal
 Electoral Institute (IFE), whose governing council was placed under the control of
 nonpartisan, civilian directors. The IE oversaw the compilation of a new voter reg-
 istration list and distribution of more than 40 million new voter identification cards.
 The IFE trained hundreds of thousands of polling officials, all chosen by lottery,
 and, working with the election assistance unit of the United Nations, helped prepare
 the more than 80,000 independent election observers, most of them affiliated with
 NGO's and civic and labor organizations.
 Some domestic observer groups, Mexican media outlets, and major political par-
 ties conducted "quick count" operations which confirmed the official results. Some
 international observers, including the National Democratic Institute and the Inter-
 national Republican Institute, praised the Government and the IFE for the handling
 of the elections, but also pointed out numerous irregularities. They criticized the
 proovernment bias in the media and the use of government resources in support
 of the ruling party. The PRD and some NGO's claimed that the Government and
 the PRI perpetrated widespread fraud, including stuffing ballot boxes and multiple
 votes. These groups, however, have yet to substantiate their claims. Election courts
 overturned results in a handful of congressional and mayoral races because of irreg-
 ularities or fraud. In cases where electoral courts determine fraud, they void the re-
 sults of the voting stations in question and determine the outcome according to the
 returns from other stations in the district.
 A severe failure in the electoral process was the lack of any meaningful prosecu-
 tion of those accused of electoral crimes. The Government appointed a special pros-
 ecutor for electoral crimes, but the prosecutor was slow in dealing with some 400
 complaints, including dozens accusing state governors and other officials of using
 government resources to support candidates. The special prosecutor brought charges
 only against a grammar school principal and one candidate for requiring parents to
 attend the can 'date's campaign rally in order to retrieve children's report cards.

 Even in this case, a local judge canceled the arrest warrants, and the principal and
 the candidate face no criminal proceedings.
 On the other hand, newly appointe7 Attorney General Lozano has asked the
 Chamber of Deputies to strip congressional immunity from two PRI Federal Depu-
 ties so that the special prosecutor for electoral crimes may prosecute them for elec-
 toral offenses. This is the first time an Attorney General has made such a request
 in connection with electoral crimes.
 One of the continuing major obstacles to election reform is the deeply entrenched
 antidemocratic tradition of unchecked power exercised by local bosses ("caciques')
 over peasants in rural areas. These bosses often exercise control over virtually every
 aspect of peasants' lives, including how they vote. One NGO that studied the results
 of the August 21 elections in a remote district found that there were 30 percent
 more votes for the PRI in polling planes where no independent observers were
 present.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the CNDH is the official human rights ombudsman of the Government,
 it is nominally independent of government control. It has been very vocal and active
 in many cases, but ineffectual in others, most notably the problems in Chiapas.
 NGO representatives charge that in addition to the obvious problem of lack of any
 enforcement authority, the CNDH lacks autonomy and has become too large and bu-
 reaucratic. They also criticize the state commissions for being ineffectual. In the
 Chiatas conflict, NGO's contended that PGR and CNDH activities were frequently
 inadequate and even negligent, and that the PGR in particular was more interested
 in protecting the army's reputation than in conducting independent and thorough
 investigations of alleged military abuses.
 In the wake of the Chiapas uprising, numerous international NGO's visited Mex-
 ico to investigate allegations of human rights violations. While some of these organi-
 zations complained about government limits placed on access to conflict areas, the
 situation steadily improved. In April one Mexican NGO complained that the mili-
 tary Attorney General's office had asked it to answer questions regarding the fac-
 tual basis for the group's assertions regarding a human rights case against the
 army. It also asked for details on the group's activities in Chiapas and when the
 organization intended to leave the state.
 Upon publication of the CNDH annual report in June, the Commission's president
 highlighted the problems of government inaction on more than half the Commis-
 sion's recommendations, of state governors not supporting state commissions, and
 "severe financial problems." In particular, the CNDH cited 103 recommendations
 which authorities had been "negligent" in implementing. Then President Salinas
 publicly called for implementation. By the end of July, the CNDH reported that
 enough progress had been made in 70 of the 103 recommendations (20 by fun imple-
 mentation) that it no longer considered the authorities as negligent.
 In July military authorities prevented 20 members of an international human
 rights delegation from traveling to the Chiapas community of Morelia. An immigra-
 tion afficial at the scene stated that his superiors had declared the community off-
 limits to foreigners.
 The National Network of Civil Organizations for Human Rights reported 86 inci-
 dents of harassment of human rights advocates from April to July, including 10 de-
 tentions and 20 cases of illegal search. Military forces conducted searches beyond
 their authority and police conducted searches without warrants. The report specifi-
 cally implicated authorities in many, but not all, of the 86 cases. Many NGO's work-
 ingn camaig reform issues reported receiving death threats.
 fense Minister Antonio Riviello imprisoned Gen. Jose Francisco Gallardo
 Rodriguez in November 1993 on a range of charges, including embezzlement and
 dishonoring the military. The embezzlement charges, which Gallardo claims were
 abandoned for lack of evidence, date back 5 years. Gallardo maintains that military
 authorities are persecuting him because of an academic dissertation calling for the
 establishment of a military human rights ombudsman's office. The authorities con-
 tinued to hold Gallardo under extraordinary security.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that men and women are equal before the law. It also pro-
 vides that education should sustain the ideals of "fraternity and equal rights of all
 mankind, avoiding privileges of race, sects, groups, sexes, or individuals.'
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equality between the sexes, nei-
 ther the authorities nor society in general respect this in practice. The most serious
 
 
 452
 
 violation of women's rights involves domestic and sexual violence, which is believed
 to be widespread and underreported. Domestic assault is a crime but in 10 states
 the "right to correct" wife and children is not a crime unless this abuse involves cru-
 elty or unnecessary frequency. Women are reluctant to report abuse or file charges
 and even when notified, the police are reluctant to intervene in what is considered
 a domestic matter.
 The Attorney General's Office operates rape crisis centers located in the Federal
 District and the states of Mexico, Queretaro, and Baja California. Few women, how-
 ever, avail themselves of the centers' services. In 1993 only 3,400 approached the
 Mexico City center, the city has a female population of at least 10 million.
 The legal treatment of women's rights is uneven. Women have the right to own
 property in their own names, and to file for separation and divorce. However, in
 some states a woman may not bring suit to establish paternity and thereby obtain
 child support, unless the child was a product of rape or cohabitation, the child re-
 sides with the father, or there is written proof of paternity.
 The Labor Code provides that women shall have the same rights and the same
 obligations as men, and that "equal pay shall be given for equal work performed
 in equal posts, hours of work and conditions of efficiency." According to a 1994
 CNDH study employers frequently required women to certify that they were not
 pregnant at te time of hiring.
 The CNDH study also found that the largest number of complaints received in-
 volved negligence or abuse during childbirth by medical personnel and charges of
 forced sterilizations. The study noted that most sterilizations occurred in public hos-
 pitals when the patients were poor, illiterate, and not informed of the consequences
 of the medical procedure. The CNDH recommended that medical administrators
 train their staff to be more aware when dealing with such patients.
 Children.-There is no societal pattern of abuse against children, but children's
 advocates report many cases of such abuse. Children under the age of 18 make up
 40 percent of the population. An estimated 12,000 live on the streets, many having
 left or been driven from their homes by alcoholic or drug-addicted parents. The chil-
 dren themselves often become involved with alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and petty
 thievery. While the Government and NGO's conduct a number of programs for
 street children, the problem is exacerbated by corrupt police who pressure street
 children to commit petty crimes and extort the profits from them. The CNDH has
 a program for protection of children's rights whlich includes educating children on
 their rights and reviewing legislation to ensure compliance with international con-
 ventions on children's riits.
 Indigenous People.-he indigenous population has long been the object of dis-
 criminatory treatment, which contributed to the social inequities in Chiapas that led
 to the January rebellion. That uprising focused unprecedented interest on the de-
 mands of Indians in that state for increased economic and social rights. As peace
 talks developed, it was clear that the EZLN's basic demands included that the Gov-
 ernment enact measures to protect indigenous cultures, establish self-governing au-
 tonomous regions in indigenous areas, and provide more opportunity for employ-
 ment in indigenous areas. Although the peace talks stalled, the Government ap-
 peared willing to consider these demands, not only for the Indians of Chiapas but
 for all of Mexico's indigenous groups. In December the Zedillo administration initi-
 ated a program to implement land reform laws in Chiapas and targeted tens of
 thousands of hectares for distribution to peasants.
 The Government, through the INI and the CNDH, operates programs to educate
 indigenous groups, many of members of which do not speak Spanish, about their
 political and human rights, and it generally professes respect for their desire to re-
 tan elements of their traditional lifestyle. The CNDH received 137 complaints from
 indigenous people. At year's end, it had resolved 73 complaints and 64 were pend-
 in  me 131 NGO's in Mexico are dedicated to the promotion and protection of indig-
 enous rights. Indigenous people do not live on independently governed reservations,
 although some indigenous communities exercise considerable local control over eco-
 nomic and social issues. These communities apply traditional law to resolve a vari-
 ety of disputes, including allegations of crimes. However, these groups remain large-
 ly outside the country's political and economic mainstream, a result of longstanding
 patterns of economic and social development, and in many cases their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and the allocation of
 natural resources is negligible.
 The 1992 reforms in agrarian law were expected to promote economic develop-
 ment in the countryside, but indigenous groups generally perceived the reforms as
 intended to break up indigenous commual lan    oldings and prevent the groups
 from obtaining title to new lands. As noted earlier, despite the 1991 amendment to
 
 
 453
 the Federal law which requires an interpreter to be present at every stage of crimi-
 nal proceedings, the courts continued to try and sentence indigenous people without
 the benefit of interpreters. Knowledge of the Spanish language is essential to work
 outside indigenous areas, and non-Spanish speaers are frequently taken advantage
 of in commercial transactions involving bilingal middlemen.
 Although the law provides some protections for the indigenous, and the Govern-
 ment provides Indian communities support through social and economic assistance
 programs, the legal guarantees and social welfare programs are not sufficient to pro-
 vide the Indians thebasic support and standards they expect.
 Religious Minorities.-In the wake of the Chiapas conflict, several Catholic lead-
 ers and groups accused of inciting the EZLN armed uprising received death threats.
 San Cristobal city officials reportedly orchestrated an effort in concert with other
 prominent figures to have the Bishop, considered by many observers as sympathetic
 to the EZLN, removed from office and expelled. In the Chiapas town of Altainirano,
 town leaders and other citizens accused Catholic nuns operating a clinic of being
 EZLN supporters and subjected them to intimidation designed to make them leave
 the community. Military and civil police authorities allegedly allowed the intimida-
 tion to proceed. The    H is investigating both cases.
 The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) complained that the Government selectively
 leaked documents alleging Jesuit ties to the Chiapas uprising and other armed
 movements. For example, a Mexico City daily published what it said was informa-
 tion  from   Mexican   intelligence  authorities  claiming  that  EZLN    leader
 Subcomandante Marcos was a Jesuit priest. The story was quickly proven untrue,
 but the Attorney General's Office declined to prosecute the newspaper for libel. The
 Government also rejected the Jesuits' request that it issue statements correcting
 this and other media stories linking the order to the EZLN. The Jesuits also com-
 plained about unauthorized raids on Jesuit facilities in Veracruz Chiapas, and
 Guererro. In the Guererro case, 6 heavily armed intruders allegedly broke into a
 retreat house and held priests, lay workers, and 20 novices hostage while they cut
 phone lines, ransacked the premises, and took away documents. The local police re-
 fused to investigate unless the Jesuits could identify the individuals who took part
 in the raids. The Jesuits also received numerous bomb and death threats; in one
 instance the caller ominously alluded to the 1991 mass murder of Jesuits in El Sal-
 vador.
 In the highlands of Chiapas and other indigenous areas, elected officials some-
 times acquiesced in or actually ordered the expulsions of Protestants belonging pri-
 marily to evangelical groups. n many cases the expulsions involved the burning of
 homes and crops, beatings, and, occasionally, killings. The most significant example
 of religious expulsions occurred in San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, where authorities
 expelled an estimated 15,000 evangelicals over the past 20 years.
 nAugat state authorities and the CNDH worked out an agreement for about
 500 evangelicals to return to San Juan Chamula. An earlier attempt to return to
 the community at the beginning of the year was unsuccessful, as the residents beat
 the returnees and drove them out of town. The evangelicals later retaliated by hold-
 ing the town mayor hostage; one person was killed when the mayor was rescued.
 In October a mob murdered three evangelical returnees. The authorities imme-
 diately arrested four suspects but later released them. Both sides are armed, and
 state officials and human rights groups continued to monitor the situation at year's
 end.
 People With Disabilities.-The law requires access for handicapped persons to
 public facilities in Mexico City but not elsewhere in Mexico. In practice, however,
 most public buildings and facilities do not comply with the law. Special education
 programs for people with disabilities are not widely available.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Federal Labor Law (FLL) pro-
 vide workers the right to form and join trade unions of their choice. About 30 per-
 cent of the total work force is organized, which implies an effective unionization rate
 nearly twice that high, since only about half the work force is employed in the for-
 mal private or public sector, accessible to union organization.
 No prior approval is needed to form unions, but they must register with federal
 or state labor authorities to obtain legal status to function effectively. Registration
 requirements are not onerous. There are credible allegations, however, that federal
 or state labor authorities occasionally withhold or delay registration of unions hos-
 tile to government policies, employers, or established unions, or register extortion-
 ists or labor racketeers falsely claiming to represent workers. To remedy this latter
 problem, Labor Secretariat (STPS) officials require evidence that unions are genuine
 and representative before registering them.
 
 
 454
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) found
 that certain restrictions in federal employee labor law, a separate section of the
 Constitution and FLL, violate freedom of association. At the request of federal em-
 ployee unions, the law allows only one union per jurisdiction and forbids reelection
 of union officials-provisions acceptable in union statutes but not in law. The COE
 welcomed the fact that privatization of most banks ended these legal restrictions on
 their unions.
 Mexican unions form federations and confederations freely without government
 approval. Most belong to such bodies. They, too, must register to get legal status.
 Questionable delays occur occasionally but none were reported in 1994.
 The largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM)
 organizationally part of the ruling PRL. CTM's major rival centrals and nearly a
 the 84 smaller confederations, federations, and unions in the Labor Congress (CT)
 are also allied with the ruling PRL However, the teachers' union, a large CT affili-
 ate, severed its ties to the  Ito free its factions to cooperate openly with other
 parties. Rivalries within and between PRI-allied centrals are strong. There also are
 a few small labor federations and independent unions outside the CT which are not
 allied to the PRI.
 Unions are free to affiliate with, and are often active in, trade union
 internationals.
 Union officers help select, run as and campaign for, PRI candidates in federal
 and state elections, and support PRI government policies at crucial moments. This
 gives the unions considerable influence on government policies, but limits their free-
 dom of action to defend member interests in other ways, particularly when this
 might threaten the Government or the PRI. After the 1991 federal elections, the
 rportion of CT Senators and deputies fell to under 10 percent, but in 1994 the
 C and especially the CTM, regained some lost congressional nominations, and
 nearly all labor candidates won handily.
 The Constitution and FLL provide for the right to strike. The law requires 6 to
 10 days' advance strike notice, followed by brief government mediation. If federal
 or state authorities rule a strike "nonexistent" or illicit," employees must remain
 at work, return to work within 24 hours, or face dismissal. If they rule the strike
 legal, the company or unit must shut down totally, management officials may not
 enter the premises until the strike is over, and the company may not hire striker
 replacements. The law permits public sector strikes, but they are rare. Provisions
 for maintaining essential services are not onerous.
 Most strike notices precede successful collective bargaining and are never imple-
 mented. During 1993, 7,200 strike notices were filed with federal labor boards, and
 148 legal strikes occurred. The authorities ruled only two nonexistent and none il-
 licit; two were withdrawn, they transferred 309 to state boards (not federal jurisdic-
 tion), and put 702 on file awaiting further information.
 There were credible allegations that federal or state labor authorities occasionally
 stretch legal requirements to rule strikes nonexistent or illicit, or use delays to pre-
 vent damaging strikes and force settlements, but there was not a consistent pattern.
 The Constitution and FLL protect labor organizations from government interference
 in their internal affairs, including strike decisions, which can also protect undemo-
 cratic or corrupt union leaders. The law permits closed shop and exclusion clauses,
 allowing union leaders to vet and veto new hires and force dismissal of anyone the
 union expels. Such clauses are common in collective bargaining agreements.
 Employer organizations have pushed for labor law reform which would limit union
 leaders' powers, but unions have successfully resisted. However, the Government
 has induced de facto reform through tripartite national pacts (see below) and collec-
 tive bargaining at the enterprise level.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and FLL
 strongly uphold the right to organize and bargain collectively. Interest by a few em-
 ployees, or a union strike notice, compels an employer to recognize a union and ne-
 gotiate, or ask the federal or state labor board to hold a union recognition election.
 FLL pro-union provisions lead some employers to seek out independent, "white," or
 company unions as an alternative to mainstream national or local unions. Represen-
 tation elections are traditionally open, not secret. Management and union officials
 are present with the presiding labor board official when each worker openly declares
 his or her vote. Such open "recounts" are prevailing practice, but not required by
 law or regulation. Secret ballots are held when all parties agree.
 Annual national pacts negotiated by the Government and major trade union, em-
 ployer, and rural organizations have voluntarily limited free collective bargaining
 for the past decade. These pacts were intended to stop inflation and to support the
 Government's free market economic reforms and structural adjustment policies. The
 mainstream labor organizations reluctantly accepted drastic reductions in members'
 
 
 455
 real incomes in the late 1980's, although these regained some lost ground over the
 last 5 years.
 The record in internal union democracy and transparency is mixed. Some unions
 are democratic, but corruption or authoritarian and strong-arm tactics are common
 in others. In 1994 dissidents protested, alleging such practices in four of Mexico's
 strongest unions. For example, they alleged fraud when the railroad union an inde-
 pendent CT member, elected officers in October by secret ballot, although these alle-
 gations appeared unsubstantiated. Three of the strongest national CTM unions--pe-
 troleum, electric, and sugar workers-have dissident movements which accused
 leaders of undemocratic or strong-arm tactics. Electric union dissidents succeeded
 in pressuring the leadership into giving them several regional leadership psts.
 The public sector is almost totaly organized. Industrial areas are heavily orga-
 nized, but states with little industry often have few unions. The law protects work-
 ers from antiunion discrimination, but enforcement is uneven, especially in states
 with low unionization.
 Unionization and wage levels in the in-bond export sector vary by area, but, espe-
 cially in the west are lower than in most other industries. Some observers allege
 poor working conditions, inadequate wages, and employer and government efforts to
 suppress unionization. There is no evidence the Feeral Government opposes union-
 ization of these plants, which tend to be under state jurisdiction, but some state and
 local governments, as well as some employers, are known to discourage unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. There have been no credible reports of forced labor for many years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law bans child labor and sets
 the minimum legal work age at 14. Although the activities of those aged 14 and 15
 are so restricted as to be uneconomic (no night or hazardous work, limited hours),
 the ILO reported that 18 percent of children aged 12 to 14 work, often for parents
 or relatives. Enforcement is reasonably good at large and medium-sized companies,
 especially in eprt industries and those under federal jurisdiction. Enforcement is
 inadequate at the  ny small companies and in agriculture. It is nearly absent in
 the informal sector, despita government efforts. Most child labor is in the informal
 sector (including myriad unerage street vendors), agriculture, and in rural areas.
 The Government increased obligatory school years from 6 to 9 in 1992 and made
 parents legally liable for their children's attendance, as part of a reform to upgrade
 Mdexican labor force skills and long-term efforts to continue increasing educational
 opportunities for youth.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the FLL provide for a
 daily minimum wage. The tripartite national minimum wage commission (govern-
 ment, labor, employers), sets miinimum wage rates each Deemnber, effective January
 1. On January 2, 1995, after the year-nd exchange rate crisis and peso float, the
 1995 minimum daily wage in Mexico City and nearby industrial areas, Acapulco,
 southeast Veracruz states refning and petrochemical zone and most border areas,
 was $3.27 (16.34 new pesos). Minimum wage earners are actually paid $3.70 (18.48
 new pesos) by their employers due to a supplemental 14 percent fiscal subsidy (neg-
 ative income tax or tax credit), which employers then subtract from their own taxes.
 These income supplements to the minimum wage, agreed in the annual tripartite
 pacts, are for all income less than four times the minimum wage, decreasing as
 wages and benefits rise. In Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other advanced industri-
 alized areas, the 1995 minimum daily wage (before the fiscal subsidy) was $3.04
 (15.18 new pesos). In other areas, it was $2.76 (13.79 new pesos).
 There are higher minimums for some occupations, such as building trades. Few
 workers (12 percent, including most waiters and hotel workers, who depend on tips)
 earn only the minimum wage. Industrial workers average three to four times the
 minimum wage, earning more at bigger, more advanced, and prosperous enterprises.
 The 1995 minimum daily wage in pesos was increased by 7 percent (4 percent for
 frojected inflation and 3 percent for productivity), plus a 3-percent increase in the
 isc'al subsi y-a 10-percent total increase. The 1995 minimum daily wage is for the
 whole year, but inflation projections have been revised upward and any of the three
 parties can ask that the board reconvene during the year to consider a changed situ-
 ation, although labor and employers agreed not to do so during the first months of
 1995. On January 3, 1995, labor, employers, and the Government agreed to estab-
 lish a committee to study further tax changes.
 The law and contract arrangements provide workers extensive additional benefits.
 all required benefits include individual retirement accounts, social security
 (IT coverage, individual worker housing accounts, substantial Christmas bo-
 nuses, paid vacations, and profit-sharing. Employer costs for these benefits run from
 about 27 percent of payroll at marginal enterprises to over 100 percent at major
 firms with generous union contracts.
 
 
 456
 The FLL sets 48 hours as the legal workweek. Workers asked to exceed 3 hours
 of overtime per day or work overtime on 3 consecutive days must be paid triple the
 normal wage. For most industrial workers, especially under union contract, the true
 workweek is 42 hours, although they are paid for 6 full days. This is why unions
 jealously defend the legal ban on hourly wages.
 The law requires employers to observe occupational safety and health regulations
 issued jointly by STPS and IMSS, and pay contributions which vary according to
 their workplace safety and health experience ratings. FLL-mandated joint (manage-
 ment and labor) committees set standards and are responsible for workplace en-
 forcement in plants and offices. These meet at least monthly to consider workplace
 needs and ifie copies of their minutes with federal labor inspectors, who assumed
 jurisdiction for all such inspections in 1987, supplanting state inspectors and
 strengthening inspection considerably. The inspectors schedule visits largely in re-
 sponse to these workplace committees.
 Individual employees or unions may also complain directly to inspectors or safety
 and health officials. Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without jeopardizing their employment. Plaintiffs may bring complaints before the
 Federal Labor Board at no cost to themselves.
 STPS and IMSS officials report compliance is reasonably good at most large com-
 panies. Federal inspectors are stretched too thinly for effective enforcement if com-
 panies do not comply voluntarily and fulfill their legal obligation to train workers
 in occupational health and safety matters. There are special problems in construc-
 tion, where unskilled, untrained, poorly-educated, transient labor is common, espe-
 cially at many small sites and companies. Many unions, particularly in construction,
 are not organized effectively to provide training and to encourage members to work
 safely and healthily, to participate in the joint committees, and to insist on their
 rights.
