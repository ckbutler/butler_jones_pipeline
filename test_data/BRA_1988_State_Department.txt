 BRAZIL
 In November 1989, Brazil will hold its first direct
 presidential election since 1960. The country returned to
 democratic rule in 1985, after 21 years of military-dominated
 government. A new Congress was freely elected in November
 1986, with the participation of 30 political parties. The
 Congress, functioning as a Constituent Assembly, drafted a new
 Constitution which was promulgated on October 5, 1988, and
 which substantially broadens the protection of individual and
 collective rights, especially in the labor area. Application
 of certain of the new constitutional provisions must await the
 approval of implementing legislation, which should be
 formulated in 1989 and 1990.
 Internal security is provided by the military as well as by
 federal, state, and local police. The armed forces have
 increasingly focused on possible external threats, but
 nevertheless are also employed internally in the event of a
 threat to public order or to protect critical industrial
 installations during strikes and emergency situations.
 In 1987 Brazil's gross domestic product grew by 2.9 percent in
 real terms, but 1988 is likely to show no growth as
 "stagflation" persists. Brazil has the eighth largest economy
 outside of the Communist bloc and also the largest foreign
 debt in the developing world--over $120 billion. In September
 1988, President Sarney announced the'formal end of a
 unilateral moratorium the Government had placed on most of its
 debt service to foreign commercial banks. The agreement on a
 long-term rescheduling plan for the servicing of past debt
 eased pressures on Brazil's balance of payments and reserves.
 Brazil's new Constitution has introduced a series of
 innovations which will increase significantly the ability of
 Brazilians to claim their guaranteed rights before Brazilian
 courts and ensure the protection of human rights in Brazil.
 One important innovation is the "Writ of Injunction," which
 can be filed in court to request enforcement of a
 constitutional provision which has not yet been implemented by
 legislation.
 Major human rights concerns in Brazil include the treatment of
 Indians and peasants involved in land disputes and the
 handling of common criminals. Reported killings of peasants
 and union organizers involved in land disputes declined in
 number in 1988 compared to the previous year but still remain
 a serious problem. Common criminals in the custody of police
 are frequently beaten and some criminals not in custody are
 killed anonymously. More Brazilian Indians were killed in
 violent incidents in the past 2 years than in the previous
 decade, while the rapid growth of prospecting activity has
 reportedly led to the deaths of hundreds of Indians, killed by
 mercury poisoning and epidemics of infectious diseases.
 The new Constitution establishes additional rights and legal
 protections for Brazil's Indians, who now have full legal
 standing in the courts for the first time in Brazilian history.

 BRAZIL
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings are rare, but several hundred
 Brazilians died in 1988 at the hands of vigilante groups or in
 bitter land conflicts. Brazilian human rights organizations
 charge that off-duty policemen often kill persons suspected of
 common crimes. It is commonly believed that many of the
 several hundred criminals killed annually in confrontations
 with police actually are killed after capture. The alarming
 rate of violent crime in such major cities as Rio de Janeiro
 and Sao Paulo has led to a high degree of public acquiescence
 in police brutality against criminal suspects. Resources
 devoted by local and state governments continue to be
 insufficient to combat the problem.
 Conflicts between rural landholders and the landless continued
 in 1988. Most of the hundreds of persons killed in such
 conflicts were rural laborers or squatters involved in land
 disputes in the northeast and the interior. In a few
 well-publicized cases, the victims were officials of the
 National Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG) or
 lawyers or clergy involved in helping to organize agricultural
 worker unions. "Invasions" of vacant land by landless
 agricultural workers were not as common in 1988 as in previous
 years, perhaps leading to the result that fewer than half as
 many killings of rural laborers and union organizers occurred
 in 1988 as in 1987. Nevertheless, CONTAG officials are
 concerned that growing assertiveness by rural workers will
 lead to further violence.  They say that confrontations have
 become more frequent in Pernambuco, the northeastern state in
 which rural unions are best organized and most active.
 In 1987 lawyer and labor activist Evandro Cavalcanti was
 murdered in the middle of a town in the interior of Pernambuco,
 allegedly because of his work on behalf of poor farmers. No
 one has yet been arrested in connection with this crime, which
 is widely believed to have been instigated by supporters or
 relatives of important political figures in Pernambuco. Two
 additional murders apparently linked to land usage occurred
 late in 1988: Joao Carlos Batista, a state legislator
 prominent in the land reform movement, was shot at his home in
 Belem on December 6, and Francisco Mendes Filho, a union
 leader known for his efforts to protect the Amazon rain forest
 from unsound exploitation, was shot dead at his home in Acre
 state on December 22. Both cases are under investigation.
 Brazil's rural violence prompted complaints by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),
 which blamed "professional murderers hired by landowners" for
 the assassination of CONTAG leaders and members. In recent
 years, less than 10 percent of the dead have been landholders,
 although in 1988 there seems to have been an increase in the
 number of hired gunmen (working for landowners) who themselves
 have been killed. Frequent death threats and beatings of
 squatters and organizers contributed further to raising
 tensions in the affected areas. Federal and state authorities
 have expressed serious concern over the violence, but the
 national Government asserts that it does not have the legal
 authority to intervene unless asked to do so by a state
 government.
 
 
 471
 BRAZIL
 Brazilian human rights organizations charge that federal,
 state, and local authorities have failed to take legal action
 against those who are responsible for such killings. These
 human rights groups charge that police often fail to conduct
 complete investigations, and frequently even cooperate with
 either the hired gunmen themselves or their employers.
 In a 1988 report entitled "Brazil: Authorized Violence in
 Rural Areas," Amnesty International (Al) asserted that despite
 "notorious, widespread and persistent" killings, "the
 Brazilian Government has failed at every level to take
 effective measures to stop them." AI said it is concerned by
 "allegations that full and impartial investigations by the
 competent authorities into such killings are not being carried
 out and that this failing may amount to acquiescence in the
 crimes," and that "official failure to conduct criminal
 prosecutions for such crimes is so persistent that it
 facilitates fresh killings and may amount to deliberate
 permissiveness towards them." Finally, AI charged that "those
 responsible for killings, threats and other brutal acts of
 intimidation against the rural poor enjoy de facto immunity
 from prosecution, which encourages further killings and
 violence."
 Several persons were prosecuted in 1988 for killings
 associated with land conflicts.  In Alagoa Grande, Paraiba
 state, Antonio Carlos Courtinho Regis was tried and acquitted
 by a jury of being one of the persons who ordered the August
 1983 killing of rural labor activist Margarida Maria Alves,
 president of a rural workers' union. It was the first time in
 memory that one of the persons accused of hiring the killers
 was brought to trial, rather than just the hired gunmen.
 Members of the Human Rights Center of the Archdiocese of Joao
 Pessoa, Paraiba state, reported that the judge presided in a
 fair and unbiased manner, noting that the trial in itself was
 at least a partial victory. Human rights groups attributed
 the acquittal to the fear felt by members of the jury sitting
 in a small town regarding the consequences they would suffer
 if they voted to convict a member of an important family.
 In Imperatriz, Maranhao state, one of the hired killers of
 Padre Josimo Tavares, a cleric active with rural labor and
 agrarian reform groups, was convicted and received a sentence
 of 17 years. None of those alleged to have been behind the
 killing has been indicted or tried. In Recife, the murder
 case of Padre Antonio Henrique Pereira Neto was reopened for
 the fifth time in 19 years. Padre Henrique, who coordinated
 the Pastoral for Youth for Archbishop Dom Helder Camara, was
 barbarously murdered in May 1969, supposedly by members of the
 Communist Hunters Command (CCC), which he had publicly
 denounced. No one was ever convicted, but in May 1988 the
 State Prosecutor reopened the case and sought indictments
 against five former policemen.
 In Rio de Janeiro and other major urban centers, there is a
 growing homicide problem. While many of the murders result
 from narcotics gang wars, there are also widespread killings
 of alleged or suspected criminals by unidentified vigilante
 groups which seem to operate with impunity. Hundreds of such
 deaths occurred in 1988; often the corpses showed signs of
 torture or brutality. Most of the killings occur in the
 poorer neighborhoods amd are cited by some as the actions of
 hired thugs, often employed by shopkeepers who have either
 been robbed or are taking preventive action. This was noted
 as a major problem by AI and by most human rights groups in
 
 
 BRAZIL
 Sao Paulo and other cities. Human rights activists allege
 that the current state administration in Sao Paulo is less
 concerned about these abuses than the previous administration.
 Investigations into these incidents are hampered because
 witnesses hesitate to cooperate with authorities for fear of
 reprisals. Alleged informal links of these groups to elements
 within the police make the problem even more difficult.
 In Rio de Janeiro, there are indications that the situation
 with regard to vigilante group activities has improved
 somewhat since the appointment in September 1987 of a new
 State Secretary of Civil Police, a former president of the
 State Bar Association and a human rights advocate. There is a
 clear understanding that state law enforcement authorities in
 Rio do not condone such activities. Accused members of
 several vigilante groups have been arrested, and a special
 commission on death squad activities chaired by the Vice
 Governor and possesing police power has been operating since
 July 17, 1987. Of 161 investigations opened by February 1988,
 however, only 25 had been completed, resulting in accusations
 against 8 persons and the seizure of 13 weapons.
 Unsolved murders remain numerous in Rio de Janeiro. The press
 often erroneously lumps together all types of killings in
 certain poorer parts of the Rio metropolitan area, particularly
 the area known as the Baixada Fluminense, as death squad
 killings. In the first 8 months of 1988, for example, 1,248
 persons were murdered in the police precinct which covers the
 Baixada Fluminense area. This compares to a total of 1,874
 for the entire year of 1987, indicating a fairly constant
 homicide rate. One knowledgeable police expert estimates that
 45 percent of these killings represent disputes among
 narcotics gangs, while 20 percent reflect vigilante killings.
 In the Queimados neighborhood of the Baixada, 102 homicides
 occurred during August 1988, 50 of which were attributed by
 police to a specific vigilante group. Eight arrests were made
 by the special state commission, but the accused were later
 released for lack of proof. The Rio de Janeiro State
 Secretary of Civil Police says that a "good number" of the
 victims are between the ages of 15 and 17, and that a study of
 this phenomenon will be sent to the United Nations
 International Children's Emergency Fund.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the new Constitution, which
 strengthens the legal penalties for torture and acquiescence
 in torture. Individuals charged with "hideous" crimes related
 to torture, narcotics trafficking, or terrorism cannot be
 released on bail and cannot benefit from a pardon or amnesty.
 Most Brazilian human rights organizations assert, however,
 that police beatings, and even torture, of poor prisoners and
 landless peasants are widespread and intended to extract
 information, confessions, or money from criminal suspects, and
 sometimes to administer punishment. Human rights groups in
 Rio de Janeiro have noted a reduction in cases of police
 brutality being reported to them, although it is not yet clear
 whether this trend holds true nationwide.
 
 
 473
 BRAZIL
 Police brutality toward suspected criminals appears to be a
 problem throughout Brazil. These abuses apparently continue
 because of a perception by state and local police that their
 supervisors tolerate such behavior. Also, in virtually every
 instance in which police officers have been brought to trial
 for abuse, the prosecution has failed to obtain a conviction.
 Sao Paulo statistics, for example, show that of 35 police.
 officers brought to trial on torture charges during the first
 half of 1987, none has been convicted so far. Human rights
 organizations find little public support for defending the
 rights of alleged criminal offenders. Public criticism of the
 police is directed not at the abuse of persons in detention
 nor at the dismal prison conditions but rather at the lack of
 efficient law enforcement.
 Most prison facilities are poorly maintained and managed.
 Very little prison construction has taken place in Brazil in
 recent years, although some states claim to be planning future
 prison construction. A new maximum security prison was
 inaugurated by Rio de Janeiro state authorities in 1988. The
 transfer of a number of criminal gang leaders to this prison
 resulted in a mass protest hunger strike by these prisoners.
 Human rights groups in Rio de Janeiro consider prison
 conditions to'be a major human rights problem; specific
 complaints include police abuse, limitations on visitation
 rights, and poor food and health conditions. The most serious
 problem, however, may well be that, due to poor administration
 of the penal and justice systems, many prisoners remain in
 prison beyond completion of their sentences.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The new Constitution limits arrests to those caught committing
 a crime, or those arrested by order of a judicial authority.
 In addition, those accused of violating military rules and
 regulations, or of military crimes as defined by law, may be
 arrested. The Constitution provides for.judicial determination
 of the legality of detention, and this provision is respected.
 Legally, a person may not be arbitrarily detained, but the law
 does permit provisional detention in exceptional circumstances
 when ordered by a judge. There have been, however, several
 cases of illegal and incommunicado detention without a
 judicial order, as well as allegations of arbitrary detention
 of squatters during evictions. Detention also may be ordered
 by a court during a police investigation or the prosecution
 phase, if there are sufficient indications that the accused
 might try to escape or interfere with the normal development
 of criminal proceedings, as, for example, when the accused
 might try to influence or harm a witness. Provisional
 detention can be extended until the case comes to trial or
 until a judge rules that reasons for the detention no longer
 exist. Provisional detention in Brazil is used infrequently.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is ensured by law and is
 generally respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges against
 them. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an
 attorney, one must be provided free of charge. In practice,
 however, there are too few public defenders, and private
 attorneys are appointed by courts to represent poor defendants
 
 
 474
 BRAZIL
 where public defenders are unavailable. This system
 contributes to a backlog that can cause delays of months or
 even years. Defendants and their attorneys have the legal
 right to be informed of the evidence on which charges are
 based. Only cases of willful crimes against life are tried by
 jury; all others are tried by a single judge.
 Lynchings of suspected criminals by irate citizens continued
 in 1988, although the phenomenon attracted less press
 attention than it did in 1987. Many lynching victims are
 street muggers caught in the act of committing a crime. Most
 observers agree that such mob lynchings arise from public rage
 against rising crime.
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. The
 Federal judicial system includes courts of first instance and
 appeals courts. The Federal Supreme Court is the highest
 court in Brazil. The states are free to organize their own
 judicial systems, so long as they do not violate basic
 principles in the federal Constitution. Brazil also has a
 system of specialized courts dealing with military, labor,
 elections, and juvenile matters, among others. A system of
 small claims courts has been created by the new Constitution.
 Under the new Constitution, military courts no longer have
 jurisdiction to hear cases against civilians.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion
 into the home, and there have been no reports of such illegal
 entry fox political reasons. However, this right is not
 always respected in practice, and entry into homes without a
 warrant still occurs in searches for criminals.
 The new Constitution provides the right for a person to file a
 "Habeas Data" writ in court, at no financial cost, to obtain
 information about himself which is in the possession of
 Brazilian authorities. This writ may also be used to request
 the correction of incorrect data about the citizen held by the
 Government.
 Although unauthorized wiretaps remain unconstitutional,
 wiretaps are now permitted for purposes of criminal
 investigation and prosecution when authorized by a judicial
 authority in circumstances defined by law. The new
 Constitution also provides that a small rural property on
 which a family lives and works cannot be seized to guarantee
 the payment of debts resulting from its productive activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press is provided for
 in the Constitution. Electronic media broadcasts discuss
 controversial social and political issues. Opposition
 viewpoints are aired freely, and the Government does not
 illegally interfere with the media. Most radio and television
 stations are privately owned, but the Government controls
 licensing authority. Newspapers are also privately owned and
 are vigorous in reporting and commenting on government
 policies and performance. Some media sources privately charge
 that self-censorship is widely exercised by many media
 organizations to avoid offending major governmental
 
 
 BRAZIL
 advertisers and creditors, including Federal, state and local
 governments and government-influenced banks. A public
 assertion of that charge in the Washington Post drew angry
 denials from several Brazilian media leaders.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil. The
 new Constitution has abolished all forms of censorship. Prior
 review of films, plays, and radio and television programming
 is practiced only to determine acceptable viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides-for the right to assemble
 peacefully. Under the new Constitution, permits are no longer
 required for outdoor political or labor meetings; however,
 such assemblies may not disturb another meeting previously
 scheduled for the same place, and prior notification to
 government authorities is required.
 In November 1988, Army troops killed three striking workers at
 the National Steel Company in Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro
 state. Several investigations to determine responsibility
 were still underway at the end of 1988. In another incident,
 4,000 teacherd, who had peacefully assembled in front of the
 Governor's Palace in Parana on August 30 were forcefully
 evicted from the grounds by military.police. Twenty teachers
 were injured in the fray, many allegedly from police
 clubbing. The Teachers' Association of Parana stated it
 intended to sue the Security Secretary and the Governor of
 Parana for the police violence.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. An overwhelming
 majority of Brazilians belong to the Roman Catholic Church,
 which maintains an active sodial and political program with no
 direct government intervention. However, spiritism has many
 adherents, and Protestantism has been expanding in recent
 years. All faiths are free to proselytize, establish places
 of worship, and train clergy. The National Council of
 Brazilian Bishops continues to complain that visas for
 missionaries and other foreign religious personnel are being
 systematically delayed by immigration authorities. In 1987
 and 1988, missionaries of several religious denominations and
 nationalities, including Brazilians, were expelled by the
 Federal Government from the areas in or near Indian
 communities where they had previously lived and worked. Both
 Catholic and Protestant church officials have protested these
 actions as a restriction on religious freedom.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, nor are
 there any restrictions on emigration or return. Brazil admits
 few immigrants, does not formally accept refugees for
 resettlement, and is selective in granting asylum.
 In late 1987 and during 1988, there were complaints in Rio by
 Chilean refugees under the protection of the office of the UN
 High Commissioner for Refugees and the Catholic Church
 (CARITAS) that they were subject to harassment by persons
 
 
 476
 BRAZIL
 acting on behalf of the Chilean Government. In December 1987,
 a number of these refugees invaded the United Nations office
 in Rio de Janeiro seeking to speed up their requests to be
 received in certain European countries and Canada, claiming
 they were not safe from harassment in Rio. In 1988 there were
 two alleged kidnapings and torturings of Chilean exiles in Rio
 by unknown individuals. The second incident resulted in
 denunciations to Federal and state authorities by the Rio Bar
 Association, concerning "infringements of Brazilian
 sovereignty."
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On November 15, 1989, Brazilians will vote for the next
 President of Brazil in the first direct presidential election
 held since 1960. On March 15, 1985, Brazil returned to
 democratic rule with the inauguration of its first civilian
 President in 21 years. Direct mayoral elections were held in
 all state capitals in 1985. National elections were held in
 November 1986 to elect state governors, the Federal Congress,
 and state legislative assemblies. Nationwide municipal
 elections were held in November 1988. As many as 30 parties
 representing a broad political spectrum participated in the
 elections. The direct election of Federal congressmen and
 senators in November 1986 produced a representative Congress.
 Acting also as a Constituent Assembly, it drafted a new
 Constitution which was promulgated on October 5, 1988. State
 governors in Brazil have been elected by direct popular vote
 since 1982, as have all municipal and state officials--and
 most Federal legislators.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian
 citizens age 18 to 70 except military conscripts who may not
 vote. It is voluntary for minors, aged 16 to 17, for the
 illiterate, and for those over age 70. Women have full
 political rights under the Constitution, and they are
 increasingly active in politics and government.
 When the political party which was in opposition to the
 military regime came to power in 1985 through a vote of the
 electoral college, it was viewed as a major test of the
 ability of the citizenry to change their government. Most
 Brazilians believe, however, that the true test of the
 transition to full democracy awaits free popular presidential
 elections scheduled for November 1989. Brazil's transition to
 democracy, beginning with the "political opening" of 1974, has
 been achieved largely through peaceful means under the
 guidance of Brazil's powerful military establishment. The
 armed forces retain significant influence in the Government,
 including Congress, but the military establishment appears to
 be respecting its limited role under the new Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are a number of Brazilian nongovernmental organizations
 which actively investigate allegations of human rights
 violations and often initiate legal proceedings. AI maintains
 offices in Rio and Sao Paulo. None of these organizations
 have formally complained of government interference in their
 activities, although many human rights organizations privately
 complain that government authorities have been unhelpful.
 With the return of democratic government to Brazil, human
 
 
 477
 BRAZIL
 rights groups previously concerned with political repression
 have turned their attention to human rights problems involving
 Indian rights, police mistreatment of suspected criminals,
 poor prison conditions, urban "death squads," and rural
 violence.
 Since 1985 a Federal prosecutor in each state has been
 designated to monitor and assist in identifying human rights
 violations and many states have established their own Councils
 for the Defense of Human Rights. Despite their formal
 establishment, few, if any, of these state human rights
 councils have yet become operational.
 Both Brazilian and foreign human rights organizations assert
 that certain elements of the Federal Government have been
 fairly responsive to human rights investigations, as have a
 few state governments. Most of the state governments, however
 reportedly have put more effort into obstructing human rights
 investigations than assisting them. Federal Justice Minister
 Paulo Brossard responded to the 1988 AI report "Brazil:
 Authorized Violence in Rural Areas" by telling journalists
 that AI is "incompetent." Agrarian Reform Minister Leopoldo
 Bessone, in contrast, described AI as a "respectable"
 organization,*although he refused comment on the report.
 Responding to press reports of the 1987 AI report, President
 Jose Sarney acknowledged that there may be a need for greater
 "penetration of justice" into agricultural regions, but he
 denied the Al charge of government "acquiescence" in rural
 violence.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and
 nationality is unconstitutional, and racial discrimination
 --illegal since 1951--is a crime excludea from bail. Public
 opinion polls, however, show most Brazilians'recognize that
 racial minorities encounter substantial de facto
 discrimination. Nevertheless, no one has ever been convicted
 of racial discrimination, according to the Ministry of
 Culture. The Brazilian legal system does not look at
 intentions, only at "facts." Accused persons have therefore
 found it expedient to deny that their intentions were
 discriminatory, with the result that the suits were dropped.
 The vast majority of the black population is
 disproportionately concentrated in the lowest economic
 stratum, a reflection of history and cultural attitudes.
 The 1988 centennial of Brazil's abolition of slavery focused
 public and official attention on the role of blacks in
 Brazilian society. Contrasting with government and church
 emphasis on themes of racial harmony and equality, however,
 were public protests by militant black groups claiming that
 Brazil's long-heralded "racial democracy" is !a myth." The
 media also focused on the existence of de facto racial
 inequality and discrimination. Such criticism drew on 1980
 Brazilian census data which show that blacks and mulattos
 receive proportionally less income and education than whites.
 Racial discrimination in housing and services has been
 reported.
 Although women constitute one-third of the economically active
 population of-Brazil, they typically earn less than men and
 rarely achieve senior positions in business. The situation in
 education, the professions, the cultural sphere, and
 
 
 478
 BRAZIL
 government service is one of much greater equality. Study and
 action groups on women's rights exist in major cities
 throughout Brazil, and university centers and course work have
 proliferated. Several state women's councils were established
 in 1987 and 1988. Greater concern over the abuse of women has
 led to the establishment of special women's police precincts
 in 11 major cities, the first having been established in Sao
 Paulo in 1985. In its first year, the Sao Paulo Women's
 Precinct attended to 60,000 complaints. By 1988 twenty
 centers for helping abused women had been installed throughout
 the state of Sao Paulo, including one center which registers
 an average of 150 cases of assault and battery against women
 in an average day. There is a high incidence of assault
 against women by husbands and lovers sometimes resulting in
 death and often severe injury, but it has been exceedingly
 difficult for a woman to obtain a conviction in the courts for
 such behavior. Women's rights were also addressed by the
 Constituent Assembly in drafting the new Constitution, which
 prohibits discrimination in employment or salaries based on
 sex, age, race, or marital status. Under the new Constitution,
 all working women are entitled to 120 days of paid maternity
 leave without loss of employment, and women prisoners are
 entitled to be accompanied by their nursing children. In
 reaction to the new Constitution, there have been many reports
 of employers having either dismissed or refused to hire women
 employees of childbearing age.
 The human rights situation of some of Brazil's Indian tribes
 deteriorated substantially in 1988, partly as the result of
 the Federal Government's decisions and actions taken in 1987.
 Following an August 1987 shooting incident in which four
 Yanomami Indians were killed by prospectors, the Federal �
 Government declared that all outsiders would be removed from
 the Yanomami area to protect the Indians. The outsiders who
 were forcibly expelled included anthropologists, missionaries,
 doctors, and nurses, while a large number of prospectors
 remained in the area. By the end of 1988, 16 months later,
 the medical teams still had not yet been allowed back, but the
 flood of prospectors had grown to over 50,000 in an area with
 9,000 Yanomami Indians. The exclusion of all health workers
 was extremely detrimental to the isolated Yanomami, the
 world's largest population of "uncontacted" indigenous people,
 who do not have natural defenses against infectious diseases
 common elsewhere. Indirect evidence suggests that, as a
 direct consequence of the prospector influx, there was a
 substantial increase in the number of Yanomami who died in
 epidemics of infectious diseases in 1988. Mercury poisoning
 also caused serious concern in 1988, due to the extensive use
 of mercury in prospector operations upriver from the Yanomami
 settlements. According to the Committee for the Creation of
 Yanomami Park, it is likely that several hundred Yanomami died
 unnecessarily in 1988 due to the factors described above.
 This would constitute more deaths than the total number of
 killings from rural violence in Brazil in 1987 and 1988
 combined.
 The country's estimated 220,000 Indians have suffered from
 government neglect and from the impact of greater contact with
 non-Indians as Brazil's internal frontier expands. According
 to Indian leaders, several tribes lost half their population
 in the last decade due to disease and other factors associated
 with the colonization of nearby lands. Despite the
 Government's responsibility under the Constitution and the
 1973 Indian Statute to protect the indigenous population,
 Indians continue to receive only minimal assistance. Land
 
 
 479
 BRAZIL
 disputes are getting more violent each year as isolated tribes
 come into increasing conflict with non-Indian settlers. In
 May 1988, for example, 14 Ticuna Indians, including women and
 children, were killed in an incident which a government
 spokesman described as "genocide." Several persons charged
 with the murders are in custody, awaiting trial which is
 expected to begin in 1989. Ticuna leaders allege that police
 authorities have allowed the man who ordered the killings to
 remain free. In September 1988, three persons were convicted
 and sentenced to lengthy prison terms for the 1987 murder of
 three Indians in Minas Gerais state. According to the
 Missionary Indigenous Council (CIMI) of the Catholic Church,
 more Indians have been registered as killed by non-Indians in
 violent incidents in the past 2 years than in the previous
 decade.
 Indian leaders believe the Government has systematically
 ignored their needs. They claim that many state and local
 governments, for example, have refused to pay the salaries of
 Indian teachers in schools where grade school instruction is
 in their native language. Indian leaders charge that the
 Federal Government has systematically used pressure tactics
 and legal subterfuges to avoid the demarcation of traditional
 Indian lands,-required under both the 1973 Indian Statute and
 the new Constitution. Instead, they charge, the Federal
 Government has established national forests which are open to
 economic exploitation by prospectors and others, as well as
 colonization by non-Indians. Indian leaders claim that the
 Federal and state Governments are more concerned about the
 exploitation of mineral and other natural resources than
 attending to the needs and rights of Indians.
 The new Constitution devotes an entire chapter to the rights
 of Indians. It guarantees to the Indians the exclusive use of
 the riches existing in the soil, rivers, and lakes located on
 their lands, including a share of the proceeds from any
 exploitation of water, mineral, or energy resources found on
 Indian lands, as defined by law. Any act which permits the
 occupation or possession of Indian lands by non-Indians, or
 which permits exploration or exploitation of the natural
 resources existing on them (except when there is relevant
 public interest, as defined by law) will be considered null
 and void. The Federal Government has the responsibility to
 demarcate and protect Indian lands. Such lands cannot be
 sold, and Indian rights over them will not expire under any
 statute of limitations. Indian groups cannot be removed from
 their lands except with congressional approval and in cases of
 force majeure, and their immediate return will be guaranteed
 as soon as feasible. Exploration or exploitation of mineral
 resources may take place only with congressional authorization,
 after consultation with the affected communities. A
 significant innovation in the new Constitution is that
 Brazilian Indians, for the first time in Brazilian history,
 now have the authority to bring suits in court to defend their
 rights and interests. In all such suits they will be assisted
 by a public prosecutor.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Brazil's labor code has long provided for representation of
 all Brazilian.workers by unions geographically defined and
 recognized by the state. The law imposed a system of
 "unicidade" (prohibiting the existence of multiple unions of
 
 
 480
 BRAZIL
 the same professional category in the same geographic area),
 which also stipulated that no union's geographical base could
 be smaller than a "municipality." Brazil's newly adopted
 Constitution retains both of these concepts, but it frees
 workers to organize new unions out of old ones without prior
 authorization from government authorities. The new
 Constitution also eliminates powers previously granted to the
 Minister of Labor to "intervene" (i.e.,. depose) a union's
 independently elected representatives and substitute others of
 his own choosing. The new Constitution grants the
 .unrestricted" right to strike to all employees, including
 public servants, although it requires that strikes not
 interrupt "essential services" (to be defined by law). The
 Constitution prohibits interference and intervention in labor
 unions by the Government, but provides that abuse of the right
 to strike will be punished under the law. It also incorporates
 a provision from the Labor Code which prohibits the dismissal
 of employees who are candidates for union leadership positions
 from the date of the registration of candidacy until 1 year
 after the termination of their mandates, if elected, except in
 the case of serious misdeeds, as defined by law.
 Brazilian law does not restrict the ability of Brazilian labor
 groups to affiliate with international labor groups. The two
 major labor federations have adopted similar positions
 regarding international affiliation: their charters mandate
 cooperation with all international labor organizations and
 affiliation with none.
 Agricultural worker unions in some areas have been the targets
 of harrassment and even killings by hired gunmen. National
 leaders of CONTAG charge that state and federal authorities do
 not adequately investigate attacks undertaken against labor
 leaders in rural areas. CONTAG charges that the individuals
 who kill labor leaders in rural areas know that they will
 escape punishment.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is guarahteed by the Constitution, and
 trade unions are legally mandated to represent workers. The
 right to organize and strike extends to the entire Brazilian
 territory, including the Manaus Free Trade Zone and Export
 Processing Zones. Although Brazilian laws do not make any
 provision for a central labor organization, three such groups
 have emerged. They do not have legal standing to represent
 any category of workers and have been created in Brazil as
 nonprofit civil associations.
 Brazil's Government has encouraged labor and management to
 resqlve differences through collective bargaining which, as a
 practice, has become more commonplace. Nevertheless, a system
 of special labor courts continues to exercise normative powers
 with regard to the settlement of labor disputes, thereby
 discouraging direct negotiation. Existing law charges these
 same courts (as well as personnel linked to the Federal Labor
 Ministry) with mediation responsibility in preliminary stages
 of dispute settlement. Arbitration by neutral, professional
 parties, does not take place.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There have been repeated charges that forced labor continues
 to be utilized in Brazil, despite Federal government
 assertions that it is taking steps to halt the practice and
 
 
 481
 BRAZIL
 prosecute the perpetrators. In 1988, as in previous years,
 the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) of the Brazilian Catholic
 Church denounced specific labor contractors in certain
 northeastern and Amazon states for maintaining "slave" work
 forces. The CPT charged that these contractors deducted
 transportation and other inflated expenses from the workers'
 meagre salaries, and employed armed guards to prevent the
 "indebted" workers from leaving the property. According to
 press reports, such cases of "slave labor" typically involve
 the exploitation of vulnerable workers, especially minors or
 migrants. The CPT charges that such "slave" work forces are
 most common deep in the Amazon, where jungle areas are being
 cleared to prepare land for agricultural use. The CPT accuses
 state and Federal authorities of failing to promptly
 investigate reports, public or private, of locations where
 compulsory labor is practiced. In 1987 in Para state,
 according to the CPT, Federal government representatives
 waited several months and finally conducted an "inspection"
 during the rainy season, after all the "slave" laborers had
 been removed.
 State and Federal authorities assert that they fully
 investigate all such reports but their ability to detect and
 prevent such abuses is limited by the remoteness of the areas
 in which the abuse occurs, as well as by the workers'
 justified fear of employer retribution. In recent years, the
 Federal Government has prosecuted several "slave" labor
 contractors in the Amazon region; however, no prosecutions
 occurred in 1988. Under the Labor Code, the Federal
 Government is responsible for investigating and prosecuting
 instances where denunciations of forced or "slave" labor have
 been made.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Fourteen is the minimum working age under the new
 Constitution, except for apprentices, and numerous legal
 restrictions have been approved to protect working minors
 under age 18. Under Brazilian law, permission of parents or
 guardians is legally required for minors to work, and
 provision must be made for them to attend school through the
 primary grades. All minors are barred from night work and
 from work that constitutes a physical strain. Minors are also
 prohibited from employment in unhealthy, dangerous, or morally
 harmful conditions. In practice, however, these laws-do not
 prevent the employment of millions of children and adolescents
 who can be seen working on the streets in every city in
 Brazil. According to Federal government statistics, 34
 percent of all children between the ages of 10 and 14 are
 considered economically active, and 65 percent of Brazilians
 between the ages of 15 and 17 are employed. Many, and perhaps
 most, of these working minors are thought to be working in
 violation of the law, but accurate statistics are not
 available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Organized labor demonstrated growing political strength by
 working for, and achieving, significant reforms in the new
 Constitution. A new workweek limit was set at 44 (down from
 48) hours; the length of the shift in uninterrupted (24-hour)
 operations was defined as 6 hours daily; vacation pay was set
 to be equivalent to at least 1 1/3 times that of normal
 monthly income; paid maternity leave was extended from 90 to
 120 days; the concept of paternity leave was introduced and
 
 
 482
 BRAZIL
 provisionally set at 5 days, pending the approval of
 implementing legislation. The new Constitution also includes
 significant new labor protections for agricultural workers and
 domestic employees. Agricultural workers now enjoy the same
 constitutional protections as urban workers, for the first
 time in recent Brazilian history.
 The new Constitution guarantees to all workers a minimum wage
 "able to satisfy the vital basic necessities of the worker and
 his family." The Constitution also requires thae salaries be
 readjusted periodically to preserve purchasing power. Real
 worker income, however, has fallen short of this mark.
 Official data available for 1986 indicate that some 42 percent
 of those economically active, including minors, earned no more
 than the equivalent of one minimum monthly salary. Periodic
 1988 readjustments notwithstanding, that figure remained under
 $70 (at official rates of exchange) at year's end. According
 to calculations made by a trade union-financed Sao Paulo
 statistical research foundation, 1988 minimum wage rates
 ranged between 15 and 20 percent of the amounts actually
 required to meet the constitutional criteria.
 With regard to health and safety regulations, Brazil appears
 to have a high rate of industrial accidents, but accurate
 statistics on job-related health hazards are not available.
 Unofficial estimates, however, link some 80 percent of social
 security system medical payments to problems resulting from
 workplace conditions. On balance, the new Constitution
 provides an array of protections for workers. Responsibility
 for enforcement of these provisions lies with government and
 judicial authorities. In the past, worker rights have not
 always been vigorously enforced.
