 NIGERIA
 With an estimated population of 80 to 85 million,
 Nigeria is the largest democracy in sub-Saharan
 Africa. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960. Its
 traditions and institutions were influenced by British
 governmental and legal practice. In 1979 Nigeria
 adopted a federal constitution modelled after the
 Constitution of the United States. In accordance with
 the new Constitution a civilian Government, with
 a president and bicameral national assembly, was
 democratically elected and installed in 1979. The
 military voluntarily relinquished political power
 after ruling Nigeria for over 13 years. The new
 civilian Government was originally formed by a formal
 coalition of two parties, but that alliance dissolved,
 and the present Administration endures with the
 formal support of just the National Party of Nigeria.
 Opposition parties operate freely, and members of the
 National Assembly cross party lines to support and
 oppose bills. The press is free, lively, and energetic,
 and usually reflects partisan regional and local
 interests. Reconciliation from the 1966-70 civil war
 appears complete. Former Biafran leader Ojukwu was
 pardoned and returned from exile in 1982.
 Economically Nigeria has a long tradition of free
 wheeling 'traders" from the days when commerce came
 across the desert.; In the 1970's Nigeria's vigorous
 free enterprise system was fuelled by an oil boom,
 but the current oil glut has deflated the economy and
 forced the Government to implement an austerity
 program. While Nigeria has been aided by the oil
 revenues, the country remains very much a devel-
 oping country, with problems of poverty, illiteracy,
 and lack of infrastructure. Because of its energy
 resources, however, Nigeria has promising.long-term
 economic prospects.
 Political and civil rights are respected in Nigeria.
 While there are instances of abuse, they are the acts
 of individuals and are not instigated or condoned by
 the Nigerian or state governments. The Nigerian
 Constitution contains a list of fundamental rights
 which are generally honored. In 1982 Nigeria signed
 and ratified the Organization for African Unity's
 Charter on Human and People's Rights.
 There have been no major changes in the human rights
 situation in Nigeria during 1982.
 The scheduled July-August 1983 elections, and the
 campaigns before them, will be a major test for
 democracy and human rights in Nigeria. The present
 civilian Government was elected and, installed democrati-
 cally, but under the supervision of the predecessor
 military regime. The 1983 elections will be the first
 under full civilian control since the new Constitution
 came into effect.

 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There is no pattern of premeditated political murder
 in Nigeria, and no allegation of complicity by the
 Nigerian authorities in such acts. Deaths sometimes
 occur in instances of rioting and violence which are
 partly political or which take on a political cast
 after beginning, but such incidents are rare and
 usually occur in remote areas. The Nigerian army
 and police are equipped and able to cope with such
 outbreaks of violence. The agency with primary
 responsibility for political internal security, the
 National Security Organization, is competent, disci-
 plined, and has a record of respecting human rights.
 While there has not been any international terrorist
 activity in.Nigeria in 1982, religious riots broke
 out between traditional Muslims and a fanatical
 Muslim sect during the last week in October at
 Maiduguri and Kaduna in northern Nigeria which,
 according to a government announcement, resulted in
 206 deaths. The leader of the sect, Muhammadu
 Marwa, known as the Maitatsine, was killed in riots
 at Kano in 1980. The sect claims that Marwa is the
 true Prophet of Islam and that the name of Mohammed
 should not be mentioned -- a message which is
 provocative to Orthodox Muslims. Its members
 allegedly believe they have a duty to kill those who
 disagree with them and supposedly do not fear death.
 Following restoration of order by the Nigerian
 police, several investigations were conducted
 regarding the causes of the riots. The Nigerian
 Government charged that the sect violated criminal
 laws, and later proscribed the Maitatsine movement
 as an illegal society in Nigeria. The authorities
 noted that freedom of religion and worship is subject
 to public safety, public order, and public morality,
 as well as the rights and freedom of other persons.
 b. Disappearance
 There may have been one case in which a man active in
 politics was kidnapped in 1982, but the circumstances
 have not yet been clarified. Political kidnapping is
 not practiced in Nigeria, and there are no allegations
 that any Nigerian authorities have ever been involved
 in such activity. No prisoners are known to be
 secretly detained by the Nigerian authorities.
 c. Torture
 The Nigerian Constitution specifically prohibits
 torture. The Nigerian Government and authorities do
 not permit or condone torture, and robbers convicted
 of physically abusing their victims are dealt with
 severely. There are indications that some police
 officers mistreat suspects in the course of interro-
 gation, but this is not condoned by their superiors.
 There has been no publicity about disciplining police
 for such abuses.
 
 
 233
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Nigerian Constitution and Government do not permit
 or condone the mistreatment of individuals. However,
 there are some allegations of the mistreatment of
 prisoners in Nigeria's overcrowded and inadequate
 prisons. This has been due to lack of adequate
 funding for prisons -- a situation which is addressed
 In part in Nigeria's FY 1983 budget. Prisoners are
 not given discriminatory treatment according to
 race or religion, but are separated according to the
 nature of their crime. Ironically maximum security
 facilities are sometimes less uncomfortable than
 others in that they are less crowded. The conditions
 in women's prisons are believed to be less severe
 than in men's institutions. Within Nigerian society,
 there are widespread reports of the police and other
 authorities extorting money from the public, usually
 but not always in small amounts. Rarely do these
 Ishakedowns" involve physical abuse, but that
 sometimes happens. Some Nigerians have been wounded
 by police at road checkpoints, and some of these
 woundings probably arose out of extortion efforts.
 Corruption by police officials is a recognized
 widespread and serious problem in Nigeria, and
 one which the Government seeks to eradicate.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no clandestine or preventive detentions in
 Nigeria. Nigerian law is based on British common law,
 and affords the common law protections including habeas
 corpus. By law a suspect cannot be held for more than
 24 hours without being formally charged. This provision
 is generally observed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guarantees of a fair trial within a reasonable time,
 notification of the charges, access to legal counsel,
 and similar protections are provided for in the
 Constitution. Trials in Nigeria are fair and public,
 and the judiciary has a high level of integrity in the
 courts operating under Nigerian law. There is less
 certainty about the treatment accorded individuals
 under some of the "customary law" procedures based
 usually in the countryside on Islamic or tribal
 traditions, but even in those courts the individual
 has recourse to the Nigerian law courts to appeal any
 injustice. There were no reports in 1982 of any
 incidents of harassment of the judiciary or defense
 counsel by the Nigerian authorities, and judges are
 able to render decisions unpopular with the Government.
 For example, the courts found in favor of an opposition
 politician in a major case in which the Government
 sought to deport him as an alien. Civilians are not
 tried by military courts, nor are there any special
 courts to deal with political or security cases.
 Counsel for the indigent is provided by the Government
 in capital cases. For other cases there is a legal
 aid society, but its resources and activities are very
 limited.
 
 
 234
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees "the privacy of citizens,
 their homes, correspondence, telephone conversations,
 and telegraphic communications...". Judicial warrants
 issued by a magistrate are required for the authorities
 to enter a home without the permission of the inhabitants.
 There have been no reported instances of forced entry,
 violations of the home, or wiretapping during the past,
 year.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and
 the press, and there is no censorship in Nigeria.
 There is an extensive and energetic press, spread
 throughout the country. Some of the newspapers and
 magazines are owned by the federal and state governments,
 but they and the privately-owned papers and publications
 are free to criticize the Government and do so. All
 TV and radio broadcast organizations are owned by
 the federal and state governments and they also report
 stories unfavorable to the governments, but in a more
 restrained style than the free-wheeling press.
 Academic freedom exists in Nigeria in the British
 academic tradition, and there is no censorship of
 domestic or foreign books and artistic works.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights to peaceful assembly are guaranteed by the
 Constitution. There is no indication of government har-
 assment of professionals or labor groups. Trade unions
 and professional associations operate freely, and the unions
 enjoy full rights to organize and bargain collectively. In
 theory workers in essential service industries are prohib-
 ited from striking, but in practice all unions seem free to
 resort to work stoppages and slowdowns in industrial disputes.
 About 10 percent of the work force is unionized in the
 country's 42 national unions, which were grouped by the
 previous military government into one central labor or-
 ganization, the Nigeria Labor Congress. The Congress is
 precluded from joining with any political party, and at
 present the labor movement stays out of Nigerian politics.
 Internationally the Nigeria Labor Congress belongs to the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Nigeria be-
 longs to the International Labor Organization, but the
 Congress is not at present allowed to join the World
 Federation of Trade Unions or International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions on the grounds that the military
 government and its successor civilian government have
 wanted to keep the Nigerian labor movement free of East-
 West competition. However, various unions have informal
 "fraternal" contacts outside Africa, and the World Federation
 of Trade Unions has awarded scholarships to Nigerian
 trade unionists for training abroad. The present Nigeria
 Labor Congress leadership is dominated by leaders
 with World Federation sympathies, and there has been
 an effort to obtain legislation or a legal interpretation
 to permit a second, international labor center.
 
 
 235
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population of Nigeria is estimated to be 47
 percent Moslem and 34 percent Christian, the rest
 being adherents of local religions. The Constitution
 precludes a state religion and guarantees freedom of
 thought, conscience, and religion, including freedom
 to change belief. Nigerians are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. No religious groups are
 discriminated against or favored. There are no
 restrictions on religious practice, ceremony, or
 teaching, although some traditional secret societies
 are banned. There is considerable harmony between
 Christians and Muslims. The worst religious tensions
 in the past year have been between groups within the
 Muslim community, which resulted in some deaths in
 northern Nigeria. A fanatical Muslim sect was proscribed
 by the Government following violent clashes with the
 police in October 1982. (See also Section 1(a) of
 this report).
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement, and
 Nigerians enjoy complete freedom of movement within
 their country. Any Nigerian may live anywhere in the
 country. There is no exit visa requirement for
 foreign travel. Married women, however, generally
 need their husbands' consent to obtain a passport.
 Emigration is unrestricted (except through currency
 controls), and Nigerians residing abroad are welcomed
 back. Citizenship is defined in the Constitution.
 It can only be revoked by due process. There are
 casks in which the authorities ruled that certain
 individuals who considered themselves Nigerians had in
 fact never acquired Nigerian citizenship because of
 parentage, place of birth, or other reasons. Nigeria
 has not historically had to harbor refugees from
 outside Nigeria, but during 1982 it accepted and
 cared for several thousand refugees from war-torn
 Chad. While those refugees are expected to return to
 Chad, the Nigerian Government has not yet put them
 under pressure to leave.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Federal Republic of Nigeria is governed by a
 democratically elected government. In addition to
 the president and vice president, all 95 senators
 and 449 representatives are elected, as are the
 governors and legislators in the nineteen constituent
 states. All legislative bodies include members
 of opposition parties, who participate vigorously in the
 democratic process. On the federal level, the
 ruling National Party of Nigeria lacks a majority in
 the National Assembly, and it is dependent on some
 opposition support to pass legislation. There are
 at present six recognized political parties, and any
 party wishing to contest elections must be registered
 and approved by the Federal Elections Commission.
 To obtain such approval, an applicant party must
 
 
 236
 show support throughout the country. This requirement
 is intended to prevent tribal politics, which have had
 adverse consequences for the nation in the past. However,
 the registration process has been fraught with problems and
 has provoked a number of court actions.
 All citizens 18 years of age or older are allowed and
 encouraged to vote. About 34 percent of registered voters
 participated in the 1979 elections. Opposition groups exist
 openly and the system encourages their active participation.
 Women in Nigeria are entitled to all rights guaranteed under
 the Nigerian Constitution and can challenge any person or
 institution which attempts to interfere with the exercise of
 these rights (See section 4). Under statutory and customary
 law as well as custom, however, they do not enjoy the status
 of men in many areas.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Nigeria has been a leader in efforts to emphasize human
 rights in Africa, and has spoken out about violations in
 other countries. In August a delegation of the Nigerian
 wing of the Inter-Parliamentary Union visited Ghana in
 connection with the human rights situation there. Nigeria
 signed and has ratified the OAU African Charter on Human and
 People's Rights, and expects to play an active role in its
 implementation. There have been no recent requests by an
 international or non-governmental organization to investi-
 gate any human rights problems in Nigeria. Amnesty Inter-
 national maintains an office in Lagos and the Nigerian Bar
 Association has a human rights committee to monitor imple-
 mentation of the human rights provisions of the Consti-
 tution. Amnesty International did not include a section on
 Nigeria in its 1982 Report. Freedom House characterizes
 Nigeria as "Free".
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Nigeria has a free market economy, one in which
 property rights are respected and guaranteed. The
 Government plays a major role in important sectors
 of the economy, but there is also a strong market
 orientation. Many entrepreneurs of modest origins
 have succeeded in business, and some have acquired
 considerable wealth. There are indigenization laws
 which reserve some business areas for Nigerians and
 which require foreign firms to maintain specified
 levels of Nigerian participation.
 The major change in the nation's economic life
 during the past year has been the need to adjust to
 declining oil income. The austerity program set in
 place in April 1982 has forced suspension and
 postponement of some of the Government's ambitious
 economic development programs. While the Government
 does not discriminate and seeks to eliminate economic
 
 
 237
 and social discrimination, there is ethnic and
 religious prejudice in Nigeria's large, diverse, and
 complex population, and those prejudices have
 economic consequences. An unmarried woman who is 21
 or above has the legal capacity to sue and be sued,
 to buy and sell property, to engage in business or a
 profession, and to choose her own residence. However,
 a married woman cannot own property or enter into
 loan or purchase agreements without the consent of
 her husband, nor can she obtain a passport or travel
 outside the country without her husband's consent.
 Further examples of discrimination against women
 include an absence under customary law of rights to
 her husband's property or income, apart from the
 right to support, and limitations on the right of
 divorced women to remarry. There is no law against
 a married woman working but, except in government
 service, there is no guarantee of equal pay for equal
 work. Traditional education for women is limited to
 homemaking skills. No statistics are currently
 available on the degree of participation of women in
 business or the professions, although there are
 significant numbers in law and medicine. Almost all
 marketing in southern Nigeria is controlled'by women,
 who often belong to politically powerful market
 women's associations. Most of the states have at
 least one woman in their houses of assembly and
 cabinets. There are three women in the House of
 Representatives, a cabinet minister, and a minister
 of state. No statistics on numbers of women in civil
 service are available, although they seem to be
 employed generally at lower levels. The federal and
 state governments and women's groups, such as the
 National Council of Women, are actively working on
 women's problems and rights.
 The most visible economic hardship in Nigeria is found in
 the urban slums. Nigeria is experiencing the classic
 developing country movement of people from the rural areas
 to the cities, particularly Lagos, where the inadequate
 infrastructure of water, electricity, housing, etc. has
 been overwhelmed. Poor urban dwellers face high unemploy-
 ment, squalid living conditions, inflationary rising costs,
 and serious crime, but few return to the rural areas.
 The World Bank statistical indicators for Nigeria show
 progress, although imprecise population statistics increase
 the margin for error. For 1981 the World Bank estimates a
 population of 79,526,000, compared to estimates by US
 experts of 85 million, and the 100 million estimate widely
 accepted in Nigeria. According to 1980 figures, life
 expectancy at birth is 48.6 years and infant mortality is
 down to 135.1 per thousand live births (a figure considered
 inaccurately low by rural medical workers). The primary
 school enrollment in World Bank 1977 statistics was 79
 percent, double from a decade earlier. Adult literacy no
 doubt lags, but it probably is higher than the 25 percent
 World Bank figure of 1970. According to 1977 World Bank
 figures, the average Nigerian receives 83 percent of daily
 nutritional requirements, but there is virtually no starva-
 tion in Nigeria and people generally appear adequately fed.
 
 
 238
 Nevertheless, as in most developing societies, there is
 probably considerable malnutrition in Nigeria, although
 difficult to document accurately. The World Bank's estimate
 of 1981 per capita GNP of $1,009 can be misleading as oil
 exports account for so much of the country's current wealth
 and a large part of the rural population is only marginally
 involved in the country's cash economy. Nonetheless,
 whatever Nigeria's actual per capita GNP may be, it is
 clearly well above the African average.
