 ZAIRE
 For over 27 years, President Mobutu Sese Seko has been the dominant force in
 Zairian politics. However, in 1990 his grip on a highly personalized authoritarian
 governmental system began to loosen. In 1992 his power was challenged by the ac-
 tivities of a "sovereign ational Conference comprising 2,800 delegates and chaired
 by the Archbishop of Kisangani, Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya. Mobutu succeeded for
 a time in coopting a faction of the Conference opposition by appointing as Prime
 Minister Nuz a Karl-i-Bond (November 1991-August 1992), the leader of the Union
 of ndependent Republicans (UFERI), who sought to reshape the Conference's ethnic
 and regional configuration. This led to an unresolved dispute between the competing
 forces and the suspension of the Conference between January and April. The Con-
 ference then resumed against the background of a prostrate economy and ethnic and
 military violence, and a compromise was reached by which the Conference extended
 Mobutu's mandate as President for 2 years (his term as President had expired on
 December 4, 1991) and elected the longtime Mobutu opponent, Etienne Tshisekedi
 wa Mulumba, Prime Minister. Tshisekedi is a cohead of the Union for Democracy
 and Social Progress (UDPS).
 In a transitional act, which took account of the compromise, the National Con-
 ference also proposed the election of a High Council of the Republic as Zaire's in-
 terim legislative assembly and paramount political institution. The act provides for
 institutional checks and balances during the transition to a democracy, which Con-
 ference delegates expect will last 2 years. In early December, the National Con-
 ference established the High Council and elected Archbishop Monsengwo its Presi-
 dent shortly before its formal closing. The National Conference scheduled a constitu-
 tional referendum for April 1993 and presidential elections for August 1994. Mean-
 while, President Mobutu contested Prime Minister Tshisekedi's authority by taking
 action which challenged the authority and the accomplishments of the Nationa
 Conference.
 The allegiance of the security forces remained crucial in the evolving political
 struggle. In late July, a restructuring of the chain of command of the national police
 force, the Gendarmerie, and the Civil Guard, brought the last two organizations,
 which are tasked with maintaining law and order, under the titular responsibility
 of the Minister of the Interior instead of the Minister of Defense. Advocated by re-
 form grou s, this transfer of responsibility was seen as a step toward greater civil-
 ian control over the security forces. Nevertheless, General Baramoto Kpama Kpata,
 President Mobutu's brother-in-law, continued to be commander of the Civil Guard,
 which remains loyal to the President. Moreover, President Mobutu's ethnic kins-
 man General Nzimbi Ngbale, still commands the Special Presidential Division
 (DSP). Both the Civil Guard and the DSP were directly implicated in many human
 rights abuses during the year yet neither commander was ever sanctioned by the
 President, nor were other commanders of the military units which were involved in
 human rights abuses. Zaire's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for
 which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analy-
 sis, were between $210 million and $223 million. Military expenditures fell in 1992
 for economic reasons rather than any voluntary reduction initiated by the Govern-
 ment. There is no indication that any voluntary effort will be made to reduce mili-
 tary spending in the near future, although economic decline will continue to take
 its toll on the defense budget.
 Subsistence agriculture has long been the base of Zaire's economy, but its min-
 erals and mining output-especially copper-has generated the hard currency reve-
 nue. Throughout 1992, however, Zaire's economy was in deep depression. The Nguz
 Government's mismanagement of public affairs during the first 8 months of 1992-
 with President Mobutu s tacit acceptance-hastened the crumbling of the country's
 infrastructure and capital depletion of the state-owned corporations. At the same
 time, corruption, blackmail, extortion, and embezzlement were as endemic as ever.
 Inflation in 1992 attained unprecedented four-digit levels. In this environment the
 wage or modern sector of the economy could not recover dynamism to offset the
 losses from the looting and pillaging which occurred nationwide in the fall of 1991.
 About 70 percent of the population is rural, mainly engaged in subsistence farming;
 this has permitted people to survive the current economic crisis. Few if any of the
 100,000 Zairian wage-earners who had lost their jobs in the wake of the 1991 pillag-
 ing of foreign investment projects and evacuation of foreigners have been reem-
 ployed.
 There were massive human rights violations in Zaire in 1992. In particular, the
 Mobutu-Nguz administration used excessive force in suppressing peaceful marches
 protesting the suspension of the National Conference, notably on February 16 when
 
 
 293
 as many as 50 unarmed demonstrators were brutally slain. It also incited extensive
 ethnic violence in Shaba province in which numerous civilians, mainly Kasaians
 died. Throughout the year, despite the ongoing dialog between contending poitica
 forces, politically inspired violence continiied, including the bombing of UDPS of-
 rices.
 Other major abuses in 1992 included the use of arbitrary detention and physical
 mistreatment of detainees, including torture. No senior law enforcement officer was
 prosecuted for such crimes in 1992. Prime Minister Tshisekedi's Government has
 pledged a commitment to the rule of law and democracy and respect for human
 rights. However, the reality of divided government in a period of economic crisis
 means that the transition to democracy in Zaire is far from assured, in part because
 the new Government has not been able to take effective control of security and po-
 lice forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extraludicial Killings.-Many deaths in 1992 resulted from
 the Mobutu-Nguz governments efforts to suppress political dissent and to fan ethnic
 tensions (see Section 1.g.). There were also several instances of targeted political or
 extrajudicial killings. For example, early in the year uniformed personnel (assumed
 to be military) killed an employee of the Commercial Bank of Zaire reportedly be-
 cause of his UDPS sympathies. In March "security forces" tortured and shot four
 persons, who died at Mama Yemo Hospital. They had been arrested for participating
 in the March 1 demonstrations in response to the Nguz government's closing of the
 National Conference.
 There were credible reports that the Government may have summarily executed
 19 soldiers arrested in connection with an attempted takeover of the official radio
 station, the Voice of Zaire, in January. The Government said the 19 had escaped
 from prison, but there was no followup investigation to determine the facts, and re-
 ports indicate they were killed shortly after their arrest.
 b. Disappearance.-Credible reports of disappearances or attempted kidnapings in
 Zaire were numerous in 1992, particularly during the first half of the year. The
 print media, human rights observers, andprivate citizens attributed many of the
 disappearances to a secret special intervention force composed of elements of the se-
 curity services, whose mission it was to carry out abductions and other forms of in-
 timidation against people supporting the opposition parties.
 In early March, uniformed assailants attempted to detain three members of the
 Layman's Coordinating Committee, the group which sponsored the Marches of Hope
 on February 16 and March 1. The three escaped arrest, but their experience lent
 weight to charges about the existence of a special intervention group. Armed Forces
 Chief of Staff General Mahele has acknowledged the existence of such a group,
 which is popularly called "Les Hiboux" (The Owls).
 At the end of 1992, there was concern about the whereabouts of 62 Zairian Air
 Force personnel. They had been transferred in mid-February to a reform camp at
 Irebu, Haut Zaire, allegedly for engaging in pillaging, but, accordin to some
 sources, for sympathizing with the opposition. Before their move, they hadbeen held
 in degrading circumstances and had not been brought before a judge with jurisdic-
 tion over such cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is forbidden by Zairian law, and its use is proscribed by official policy. The
 Penal Code provides that persons who have committed torture can be sentenced to
 5 to 20 years in prison. Security personnel nonetheless beat and otherwise mistreat
 suspects during criminal interrogations. Human rights organizations have recorded
 many instances of torture or cruel treatment. For example, during the March-April
 trial of the soldiers accused of the attempted takeover of the government radio sta-
 tion, several of the defendants affirmed they had been tortured in underground cells
 at Camp Tshatshi. They testified they were stripped naked, beaten with rifle butts,
 cut with bayonets, brought before faked firing squads, and raped or otherwise sexu-
 ally abused.
 During the first half of 1992, Lieutenant Colonel Luc Mayolo Mokakoso and a
 CaptainMbumb-2 of 11 army officers arrested in July 1991 on grounds of plotting
 against the Government and sympathizing with opposition parties--were held at
 Ndolo military prison and subjected to degrading treatment. Prisoners at Ndolo
 sleep two to a straw mat in unventilated and badly lighted rooms. Medications are
 rarely available. Colonel Mayolo was released in late October, however, he still has
 to report to Ndolo prison on a daily basis, is under occasional surveillance, and is
 not allowed to take up anv private activity.

 Appalling prison conditions are a cause of prisoner morbidity. Prisoners die of ex-
 haustion and assault in addition to disease, often brought on by malnutrition. Mi-
 nors are generally held in the same quarters as adults sometimes of either sex, a
 practice which encourages sexual abuse. The Zairian Prison Fellowship (ZPF) vis-
 ited six prisons in Kinshasa in 1992 although it knew of 217 throughout the coun-
 try. Conditions are particularly bad at Makala Prison, Kinshasa s penitentiary,
 where the ZPF recorded seven deaths from cholera in less than a week in May. t
 calculated that each inmate at Makala in May was given on average no more than
 70 grams of poor quality food each day. Prisoners slept on bare floors without cov-
 ers. The ZPF also reported that at the Ngaba jail in the capital, men, women, and
 young offenders were held together in communal cells. Another well-informed source
 noted in a report that the Kalamu jail in the capital "is worse than hell. The in-
 mates eat, sleep, and relieve themselves in a single room in which they are asphyx-
 iated by ammonia gas." d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Zairian law
 a warrant is not required for the arrest of a suspect of a crime punishable by more
 than 6 months' imprisonment. Any law enforcement officer having the status of "ju-
 dicial police officer" is empowered to authorize arrest. This status is vested in senior
 officers of each of the security services. The law provides that detainees be brought
 before a magistrate for a hearing within the first 48 hours of arrest. If grounds for
 arrest are presented, the magistrate may order detention for an initial period of 15
 days followed by renewable 30-day penods.
 In practice, especially during the rust 8 months of 1992, many people were ar-
 rested arbitrarily and held in detention for varying periods without recourse to due
 process or judicial review. Although the Code of Military Justice provides for legal
 safeguards, its provisions were regularly disregarded. The Government has never
 implemented the National Security Council guidelines issued in 1990 to end unlaw-
 ful incommunicado detentions and the practice of internal exile. The law mandates
 judicial oversight of detention centers, but such oversight rarely occurs, due to offi-
 cial indifference and to a lack of personnel, materiel, and transport.
 The Zairian Prison Fellowship noted in May that nearly 85 percent of the 843 in-
 mates then at Makala Prison were suspects who had not been tried and convicted.
 Some of them had been there without charge for 10 years. About two-thirds of the
 300 persons held at Ndolo military prison have not been charged. At year's end,
 there were some signs of improvement in the situation at Makala prison following
 visits by the Justice Minister and a representative of the United Nations Secretary
 General charged with investigating the human rights situation. There were reports
 that judicial proceedings were being expedited at Makala, and as many as 30 pris-
 oners were released in November and early December.
 Persons detained in Zaire for political reasons have traditionally been held under
 administrative detention, house arrest, or internal exile. Many of them are held in
 clandestine or military prisons. Such cases rarely come to trial. The National Secu-
 rity Council has acknowledged the existence of political detainees, but the Govern-
 ment has never disclosed the number. The Zairian League for Human Rights esti-
 mates the figure to be about 90, but this may be an underestimate. It is impossible
 to determine accurately the number of political detainees at any given moment.
 On January 23, the Nguz government linked the opposition to the aborted take-
 over that morning of the radio station, the Voice of Zaire. While warrants were ru-
 mored to have been handed out for the arrest of opposition party leaders Etienne
 Tshisekedi and Marcel Lihau, the only party figures detained for a short time were
 Fernand Tala-Ngai and Kiro Kimathe; the latter was charged with distributing
 antigovernment tracts, i.e., U.S. Embassy press releases condemning the suspension
 of the National Conference. At least nine people were detained for political reasons
 at Makala Prison following the suppression of the March of Hope on March 1. In
 early summer, some 50 prisoners held at Makala Prison wrote to the President of
 the National Conference that they were being detained on trumped-up political
 charges. They claimed that the charges had been sustained by corrupt magistrates.
 In the past, the Government had frequently used internal exile to intimidate civil-
 ian opponents, such as Pririie Minister Tshisekedi. There were no known cases of
 civilians being sentenced to internal exile in 1992, but 62 Zairian Air Force person-
 nel were transferred as a disciplinary measure to a reform camp at Irebu, Haut
 Zaire in mid-February (see Section 1.b.).
 e. benial of Fair Public Triai.-The judiciary is not independent of the executive
 branch and has consistently been responsive to priorities and objectives set by the
 Government and the Presidency. Zaire's civil and criminal codes are based on Bel-
 gian and customary law. Its legal system includes lower courts, appellate courts, the
 Supreme Court, and the Court of State Security. Most cases are initiated at the
 local level, and many disputes are adjudicated by local administrative officials or
 traditional authorities. Aderence to acceptable legal procedures varies in most in-
 
 
 stances. Charges of misconduct against senior government officials are riled directly
 with the Supreme Court.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to a public trial and counsel.
 The right of appeal is provided in all cases except national security, armed robbery,
 and smuggling, which are adjudicated by the Court of State Security. When a de-
 fendant is unable to afford a lawyer, the law provides for court-appointed counsel
 at state expense in capital cases, all proceedings before the Supreme Court, and
 other cases when requested by the court. In practice, these guarantees are applied
 unevenly. Many defendants never meet their counsel or do so only after months of
 detention and interrogation.
 There were a number of irregularities in the March-April trial of the soldiers con-
 victed in the attempted takeover of the Voice of Zaire. Before the trial some of the
 suspects had been tortured; these charges were never investigated. Of the approxi-
 mately 30 soldiers who were arrested, only 12 were brought to trial. During the
 trial, some defendents alleged that they had been tortured in the presence of high
 government officials. The whereabouts of the remaining soldiers is unknown. The
 defense attorneys were given access to the case files only on the fourth day of the
 trial. French was the predominant language used, yet some of the soldiers knew lit-
 tle or no French.
 The Transitional Government has vowed to improve Zaire's judicial system and
 deliver fair and impartial justice. However, the system is compromised by corruption
 and intimidation of judiciary personnel by central government authorities, especially
 in politically sensitive cases and those involving property and labor disputes. The
 judicial system is also hobbled by a continuing shortage of trained and motivated
 personnel, a scarcity of essential supplies, and other constraints. In particular, mag-
 istrates, like many other Zairians, suffer from inflation-ravaged wages and poor
 working conditions a situation that gives rise to corrupt practices. In September the
 Zairian League of Human Rights made a number of recommendations to the
 Tshisekedi Government to improve judicial administration. By yea's end, the Gov-
 ernment implemented some of the recommendations, particularly those relating to
 expediting trials. Human rights gups reported better access to prisons. The Gov-
 ernment allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide assistance
 in some prisons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Security
 forces routinely ignored legal provisions that require a warrant before searching a
 home, and entered and searched residences at will. Also, Zairians continued to be
 beaten and robbed in their homes. One of many instances of a search without war-
 rant was that conducted at the home of opposition political leader Kiro Kimathe,
 Vice President of the Christian Federalist Democrats.
 Evidence suggests that the Zairian security services open private mail and tap
 telephone conversations. On March 25, Umoja, an opposition newspaper, published
 a transcript of a purported telephonic intercept of a conversation between Prime
 Minister Nguz and Defense Minister Ngbanda. Umoja said it had been given the
 transcript by a disenchanted employee of the relevant security service.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were a number of instances of security forces using excessive force and
 violating humanitarian law in 1992. The Zairian security forces have not been
 trained properly to perform effective crowd control. The severity with which the au-
 thorities suppressed demonstrations in 1992 as well as the frequency of the inci-
 dents and the rarity of disciplinary action indicate that the authorities condoned,
 if not explicitly encouraged, the use of excessive lethal force, especially during the
 first 3 months of 1992.
 The most flagrant show of excessive force took place in Kinshasa on February 16.
 Security forces su ppressed thousands of demonstrators who had peacefully gathered
 under the leadership of Christian laymen in support of the resumption of the Na-
 tional Conference. Troops used nightsticks, metal-tipped whips, tear gas, live gun-
 fire, and water cannons to attack the demonstrators who posed no apparent threat
 to public safety. Although the Government claimed that 17 persons had been killed,
 at least 24 persons died, and some credible sources claim as many as 50 deaths.
 More than 200 persons were injured. The Government claimed that the marches
 were illegal and that the troopslost control when one of their number and his son
 were killed by demonstrators.
 On March 1, troops fired on participants in a smaller demonstration-a "March
 of Hoe' in support of the National Conference. The demonstrators posed no threat
 to public order, but at least 5 persons were killed including a gendarme, and 10
 were wounded. The authorities arrested over 10 persons, including 5 priests.
 In both marches the organizers had sought the Government's authorization sev-
 np!rirvR in ndvanm.. Havina nreviousiv issued a aeneralized orohibition on all dem-
 
 
 onstrations during the National Conference, the Nguz government either ignored
 the requests or denied them. The demonstrators, holding aloft candles, bibles, cruci-
 fixes, and palm branches, had intended the marches to be peaceful. Despite calls
 by foreign governments including the United States, the N  government refused
 to undertake an independent inquiry into the events to identif the perpetrators.
 The authorities also provoked ethnic violence for political purposes. In Shaba
 province, Prime Minister Nguz and Shaba Governor Kyungu directly abetted strife
 with incendiary calls to drive out Kasaians. In January at Fungurume, near Likasi
 militant members of Nguz's UFERI party helped fan ethnic conflict, which resulted
 in the deaths of 4 Balubas of Kasai origin; another 53 were injured, 11 seriously,
 and 50 homes destroyed. During the following months UFERI militant members
 perpetrated other politically motivated violence against Kasai Baluba in Shaba
 province, razed Baluba dwellings in Kapalowe, Kasumbalesa, Kasenga, Kipushi,
 Lukufu, and Musoshi, and displaced thousands of people in the process.
 Uniformed personnel (presumed to be military) massacred some 20 persons in-
 cluding children at KatandafTshilenge on June 27 in a tribal dispute over the use
 of land. In August UFERI militants killed about a dozen Baluba and destroyed
 many homes. In some instances the security forces intervened however, to protect
 ethnic Balubas, and killed at least seven UFERI members. in mid-September in
 Likasi, there was further ethnic violence in which 30 Kasaians and a gendarme
 were killed and 60 houses set afire.
 President Mobutu traveled to Shaba in late August, ostensibly to dampen ethnic
 tensions, yet failed to dismiss the people responsible for encouraging the violence
 and initiated no official investigation. Shaba Governor Kyungu and former Prime
 Minister Nguz therefore continued to encourage anti-Baluba sentiment throughout
 the year.
 In Equateur and Haut Zaire provinces in the north and in Kivu province in the
 east, there were incidents of violence involving apparently ill-disciplined military
 units. In April and May, about 40 uniformed personnel and park guards razed sev-
 eral villages in the Salonga National Park in Equateur (on the pretext of conducting
 an antipoaching campaign), killed several villagers, raped many women, stole per-
 sonal possessions, and burned many huts. Some 155 persons lodged grievances with
 the national human rights organizations. There has not been an official investiga-
 tion.
 Similarly, in North Kivu, more than 30,000 Zairians sought temporary refuge in
 Uganda and Rwanda because of the depredations of the Zairian armed forces. In
 one incident, the military razed some 80 dwellings, leaving 315 people homeless.
 Disgruntled troops also sacked the cities of Kindu, in South Kivu, in late July;
 Mbandaka, in Equateur, in mid-October; and Coma and Rutshuru, in North Kivu,
 in late December. An especially serious incident of looting and killing in Kisangani,
 Haut Zaire, December 21-22 left at least 50 persons dead and more seriously in-
 jured. Lack of pay, poor living conditions, or conflict with local merchants appar-
 ently triggered this action. Although there is no evidence these acts were sanctioned
 officially, the Government's response was slow. There was no investigation, follow-
 up, or criminal charges.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to
 express their opinions freely. Freedom of speech and press expanded in 1992, espe-
 cially after the  shisekedi overnment was formed in August. However, Prime Min-
 ister Nguz's government continually sought to subordinate this right to "public order
 and good conduct."
 The Zairian Radio and Television Office (OZRT), the only media organ capable of
 reaching audiences nationwide, remains under government control. In January the
 Minister of Information prohibited the broadcast of a briefing on the December 1991
 visit to Washington of an opposition delegation. Shortly thereafter the Nguz govern-
 ment tried unsuccessfully tp limit coverage of opposition political parties by firing
 independent-minded public newscasters. Later in the year, reflecting the liberaliza-
 tion under way, some broadcast journalists were presenting a more nearly balanced
 treatment of the news. Later in the year, reflecting the liberalization underway,
 some broadcast journalists were presenting a more nearly balanced reatment of the
 news, but the official broadcast media as a whole remained neither independent nor
 objective. The OZRT usually provided regular live televised coverage of the National
 Conference whenever it was in session.
 The print media are subject to an ordinance on press freedom promulgated on
 April 20 1981. The ordinance does not define "freedom of the press.* A member of
 the bar has stated that the law more properly relates to "control of the press," e.g.,
 through publication approval and copyright registration, rather than to freedom of
 
 
 the press. The Nguz government attempted, without much success, to keep the
 press in line by warning Zairian publishers in February that those not conforming
 to the 1981 decree "would risk severe punishment" and by detaining in July for 4
 days Zongia Mbali, the editor of Le Manager Grognon, at Makala Prison on charges
 that his paper was not approved for distribution. The Government also tried to re-
 strict private press access to newsprint and other supplies. On November 7, armed
 men wearing military uniforms firebombed Terra Nova, a printing plant in
 Kinshasa that published a dozen opposition newspapers. Similarly, on December 26
 armed men in uniforms destroyed the printing equipment of the newspaper group
 Le Potentiel, which has supported Prime Minister Tshisekedi. No one ad been
 charged in either incident by year's end.
 An energetic, if at times irresponsible, free press that occasionally reports rumors
 and speculation as fact has emerged in Kinshasa. Nearly a dozen private news-
 papers reported regularly on national and international events in 1992. Foreign
 iournaliqtq were permitted in Zaire and reported on various developments through.
 out the year. The impact of the free press was largely confined to Kinshasa, how-
 ever. Distribution of private newspapers to rural areas was limited by lack of trans-
 port and other obstacles, including apparently the Government's alleged purchase
 of surplus newspapers to prevent their distribution outside Kinshasa and
 Lubumbashi. This practice was especially prevalent in Shaba province, Prime Min-
 ister Nguz's native region.
 The public universities and most other institutions of higher learning were closed
 during 1992, in part to forestall student unrest, but also because of massive finan-
 cial and administrative problems and as a result of the damage to facilities caused
 by the looting in September 1991. The University of Kinshasa was expected to re-
 open in January 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of the people to as-
 semble peacefully has never been firmly established in Zaire. The Nguz government
 prohibited all demonstrations during the period of the National Conference and en-
 couraged the security forces to intimidate the political opponents of the status quo-
 hence, an atmosphere of uncertainty prevailed concerning the security of public and
 private gatherings. Especially during the first 8 months of the year, there continued
 to be incidents of harassment and violence perpetrated against opposition political
 groupings. Twice durin  this  riod, the offices of the UDPS party in Kinshasa,
 whose de facto leader isPrime Minister Tshisekedi were ransacked. Although oppo-
 sition political parties were not allowed to hold rallies, Nguz's UFERI party did so
 in Shaba July 17 without government interference.
 On the other hand, the Shaba provincial authorities prevented UDPS political
 leader Kibassa Maliba from being met by supporters in bibumbashi in early March
 and brutally dispersed the people who had gathered at his residence to welcome
 him. One of his sympathizers was killed. Not long thereafter, Shaba officials pre-
 vented the supporters of Charles Mwando Nsimba, the leader of a dissident UFERI
 faction, from holding a meeting. His supporters were violently dispersed, and their
 fields were set afire.
 Sympathizers of opposition political parties also at times tried to suppress free as-
 sembly and association. For example, they stoned the cortege of the late head of the
 Kimbanguist church as his remains were being taken to their final resting place.
 (The Kimbanguists are considered pro-Mobutu by many people.) Similarly, during
 the campaign for the election of a prime minister by theNational Conference, UDPS
 sympathizers threatened the opponents of party leader Tshisekedi with bodily harm
 and property damage if they voted for someone else.
 Since the election of Etienne Tshisekedi as Prime Minister, private organizations
 have been free to organize and conduct their affairs peacefully without constraints
 beingimposed upon them by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-About 50 percent of the population is Catholic, 40 percent
 Protestant and Kimbanguist (a Zairian Christian church), and 5 percent Muslim.
 The remainder profess indigenous or other religious beliefs. There is no legally fa-
 vored church or religio  n Zaire, but the Constitution limits religious freedom by
 authorizing the Government to regulate religious sects by law.
 The 1971 law regulating religious organizations grants to civil servants the power
 to establish or dissolve religious groups. Under this law the process for becoming
 recognized is restrictive; however, officially recognized religions are free to establish
 places of worship and to train clergy. Most recognized churches have external ties,
 and foreign nationals are allowed to proselytize.
 The Jehovah Witnesses and some other religious sects were banned on charges
 of subversive activities or fraud on March 12, 1986. Before and after the issuance
 of that presidential ordinance, the Jehovah Witnesses were hounded, detained, tor-
 tured. and at times murdered because of their religious beliefs. They also lost assets
 
 
 298
 in Kinshasa valued in excess of $25 million. During the first half of 1992, they con-
 tinued to be persecuted by government officials, especially in South Kivu province
 (Maniema). Human rights organizations have condemned their persecution. In the
 wake of the suppression of the March of Hope in Kinshasa on February 16, the
 churches and rectories of St. Michael at Bandalunga, St. Joseph at Matonge, and
 St. Dominic at Limete were broken into and pillaged. Two Belgian priests were ex-
 pelled for their involvement in the Marches of Hope
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens, refugees, and permanent residents must carry identity
 cards. Police and soldiers erect checkpoints on major roads to inspect pa ers. Pass-
 ports and exit permits are available, in principle, to all citizens, but the Government
 has occasionally prevented individual travel by withholding such documents. Cor-
 ru pt officials may provide them at exorbitant cost.
 Ethnic strife among indigenous Katangans and Balubas of Kasai origin residing
 in Shaba province provoked the displacement of thousands of Balubas to East and
 West Kasai throughout the year. Even within Kasai, life was made difficult for them
 because Shaba Governor Kyungu prohibited the transshipment of foodstuffs and
 other supplies from Shaba to Kasai, as well as expropriated the prepaid goods of
 Kasai merchants in transit.
 Government treatment of refugees has been benign and asylum has been liberally
 granted. Most refugees in Zaire do not live in camps. Two indigenous nongovern-
 mental organizations, the Christian Church of Zaire and the recently formed Com-
 mittee for Intervention and Assistance to Refugees, provide assistance in conjunc-
 tion with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which maintains an
 office in Kinshasa. Doctors without Borders of Belgium serves Angolan refugees in
 western Shaba province. At the end of 1992, some 512,000 refugees and other dis-
 placed persons were in Zaire, including about 280,000 Angolans. The Sudanese refu-
 gees in northeastern Zaire numbered about izu,uuu. The other refugees were mainly
 urundians, Rwandans, and Ugandans. There were no known instances of forced
 repatriation in 1992.
 Some 60,000 Zairians have sought asylum in neighboring countries. Prospective
 returnees are dealt with individually, and there is no evidence of discrimination
 against them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The President and the opposition were unable to reach consensus to hold free and
 fair elections in 1992. However, in August the National Conference elected Etienne
 Tshisekedi Prime Minister. The election, which many people welcomed, reflected the
 desire for change. President Mobutu has withheld his support and has continually
 sought to control the pace and extent of political reform, in part by attempting to
 split the opposition. President Mobutu has said he will be a candidate in the presi-
 dential election, but he is relying on units of the military and elements of the politi-
 cal organizations he built up during 27 years to stand by him in his attempts to
 retain power as long as he can.
 The National Conference closed on December 5 under pressure from the Presi-
 dent. The Conference, a diverse group of 2,800 participants, set out the outlines of
 a 2-year transition process, formed the new institution of the High Council of the
 Republic, established an elections calendar, and drafted a new constitution and elec-
 toral code. However, the Conference did not consider the reports of two sensitive
 commissions, which had been established to review cases of ill-getten gains and po-
 litical killings. Although several women participated in the Conference, there are
 few in the Government.
 The indigenous Pygmies living in remote areas take little part in the political
 process. The Pygmies did not participate in the National Conference, but their inter-
 ests were represented and their plight was debated in plenary sessions in August.
 The Conference voted that #ll Pygmies should be considered Zairian citizens with
 full citizenship.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental Zairian human rights organizations have been active in
 the country since 1990. These comprise the Zairian League of Human Rights, the
 Voice of the Voiceless, the Zairian Association for the Defense of Human Rights, and
 the Zairian Prison Fellowship. All have reported and documented human rights
 abuses, as well as issued reports on the Government's attitude regarding its respon-
 sibility to protect these rights and to meet the basic human needs of the population.
 Because of their consistent criticism of the Government during the first 8 months
 
 
 299
 
 of the year, the Nguz administration frequently harassed these organizations. For
 example one leader of a human rights group was arrested, his house and office
 searched, and his documents seizedby oxicials loyal to President Mobutu and the
 Nguz government. Several employees of the same organization were prevented from
 de ivering a press statement to the local broadcast media. On December 13, two
 human rights group leaders were arrested by military personnel at the Kinshasa
 airport, where they had gone to receive a visiting French delegation. They were
 beaten and held for several days in military custody. The delegation was sent back
 to France.
 During the first 8 months of 1992, the Nguz government often rejected efforts by
 national and international private human rights organizations to investigate alleged
 human rights abuses. It refused to permit an independent inquiry concerning the
 February 16 massacre despite demands by the United States and members of the
 European community.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintains a regional office
 in Kinshasa. The ICRC makes regular prison visits in Zaire.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Zaire's population of about 40 million includes over 200 separate ethnic groups.
 Four indigenous languages have national status. French is the language of govern-
 ment, commerce, and education. Political offices have generally been proportionally
 allocated among the various ethnic groups, but President Mobutu's Ngbandi tribes-
 men are disproportionately represented at the highest levels of the security and in-
 telligence services. Ngbandi predominate at all levels within the Special Presidential
 Division, the best equipped and trained unit of the armed forces.
 In 1992 the National Conference proposed a census for the diminishing Pgmy
 population with the idea of establishing administrative territorial reserves for Pyg-
 mies. No one has an accurate count of them since they often resist contact with out-
 siders. They may number between 6,000 and 10,000.
 Women are relegated to a seconda   role in Zaire's traditional society. They are
 the primary farm laborers and smal traders and are exclusively responsible for
 child-rearing. In the nontraditional sector, women commonly receive less pay for
 equal work.Women in Zaire tend to be less educated than men- a recent U.N. study
 indicates that females in Zaire receive only one-third of the saooling given males.
 Although women are represented in the professions and the civil service, only rarely
 do women occupy positions which permit them to exercise authority over male pro-
 fessionals. A few have attained positions of high responsibility.
 Women are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission before engaging
 in routine legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank
 account, accepting employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987 revision of the
 Family Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's property. The Code also pro-
 tects a married woman's right to control her property and to receive a property set-
 tlement in the event of divorce.
 Although the Government has not addressed the issues of discrimination, role as-
 cription, and domestic violence, these issues were raised by a commission of the Na-
 tional Conference. The commission did not provide any particular insights into vio-
 lence against women, including rape. In general, the Conference was very conserv-
 ative aout women's rights. The question of domestic violence has generally been
 ignored by the press and human rights groups despite acknowledgment that it oc-
 curs and may indeed be common. Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is not
 widespread in Zaire, but it is practiced among isolated groups in northern Zaire.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to form and join trade unions
 is provided for in the Constitution and in legislation, but there are two exceptions.
 Magistrates and other employees of the judicial system are governed by a statute
 which stipulates that they may not create their own union. In addition, all military
 personnel (including gendarmes or the national police) are subject to a statute which
 states that they, too, cannot establish a union. Before April 1990, all trade unions
 were required by statute to affiliate with the National Union of Zairian Workers
 (UNTZA), the single legally recognized labor umbrella organization which was an
 integral part of the only political party then allowed, the Popular Movement for the
 Revolution (MPR). After April 24, 1990 when political pluralism was permitted, the
 UNTZA disaffiliated itself from the MPh and reorganized under new leadership cho-
 sen through elections deemed fair by outside observers. Other independent labor
 unions and nascent confederations emerged in the ensuing months, most of which
 organized along occupational lines. Some of these have antecedents which existed
 in the early years of Zaire's independence. The situation is still in flux. There is a
 
 
 300
 loose confederation of government worker unions which has not selected its leader-
 ship.
 The right to strike is recognized in Zairian law; however, 'legal" strikes rarely
 occur since the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and ap-
 peal procedures. Labor unions have not effectively defended the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. Although the UNTZA and the other
 unions employed various means (including wildcat strikes) in 1992 in attempts to
 improve pay and working conditions, their impact was minimal. The most important
 work stoppage was a general strike at Matadi early in the year in support of a re-
 sumption of the National Conference; it ended after 3 weeks when troops of the 31st
 Airborne Brigade replaced longshoremen and other striking workers. Teachers and
 other civil servants also went on strike during the year for wage increases or to pro-
 test nonpayment of salaries.
 Several instances of arbitrary dismissal of employees by government employers
 (various ministerial departments and state enterprises) were recorded during the
 first 8 months of 1992. A well-informed source noted that 90 employees at the Office
 of the Prime Minister were arbitrarily fired between February and July. Two senior
 civil service union representatives were also dismissed on spurious grounds. The
 reason given was unauthorized participation in political activities i e., active sup-
 port of opposition parties. Credible sources have asserted that Gene'ral Kikunda
 Ombala, the chief executive officer of Air Zaire, a government-owned airline, dis-
 missed personnel solely because of their political activity.
 In 1992 the UNTZA participated actively in the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and maintained ties with a number of foreign trade union organiza-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation provides for the
 right to bargain collectively. The UNTZA has negotiated about 1,000 collective bar-
 gaining agreements during the past several years. An agreement between the
 UNTZA and the employers association (ANEZA) provided for wages and prices to
 be fixed jointly each year under minimal government supervision. This system,
 which functioned until 1991 broke down as a result of the rapid depreciation of
 Zaire's national currency and has not been replaced by an alternative system. Con-
 tinuing hyperinflation has encouraged a return to pay rates individually arranged
 between employers and employees, a decline in the influence of unions (at least in
 the formal economic sector), a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a
 buyer's market for labor.
 The Government has not promulgated the revisions to the Labor Code promised
 in 1990. These would strengthen the provisions of the law safeguarding the right
 to form unions and to bargain collectively. The revisions would also protect workers
 against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones in Zaire.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 in Zaire. However, the Zairian Prison Fellowship reported to the National Con-
 ference that inmates at the Lugumu and Anenga prisons were forced to work for
 the personal benefit of the wardens in 1992. The International Labor Organization
 Committee of Experts in its 1992 report reiterated its concern about the Zairian
 laws of 1971 and 1976 that provide for compulsory labor by Zairian nationals who
 are delinquent taxpayers or who fail to contribute to national development efforts.
 d. Minimum Age and Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years. Minors 14 years and older may be employed legally with the
 consent of a parent or guardian. Employment of children of all ages is common in
 the informal economic sector and in subsistence agriculture. Neither the Ministry
 of Labor nor the labor unions make an effort to enforce child labor laws. Larger en-
 terprises do not commonly exploit child labor. There were credible reports that pro-
 Mobutu forces were drafting -13- to 17-year-old youths into the Special Presidential
 Division.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most Zairians are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. Because of spiraling inflation
 in 1992, the minimum legal monthly wage was far too low for employees and their
 families to have anyhing approximating a decent standard of living. Most workers
 relied on the extended family and informal economic activity to survive.
 In particular, public sector salaries remained far below the minimum subsistence
 wage except at the highest levels of government service; public sector employees
 generally held a second job and some engaged in corruption. Since the law requires
 employers to provide medical benefits, this was often the only reason employees
 wanted to retain their jobs in the formal sector.
 The maximum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is 48 hours. One
 24-hour rest period is required every 7 days. The Labor Code specifies health and
 
 
</pre>

<pre>
 safety standards. The Ministry of Labor is officially charged with the enforcement
 of these standards, but there is little enforcement in practice. Minimum wages, safe-
 ty, and health standards do not apply to employees engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture.
