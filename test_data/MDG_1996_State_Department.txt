 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar comnpleted its transition from 16 years of authoritarian Socialist rule
 with the free and fair election of Albert Zaf ' as President in 1993. Under the 1992
 Constitution, power is divided between the President, the Prime Minister, and his
 Government and a bicameral legislature (Senate and National Assembly). A number
 of institutions provided for in the Constitution, including the Senate, an independ-
 ent judiciary, and new courts that require Senate appointments,_had not been estab-
 lished by year's end. Communal elections, the first step toward the creation of the
 Senate, were held in November 1995. Departmental and regional elections, which
 must also precede a Senate election, were post poned in July due to impeachment
 proceedings against President Zafy. His impeac ent became effective in Septem-
 ber, with Prime Minister Norbert Ratsirahonana becoming acting Head of State
 while retaining his post as Prime Minister. In December former president Didier
 Ratsiraka defeated Zafy in a runoff presidential election.
 The Ministry of National Police is responsible for law and order in urban areas.
 The Ministry of Armed Forces comprises the National Army, including army troops,
 air force, navy, and the gendarmerie. The gendarmerie has primary responsibility
 for security except in major cities, and is assisted in some areas by regular army
 units in operations against bandit gangs and cattle thieves. In August the Minister
 of Armed Forces issued a statement reiterating the armed forces commitment to
 abide by the law as the impeachment struggle came to dominate national politics.
 The armed forces assiduously observed this order. Military force strength gradually
 declined to about 20,000 troops. There are also village-level law enforcement groups,
 or vigilance committees, known as dina. There were occasional reports that police
 and gendarmes committed human rights abuses, as did the dina.
 Madagascar is a very poor country. The economy relies heavily on agriculture;
 production of coffee and vanilla fell, but shrimp exports rose, and rice, the maor
 staple, remained at near-sufficiency. Manufacturing in export processing facilities
 increased modestly. Smuggling of vanilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle continued
 to be major concerns. Overall economic performance stabilized, but three-fourths of
 the population of 14 million still live in poverty. Foreign assistance remains a major
 source of national income. Living standards are low, with per capita gross domestic
 product estimated at $250. Inflation was 49 percent in 1995, but fell rapidly in
 1996. Unemployment; especially among youth, remained high. The Government
 plans to implement a program of economic reform and structural adjustment to fos-
 ter a market economy.
 The human rights situation did not change significantly from 1995. There was lit-
 tle political violence, despite strikes, demonstrations, and heated political debate be-
 tween the President anl his opponents in the National Assembly. There were occa-
 sional reports of police brutality against criminal suspects and detainees, as well as
 instances of arbitrary arrest and detention. Prison conditions remained harsh and
 life threatening, and in some prisons women may experience physical abuse, includ-
 ing rape. The authorities took no action to relieve the overburdened judiciary. As
 a result, suspects were held in lengthy pretrial detention that often exceeded the
 maximum sentence for the alleged offense. Dina were responsible for summary jus-
 tice in rural areas where the Government's presence was weak. Women continued
 to face societal discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra ldicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government forces. However, harsh prison conditions and the authorities'
 failure to provide adequate food and medical treatment resulted in an unknown
 number of deaths in custody (see Section 1.c.). Village dina continued to mete out
 summary justice, including executions, to combat rising rural banditry. The Mala-
 gasy Young Lawyers Association reported more than a dozen executions following
 dina trials, usually for cattle theft. Mobs took violent action against suspected
 thieves in some areas, particularly major cities, resulting in injury or death.
 There were no developments in several pre-1996 incidents: The 1994 beating
 death of radio journalist Victor Randrianirina, who had allegedly reported on sap-
 phire smuggling, several 1991-93 incidents in which security forces killed or injured
 unarmed civilians; the deaths of more than 30 demonstrators who were killed by
 then-President Ratsiraka's presidential guard at Iavoloha palace on August 10,
 1991; or a March 31, 1992, incident in which soldiers killed 6 pro-Ratsiraka support-
 ers at the National Forum (Constitutional Convention).
 b. Disappearance-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically provides for the inviolability of the person. However,
 there were occasional reports that police or other security forces mistreated pris-
 oners or detainees. There were rare instances of dina trials in which torture was
 used to elicit confessions.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Prisoners' diets are inadequate,
 and family members must augment daily rations. Prisoners without relatives nearby
 sometimes go for days without food. Prison cells average less than 1 square meter
 of space per inmate. The authorities do not provide adequate medical care. The pris-
 on population of 20,000 suffers a range of medical prob ems that are rarely treated,
 including malnutrition, infections, malaria, and tuberculosis. These conditions have
 caused an unknown number of deaths.
 Women in prisons suffer abuses, as do the children who are sometimes confined
 with them. Gender segregation is not absolute, and some rapes were reported.
 The Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, religious and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and a Malagasy legal
 association investigating excessive pretrial detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons, but in practice the authorities do not always observe legal safe-
 guards against arbitrary arrest and detention. In particular, excessive investigative
 detention of suspects results in denial of due process.
 According to law, a criminal suspect must be charged, bound over, or released
 within 3 days of arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but is not always re-
 quired. According to the Penal Code, defendants in ordinary criminal cases have the
 right to be informed of the charges against them, must be charged formally within
 the specified time permitted, and must be allowed access to an attorney. Court-ap-
 pointed counsel is provided for indigent persons accused of crimes that carry a mini-
 mum 5-year jail sentence. An attorney or the accused may request bail immediately
 after arrest, after being formally charged, or during the appeal process, but it is
 rarely granted in the case of violent crimes.
 More than 70 percent of the estimated 20,000 persons in custody were in pretrial
 detention. Despite existing legal safeguards, investigative detention often exceeds 1
 year, and 3 or 4 years of detention are common, even for crimes for which the maxi-
 mum penalty may be 2 years or less. The accused may wait years in prison only
 to be ultimately exonerated in court. A Catholic NGO, Aumonerie Catholique, in
 partnership with the Young Lawyers' Association, pursued case reviews of a number
 of detainees.
 Although the law allows detainees to sue the Government for damages in cases
 of unlawful detention, no such suits were reported. By law, persons accused of sub-
 versive activity may be detained incommunicado for 15 days and are subject to in-
 definite detention if considered necessary by the Government; however, this law was
 not invoked during the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, implementing legislation has not been passed. The establishment of
 a number of courts also provided for in the Constitution awaits the long-delayed in-
 auguration of the Senate.
 The judiciary has three levels of jurisdiction: local courts for civil and criminal
 cases carrying limited fines and sentences; the Court of Appeals, which includes a
 criminal court for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and the Supreme
 Court. The judiciary also includes courts designed to handle specific kinds of cases
 such as cattle theft. The High Constitutional Court is an autonomous court that un-
 dertakes technical reviews of laws, decrees, and ordinances, and certifies election re-
 sults.
 While awaiting reform, the judiciary remained under the Ministry of Justice. Lack
 of internal controls and relatively low salaries for magistrates encourage corruption.
 With judicial reform stagnated, the pace of court proceedings has slowed and cre-
 ated a huge backlog, contributing to the problem of excessive investigative deten-
 tion.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney, to be present at
 the trial, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence under the Penal Code.
 The right of traditional village institutions to protect property and public order
 is codified in the Constitution as well as earlier laws. Dina adjudicate or arbitrate
 civil disputes within and between villages. Dina are also established in some urban
 areas. In practice dna increasingly deal with criminal cases because of increasing
 crime, the physical isolation of many rural areas, and the ineffectiveness of the po-
 lice and the judiciary outside major centers. Dina punishments were at times severe
 
 
 159
 and in some cases included capital punishment. In late 1995, the Government began
 to combat crime and insecurity in isolated rural regions by augmenting the gendar-
 merie-traditionally responsible for law and order in rural areas-with army units.
 In November 1994, the National Assembly formally recognized the role of dina in
 reducing crime when it passed legislation that gave dina verdicts the same weight
 as judgments by lower courts. This legislation also increased fines and the severity
 of prison sentences for those refusing to abide by dina decisions. However, the 1994
 law remained under review by the High Constitutional Court and did not become
 effective. Decisions by dina are not subject to codified safeguards for the accused,
 but in some instances may be challenged at the appeals court level. Some cases
 have also been referred to the Office of the Mediator (ombudsman), which inves-
 tigates and may seek redress from formal judicial authorities.
 Military courts are integrated into the civil judicial system, and differ only in the
 kinds of cases tried and in the inclusion of military officers on jury panels. Such
 courts have jurisdiction over some cases involving national security, including acts
 allegedly threatening the nation and its political leaders; invasion by foreign forces;
 and rioting that could lead to the overthrow of the Government. Defendants in mili-
 tary cases, as in civil law, enjoy an appeals process that reexamines points of law
 rather than the facts of the case. A civilian magistrate, usually joined on the bench
 by a panel of military officers, presides over military trials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The
 press is independent, and the judiciary functions effectively in this area.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Rel ,ion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. However, fear of crime effectively restricts travel to some
 places, especially at night. Malagasy and foreign residents require exit visas, but
 these are almost never refused unless the person is involved in legal proceedings.
 The Government generally cooperates closely with the United Nations High Com-
 missione r   Refugees in processing the small number of refugees or asylum seek-
 ers. However, the Government has ailed to resolve the status of approximately 127
 Ethiopian asylum seekers who have been in Madagascar for severalyear. A group
 of approximately 40 Ethiopians staged a hunger strike from September 30 to Octo-
 ber 6 to protest the Government's failure to recognize them as refugees. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of those with recognized or pending claims to refugee
 status. The i    ofathe proevision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct universal suf-
 frage and secret ballot. Albert Zafy was elected to a 5-year term as President in
 1992 in the first election under the current constitution. In 1993 138 members of
 the National Assembly were elected for 4-year terms. Local government mayors and
 councils were elected in 1995. A referendum to amend the Constitution was also
 held in 1995. These by-elections were generally free and fair.
 Under the Constitution, the President has primary responsibility for national de-
 fense and foreign policy, while the Prime Minister is head of  vernment and re-
 sponsible for domestic policy. The President selects the Prime inister under provi-
 sions of a 1995 referendum that amended the Constitution. The Prime Minister is
 appointed when a new National Assembly is elected every 4 years, or upon a va-
 cancy. The Constitution gives the President, acting in conjunction with the Council
 of Ministers, the right to dissolve the National Assembly if there have been two gov-
 ernmental crises in the previous 18 months. The High Constitutional Court must
 rule that such crises have occurred. The Prime Minister is required to submit his
 resignation, as must the Cabinet, if a motion of censure is passed by a two-thirds
 majority of the National Assembly.
 
 
 160
 Relations between the President and the National Assembly progressively deterio-
 rated following the 1995 referendum in which the President acquired the right to
 name the Prime Minister. The President's insistence on the right to select political
 allies for several crucial ministries in the successor government of Prime Minister
 Ratsirahonana ultimately led to a motion of impeachment against him in July. In
 September the High Constitutional Court validated the National Assembly's vote.
 The Senate had not yet been created by year's end. Two-thirds of the Senate's
 members are to be selected by local, department, and regional government officials,
 while one-third of the members are to be appointed by the President. Although local
 government elections were held in November 1995, the departmental and regional
 elections scheduled for 1996 were postponed.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but in practice they are underrepresented in both areas. Only one ministerial
 post has been held by a woman in any one of the successive governments since
 1992, and women hold only 6 percent of National Assembly seats. However, nearly
 half of the magistrates are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their m     on  uman rights cases. Government officials
 are usually cooperative and responsive to their views. The Constitution provides for
 an independent office to promote and protect human rights. In 1994 the National
 Assembly assigned that role to the Office of the Mediator (ombudsman), which relies
 on moral suasio"n to correct abuses. The Office publishes annual reports on its activi-
 ties, and produced and distributed a series of brochures to educate citizens on their
 rights and responsibilities, outline the rights of women and children, and bring pub-
 lic attention to the potential for human rights violations by dna.
 The Government is open to visits by international human rights groups and to
 domestic and international election observers, although no foreign groups applied to
 observe any elections.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So.
 cmi Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and outlaws groups that ad-
 vocate ethnic or religious segregation. However, there are no government institu-
 tions that enforce these antidiscrimination provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is not widespread. Police and legal authorities
 intervene when physical abuse is reported. There is no law dealing specifically with
 violence against women except rape. Spouses can be tried for nonrape abuses, gen-
 erally under civil law.
 There is societal discrimination against women. Such discrimination is less salient
 in urban areas where many women manage or own businesses or fill management
 positions in state industries.
 Under a 1990 law, wives have an equal voice in selecting the location of a married
 couple's residence, and they generally receive an equitable share of common prop-
 erty on divorce. Widows with childre n inherit half of joint marital propert. A tradi-
 tion known as "the customary third" is still observed in some areas. Under this cus-
 tom, the wife has a right to only one-third of a couple's joint holdings. However, a
 widow receives a pension, while a widower does not.
 Children.-While official expenditures on children's welfare are low, the Govern-
 ment has maintained spending levels of the ministries of Health and Education de-
 spite increasing fiscal austerity. However, these levels are not sufficient to maintain
 public services under current economic conditions. The Government provides edu-
 cation through the secondary or vocational level, and it is compulsory through the
 age of 14. In practice, however, attendance at primary schools is estimated to be
 about 70.percent.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabiities.-There is no systematic discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. There
 is no law mandating access to buildings for people with disabilities. One NGO,
 Fondation Ikoriatsoa, has begun work on a draft law to define the rights of the dis-
 abled.
 National/Racial/Ethni Minorities.-The Malagasy, who are of mixed Malayo-
 Polynesian, African, and Arab heritage, include 18 distinct groups differing in re-
 vional and ancestral affiliation. Although there are some linguistic differences, near-
 tyall speak a dialect of the Malagasy language. None of these groups constitutes
 a majority of the population.
 
 
 A long history of military conquest and political consolidation raised the political
 and economic status of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin above that of coastal
 groups of more African ancestry. Centralized administration and economic planning
 since independence reinforced the concentration of economic and political power in
 the central highlands, where the capital is situated. These policies fed enduring ten-
 sion between coastal and highland peoples. Ethnic, caste, and regional solidarity are
 often factors in hiring practices.
 An IndooPakistani community has resided in Madagascar since the early part of
 the century. This community, traditionally focused on commerce, now numbers
 about 20,000. Few of these individuals have made successful claims to Malagasy na-
 tionality, which is customarily acquired through a native-born Malagasy mother.
 Indo-Pakistanis are widely mistrusted. In past years, their shops have been looted
 and ransacked during civil disturbances.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the 1995 Labor Code provide
 workers in the public and private sectors with the legal right to establish and join
 labor unions of their choosing without prior authorization. However, essential serv-
 ice workers, including police and military, may not form unions. Unions are re-
 quired to register with the Government, and registration is routinely granted. About
 80 percent of the labor force of 5 million is engaged in agrarian production. Union
 members account for only about 5 percent of the total labor force.
 There are a number of trade umon federations, many affiliated with political par-
 ties. Neither public nor private sector unions have played a major political or eco-
 nomic role in recent years. The Government exercises very limited control over orga-
 nized labor.
 The Labor Code and the Constitution include the right to strike, including in ex-
 port processing ("free trade") zones (EPZ's). Workers in essential services have a rec-
 ognized but restricted right to strike, although in practice short strikes took place
 without reprisal. The code requires workers to exhaust conciliation, mediation, and
 arbitration procedures before striking, but has not in practice been a significant de-
 terrent to legal strikes.
 Strikes took place in virtually every major city as workers added their voice to
 the political struggle between the President and the National Assembly and pro-
 tested declining incomes and poor economic conditions. Government workers and
 university students also called strikes to protest austerity measures.
 The ILO noted a number of instances in which the Government has failed to bring
 law and regulation into conformity with existing conventions or otherwise submit
 texts for ILO review, including those addressing forced labor, freedom of association,
 guarding of machinery, hygiene in commerce and offices, and weight limits. In most
 instances, these failures indicate legislative inertia rather than abuses.
 Unions freely join and participate in international bodies and may form federa-
 tions or confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the Labor Code and the
 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The code states that collec-
 tive bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor on the initiative
 of either party. Collective bargaining agreements are rare. The Government is often
 involved in the bargaining process, in part because of the large percentage of public
 employees who are union members.
 The Labor Code prohibits discrimination by employers against labor organizers,
 union members, and unions. In the event of antiunion activity, unions or their mem-
 bers may file a case against the employer in civil court. Labor laws apply uniformly
 throughout the country, including in the EPTs. However, the Government's enforce-
 ment of labor laws and regulations is hampered by lack of staff and financial re-
 sources. The 27 Ministry of Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites with some
 regularity but most often those located near the capital.
 There are several EPZ's which are, in practice, firms operating under special im-
 port and export rules. Such firms are required to follow all pertinent labor law and
 regulation, including minimum wage laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code explicitly pro-
 hibits forced labor Code, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines a child
 as any person under the age of 18 years. The legal minimum age of employment
 is 14 years, and work by individuals under the age of 18 is prohibited at sites where
 there is apparent and imminent danger. The Government enforces child labor laws
 in the small formal economic sector through inspectors of the Ministry of Civil Serv-
 ice, Labor, and Social Redressment. In the large agricultural sector, many young
 
 
 children work with parents on family farms at much younger ages. In urban areas,
 many children work as petty traders and beggars.
 Education is compulsory to the age of 14. In practice, however, only about 70 per-
 cent of children attend primary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and implementing legislation
 prescribe working conditions and wages, which are enforced by the Ministry of Civil
 Service, Labor, and Social Redressment. The law makes separate provisions for agri-
 cultural and nonagricultural labor.
 The minimum wage is set by the Government. Other wages are set by employers
 with individual employees, sometimes below the standard minimum wage. When
 there is a failure to reach agreement, the Ministry of Labor convenes a Committee
 of Employment Inspectors to resolve the matter. If this process fails, the Committee
 refers the matter to the chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration. No
 such cases reached the Court of Appeals during the year. The minimum wage is
 $30.50 (fmog 121.605) per month. This wage does not provide a decent living for a
 worker and family and must be supplemented by subsistence agriculture, petty
 trade, support from relatives, or employment of other family members. Minimum
 wage rates are not always respected, since high unemployment and widespread pov-
 erty lead workers to accept wages at lower levels.
 The standard legal workweek in nonagricultural and service industries is 40
 hours, and 422 hours in agriculture. At least one 24-hour rest period each work-
 week is mandated. The Labor Code sets rules and standards for worker safety and
 work site sanitation. Ministry of Civil Service, Labor and Social Redressment offi-
 cials monitor labor conditions. However, they are usually able to cover only the cap-
 ital region effectively. If violators do not remedy cited violations within the time al-
 lowed, they may be legally sanctioned or assessed administrative penalties. In some
 sectors, safety equipment is not used due to the expense of protective clothing and
 other safety devices. There have been no published reports of occupational health
 hazards or accident trends. There is no explicit right for workers to leave dangerous
 workplaces without jeopardizing their employment.
