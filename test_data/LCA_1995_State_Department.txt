 SAINT LUCIA
 Saint Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Except for the period between 1979 and 1982, Prime Min-
 ister John Compton has led the Government since 1964. His United Workers Party
 
 
 519
 defeated the main opposition Saint Lucia Labour Party in 1987 and again in 1992,
 and holds 11 seats in the 17-member House of Assembly.
 The Royal Saint Lacia Police is the only security force and includes a small unit
 called the Special Services Unit (which has some paramilitary training) and a Coast
 Guard unit. Although the police have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of
 rFspect for human rights, there were allegations of abuse by police and prison offi-
 cia s.
 The economy is based on tourism and on the export of bananas, which represent
 the principal sources of foreign exchange earnings. Saint Lucia is diversifying its
 economy into other types of agriculture, light manufacturing, and construction. Un-
 employment, estimated at 25 percent, remains a source of potential instability.
 The authorities generally respected human rights. Government criticism of the
 media, occasional credible allegations of physical abuse of suspects or prisoners, do-
 mestic violence against women, child abuse, and a lack of effective government chil-
 dren's rights programs continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such
 abuse. However, many criminal convictions in recent years have been based on con-
 fessions, which may reflect an effort by police to force confessions rather than use
 investigative approaches. As in past years, there were occasional credible allegations
 of physical abuse of prisoners by law enforcement officials prior to and during incar-
 ceration.
 The Government has not taken any specific action in response to these allega-
 tions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours after detention. However, the authorities frequently held
 prisoners for years "on remand" after charging them (there is no constitutional re-
 quirement for a speedy trial). There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or forced
 exile.
 While Spartan and crowded, prison conditions meet minimum international stand-
 ards and the Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 There are two levels of courts in St. Lucia: courts of summary jurisdiction (mag-
 istrate's courts) and the High Court. Both levels have civil and criminal authority.
 The lower courts accept civil claims up to about $1,900 (EC$5,000) in value, and
 criminal cases generally classified as "otty." The upper court has unlimited author-
 ity in both civil and criminal cases. All cases can be appealed to the Organization
 of Eastern Caribbean States Court of Appeal. From there, cases may be appealed
 to the Privy Council in London, as the final court of appeal.
 The Constitution requires public trials before an independent and impartial court
 and, in cases involving capital punishment, provision of legal counsel for those who
 cannot afford a defense attorney. In criminal cases not involving capital punish-
 ment, defendants must obtain their own legal counsel. Defendants are entitled to
 select their own legal counsel are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,
 and have the right of appeal. he authorities observe both constitutional and statu-
 tory requirements for fair public trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-TIThe
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these
 prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Government generally respects
 constitutional provisions for free speech and press, it occasionally has demonstrated
 open hostility toward both the print media and radio. However, the Government's
 attitude toward the press does not appear to affect press freedoms in Saint Lucia.
 Three privately owned newspapers and two privately owned radio stations cover
 a wide spectrum of political opinion and are often highly critical of the Government.
 The two local television stations are also privately owned and cover a wide range
 
 
 of views. In addition, the public can subscribe to cable television service, which pro-
 vides broadcasts from a variety of sources.
 In March the House of Assembly passed an amendment to the Criminal Code
 which was aimed at suppressing expressions of discontent in the banana industry
 but which had implications for the society as a whole. Among other prohibitions, the
 legislation penalized any threats by words, behavior, or written documents "which
 cause a person to desist from performing or to discontinue any lawful activity on
 his or on another person's property." After intense public pressure, legislators abol-
 ished the amendment a few months later because many considered it "draconian!
 and believed it could be interpreted as prohibiting strike activity.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association and assembly. The law requires permits for public meetigs
 and demonstrations if they are to be held in public places, such as on streets or side-
 walks or in parks. The plice routinely grant such permits; the rare refusal gen-
 erally stems from the faiiure of organizers to request the permit in a timely manner,
 normally 48 hours before the event.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status;
 however, government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Saint Lucia's parliamentary
 system provides for genuine choices among parties, policies, and officials. Although
 there are two main parties, several other political organizations alsoparticipate in
 free elections, which are held at least every 5 years, by secret ballot. The op position
 Saint Lucia Labour Party plays a significant role in the country's political life and
 holds 6 of the 17 seats in the legislative House of Assembly. One member of the
 Senate and one member of the House of Assembly are independents. In addition
 at least three other political parties-the St. Lucia Freedom Party, the Concerned
 Citizens' Movement, and the Citizens' Democratic Party-were formed in 1995.
 There are no impediments to participation by women or minorities in government.
 Both the Attorney General and the deputy leader of the Senate are women. How-
 ever, women and minorities are not represented in numbers proportional to their
 percentage of the population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights groups, there are no governmental restric-
 tions which would prevent their formation. International human rights groups, in-
 cluding Amnesty International and the Caribbean Human Rights Network, made no
 reports or requests for investigations on Saint Lucia during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Government policy is nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs, education,
 and opportunity for advancement. There are no legal restrictions on the role of
 women or minorities.
 Women.-There is increased awareness of the seriousness of violence against
 women. The Government does not prosecute crimes of violence against women un-
 less the victim herself presses charges. If the victim chooses for any reason not to
 press charges, the Government cannot bring a case. Charges must be brought under
 the ordinary civil code. The police force conducts some training forplice oficers re-
 sponsible for investigating rape and other crimes against women. Police and courts
 enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although police are hesitant to inter-
 vene in domestic disputes, and many victims are reluctant to report cases of domes-
 tic violence and rape or to press charges.
 The 1994 Domestic Violence Act allows a judge to issue a protection order prohib-
 iting an abuser from entering or remaining in the place where the victim is. It also
 allows the judge to order that an abusers name be removed from housing leases
 or rental agreements, with the effect that the abuser would no longer have the right
 to live in the same residence as the victim.
 The Saint Lucia Crisis Center monitors cases of abuse (physical and emotional)
 and helps its clients deal with such problems as incest, nonpayment of child sup-
 
 
 port, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, custody, and visitation rights. The
 group has publicized the plight of battered women and has protested the rare
 deaths of women who were victims of domestic violence. The Crisis Center is also
 working to establish a shelter for battered women and homeless girls. Some second-
 ary schools address the problem of sexual harassment and battering in their cur-
 riculum topics.
 The Minister for Women's Affairs is responsible for protecting women's rights in
 domestic violence cases and preventin discrimination against women, including
 equal treatment in employment. The Minister has recently completed a report on
 the status of women.
 Children.-Despite the 1992 Children's Rights Act, which details a strong commit-
 ment to children's rights, the Government has not fulfilled that commitment with
 effective programs. Domestic violence and incest continued to be among the prob-
 lems most affecting the welfare of children in Saint Lucia. The Government has
 started to keep statistics on the incidence of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the disabled, nor mandating provision of access to buildings or government services
 for them. There is no rehabilitation facility for the physically disabled, although the
 Health Ministry operates a community-based rehabilitation program in residents'
 homes. There are schools for the deaf and for the blind up to the secondary level.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Most public sector employees are unionized; about 20 percent of the total work force
 is unionized. Unions are independent of government, and are free to choose their
 own representatives in often vigorously contested elections. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and to choose policies to advance their members' best interests.
 There is no restriction on forming a national labor federation, and in 1994, several
 of the major unions formed an umbrella grouping called the "Industrial Solidarity
 Pact." Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations, and some have
 done so.
 Strikes in both the public and private sectors are legal, but there are many ave-
 nues through collective bargaining agreement and government procedures which
 may preclude a strike. The law prohibits the police and fire departments from strik-
 ing. Other "essential services" workers-water and sewer authority workers, electric
 utility workers, nurses, and doctors-must give 31 days' notice before striking.
 Strikes have become mere common since the October 1993 protest by banana farm-
 ers, perhaps because militancy appeared to have been effective. Public sector em-
 ployees in customs, air and sea ports, inland revenue, Radio Saint Lucia, and others
 struck in 1994 and again in 1995.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining, and they fully exercise that right. The 6-year
 wage agreement that the Government reached with six public sector unions broke
 down in the summer of 1994, resulting in widespread strike action. In 1995 a public
 sector strike action was called off after 6 weeks, although additional strike action
 appeared likely. Public sector unions sought wage increases comparable to the over-
 50-percent increases granted to the most highly ranked ministry officials.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. It also requires that employers reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Labor law is applicable in the export processing zones (EPZ's), and there are no
 administrative or legal impediments to union organizing or collective bargaining in
 those zones. In practice, however, many firms resist union efforts to organize in the
 EFZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Women's and Young Persons
 Act stipulates a minimum egal working age of 14 years. Ministry of Labor officials
 effectively enforce the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, in ef-
 fect since 1985, set out minimum wage rates only for clerks. These office workers
 receive a legislated minimum wage of about $300 (EC$800) per month. The mini-
 mum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker sup-
 porting a four-person family, but almost all categories of workers receive more than
 the legal minimum for clerks, which is used only as a guide for setting pay for other
 professions.

 There is no legislated workweek, although the common practice is to work 40
 hours in 5 days. Special legislation covers hours which shop assistants, agricultural
 workers, domestics, and young people in industrial establishments may work.
 Occupational health and ssfety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The
 Ministry enforces the Act through threat of closure of the business if it discovers
 violations and the violator does not correct them. Workers are free to leave a dan-
 gerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
