 GABON
 Gabon is a developing country with a single-party political
 system in which.effective political power is concentrated
 in the Presidency. This office has been held since 1967 by
 President Omar Bongo, who, as Vice President, succeeded to
 office on the death of former President N'ba. President Bongo
 was reconfirmed in office in 1973 and 1979 in uncontested
 elections. A March 1983 amendment to the Constitution
 of the country's only legal political party restricts
 candidacy in future Presidential elections to the 'Secretary
 General-Founder of the Democratic Party of Gabon,* thus,
 reserving Presidential candidacy for the current incumbent,
 President Bongo. Nevertheless, Presidential power is in
 practice limited by the increasing complexity of government
 and the diffusion of power through a 50-member Cabinet
 headed.by a Prime inister.
 A 93-member National Assembly elected from slates chosen by
 the single party meets regularly, but it has little real power.
 While opposition parties are not permitted, there have been
 cases where local or parliamentary elections were contested
 and won by party members who were not supported by the party
 hierarchy.
 The country's Constitution guarantees basic protection of the
 individual and respect for the integrity of the person. While
 there have been reports of isolated exceptions, these rights
 are generally respected in practice. A legal system based upon
 French civil law, customary law, and the 1961 Constitution
 functions fairly effectively. Political rights, however, are
 not guaranteed under the Constitution, and active political
 opposition is not permitted. An estimated 21-25 persons are
 currently imprisoned for opposition political activity. Public
 criticism of particular government actions and policies is
 allowed and occurs with some regularity within the context of
 the single party, although direct attacks on the President are
 prohibited. The Gabonese press has taken issue with actions of
 government agencies and criticized ministers. Foreign periodicals
 containing articles critical of the Government are generally
 allowed to circulate freely. During a disagreement with France
 in October and November, the Gabonese media, under orders from
 President Bongo, conducted a total blackout of news from and
 about France.
 There is no evidence of systematic police or other repression
 of the population. The security forces are divided into several
 distinct and autonomous groups of varying effectiveness. These
 include the army, gendarmerie, Presidential Guard, police
 and the National Documentation Center. While several of the
 security services have an internal political intelligence
 role, the security forces do not as a rule interfere in the
 daily life of the population.
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has the highest
 per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa due to its important
 petroleum and mineral resources and limited population.
 Economic performance has also benefited from longstanding
 government policies supporting private enterprise and
 encouraging foreign investment. While income distribution
 is skewed in favor of the modern urban sector as opposed to
 the traditional, agricultural sector, most Gabonese have
 benefited from the country's strong economy.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation
 
 (133)
 
 
 134
 in Gabon in 1983. The sentences of the political oppositionists
 convicted in November 1982 were reduced by five years each
 and nine were released. Seventeen remain in prison. Four
 additional persons were convicted of organizing a clandestine
 political opposition in mid-1983 and sentenced to four-year
 terms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no known political killings or summary
 executions in Gabon in recent years.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known or reported cases of abductions or
 hostage-taking by government or non-government groups in the
 past 15 years. The authorities have sometimes been slow
 to advise the families of accused criminals or detainees who
 are arrested, but there has been no evidence of attempts to
 suppress news of an arrest.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 .Punishment
 There have been no reports of the torture of prisoners.
 The Morena political opposition group based in Paris has
 alleged that several people detained in the Libreville
 prison on political charges have been mistreated or kept in
 harsh and degrading conditions. There are other conflicting
 reports that virtually all prisoners are allowed family
 visits, and family members report no serious mistreatment.
 Some defendants at the trial of the Morena oppositionists
 in November 1982 alleged that they had been subjected
 to beatings while in prison and that they had been confined
 without daylight or medical care. Police are believed to
 be rough but not brutal in their treatment of suspected
 criminals and prison conditions are harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In Gabon, "acts against the security of the state,' and
 'actions against the chief of state,' which can include
 advocating the nonviolent installation of a multiparty
 system, are punishable crimes. Approximately 21 members or
 alleged members of the small Morena opposition group are
 currently in prison on such charges; most were detained for
 several months before being brought to trial in 1982 and
 1983. There have been a few reports that the number of
 persons in prison for political opposition may be 25 tut
 firm information is available only on the 21 Morena members
 who were tried and sentenced to four to 15 years.
 There have been no reports of detention without trial of
 persons accused of common crimes. Routinely, extensive
 publicity is given to criminal court proceedings. Gabonese
 law, amended in September 1983, provides for up to six
 months of "preventive detention," on a judge's order, of
 suspected criminals.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In June 1983 four political dissidents were given nonpublic
 trials, with defense attorneys present, and sentenced to four-
 year prison terms. Their trial contrasted with the November
 1982 public proceedings, with representatives of the international
 press and Amnesty International present, at which 25 other
 dissidents were given prison sentences of from one to 20 years.
 (Nine of these were released in March 1983, when President Bongo
 reduced all sentences by five years.) None of the 21 political
 prisoners now known to be incarcerated was accused of advocating
 or carrying out acts of violenge. Their crimes were printing
 and distribution of antigovernment tracts, and allegedly encourag-
 ing the Government of France to use its supposed influence in
 Gabon to bring about a multiparty political system.
 Gabon's Constitution specifies that the President has the
 authority to appoint, transfer, and dismiss judicial officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There has been no evidence of significant abuses by the Government
 in this area. The various police and security units monitor dissi-
 dent political activity and do have the capability to monitor
 telephone conversations, but interference in the daily life of the
 populace is relatively rare.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are certain limits on these rights in Gabon: no direct
 public criticism of President Bongo is permitted in the country,
 and no advocacy of a multiparty political system by the media or
 individuals in Gabon is tolerated. Foreign magazines and
 newspapers, notably French publications and magazines printed
 elsewhere in Africa, which sometimes criticize the President and
 the one-party system, generally circulate freely in Gabon,
 although occasional issues of particular publications are seized
 by the police.
 The policies of the Government have been debated in public forums.
 The President and his key ministers have all submitted to lively
 direct questioning on domestic policy issues such as education,
 public housing, and transportation, and the country's single
 daily newspaper, which is government-owned, regularly prints
 columns attacking alleged inefficiency or corruption in various
 government offices. A weekly television "hot-line" program ran
 for several months in 1982 featuring each minister, who was
 required to respond to often critical and provocative questions.
 This program was not continued in 1983. The same end was
 served, to a more limited degree, by televised confrontations
 during 1983 between certain ministers and the leadership of the
 Women's Union of the political party and representatives of
 students from several institutions of higher education. President
 Bongo also participated in two such televised sessions.
 The Gabonese media carried no news from or about France from late
 October to late November, on the orders of President Bongo. The
 news blackout was in response to the publication of a book in
 France containing allegations of personal and political improprie-
 ties by the President and his Gabonese and French advisers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political activity outside the Democratic Party of Gabon is
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 10
 
 
 136
 illegal. The Morena activists were accused of organizing an
 opposition political activity, which was considered illegal even
 though there was no evidence presented that the group used or
 advocated violence.
 The Government does not interfere in other private organizations
 which individuals may wish to form. In some sectors, for
 example, sports clubs and social service organizations, there
 are national programs under Government auspices, which dominate
 the scheduling of competitions and other activities, but diverse
 private groups and events sponsored by private companies also
 exist.
 All labor union activity is under the Government-sponsored
 Gabonese Labor Confederation. This organization is closely
 tied to the governing political structure but has served as an
 advocate for workers within government councils. It has, for
 .example, successfully brought pressure for substantial wage in-
 creases in 1983. Local union chapters, including the one covering
 workers at the country's largest enterprise, the Elf-Gabon
 Petroleum Company, have in the past organized successful wildcat
 strikes to obtain wage increases and other objectives. Unemploy-
 ment among Gabonese is almost non-existent. However, some
 unemployment does exist among the 100,000 foreign workers who
 augment the country's work force. These foreigners are subject
 to minimum protection by the Government and may be fired or
 expelled to make a place for an unemployed national.
 The labor union leadership at the national level, where government
 influence is greatest, bargains for public sector employees; it
 is not active in local collective bargaining. The Labor Confedera-
 tion, and a variety of private trade associations and professional
 bodies, maintain relations with international bodies in their
 fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Gabonese Constitution guarantees the free practice of
 religion, and religious freedom and tolerance. Christian, Muslim,
 and animist religions all flourish exists in Gabon, and public
 worship is unrestricted. A number of different religious groups
 operate schools. There is no political or economic discrimination
 because of religious preference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country, foreign travel, and return to Gabon
 are normally not restricted by the Government, although government
 employees must obtain permission to travel abroad. Since mid-1983,
 the Government has slightly tightened restrictions on the entry
 and resettlement of refugees, but several people who have a "well-
 founded fear of persecution" in their country of origin have been
 given permission to stay in Gabon; they come from a variety of
 countries, including those with which Gabon has friendly bilateral
 relations. There have been no reported cases of involuntary re-
 patriation, and those refugees who wish to repatriate voluntarily
 are allowed to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Gabon is governed by a centralized, single-party regime in
 which President Omar Bongo exercises most but not all effective
 power. Major political and economic decisions are made by the
 
 
 137
 President, usually in consultation with Cabinet members. This
 --group nearly 50 strong--includes representatives of all the
 country's major ethnic, geographic, and political groupings.
 Gabon's varied interest groups are thus given access to
 political patronage. The Pang, an ethnic group comprising
 40 percent of the population, feel themselves to be underrepre-
 sented. Pear of Fang dominance by the remaining 60 percent has
 contributed to the President's political control. The need to
 maintain this balance of interests represents, therefore, the
 major check on Presidential power. The very size and complexity
 of the Government structure is another.
 Opposition political parties are not permitted. Elections below
 the Presidential level are sometimes contested, but all candidates
 must be approved by the Democratic Party of Gabon.
 Membership in the single political party is open to all Gabonese
 but is not required. Obtention of social benefits, government
 employment, or university admission does not require party member-
 ship. The party structure, which extends from local chapters up
 to a national committee, is used as a rough and imperfect channel
 for conveying the views and concerns of the local populace to
 senior government officials. Specific government actions or
 policies are occasionally criticized at party congresses, but
 this must occur within the context of loyalty to party leadership.
 Proposals presented by the leadership at party congresses at
 times have been substantially changed as a result of the debate
 and negotiation at the congress.
 Women enjoy full legal rights in Gabon and occupy government
 positions from State Secretary (vice minister) level down through
 the Government and political party organization. They are parti-
 cularly active in the judiciary. Their influence is limited by
 cultural factors but not by any legal or party regulation.
 Indeed, the President recently has been criticized for paying
 too much attention to the economic and social concerns of
 women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 President Bongo has invited representatives of Amnesty Inter-
 national and other human rights organizations to visit Gabon.
 An Amnesty International representative from Senegal was present
 in 1982 for the major human rights-related event in recent
 years, the public trial of the Morena dissidents. The United
 Nations High Commission for Refugees has had a refugee office in
 Gabon; its functions have been assumed by the United Nations
 Development Program, since the number of refugees from Equatorial
 Guinea has dropped substantially.
 In its 1983 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about
 the severity of the sentences imposed in the Morena dissidents'
 trials, and that the court proceedings did not conform to recog-
 nized international standards. The Freedom House 1983 report
 rates Gabon 'not free.")
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL. AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Gabon is a developing country which as a result of significant
 petroleum and mineral resources and a limited population has one
 of the highest per capita incomes in Africa. Estimates of the
 
 
 138
 actual per capita gross domestic product (GDP) have varied due
 to differing estimates of the country's population and fluctua-
 tions in the exchange rate. Based on a census carried out in
 1981, the Government has reported the population at 1.2 million
 which gives a per capita GDP level in 1982 of slightly under
 $3,000. Gabon has enjoyed substantial economic growth over the
 past 10 years, helped in part by the Government's policy of
 supporting private enterprise and encouraging foreign investment.
 Economic growth has stagnated over the last two years due to the
 depressed state of world markets for most Gabonese exports.
 Nevertheless, Gabon remains one of the financially strongest
 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
 In spite of its good economic record, Gabon faces the problem
 common in developing countries of trying to integrate the modern
 sector of the economy with the traditional sector based on
 semisubsistence agriculture. The traditional sector in Gabon
 confronts many of the same economic and social problems faced by
 the poorer nations in the region. As is true elsewhere, income
 distribution is skewed strongly in favor of the roughly 50
 percent of the population who live in the modern urban sector.
 The Government is attempting to ensure further economic growth
 and a more equitable distribution of national income through a
 program of investment in education, social services, infrastruc-
 ture, and agriculture. Access to the Government's social
 programs is open to all Gabonese citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. The right of both men and women to hold.private property
 is spelled out in the Constitution and is in practice fully
 protected. Pay scales are relatively high by African standards
 with the minimum wage at $125 per month.   (The apparent decline
 from the previous year is due to fluctuations in the exchange
 rate between the dollar and the African franc.) There is
 virtually no unemployment among Gabonese wishing to enter the
 wage economy. Some limited unemployment exists among the
 estimated 100,000-150,000 foreign workers residing in Gabon.
 According to the World Bank, life expectancy at birth rose from
 40.2 to 44.5 between 1970 and 1980. Estimates of infant mortality
 vary widely. The World Bank statistics report an increase from
 116 per 1,000 in 1982 to 164 per 1,000 in 1983, although health
 care in the interior is gradually being expanded. The large
 majority of the population has access to maternity clinics and
 basic health facilities. World Bank estimates of the ratio of
 available calorie supply to nutritional requirements have varied
 between 87.9 and 104 percent in recent years. There has been no
 evidence of significant malnutrition due to inadequate food
 supplies but lack of knowledge of good nutritional practices for
 children in the traditional sector remains a problem. The World
 Bank gives the primary school enrollment ratio as 102 percent.
 The Government has made school attendance compulsory and nearly
 all primary school-aged children are believed to be attending
 school.
 In recent years, women have begun to play an increasing role in
 the economic, political, and cultural life of the country, partic-
 ularly in the urban areas. The number of women in the Government
 and professions has grown steadily, and they continue to play an
 important role in retail trade. In the rural areas, cultural
 factors still tend to limit most women to their traditional role
 in agriculture, although the spread of educational opportunity
 is starting to have some impact on this, in both rural and urban
 areas. The role of women as homemakers is dominant.
