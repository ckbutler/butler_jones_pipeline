 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy and a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen is the nominal Head of State and is rep-
 resented in The Bahamas by an appointed Governor General. On August 19, 1992,
 the opposition Free National Movement (FNM) defeated the Progressive Liberal
 Party (PLP), which had governed The Bahamas since 1967. Two days later, FNM
 leader Hubert A. Ingraham took the oath of office as the new Prime Minister.

 The police and a small defense force are answerable to civilian authority and gen-
 erally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there are continuing credible
 reports that police occasionauy abuse suspects under arrest, both Bahamian citizens
 and foreigners. No figures are available from the US. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency on military spending. Indications are that these expenditures have
 been declining and are likely to continue to do so for the near future.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accunts for nearly half of The
 Bahamas' gross national product The second most important economic sector is fi-
 nancial services, particularly offshore banking.
 Bahamians enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. The
 principal human rights problems are harsh and overcrowded conditions at the na-
 tion's sole prison f cility, occasional antagonism toward the Haitian migrant com-
 munity, and the slow pace of the judicial system.
 RESPECr FOR HUMAN RIGHTh
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Estrjudiial Killing.-Poiticlly motivated killings are not
 known to occur. There continue to be instances of killings of detainees in official cus-
 tody. In Januay the police shot and killed a s   w   attempted to flee custody
 at Freeport's central police station. The Grand Bahama Human Rights Organiza-
 tion, noting that police should use no more force than necessary, called upon the
 police to investigate the shooting and report its findia. In December a coroners
 inquest exonerated the policeman involved in the shooting, concluding that the po-
 liceman had accidentally shot and killed the suspect during a struggle with him. In
 another incident in September, the police shot and killed a suspect in Nassau while
 trying to apprehend him. Police saidthat the policeman's revolver discharged during
 a struggle with the suspect. An opposition Senator called upon the Government to
 appoint an independent panel to investigate the shooting.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or govern-
 ment-sanctioned clandestine detentions during 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradig Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or degrading treatment or pun-
 ishmnent. The poie generally respect the constitutional safeguards against mistreat-
 ment, but there were crdile charges in some cases that police investigators and
 prison guards intimidated and physically abused detainees, as well as allegations
 that police used excessive force in apprehending suspects. The Police Criminal In-
 vestigation Department investigates credible allegations of abuse and disciplines
 those officers determined to be gutilty.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, The Bahamas' only prison facility, remain harsh and over-
 crowded. The prison building is old and decrepit. Originally built to house 800 in-
 mates, it often holds 1,300 or more criminals, not including the hundreds of illegal
 Haitian immigrants sometimes detained there. The men's maximum security facility
 is particularly overcrowded. Up to four male prisoners may be housed in 6- by 8-
 foot cells designed to hold no more than two. Most prisoners lack beds and many
 sleep on concrete floors. The cells have no running water and drinking water is
 often not supplied unless the prisoner has paid a trustee. anitation facilities usu-
 ally consist of a plastic bucket in each cell.Prisoners allege that requests for medi-
 cal attention are sometimes denied. Prison authorities often decline to forward pris-
 oners' letters, including letters to the courts by prisoners defending themselves.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rests and detention. Authorities conduct arrests openly and, when required, obtain
 judicially issued warrants. Cases of suspected narcotics or firearms possession, how-
 ever, d not require warrants. Suspects under arrest appear before a magistrate
 within 48 hours to hear the charges against them and generally gain access to an
 attorney of their choice. The Government respects the right to a judicial determina-
 tion or the legality of arrests. A system of bail exists, mostly for Bahamian suspects,
 as most foreign offenders are termed likely to flee if granted bail. Judges sometimes
 authorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on minor charges. The Government is ob-
 ligated to provide legal representation only to destitute suspects in cases involving
 capital crimes. Illegal migrants, mostly Haitians, have the r!ght to retain legal rep-
 resentation but are generally held at Fox Hill prison pending deportation unless
 they can arrangeprivate means for their repatriation. As a result, illegal migrants
 may be held at Fox Hill for weeks or months while awaiting repatriation. Some
 Cuban "raft people" have been allowed to live in the community if sponsors pay for
 their housing and food, but many remain in a legal limbo with no status as resi-
 dents or workers.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The justice system in The Bahamas derives from
 English common law, but shares some features of the US. legal system. The judici-
 ary is independent, appointed by the executive branch on the advice of the Judicial
 and Legal Services Commission, and conducts fair and public trials. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to appeal. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and lawyers have access to their clients. The overburdened
 judicial system must administer a rapidly increasing caseload, most of it related to
 narcotics, which often results in excessive pretrial detention and prison overcrowd-
 ing; trials can often take as long as 2 years from time of arrest to eventual convic-
 tion or acquittal.
 The Bahamas has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-As a
 rule, the Government does not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The Con-
 stitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure and usually requires a court
 order for the entry into and search of a private residence. A police inspector or more
 senior police official may authorize the search of a residence without a court order
 when probable cause exists for a weapons violation. Such an official may also au-
 thorize the search of a person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person is
 traveling) without a court order should probable cause exist for drug possession.
 Aside from restrictions on prison mail, the Government neither censors mail nor re-
 stricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression, a right that is usually respected in practice. The political opposition free-
 ly criticizes the Government. Three daily and two weekly newspapers are privately
 owned and express a variety of views on matters of public interest, including criti-
 cisms of the government and its policies. The threat of libel suits under laws un-
 changed since the 19th century sometimes causes cautious treatment of stories
 about fraud, corruption, or moral turpitude.
 A controversial parliamentary election law makes it an offense to use "foreign
 radio or television stations to broadcast any material having reference to an election
 in The Bahamas, with the aim of influencing an election, other than pursuant to
 arrangements made with the Broadcasting Corporation of The Bahamas for the
 broadcast to be received and retransmitted by the corporation." Violators of this law
 face a fine of $2,000 and/or 2 years in jail, after which they would be ineligible to
 register or vote for 7 years. The law also includes penalties against persons accused
 of "heckling" at political rallies and required that all "bills, posters and placards
 bear the name and address of the publisher." The statute establishes an Electoral
 Broadcast Council to monitor campaign coverage by the Broadcasting Corporation
 of The Bahamas for fairness. The former government defended the law by saying
 that the new law would allow the opposition freer access to national television and
 radio. No one was prosecuted under this law following the 1992 elections.
 For many years, the Government maintained a monopoly on local radio and tele-
 vision broadcasting, and the government majority in Parliament thwarted initiatives
 to secure private ownership of radio stations. The radio and television network cov-
 ered the views of the Government and the activities of government ministers ex-
 haustively and generally provided less coverage of opposition views and activities.
 Opposing viewpoints and opposition activities, however, received increased coverage
 in 1992, particularly during the election campaign. In September the new adminis-
 tration of Prime Minister Ingraham introduced legislation to permit private radio
 and television stations to operate in The Bahamas. The Parliament approved the
 bill after lively debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association. These rights are respected in practice.
 Private associations are permitted, but groups must obtain permits to hold public
 demonstrations. Such permits are freely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Full freedom of religion exists in The Bahamas, which
 has no favored or official state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Bahamians and residents of The Bahamas enjoy free movement within
 the country, and Bahamians face no impediments to foreign travel or emigration.
 The Government liberally grants passports to its citizens. The Bahamas is not a
 party to the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Cuban
 asylum seekers were treated as illegal immigrants, and in the past some were held
 in prison until a third country, usuall the United States, arranged to admit them.
 During 1992, however, treatment of &ban asylum seekers improved as the Baha-
 
 
 329
 mian Government worked with private groups to arrange temporary housing for Cu-
 bans.
 The presence of an estimated 30 to 40,000 Haitian migrants in The Bahamas re-
 mained a volatile social, economic, and political issue in 1992. During 1992, the Gov-
 ernment repatriated hundreds of Haitians to their homeland under the auspices of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). According to
 UNHCR officials who interview the refugees to determine their status, relatively
 few qualified as legitimate refugees. There were 265 Haitians in custody as illegal
 immigrants at the end of the year. Like others held at the prison, the Haitians com-
 plain of overcrowding and poor food; occasional reports of abuse of Haitians and Cu-
 bans by prison guards are difficult to confirm.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty political system,
 governed by an elected Prime Minister and Parliament. The political process is open
 to all elements of society, and citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to reg-
 ister and vote. In the 1992 elections, slightly over 92 percent of registered voters
 cast valid ballots. Registration is on a nonparty basis. The two principal political
 parties are the Free National Movement (FNM) and the Progressive Liberal Party
 (PUP). The PP led the country for 6% years of internal self-government from Janu-
 ary 1967 until independence in July 1973, and held power under Prime Minister
 Sir Lynden 0. Pindling until August 1992.
 The Bahamian people exer      their right to change their overnment in 1992.
 As a result of the August 19 general elections the opposition  ree National Move-
 ment won control of the Government from the Pogressive Liberal Party. The transi-
 tion occurred smoothly and rapidly, as new Prime Minister Hubert A. Ingraham
 took the oath of office 2 days after the elections. The new Parliament formally
 opened on September 2.
 As a result of the general elections, the FNM now holds 32 of 49 seats in the Par-
 liament's House of Assembly, while the PP holds 17. The outcome of one of two
 House of Assembly races, won narrowly by candidates of the FNM and the PLP re-
 spectively, was reviewed by an election court in late 1992. After 3 weeks of testi-
 mony from witnesses concerning voter qualification and ballot counting in one of the
 disputed races, the election court disallowed several ballots and, as a result of a sub-
 sequent recount, reversed the original outcome of the contest. No hearings have yet
 been held concerning the second disputed contest. Under the parliamentary system
 general elections must occur every 5 years, but can be called sooner.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Four local human rights groups operate in The Bahamas: the Grand Bahama
 Human Rights Organization, the New Providence Human Rights Organization, the
 Abaco Human Rights Organization, and the National Association for the Protection
 of Human Rights. These organizations operate freely and report without govern-
 ment restriction on alleged human rights violations.
 No international human rights organization sought to visit The Bahamas to inves-
 tigate human rights conditions during 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights and freedoms regardless of race,
 place of origin, political opinion, creed, or sex of the individual. However the Con-
 stitution does distinguish between the sexes in that it does not provide Bahamian
 women equal ability to bestow citizenship upon their foreign-born spouses. Addition-
 ally, nationality laws confer citizenship more easily on the children of Bahamian
 men than on those of Bahamian women in marriages involving two nationalities.
 The FNM pledged in its party platform to "accord non-Bahamian spouses of Baha-
 mian women the same privileges as those afforded the spouses of Bahamian men."
 Women participate fully in Bahamian society and are well represented in the busi-
 ness and professional sectors, as well as in _the judiciary and in government. The
 new Prime Minister, for example, appointed three women to his Cabinet. Baha-
 mians elected 4 women to the 49-member House of Assembly, including a par-
 liamentarian later elected as Deputy Speaker of the House. The parties also ap-
 pointed 3 women to the 16-member Senate, including one appointed as the govern-
 ment leader in the Senate.
 Domestic violence againstomemen continued to be an issue of concern, with ind-
 ndent women's support gups reporting that many women sought shelter at the
 men's Crisis Center in Nassau. Women may have their cases heard in a closed
 domestic court and may seek a restraining order against an abusive spouse or male
 
 
 330
 companion. Women's rights groups speak freely on ways to improve the condition
 of women and children, including safeguarding their physical safety.
 According to the Women's Crisis Centre of the public Princess Margaret Hospital
 child abuse and neglect rose in the Bahamas durin 1992. The hospital reported
 that, during the first 10 months of 1992, it received reports of 195 cases of rape,
 sexual molestation, and incest involving victims, both male and female, between the
 ages of 1 and 19. Actual figures could be much higher than the reported cases. Dur-
 ing the first 9 months of 1992, the hospital's accident and emergency department
 treated 90 minors, ranging in age from birth to 14 years, with a history of sexual
 abuse. In November the Bahamian Government and the Women's Crisis Centre em-
 phasized the need to combat child abuse through a public awareness program with
 the theme "it shouldn't hurt to be a child."
 Many Haitians in the Bahamas are illegal immigrants and face economic and so-
 cial deprivation. A major campaign issue in 1992 involved how to contend with the
 growing Haitian population. Many Bahamians view the Haitians as unwelcome
 guests who are a #rain on the economy, contribute to the moral decline of the coun-
 try, and have no constitutional rights. The previous government asserted that it
 could no longer allocate scarce resources to care for Haitian migrants, and that na-
 tive Bahamians were demanding "immediate action" to reduce the number of mi-
 grants significantly. The new Government announced plans to build a "transit cen-
 ter" for Haitian migrants in the Bahamas, in which they would be held pending re-
 patriation.
 The original inhabitants of the Bahamas, the Lucuyan Indians, perished during
 the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Therefore, The Bahamas has no indigenous
 peoples. The Bahamian population consists primarily of descendants of subsequent
 European, African, and U.S. (Loyalist) settlers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifically grants labor unions the
 rights of free assembly and association. Workers may form or join unions without
 prior authorization, except for members of the police force defense force, fire bri-
 gade, and prison guards, all of whom are forbidden by the Constitution to organize.
 This right is exercised extensively, particularly in the hotel industry where approxi-
 mately 80 percent of the employees are unionized.
 The two major labor organizations in The Bahamas, the 8,000-member Bahamas
 Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union and the 12,000-member Trade Union Con-
 gress, function independently of actual government or political party control. All Ba-
 hamian labor unions are guaranteed the right to maintain affiliations with inter-
 national trade union organizations. The TUC, which groups 10 of the country's 44
 registered unions, is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions and the Caribbean Congress of Labor.
 The right to strike is limited under the Industrial Relations Act, which requires
 that union members must vote to strike and that the motion must be passed by a
 simple majority before a strike can commence. The Ministry of Labour oversees the
 vote. The Ministry may also refer a dispute involving employees of an "essential
 service" to the Industrial Relations Board for settlement if the Ministry determines
 public interest requires such action. The Industrial Relations Act also states that
 a strike which has an object "other than or in addition to the furtherance of a trade
 dispute within the trade or industry in which the strikers are engaged' or "is de-
 signed or calculated to coerce the Government either directly or by inflicting hard-
 ship upon the community" is illegal.
 Various labor unions engaged in protests and sick-outs, especially during the
 weeks before the general elections, to press for wage demands and resolution of
 grievances.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize,
 and collective bargaining is extensive for the 30,000 workers (25 percent of the work
 force) who are unionized. Collective bargaining is protected in law and freely prac-
 ticed, and the Ministry of Labour is responsible for mediating disputes. Wages are
 set in free negotiations between unions and employers without government involve-
 ment.
 Both the Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers. The Industrial Relations Act requires employers to recog-
 nize trade unions. The Industrial Relations Board within the Ministry of Labour
 mediates and conciliates disputes between individual employees or unions and their
 employers. Mechanisms exist to resolve complaints: filing a trade dispute with the
 Ministry of Labour, or bringing a civil suit against the employer in a court of law.
 The Industrial Relations Act requires the reinstatement of workers fired for union
 activities. Employers may dismiss workers in accordance with applicable contracts,
 
 
 which generally require some severance pay. The Bahamian Government uniformly
 enforces labor laws and regulations throughout the country; however, inspections
 only occur infrequently.
 Two small, but not particularly active, free trade zones exist in The Bahamas.
 Labor law and practice in these zones do not differ from those in the rest of the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor does not exist in practice.
 . Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-While no laws prohibit the em-
 ployment of children below a certain age, compulsory education for children up to
 the age of 14 years and high unemployment rates among adult workers tend to dis-
 courage child employment. Nonetheless, some children sell newspapers along major
 thoroughfares and work at grocery stores and gasoline stations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period. The Act
 requires overtime payment (time and a half) for hours in excess of the standard.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act permits the creation of a wages council to recommend
 the establishment of a minimum wage; to date, no such council has been estab-
 lished.
 The Ministry of Labour, which is responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team
 of several inspectors who make on-site visits to enforce occupational health and
 safety standards and investigate employee concerns and complaints. The Ministry
 normally announces these inspection visits ahead of time. Employers generally co-
 operate with inspections in implementing safety standards. The Bahamian economy
 is service-oriented, especially in tourism and offshore banking, and therefore does
 not have significant industrial and occupational health hazards. The national insur-
 ance program provides for compensation for work-related injuries. The Act also re-
 quires an employer to find suitable alternative emploment for an employee who is
 injured on the job but is still able to work.
