 BAHRAIN
 The Al Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late
 18th century and dominates its society and government. The
 Constitution confirms the Amir as hereditary ruler. The
 current Amir, Shaikh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa, governs Bahrain
 with the assistance of his brother, the Prime Minister; his
 son, the Crown Prince; and an appointed Cabinet of Ministers.
 The Government has suspended some provisions of Bahrain's 1973
 Constitution, including those articles relating to the National
 Assembly, which the Government disbanded in 1975. There are
 few judicial checks on the Amir and his Government.
 Bahrain is a relatively heterogeneous society in which social .
 ties .and interpersonal associations are formed in a complex web
 of family, tribal, economic, and religious affiliations.
 Bahrain is divided between the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam,
 with the Shi'a comprising over two-thirds of the indigenous
 population. There are important sectarian divisions among the
 Shi'a. Despite their minority status, the Sunnis predominate
 because the ruling family, supported by the military, security
 forces, and powerful merchant families, is Sunni.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security.
 Under its auspices, the police force and the Security Service
 are responsible for maintaining internal order and preventing
 sectarian violence and terrorist actions. The state security
 apparatus in Bahrain is extensive and highly effective. The
 past year witnessed a decrease in credible reports of human
 rights violations. In part, the decrease may be due to the
 perception of a lessened security threat, both domestic and
 international. There were no confirmed reports of torture by
 security forces in 1991.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government ownership of many
 basic industries, including the oil industry. Possessing
 limited oil reserves, Bahrain has diversified its economic
 base, attracting companies doing business in financial
 services, petrochemicals, and light manufacturing. It has used
 its oil revenues to build an advanced infrastructure in
 transportation and teleconmunications and has become a leading
 regional financial center. The economy suffered from the
 decline in oil prices beginning in 1986; Iraq's invasion of
 Kuwait further depressed business confidence. In the post-Gulf
 War period, business confidence and investment have recovered
 significantly.
 Civil liberties remain closely circumscribed. Principal human
 rights problems continue to include the denial of citizens'
 right to change their government, the occasional practice of
 arbitrary and incommunicado detention, and the absence of
 impartial inspection of detention and prison facilities, as
 well as restrictions on the right to a fair public trial,
 freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly and
 association, women's rights, and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political or other extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 1345
 BAHRAIN
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. There were no credible reports
 of torture in 1991. There were few reliable reports about what
 happens during detention in security prisons, since visits by
 nonofficial persons are generally prohibited. However,
 Bahrain's small size, and the complex web of family, tribal,
 economic and religious affiliations which criss-cross society,
 would make it extremely difficult for the Government to conceal
 such practices were they frequent or systematic.
 The Government continues to deny categorically that torture
 takes place, but to date it has not implemented the procedural
 safeguards consistent with international norms that would help
 deter such practices. Allegations of torture, regardless of
 their validity, are lent credence by government policies
 allowing the practice of incommunicado detention and detention
 without trial. There were no known instances of authorities
 being punished for committing human rights abuses in previous
 years.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Political activity is strictly controlled by the security
 forces, and persons may be detained and arrested for attempting
 to exercise the rights of free speech, association, or other
 rights,- often on suspicion of antiregime activity. The
 Government's assessment that domestic and international threats
 to its stability and security have diminished has resulted in
 some loosening of control on some activities which previously
 might have been considered "subversive." Activities that could
 lead, under provisions of the security law, to detention,
 questioning, warnings, or arrest include membership in illegal
 organizations or those deemed subversive; painting antiregime
 slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations;
 possessing or circulating antiregim  writings; preaching
 sermons with an extreme Islamic fundamentalist or a "radical"
 political tone; or harboring or associating with persons
 committing such acts.
 According to the State Security Act of 1974, persons accused of
 subversive or antiregime acts may be detained without trial for
 a period not to exceed 3 years. Detained persons have the
 right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal after a period
 of 3 months, and, if the appealis denied, thereafter every 6
 months from the date of the original detention. Bahraini
 authorities are known to detain suspects without charge and
 hold them in incommunicado detention, often for periods of up
 to 3 months. Abdullah Fakhro was held without charge for 6
 months in 1991 for publicly praising Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
 and calling on Saddam Hussein to invade Bahrain. The
 Government denies that it is currently holding any prisoners
 without charge and claims that none of the prisoners awaiting
 trial have been chargdd under the 1974 State Security Act.
 The Ministry of Interior, which oversees the Security Service
 and police, also controls the office of the public prosecutor,
 whose judges initially determine if sufficient evidence exists
 to continue to hold a prisoner in "investigatory detention."
 The Ministry is also responsible for all aspects of prison
 
 
 1346
 BAHRAIN
 administration, giving prisoners and their attorneys no
 recourse to any authority outside of the Ministry of Interior
 in the early stages of detention.
 In the past there have been confirmed reports that, without
 benefit of trial, young Bahraini men suspected of
 antigovernment activity have been forced to reside outside of
 Bahrain.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Procedures in Bahrain's Security Court do not meet
 international standards for fair trials. A person arrested may
 be tried in either an ordinary criminal court or, if required
 by the prosecution, the Security Court. Ordinary civil or
 criminal court trials provide procedural guarantees, including
 open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid available when
 necessary), and the right to appeal. Security cases are tried
 directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as the
 Security Court. Such proceedings are held in secret, and there
 is no right to judicial review of the legality of arrests. The
 Security Court is exempted from adhering to the procedural
 guarantees of the penal code. There are unconfirmed reports
 that convictions in the Security Court can be based on
 confessions alone, obtained while in official custody and
 possibly elicited under duress. Bahraini attorneys are
 appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs to act
 as counsel. Some defense attorneys assert that they are denied
 access to "secret information" upon which accusations against
 their clients are based. Sentences imposed by the Security
 Court may, at the discretion of the court or the desire of the
 defendant's family, be referred to the Amir for clemency.
 The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) maintains a separate court
 system for military personnel accused of offenses under the
 military code. These courts do not review cases involving
 civilian criminal or security offenses.
 It is impossible to determine the number of political prisoners
 in Bahrain because the Government does not release data on
 cases involving security offenses, such cases are not tried in
 open court, and prisoners convicted of security offenses are
 not always allowed visits. Government officials have stated
 that there are currently only 300 people in Bahraini jails,
 including those who claim to be political prisoners. Credible
 sources indicate that, while the overall number of prisoners
 has probably decreased in the past year, between 100 and 150
 persons who claim to be political prisoners remain in Bahraini
 jails. On March 17, in commemoration of the first day of
 Ramadan, the Government released, as is customary, a group of
 some 40 prisoners. Of those released, 18 may have
 characterized themselves as political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 .Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry is empowered to authorize entry into
 private premises without judicial authorization, although such
 authorization by the Ministry is said to be infrequent.
 Telephone calls and correspondence are subject to monitoring.
 Police informer networks are extensive and effective.
 
 
 1347
 BAHRAIN
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution provides for the right "to express and
 propagate opinions," in practice, Bahrainis cannot freely
 challenge the legitimacy of the regime in speech or writing.
 Political meetings are not permitted. Gatherings which might
 take on a political tone are monitored.
 In the wake of the Gulf War, some governmental restrictions on
 freedomof speech and assembly have been informally relaxed.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide power over the local
 media, and the press generally follows official policy
 closely. Self-censorship of stories on sensitive topics is
 routine. In the past, minor deviations have brought closure
 of the offending newspapers. The Government also does not
 condone unfavorable coverage of its domestic affairs by the
 international media and has on occasion revoked the press
 credentials of offending journalists. Since the Ministry also
 sponsors the jqurnalists' residence permits, such actions can
 easily lead td deportation.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television
 stations. Iranian radio and television broadcasts (in Arabic
 and Farsi) are accessible. Many senior government officials,
 ruling family members, some businessmen, and the major hotels
 use satellite dishes to view international broadcasts. The
 use of satellite dishes by private citizens to pull in
 television signals from outside Bahrain has greatly
 multiplied. Cable News Network is now broadcast 24 hours a
 day on a local channel without censorship, and BBC World News
 Service is carried on a local channel approximately 18 hours a
 day, also uncensored. U.S. Armed Forces Radio is also
 available. All newspapers are nominally privately owned and
 exercise self-censorship in reporting on antiregime activities
 and in criticizing the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of free assembly,
 public political demonstrations or meetings are prohibited.
 Political organizations are also prohibited, but the large
 number of social and sports clubs have traditionally served as
 forums for discreet political discussion, although even these
 are closely monitored by the Government. The Government has
 recently introduced a requirement that all social and sports
 clubs include clauses in their founding documents barring any
 form of political activity. The Bahrain Bar Society (BBS)
 refused to include such a clause in its constitution but,
 after extended negotiations with the Ministry of Labor, was
 issued an organization permit without the clause. Without
 permits, organizations are technically illegal. Permits for
 religious rites, including for Shi'a ceremonies, are routinely
 granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Muslim, and Islam is the
 state religion. Christians and other non-Muslims, including
 Jews, Hindus, and Baha'is have long enjoyed considerable
 freedom to practice their religion and build places of
 worship. Adherents of other faiths also maintain places of
 worship; some small groups worship in their homes. Religious
 tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of sermons delivered by
 
 
 1348
 
 BAHRAIN
 famous Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications
 of other religions are readily available in Bahrain.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is not encouraged and
 anti-Islamic writings are prohibited, but conversions from
 Islam to other religions are tolerated. Both Sunni and Shi'a
 sects are subject to government control and monitoring, but
 there is no interference with routine worship, preaching, or
 religious activities. Public religious events, most notably
 commemorative marches by the Shi'a, are permitted but are
 closely watched by the police. Prior to the Iraqi invasion
 and occupation of Kuwait, there were no restrictions on the
 number of-Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a
 shrines and holy sites in Iraq. Such pilgrimages are not
 curreptly feasible owing to conditions inside Iraq. Religious'
 study in, and pilgrimages to, Iran were strongly discouraged
 in the past, although restrictions on all travel to Iran have
 been relaxed in recent months.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. Passports, however, can be denied
 on political grounds. At least 3 to 5 percent of the
 indigenous Bahraini population, mostly Persian-origin Shi'a,
 do not have passports and cannot readily obtain them.
 Bahrainis living abroad who are suspected of political or
 criminal offenses may face imprisonment upon return to
 Bahrain. There have been recent credible reports that
 opponents of the regime and their families have been refused
 permission to return to'Bahrain after traveling abroad.
 Refugees are not repatriated to countries from which they have
 fled. Generally, Bahrain does not resettle refugees, although
 it did accept more than 7,500 Kuwaitis during the Gulf War,
 almost all of whom have now returned to Kuwait. There are
 some Iranian emigres who have fled Iran since 1979 and have
 permission to remain in Bahrain, but they have not been
 granted citizenship. A second group in a similar situation is
 the 3,000 to 5,000 Persian-origin, Shi'a Bahrainis who enjoy
 less than full citizenship under the Bahraini Citizenship Act
 of 1963. The law does not address the citizenship of those
 who were not registered with Bahraini authorities as citizens
 prior to 1959, creating a legal lacuna for these persons and
 their descendants.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right or ability to change peacefully
 their government or their political system. Since the 1975
 abolition of the National Assembly, there have been no formal
 democratic institutions, and neither political parties nor
 opposition organizations are permitted. Bahrain is a
 hereditary monarchy ruled by the Al Khalifa family, headed by
 ,.the Amir. All government positions are appointive. About
 one-third of the cabinet ministers are Shi'a, although they do
 not hold key portfolios. The average Bahraini can attempt to
 influence government decisions through submission of written
 petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including appeals to the Amir and other officials at their
 public audiences, called majlises.
 Four clandestine political groups seek change in Bahrain.
 The Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the group
 
 
 1349
 BAHRAIN
 responsible for a 1981 coup attempt, is almost exclusively
 militant Shi'a in its makeup and calls for violent revolution
 and a strict theocratic state . The Bahraini Islamic Call
 Party advocates a relatively moderate form of populist Islam
 and demands reforms in the social and economic structure of
 Bahrain and the establishment of an Islamic republic. Both
 have ties to Iran and attract some support from younger
 disaffected Shi'a. Both organizations have become less active
 over the past 2 years. Two underground, secular leftist
 groups exist, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain
 and the National Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. Both
 have ties to radical Arab regimes and Arab nationalist
 organizations. Their influence has also declined in recent
 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Given the restrictions on freedom of association and
 expression in Bahrain, any independent, domestically based
 investigation and public criticism of the Government's human
 rights policies would face major obstacles. The Government
 has consistently characterized charges of torture and denial
 of access by families and lawyers to detainees as "baseless."
 The Government indicated during 1991 that it'intends to invite
 Amnesty International and the International Committee of the
 Red Cross to visit Bahrain but by year's end had not.yef done
 SO.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a
 more favored status in Bahrain than the Shi'a, who form
 approximately two-thirds of the population. Sunnis generally
 receive preference for employment in sensitive positions,
 including in the Bahraini Defense Force and managerial ranks
 in the public sector. Shi'a tend to be employed in lower
 paid, lesser skilled jobs. Social and municipal services in
 most Shi'a neighborhoods, particularly in rural villages, are
 inferior to those found in Sunni urban communities. In an
 effort to remedy social discrimination, improve living
 conditions for the Shi'a and encourage integration, 'he
 Government has built numerous subsidized housing complexes
 open to all Bahrainis on the basis of financial need.
 Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of Bahraini
 women. Specific rights vary according to Shi'a or Sunni
 interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the person's
 faith or the court in which various contracts have been made,
 for example in the case of marriage. A common complaint by
 women's groups concerns inequality of wages and opportunity in
 the workplace. While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the
 right to initiate a divorce, the court may refuse such a
 request. Women of either sect may own and inherit property
 and may represent their own interest in all public and legal
 matters. In the absence'of a direct male heir, Shi'a women
 may inherit all property; in contrast, Sunni women-in the
 absence of a direct male heir--inherit only a portion of all
 property, with the balance being divided among uncles and
 (male) cousins of the deceased.
 According to Islamic tradition, a woman generally ceases to
 have responsibility for her children after they reach the age
 
 
 1350
 BAHRAIN
 of 7 in deference to the father; in the case of proven
 incompetence on the husband's part, this is not applied. A
 non-Bahraini woman automatically loses custody of her children
 if she is married to, and divorces, their Bahraini father.
 Women may obtain passports without the permission of a male
 head of the household and may exit the country without his
 permission. Bahraini women are free to wear the clothing of
 their choice (a large percentage wear Western dress outside
 the home), to work outside the home, and to drive a car
 without an escort. With the development of the Bahraini
 economy, women have increasingly taken jobs previously
 reserved for men. Women now constitute about 20 percent of
 the Bahraini work force. The Government has encouraged the
 hiring of women, enacted special laws to promote female entry
 -into the work force, and is itself a leading employer of
 women. Generally, women work outside the home during the
 years between secondary school or university and marriage.
 Women make up the majority of students at Bahrain's
 universities. Women's organizations exist which have as a
 goal the betterment of the status of women under both civil
 and Islamic law.
 Violence against women is known to occur, but knowledge of
 such incidents is usually kept within the family in this
 traditional society, and it is difficult to judge its extent.
 In general, there is virtually no public attention to or
 discussion of violence against women and no government
 policies that address it. There are very few known instances
 of Bahraini women seeking redress for violence in court.
 More evidence exists regarding violence against expatriate
 women working in Bahrain as domestics. Cases of domestics
 b aten badly enough to require hospitalization continue to be
 reported to the police and, in the past, have been covered in
 the local newspapers. Most victims are too intimidated to sue
 their employers. Those who do, however, appear to receive a
 sympathetic hearing from the courts.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Although the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, there are no trade unions, primarily because the
 Government actively discourages them. Strikes are not
 permitted. In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's and
 in 1965 and 1974, the Government encouraged--and now closely
 controls--the formation of elected workers' committees in
 major companies. Since 1982, when the Government granted
 permission to form the first joint labor-management
 consultative committee (JCC), 13 JCC's have been established
 in the major industries. The JCC's represent close to 70
 percent of the island's indigenous industrial labor force.
 Nonindustrial expatriate workers, who comprise about 60
 percent.of the overall work force, are denied even these
 limited rights. The Bahrain Labor Committee, established in
 1983 by law, is a nongovernmental organization which oversees
 and coordinates the work of the JCC's. The Committee also
 hears complaints from workers, Bahraini and expatriate alike,
 and assists them in bringing their complaints to the attention
 of the Ministry of Labor or the courts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no collective bargaining units or contracts. As
 
 
 1351
 BAHRAIN
 noted above, in 13 key industries employing significant
 numbers of Bahrainis the Government has sanctioned the
 formation of JCC's comprised of employee representatives and
 representatives from management. While these JCC's, are
 empowered to resolve labor disputes, organize workers'
 services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and raising
 productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized
 vehicle for addressing these or other labor-related issues.
 Minimum wages in Bahrain are established by Council of
 Ministers' decree. Increases in wages above the minimum are
 negotiated between management and labor, with government
 salaries for comparable work serving as an informal
 guideline. There are two export processing zones, but labor
 law and practice are the same in these zones as in the rest of
 the country.
 c. Prohibition- of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited, and the
 Labor Ministry is charged with enforcing the law. The press
 has reported instances in which private sector employers have
 occasionally compelled expatriate workers from developing
 nations to perform work not specified in their contracts.
 Once a complaint has been lodged by a worker with a grievance,
 the Labor Ministry opens an investigation and often takes
 appropriate remedial action. Many abuses, however, probably
 go unreported (see Section 6.e.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 16 years. Juveniles between
 the age of 14 and 16 receive special protection under the
 labor laws. They may not be employed in hazardous conditions
 or at night and may not work over 6 hours per day or on a
 piecework basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by
 Ministry of Labor inspectors, although child labor outside the
 industrial sector is less well monitored.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage scales, set by government decree, exist for both
 private and public sector employees and generally afford a
 decent standard of living for workers and their families. For
 expatriate workers, employers consider benefits such as annual
 repatriation, housing, and education bonuses as part of the
 salary.
 In practice, however, expatriate workers are disadvantaged by
 the requirement that all foreigners must be sponsored by
 Bahrainis or Bahrain-based institutions and companies in order
 to work. Under this system, sponsors may cancel the residence
 permit of any person under their sponsorship and thereby
 blacklist them so that--they cannot obtain entry or residence
 visas from another sponsor. Such power contains the potential
 for exploitation, since foreign workers are often unwilling to
 report abuses of their rights for fear of forced repatriation.
 Instances of expatriate workers being denied their guaranteed
 holidays, days off, and vacations without compensation have
 been reported by the English-language daily newspaper, which
 serves as an unofficial ombudsman for the expatriate
 community.
 Bahrain's Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, mandates acceptable conditions of work for all
 adult workers, including adequate standards regarding hours of
 
 
 1352
 BAHRAIN
 work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health.
 Bahrain's labor law does not recognize the concept of equal
 pay for equal work. Asian workers are paid lower wages than
 their Bahraini counterparts (excluding housing and educational
 allowances). Westerners and Bahraini workers are paid
 comparable wages; women are generally paid less than men.
 Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity leave and
 nursing periods during the day.
