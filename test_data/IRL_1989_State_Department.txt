 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are guaranteed by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive
 Irish governments have had to deal with the spillover into the
 Republic of violence from Northern Ireland. That violence led
 Irish authorities to adopt special legislation in 1984 granting
 the police increased powers to detain and interrogate those
 suspected of acts of terrorism. During 1989 Irish officials
 continued to apply such special legislation with restraint.
 The Irish economy, based largely on free enterprise, has grown
 rapidly as a result of long-term policies of industrialization
 and diversification. It performed well in 1989 despite
 continued fiscal austerity and unemployment of about 17
 percent. Exports were strong, and the budget deficit was
 reduced.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance
 to the observance and maintenance of human rights, both in
 theory and prictice at home and abroad, and there were few, if
 any, reports of human rights abuses during 1989.
 Discrimination (and violence) against women remains a human
 rights problem,
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In the past, politically motivated killings have occurred in
 Ireland as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland.
 In these cAses, such groups as the. Provisional Irish
 Republican Army (PIRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army
 (INLA) usually claim responsibility. In 1989 two such
 killings kook place in the Republic's border area with
 Northern Ireland. The 'Government uses the full force of law
 to pursue and-pxosecute such cases, wherever possible.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected in practice by the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person shall be deprived of
 personal liberty only in accordance with the law. The same
 section of the Constitution provides for a judicial
 determination'of the legality of a person's detention and
 requires in such cases that the arresting authorities make'
 written explanation to the court about the person concerned.
 Neither in law nor in practice is anyone subject to arrest for
 the expression of political or religious views.
 
 
 1160
 Short-term detention without charge exists but is restricted.
 It is permitted for a maximum of 48 hours in cases covered by
 the Offenses Against the State Act of 1939, legislation
 designed to "prevent actions and conduct calculated to
 undermine public order and the authority of the State." This
 legislation was reactivated in 1972 and broadened to include
 other "scheduled offenses" against peace and order. The
 police may now arrest and detain for questioning anyone
 suspected of any offense involving firearms, explosives,
 membership in an unlawful organization, or malicious damage to
 property. After the 48-hour period, the person must be
 brought before a magistrate, presented with written charges,
 and given legal representation.
 The Omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives some increased
 powers to the police in the area of detention for
 interrogation. Critics of the 1984 act have argued that those
 increased powers, which did not come into effect until 1987,
 following implementation of the companion complaints
 procedure, are out of proportion to the threat addressed and
 are unhealthy for democracy. Defenders of this legislation
 counter that two issues of human rights are at stake: the
 right of citizens to be protected against crime, along with
 the safeguarding of individual rights from abuse by police.
 Neither incommunicado detention nor exile is used. With
 regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. A defendant has the right to legal
 counsel. The courts are independent, and jury trial is the
 norm. The Constitution provides, however, for the creation of
 "special courts" to deal with cases where the "ordinary courts
 are inadequate to secure the effective administration of
 justice, and the preservation of public peace and order." The
 Offenses Against the State Act of 1939 formally set up such
 courts and provided that they may try persons for offenses
 against national security, particularly cases of political
 violence perpetrated by terrorist groups likely to intimidate
 regular juries. Rather than having juries, these courts have
 panels of judges, each consisting of an uneven number of
 judges, but in any event not less than three. Their verdicts
 are by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally are similar
 to those of regular courts, except that the sworn statement of
 a police chief superintendent that the accused is a member of
 an illegal organization is considered prima facie evidence of
 such membership. Court sessions are usually public but may
 exclude certain persons, other than genuine press
 representatives. There is provision for free legal aid and
 appeal against conviction or sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 basic human right of noninterference with personal privacy,
 family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and
 generally observed. The Constitution, however, provides that
 the State shall enact no law "providing for the grant of the
 dissolution of marriage." A proposal to amend the
 Constitution to permit divorce in limited circumstances was
 overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986 nationwide referendum. In
 the same year, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that
 
 
 1161
 IRELAND
 the absence of divorce is not a breach of the European
 Convention on Human Rights.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. The State endeavors to
 insure that organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty
 of expression (including criticism of government policy), are
 not used to undermine public order, morality, or the authority
 of the State. Furthermore, "publication or utterance of
 blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, official censorship is directed largely toward
 pornographic material.- Nonetheless, the state-owned radio and
 television network, on the basis of the constitutional
 provisions dealing with public order and the authority of the
 State, denies air time to members of a list of organizations
 including (Provisional) Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
 the illegal Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). In 1982
 this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme Court
 and upheld on constitutional grounds. All political parties
 not on the list are-given access to both publicly owned radio
 and television facilities and major independent daily
 newspapers. Criticism of the Government in such media is
 allowed and it flourishes. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedpiq ofPeaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such
 as PIRA and INLA, however, are illegal, and membership in them
 is an offense against national security. Political parties or
 groups associated with such organizations, such as
 (Provisional) Sinn Fein, are not proscribed.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.A.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ireland is 94 ercent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 provides for freedom of religion, and there are no
 restrictions upon freedom of worship. Discrimination in
 employment, education, and other fields based on religious
 grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish laws, such as the
 prohibition againstdivorce, reflect the point of view of the
 majority of the population. The area of family law--including
 the rights of illegitimate children--is the subject of current
 debate in which minority religious communities have felt fully
 at liberty to take a vocal and active role.
 d. 'Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as
 well as freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary repatriation. Irish authorities have accepted
 asylum-seekers only on a limited basis and firmly apply
 international definitions to those who claim refugee status.

 Section 3 Respect for.Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ireland has enjoyed a consistent history of orderly transfer
 of power by elections since the end of the Irish civil war in
 1923. The country has several political parties and provision
 for independents to stand for election to either house of the
 Irish Parliament. The constitutional requirement that
 elections be held at least every 7 years has always been met.
 Ireland uses a proportional voting system, and the secrecy of
 the ballot is fully safeguarded. There is universal suffrage
 for those over 18 years of age.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Irish governments generally cooperate with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although they
 have not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 The Irish Council for Civil Liberties operates freely and
 without hindrance as the principal independent organization
 interested in domestic human rights issues.
 Ireland has held the vice-chairmanship of the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission, reflecting concern by both the Government
 and people for worldwide respect for basic human rights. This
 concern is reflected as well in support for Amnesty
 International's activities in other countries.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based On Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide adequate shelter, nutrition,
 health care, and education without regard to race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. People whose
 means are inadequate and who are not entitled to other benefits
 may receive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 The Anti-Discrimination (pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment
 Equality Act of 1977 seek to provide protection and redress
 against sex and pay discrimination. Their operation is
 monitored by the Employment Equality Agency. The number of
 cases has fallen in recent years, but this has not been
 accompanied by real progress in eliminating the differential
 in the key index of average hourly earnings in industry. In
 June 1988, women's hourly earnings in the manufacturing sector
 were 67 percent of men's earnings.
 According to women activists, violence directed specifically
 against women, including wife beating, is not acceptable in
 Irish society. Nevertheless, violence against women occurs,
 although its extent is not reliably known. Police frequently
 are reluctant to bring domestic problems into court, and women
 do not readily seek redress under the law for abuses committed
 against them. The women's 4ovement continues to highlight
 family law, rape law reform, and social welfare discrimination
 as problem areas.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 There is no basic law governing trade union activities. The
 
 
 1163
 IRELAND
 right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to
 refrain-from joining. Most businesses (covering over 56
 percent of the labor force) are unionized.
 The Irish Congress.of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents
 unions'in.both the Republic.and Northern Ireland, has 81
 member unions with 663,000 members. Both the ICTU and the
 unaffiliated unions are independent of the Government and of
 the political parties. The ICTU is affiliated with the
 European Trade Union Confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage in
 free collective bargaining. Most terms and conditions of
 employment are determined through collective bargaining. As
 part of the industrial relations machinery, the Labour Court,
 consisting of an employer representative, a trade union
 representative, and an independent chairman, may investigate
 trade union disputes, recommend the terms of settlement,
 engage in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint
 committees to regulate conditions of employment and minimum
 rates of pay for-workers in-a given trade or industry. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist. For a number of years, however, the Committee of
 Experts of the International Labor-Organization (ILO) has
 urged the Government to bring an 1894 merchant seaman's law,
 still on the books, into conformity with ILOConvention 105 on
 the Abolition of Forced Labor which Ireland has ratified. The
 Governmuent hap assured the Committee that the provisions in
 question regarding disciplinary measures for seamen have not
 been used in recent times and that steps are under way to
 amend the legislation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14 years with the written
 permission of the parents. Irish laws limit the hours of
 employment for 15-year-olds to 8 hours per day and 40 hours
 per week. Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up to 9
 hours per day and 40 hours per week. These provisions are
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no general minimum wage legislation. However, some
 workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to
 specific industrial sectors, mainly those which tend to pay
 lower than average wages. The 1988 average weekly wage of
 $310 for production and transport workers was generally
 adequate to provide an acceptable standard of living. Working
 hours in the industrial sector are limited to 9 hours per day
 and 48 hours per week. Overtime work is limited to 2 hours
 per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. Four
 basic laws dealing with occupational safety provide adequate
 coverage. An extensive system of public health insurance
 offers health protection.
