 UNITED KINGDOM
 The tradition of constitutional and common law in the
 United Kingdom and the sanctity of individual rights
 are the basis upon which the concept of personal and
 political liberty originated in Britain and the United
 States. From the benchmark of the Magna Carta, through
 its pioneering of workers' rights during the industrial
 revolution, to its present-day record regarding respect
 for the integrity of the person, respect for civil and
 political liberties, and parliamentary sensitivity to
 the basic needs of its people, the UK has found itself
 in the forefront of the West's slow but steady evolution
 towards modern-day practices.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In a 1976 report, the European Commission on Human Rights
 announced its findings in a 1971 case brought by the
 Irish Government, which the British Government did not
 contest. The Commission found that five interrogation
 techniques used by the security forces in Northern
 Ireland in fourteen suspected terrorist cases in 1971
 constituted a breach of Article 3 of the European
 Convention on Human Rights, which forbids torture and
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The
 European Court of Human Rights subsequently rejected the
 torture allegations in a January 1978, decision.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Court, in its 1978 decision, found that the so-called
 sensory deprivation techniques constituted a breach of
 Article 3 of the Convention in that they amounted to
 inhuman and degrading treatment. The UK had already
 announced in March 1972 that these techniques had been
 abandoned and that substantial compensation had been
 awarded to those involved.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Terrorism in Northern Ireland has presented the
 Government with a serious problem of protecting the rights

 and safety of the population as a whole in the province
 in recent years. Acting from the premise that the fun-
 damental "right to life" was in serious jeopardy in Nor-
 thern Ireland, the British Government proposed and Parlia-
 ment adopted two acts which provide it with powers to
 deal with the threat: the prevention of Terrorism
 (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1976 and the Northern
 Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1973. The latter
 was the subject of a derogation by the European Commis-
 sion on Human Rights in its report of September, 1976,
 which found that detention without trial under the Act
 (discontinued in December, 1975) had been justified as
 "strictly required by the exigencies of the situation"
 under Article 15 (1) of the European Convention on
 Human Rights. Although both these Acts empower the
 restriction of personal liberties, they are subject to
 close scrutiny in Parliament and to mandatory renewal
 of frequent intervals.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The United Kingdom is a world-leader in the fulfillment of
 the basic human needs of its people. It was a pioneer in
 developing primary and secondary education and a government
 sponsored health-care system, and continued to provide fully
 for the basic needs of its citizens with regard to food and
 shelter. The UK has ratified the United Nations Convention
 on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 
 
 321
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Civil and political liberties are well-protected in the UK.
 Britain is a party to the United Nations Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights. As noted above, the UK differs from
 many democracies in having no written constitution of basic
 law defining the powers of Government and the rights of
 the governed. There is some interest in political circles
 in the desirability of a Bill of Rights on the US model.
 With respect to Northern Ireland, a standing advisory com-
 mission on human rights was set up by the Northern Ireland
 Constitution Act (Part III) of 1973. The Commission is
 studying the question of whether a Bill of Rights should be
 recommended for Northern Ireland but it has not yet sub-
 mitted its report to the British Government. There are
 numerous legislative guarantees of civil and political
 liberties specifically aimed at Northern Ireland, the
 fundamental one being the above-mentioned Act which made
 unlawful any Northern Ireland executive or legislative
 action that was discriminatory on religious or political
 grounds. With minor exceptions, there are no restrictions
 on freedom of speech, religion, assembly, or movement in
 Northern Ireland.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The British Government's record with respect to independent,
 outside investigations of alleged human rights violations is
 outstanding. In the above-mentioned case brought by the Irish
 Government, the British attorney-General made clear that the
 Government "accepts in full the right of the applicant
 Government to refer the case to the court." Moreover, Britain
 years ago executed a separate declaration accepting the right
 on petition by individuals and non-official organizations
 under Article 25 of the European Convention-on Human Rights,
 which it was the first signatory country to ratify in 1951.
 It should be noted that Britain has provided a home for
 Amnesty International, a leading private human rights
 organization, for years.
