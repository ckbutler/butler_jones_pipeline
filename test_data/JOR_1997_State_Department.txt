 JORDAN
 The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy that has been
 ruled by King Hussein since 1952. The Constitution concentrates a high degree of
 executive an  l   aive authority in the King, who determines domestic and for-
 eign policy. Thesprime Minister and the Cabinet manage the daily affairs of govern-
 ment. The Parliament consists of the 40-member Senate apointed by the King and
 the 80-member Chamber-of Deputies,.which iselected bythe people every 4 years.
 After the 1989 elections and tke lifting of martial law in 1991,w the lower house
 began to assert itself on domestic and foreign policy issues. The Parliament elected
 in 1993, however, was less- assertive than its predecessor. Over 500 candidates com-
 peted in the October parliamentary elections, despite a boycott by the Islamist and
 other parties. The election was marred by-reports of registration irregularities,
 fraud, and restrictions on the press and on campaign materis. According to the
 Constitution, the judiciaryis independent of other branches of goversnent; how-
 ever, in-practice, it is susceptible to outside influences.
 General police functions are the responsibility of the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD). The PSD, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), and the military share
 responsibility fot maintaining internal security and have authority to monitor the
 activities of persons believed to be security threats. The State Security Court and
 brad police powers are vestiges of martial law, which was in place from 1967 to
 1991. The security forces continue to commit human rights abuses.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with significant government participation in indus-
 try, transportation, and communications. The country has few natural resources and
 relies heavily on foreign assistance and remittances from citizens working abroad.
 The economy has suffered from chronically high unemployment since the late
 1980's. As part of a structural adjustment program, the Government has removed
 subsidies on several staple goads and lifted price controls on bread, soft drinks,
 fruits, and vegetables. While consumer prices and- interest rates have risen, wages
 have remained stagnant, eroding the purchasing power of most citizens. Exporters
 -have not yet found adequate replacement markets for those lost as a result of Unit-
 ed Nations sanctions against Iraq. Additional trade with Iraq under "food for oil"
 arrangements has not significantly affected the economy. High expectations that sig-
 nificant markets would develop in the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel following the
 1994 signing of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty have not been realized. Per capita
 gross domestic product in 1996 was $1,632.
 Since the revocation of martial law in 1991, there hasbeen noticeable improve-
 ment in the human rights situation, however, problems remain, including: abuse
 and mistreatment of detainees; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of accountability
 within the security services; prolonged detention without charge; lack of due prc-
 
 
 1492
 ess; infringements on citizens' privacy rights; harassment of opposition political par-
 ties; and restrictions on the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their form of government, although they
 can participate in the political system through political parties and municipal and
 parliamentary elections. New restrictions on the press decreed by the King in May
 shutdown many smaller publications and led the others to practice increased self-
 censorship. In reaction to these limitations and to the "one-man, one-vote" change
 in the election process, the Islamist and other parties boycotted the October par-
 liamentary elections. Abuse of foreign servants is a problem. Restrictions on wom-
 en's rights, violence against women, and abuse of children are also problems. The
 Government imposes some limits on freedom of religion, and there is official dis-
 crimination against adherents of the Baha'i faith.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial/Killing.-There continues to be a reluctance
 on the part of the security services to transparently investigate allegations of wrong-
 ful death in police custody. In one incident, family members accused police of killing
 Samer Mohammed Ziyad on June 23. The 29-year-old man was wanted for theft,
 fraud, and arson. According to relatives, police first assaulted Samers brother out-
 side of the family home. After the injured brother left to seek medical attention, two
 police officers entered the house, found Samer, and escorted him to a bedroom.
 There, according the family members who witnessed events, a policeman struck
 Samer twice on the head with a heavy wooden baton causing him to collapse, uncon-
 scious, to the floor. Samer was instructed to get up by police. When he remained
 motionless, the same policeman sprayed a mace-like substance into his face. The
 fumes were so strong that the policemen and family members left the house and
 remained outside for approximately 90 minutes. At that time an officer arrived and,
 after assessing the situation, instructed family members to take Samer to the hos-
 pital. Samer was pronounced dead on arrival. Police officials claim that Ziyad had
 already collapsed when police arrived to arrest him. A government autopsy reported
 the cause of death to have been a heart attack caused by blockage in the coronary
 arteries. Family members countered that Ziyad had no history of medical problems
 and demanded a second autopsy. A second autopsy was performed by a panel of five
 independent physicians. While the second autopsy did not directly contradict the
 first autopsy's stated cause of death, it did describe two severe wounds to the vic-
 tim's head and surrounding brain tissue. Police officials claim to have conducted an
 investigation of the incident and the allegation of wrongful death but have refused
 to release any findings. The policemen involved in the incident have not been cen-
 sured and remain on active duty.
 In March a member of the army border guard member, Ahmed Daqamseh, shot
 and killed seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounded three others on Naharayim Island
 in the Jordan River. In June he was tried in military court, convicted, and sen-
 tenced to life in prison. The Government immediately condemned the act and the
 King made an unprecedented trip to visit the schoolgirls' families.
 There were no developments in the investigation of police officers involved in the
 alleged wrongful deaths of Younis Mahmoud Abu Dawlah, who died in December
 1996, and Mahmoud Khalifah, who died in June 1995. Both men died while in police
 custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture And Other Cruel, Inhuman, Or Degrading Treatment Or Punishment.-
 Although the legal code provides prisoners with the right to humane treatment, se-
 curity and police forces sometimes abuse detainees physically during interrogation.
 Torture allegations are difficult to verify because security officials frequently deny
 detainees timely access to lawyers. The most frequently alleged methods of torture
 are sleep deprivation, beatings, and extended solitary confinement. Defendants in
 high-profile cases before the state security court occasionally claim to have under-
 gone physical and psychological abuse while in detention. Government officials re-
 ject allegations of abuse.
 In May Fahd Rimawi, editor of the weekly tabloid Al Maid, publicly alleged that
 he was slapped in the face, insulted, and threatened by officers of the General Intel-
 ligence Directorate. Rimawi had been called in for questioning after publishing an
 editorial in which he stated that it was "unfortunate -that an Israeli stabbing victim
 in Jordan survived the attack. The Minister of State for Information Affars said
 that Rimawi was summoned and interrogated for publishing "erroneous news" about
 changes in the security forces' leadership. The Government denied that Rimawi was
 abused and sald that he was released with a warning.
 
 
 1493
 .During the June military trial of Ahmed Daqamseh, an army border guard con-
 victed of Icilling seven Israeli schoolgirls and wounding three others (see Section
 L.a.), the defendant displayed -bruises to his face and back. Daqamseh's lawyer
 claimed that Daqamseh was beaten by the soldiers guarding him. The director of
 -the military prosecutor's office alleged that Daqamseh beat himself against his cell
 "door "in an attempt to escape from captivity." Court was adjourned for 3 days so
 - Daqamseh-could be examined and the- source of the injuries determined, but the re-
 sults of the examination were not made available to Daqamesh's attorneys.
 Montasser Abu Zaid was hanged. in June for murder. Abu Zaid was convicted in
 1996 on the basis of-a confession that he claimed was extracted under duress. He
 alleged that he, and his wife were beaten and deprived of sleep-in pretrial detention.
 These allegations were made during the course of the trial, but no investigation was
 conducted.
 In May police used force to disperse demonstrating journalists, striking protesters
 (see Section 2.b.).
 Prisons and. local police detention facilities are Spartan but generally meet mini-
 mum international standards. Prisoners detained on national security grounds are
 often kept in separate prisons- maintained by the .GID, where conditions are much
 the same as other incarceration facilities.
 There were reports in April of a- hunger strike staged-by- prisoners at Suwaqah
 prison after -they were not included in a royal amnesty. Relatives of prisoners told
 the Parliament's Public Freedoms Committee that-personnel from the PSD entered
 the prisonand beat those inmates who were, participating in the hunger strike.
 The International Committee of the: Red Cross (ICRC) is permitted unrestricted
 access to prisoners and prison facilities, including GID facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Or Exile.-Security forces arbitrarily arrest and de-
 tain citizens. Under the Constitution citizens are subject to arrest, trial, and punish-
 ment for the defamation of heads of state, dissemination of "false or exaggerated in-
 formation outside the country which attacks, state dignity," or defamation of public
 officials.
 The Criminal Code requires legal authorities to file formal charges within 10 days
 of arrest. The courts routinely grant requests from prosecutors for 15-day extensions
 as provided by law. This practice generally extends pretrial detention for protracted
 periods of time. In-cases involving state security, the authorities frequently hold de-
 fendants in lengthy pretrial detention, do not provide defendants with the written
 charges against them, and do not allow defendants to meet with their lawyers until
 shortly before the trial. Security defendants usually meet with-their attorneys 1 to
 2 days prior to the trial.  0
 The Government detains, persons, including journalists, for varying amounts of
 time for what appear to be political reasons. During the year all such detainees
 were released within 3 months; most were released irrimediately after questioning.
 Approximately 350 people, including journalists, were detained for national security
 reasons during the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial Of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent ju-
 diciary, and court rulings against the Government in past years indicate that the
 judiciary can function independently. However, the judiciary is susceptible to out-
 side pressure, because a judge's appointment to, and advancement within the judici-
 ary, is determined by a committee whose members are appointed by the King.
 There are several types of courts. Most criminal cases are tried in the civilian
 courts, which also include appeals courts, the Court of Cassation, and the Supreme
 Court. Cases involving sedition, armed insurrection, financial crimes, drug-traffick-
 ing, and offenses against the King are tried in the State Security Court, a remnant
 of the pre-1991 martial law period. In January Parliament passed amendments to
 the law governing the State Security Court effectively extending its jurisdiction in-
 definitely. The amendments had been rejected earlier by the lower house's judicial
 committee as "undemocratic" and contrary to the concept of an independent judici-
 ary. Islamic, or Shari'a, courts, have jurisdiction over marriage and divorce among
 Muslims and inheritance cases involving both Muslims and non-Muslims (see Sec-
 tion 5). Under Shari'a, a woman's testimony is only equal to half that of a man (see
 Section 5).
 Most trials in the civilian courts are open. Defendants are entitled to legal coun-
 sel, may challenge witnesses, and have the right to appeal. Defendants facing the
 death penalty orlife imprisonment must be represented by legal counsel. Public de-
 fenders are provided if the defendant cannot afford to hire legal counsel.
 The State Security Court consists of a panel of three judges, who may be either
 civilians or military officers. Sessions are frequently closed to the public. Defendants
 tried in the State Security Court are often held in pretrial detention without access
 
 
 1494
 
 to lawyers, although they are visited by representatives of the ICRC. In the State
 Security Court, judges have inquired into allegations of that defendants were tor-
 tured and have permitted the testimony of physicians regarding these allegations.
 To date the Court has not invalidated a confession obtained under duress, but on
 review, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the State Security Court cannot issue
 a death sentence on the basis of such a confession alone. Defendants in the State
 Security Court have the right of appeal to the Court of Cassation, which is author-
 ized to review testimony, evidence, and judgment. Appeals are automatic for cases
 involving the death penalty.
 In the past, defense attorneys have challenged the appointment of military judges
 to the State Security Court to try ciirilian cases as contrary to the concept of an
 independent judiciary. Military judges appear to receive adequate training in civil
 law and court procedure and State Security Court decisions are reviewed by the
 Court of Cassation.
 Journalists Nahed Hattar and Abdullah Abu Roman were charged with offenses
 against the King in August 1996. The State Security Court dropped charges during
 the summer of 1997, but the state prosecutor is appealing the decision. Hattar is
 accused of slandering King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan. The evidence against
 him includes published articles that criticize the permanent settlement of Palestin-
 ian refugees in Jordan. Abu Roman is accused of slandering the King. The evidence
 against him is based on articles seized when police raided his office. The two are
 also being tried in civil court on charges including propagating material that "harms
 relationsbetween Jordan and Palestine, sows sectarianism and ethnicism, instigates
 violence, terror, and hatred, and undermines national unity."
 The press routinely carries details of the security court cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, Or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution dictates that security forces must obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor
 General or a judge before conducting searches or otherwise interfering with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence. The security services generally respect these con-
 stitutional restrictions; however, in security cases, authorities sometimes-in viola-
 tion of the law--obtain warrants retroactively or obtain preapproved warrants. Se-
 curity officers reportedly monitor telephone, read correspondence, and engage in
 surveillance of persons who may pose a threat to the Government or national secu-
 rity. While these practices are not believed to be widespread, the law permits them
 if the Government obtains a court order.
 Section 2. Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom Of Speech And Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and of the press; however, the Government imposes some restrictions on
 these rights. Freedom of the press was curtailed by restrictive new amendments to
 the Press Law. The Government also intimidates journalists to encourage self-cen-
 sorship. Private citizens can be prosecuted for slandering the royal family, the Gov-
 ernment, or foreign leaders and for sowing sedition. Citizens generally do not hesi-
 tate to criticize the Government openly, but are more circumspect in regard to the
 King and the royal family.
 The Press and Publications Law was amended by royal decree-i.e., without par-
 liamentary approval-in May. The amendments gave daily and weekly newspapers
 3 months to meet greatly increased capitalization requirements, ranging from
 $70,000 to $840,000 and $21,000 to $420,000, respectively. The amended law further
 prohibits the publication of news, opinion, information, reports, caricatures, or
 photos that: offend the King or the royal family; pertain to the armed forces or secu-
 rity services; harm national unity; disparage religion; offend an individual or harm
 his reputation; disparage the heads of friendly states; harm the country's relations
 with other nations; promote perversion or lead to moral corruption; shake confidence
 in the national currency; or feature false news or rumors. Fines for violations of the
 law were raised from a maximum of $1,400 to between $21,000 and $35,000. News-
 papers deemed to be in violation of the law can be shut down until all fines are
 paid.
 The Press and Publications Law amendment also mandates that editors must be
 citizens, resident in the country, and have 10 years of full-time experience as jour-
 nalists. In September chief editor Nabil Al-Sharif of the nation's second largest
 daily, A1-Dustur, received a letter from the Ministry of Information ordering him to
 resign because he had less than 10 years full-time experience as a journalist. The
 Al-Sharif family and the Government each control three seats on the paper's nine-
 member board. Mr. Al-Sharif said that the Government was unhappy with Al-
 Dustur's editorial policy and that it had been trying use the board of directors to
 oust him for some time.
 
 
 1495
 The Government exercises control over the daily print media through its owner-
 ship of 61 percent of the Jordan Press Foundation, and 32 percent of the Jordan
 Press and Publications Company, which together publish three of the country's five
 dailies. The amended Press Law dropped an earlier clause requiring the Govern-
 ment to reduce its shares in press establishments to a maximum of 30 percent. The
 Government also requires licenses for newspapers and periodicals, but the Press
 Law does not prescribe penalties for publishing without a license. Specialized publi-
 cations may not publish material other than that for which they are licensed. The
 Government may revoke the licenses of periodicals that repeatedly violate the Press
 and Publications Law or which fail to publish for an extended period of time. The
 Government licensed one new publication in 1997. No licenses were revoked.
 The Government also requires licenses for journalists, editors, and publishers.
 Journalists have long complained about the requirement that they must join the
 government-spnsored Jordan Press Association (JPA). However, the Government
 as not   en legal action against journalists who refuse to join the association. For-
 eign journalists and Jordanians working for foreign news agencies must register
 with the Ministry of Information. The Press Law offers limited protection for the
 confidentiality of a journalist's sources.
 Persons accused of violating the Press and Publications Law are tried in a special
 court for press and copyright cases. Journalists are also prosecuted for criminal and
 security violations in connection with their work. Most such cases result in acquittal
 or are dismissed before coming to trial. No guilty verdicts have been handed down
 since the May amendment to the Press and Publications Law. Nevertheless, the
 Government routinely uses detention and prosecution or the threat of prosecution
 of press and publications cases as a means to intimidate journalists and to encour-
 age self-censorship.
 Credible observers expect the broad definition of punishable offenses in the
 amendments to the Press Law to encourage increased self-censorship. The first
 newspaper to close following the press amendments was the satirical weekly Abed
 Rabbo, which printed its final issue on June 14. The paper cited the decree's broad
 definition of prohibited reporting and the severity of fines as the reasons for its clo-
 sure. Two of the paer's editors, Omar Nadi and Yousef Gheishan, had been de-
 tained in January, charged with slandering a Member of Parliament and a govern-
 ment minister. The paper had called the parliamentary deputy a hypocrite and
 printed a cartoon depicting the minister stealing cars.
 As a direct result of the new capitalization requirements promulgated in the Press
 and Publication Law amendments, 14 of 23 weeklies were forced to cease publica-
 tion. Of the nine weeklies still publishing, four are considered party publications
 which are not yet subject to the same restrictions. Regarding the new senior editor
 qualifications contained in the law, two of the five senior editors of daily news-
 papers-i.e., all but one of the dailies not completely controlled by the Govern-
 ment-and one of the weekly senior editors have been asked to resign.
 In January Abdullah Bani Issa, editor of the weekly Al Hiwar, was sentenced to
 6 months in prison and fined $700 for publishing an interview in which Ata Abu
 Rishtah, leader of the illegal Tahrir Party, allegedly slandered the King and the
 Crown Prince. The sentence cited the Press and Publications Law in imposing the
 fine and the Penal Code in passing the jail sentence. The decision was overturned
 in April by the Court of Appeals, which ruled that the content of the interview was
 neither criminal nor slanderous. Abu Rishtah is currently in jail for an earlier 1996
 State Security Court conviction for slandering the King.
 Also in January, Na'el Salab, editor of the weekly Al Haqiqa, was sentenced to
 9 months in prison and fined $21,000 for "spreading false news and publishing por-
 nographic material" for reporting on prostitution in Amman. Salah had been de-
 tained for 4 days in 1996 in connection with the case.
 The editor in chief of the Al-Ahali weekly newspaper Jamil Nimri, and reporters
 Basel Tallouzi and Ramadan Rawashdeh were acuitted in February of charges of
 "instigating the masses" against the Jordan-Israel peace treaty and harming na-
 tional security. The Al-Ahali newspaper is linked to the Jordan People's Democratic
 Party. In May Osama Rantisi, editor of the Al-Ahali, was detained for 10 days be-
 fore being charged with lack of accuracy and objectivity in reporting, and slandering
 individuals. The arrest came after Rantisi published a story alleging that one of
 Amman's private hospitals was failing financially and was going to be purchased by
 a group of Israeli investors.
 Zarqa mayor Mustafa Fayyad was detained for 3 days in February for slandering
 members of parliament. The Speaker of the lower house of Parliament requested
 mayor Fayyad's arrest after he said in an interview that "three quarters of the
 Members of Parliament are liars."
 
 
 1496
 Journalists Nahed Hattar and Abdullah Abu Roman faced charges in the State
 Security Court, Hattar for slandering the King and the Crown Prince, and Abu
 Roman for slandering the King (see Section i.e.).
 The Penal Code authorizes the State to take action against any person who incites
 violence, defames heads of state, disseminates "false or exaggerated information out-
 side the country which attacks state dignity," or defames public officials. Ahmed
 Oueidi Abbadi was charged with undermining national unity, inciting people to
 criminal acts, and fueling bigotry, for a 1996 editorial in which he called for govern-
 ment confiscation of the property of- Palestinians living in Jordan. The case was
 - postponed in April and eventually dismissed: Abbadi was elected to Parliament in
 'the October elections.
 -  The -Government.is the sole-broadeaster-of radio and television programs. Radio'
 and television -news broadcasts are more restricted than the print media. Television
 news airs-reports critical of the Government but rarely covers alleged human rights
 abuses. Opposition parties have complained that Jordan Television (JTV) reports
 only the Government's position on controversial matters. International satellite tele-
 vision and Israeli and Syrian television broadcasts are available and unrestricted.
 In March the Government announced an-end to pre-distribution censorship of
 -publications entering the country. Previously, imported magazines and newspapers
 �were subject to a pre-distribution check for violations of the press and publicatio ns
 law. In October, in the period leading up the parliamentary elections, the Govern-
 .  ment resumed pre-distribution censorship of foreign publications, blocking the dis-
 tribution of 54 Arabic language publications and 16 issues of British newspapers.
 There were no dismissals of university professors for their political views in 1997.
 -However,. intellectuals believe that there are no safeguards to prevent such disnmis-
 sals.
 .b. Freedom Of Peaceful Assembly And Association.-The Government restricts
 freedom of-assembly. Citizens, must obtain permits for public gatherings. Since 1989
 the Government has granted some permits for peaceful demonstrations. The Gov-
 ernment- denies permits for public protests an [ rallies that it determnines pose a
 threat to security.
 In January the Government permitted a demonstration at the site of an Israeli
 trade fair on the outskirts of Amman. Water cannons were fired- over the heads of
 the 500 demonstrators to maintain order, and security forces. prevented demonstra-
 tors from-approaching the entrance to the site. Organizers of the demonstration al-
 leged that members of the security forces prevented buses full of people arriving
 from outside Amman to reach the demonstration site.
 The Government issued permits for a large gathering in March "in solidarity with
 the Paestinian ,people." Opposition figures from political parties, professional asso-
 ciations, women a groups, and grass roots organizations took p art and addressed the
 crowd. Some would-be participants did not make it to the rally site, however, when
 police stpped buses hired for the event that had not obtained the appropriate per-
 mit for changing their routes. The drivers were fined and the buses were im-
 pounded, leaving passengers without transportation. The usual penalty for this in-
 fraction is a small fine.
 Police used. force on May 20 during an unlicensed demonstration at the offices of
 the Prime Minister by approximately 50 journalists to protest amendments to the
 Press and Publications Law. As the demonstrators dispersed, security forces became
 involved in  dispute with journalists over the filming of an interview with promi-
 nent opposition figure LaytShubaylat. In the ensuing fracas several people were
 pushed, shoved, and struck by police. At least one demonstrator was kickedand hit
 several times with batons. Nine people were detained for several hours following the
 demonstration. The Government said the police actions were justified because the
 prtest was unlicensed. The demonstration and the police response were reported
 in the print media.
 The Government ,restricts freedom of association. The Government requires and
 routinely grants approval for conferences, workshops, and seminars. In January the
 Ministry of Culture announced its decision to require Ministry approval, in writing,
 for any cultural, scientific or artistic activity. The decision was revoked 3 weeks
 later after public complaints.
 The Government routinely licenses political parties and other associations. There
 are currently 17 licensed parties. Membership in an unlicensed political p arty is ille-
 gal. The High Court of Justice may dissolve a party if it violates the Constitution
 or the Political Parties Law. The Government can deny licenses to parties that it
 decides do not meet a list of political criteria contained in the Political Parties Law.
 In a July statement to the Minister of Interior, 11 opposition parties complained
 that during a government-ordered audit of parties finances, some carties were
 asked to submit unrelated information, including party members' names and ad-
 
 
 1497
 dresses. The Minister responded that the audit was being conducted in accordance
 with the law, and that all parties were being treated equally.
 c. Freedom Of Religion.-According to the Constitution, Islam is the state religion.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion and provides for
 "personal freedom." Sunni Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population. Is-
 lamic institutions are managed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Trusts,
 which appoints imams and subsidizes certain activities sponsored by mosques. The
 Political Parties Law prohibits houses of worship from being used for political party
 activity. The law was primarily designed to prevent Islamist parliamentarians from
 p reaching in mosques; however, enforcement of the law has not been consistent. Re-
 ligious instruction is mandatory for all Muslim students in public schools. Christian
 and Baha'i students are not required to attend courses in Islam.
 The Government does not interfere with public worship by the country's Christian
 minority. Established religious groups, which include Islam, Roman Catholicism,
 Greek Orthodoxy, the Baptist Church, the Anglican Church, the Presbyterian
 Church, the Assyrian Church, and Armenian Orthodoxy, require official government
 recognition in order to register property in the name of the church, but members
 may practice their religion without government recognition. The Government does
 not recognize the Bahai faith as a religion but does not prohibit the practice of the
 faith. The Government does not record the bearer's religion on national identity
 cards issued to Baha'is, nor does it register property belonging to the community.
 Unlike Christian denominations, the Baha'i community does not have its own court
 to adjudicate personal status and family matters. Baha'i personal status matters are
 heard in Islamic law courts.
 The Government does not recognize Jehovah's Witnesses, the United Pentecostal
 Church, the Church of Christ, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,
 but each denomination is allowed to conduct religious services and activities without
 interference.
 The law prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing Muslims. Muslims who convert
 to other faiths complain of social and government discrimination. The Government
 does not fully recognize the legality of such conversions. Under Shari'a, converts are
 regarded as apostates and may be legally denied their property and other rights.
 In Jordan this principle is not applied. Converts from Islam do not fall under the
 jurisdiction of their new religions laws in matters of personal status and are still
 considered Muslims under Shari'a, although the reverse is not true. Christians are
 also subject to aspects of Shari'a designating how inheritances should be distributed.
 d. Freedom Of Movement Within The Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, And
 Repatriation.-The law provides for the right of citizens to travel freely abroad and
 within the country except in designated military areas. The law requires that all
 women and foreign women married to Jordanians obtain written permission from
 their male guardian-usually their fathers or husbands-to apply for a passport. A
 woman traveling abroad with children may also be required to show written author-
 ization from her spouse before departure. egal authorities enforce requests from fa-
 thers to prevent their children from departing the country, even when traveling
 with their mothers.
 Following the shooting in March of seven Israeli girls by an army border guard
 Ahmed Daqamseh, security forces closed the entrance to Daqamseh s home village
 of Ibdir to all except the village's inhabitants. A delegation from a neighboring tribe
 coming to inquire about the Daqamseh family's welfare and opposition figures at-
 tempting to deliver the family material support were prevented from doing so by
 security forces. Foreign diplomats were also denied entry.
 Jordanians with full citizenship receive passports valid for 5 years. Most Palestin-
 ian living in Jordan are citizens and receive passports valid for 5 years. However,
 ap proximately 150,000 Palestinian residents-most refugees or children of refugees,
 who arrived from Gaza after 1967-do not qualify for Jordanian citizenship. They
 receive 2-year passports valid for travel only.Following Jordan's administrative and
 legal disengagement from the West Bank in 1988, Palestinians residing in the West
 Bank received 2-year passports valid for travel only, instead of the 5-year Jordanian
 passports they had received previously. In October 1995, King Hussein announced
 that West Bank residents without other travel documentation would again be eligi-
 ble to receive 5-year Jordanian passports. However, the Government has stressed
 that these passports are for travel only and do not connote citizenship. All Palestin-
 ians must obtain permits from the Ministry of the Interior for travel between Jor-
 dan and the Israeli-occupied territories. Such permission is routinely granted.
 The Constitution prohibits the deportation of citizens; the Government respects
 this prohibition.
 The Government generally cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 
 
 1498
 ugees. The Government provides for first asylum. Since 1991 thousands of Iraqis
 have sought asylum in Jordan and been given assistance by the UNHCR. There
 were two reports of forced expulsion of Iraqis to Iraq. The Government forcibly de-
 ported Iraqi national Adnan Karam Tu'ma to Iraq on March 25 despite his plea that
 he be granted temporary political asylum based on his claim that he was a member
 of the Iraqi opposition. In the second instance, the Jordanian chapter of the Arab
 Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) alleged that Iraqi national and opposition
 figure Samir AI-Sa'di was detained and then deported to Iraq by security services
 in June without having had the chance to file for refugee status with the UNHCR.
 Over 1.35 million Palestinian refugees are registered in Jordan with the United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency. The Agency counts another 800,000 Palestinians
 as either displaced persons from the 1967 War, arrivals following the 1967 War, or
 returnees from the Gulf.
 Section 3. Respect For Political Rights: The Right Of Citizens To Change Their Gov-
 ernment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their system of government. The King
 has sole discretionary authority to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and the
 Cabinet, to dissolve Parliament, and to establish public policy. Appointments made
 by the King to high government posts do not require legislative approval. Executive
 power is vested in the King, who exercises his powers through his ministers in ac-
 cordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
 The Parliament is composed of a 40-member Senate appointed by the King and
 a popularly elected 80-member Chamber of Deputies. The Parliament is empowered
 by the Constitution to approve, reject, and amend legislation proposed by the Cabi-
 net. A group- of 10 senators or deputies may submit draft bills for consideration,
 however, in practice, -Members of Parliament ask the Government to initiate legisla-
 tion for consideration. Opposition members of Parliament have complained that at-
 tempts by members of the lower house to initiate legislation receive no response
 from the Government. The, King proposes and dismisses, extraordinary sessions of
 Parliament and may postpone regular sessions up to 60 days. By law, if the Govern-
 ment amends or enacts a law when. Parliament is not in session, it must submit
 the law to Parliament -for consideration during the next session. However, this does
 not always occur.
 The Electoral Law and -the. distribution of- parliamentary seats deliberately favor
 regions with populations known, for their traditional, pro-Hashemite views, i.e.,
 rural and southern Jordan.
 - Over 500 candidates competed-in the-October parliamentary elections, despite a
 boycott by Islamist and other parties. There were many reports of registration irreg-
 - ularities and fraud-on the part of candidates. Restrictions on the press and on cam-
 paigu -materials also-had a negative effect on the campaign, which elicited much de-
 bate over the fairness of the Electoral Law and its implementation. Voter turnout
 was significantly lower in most urban areas than in .rural areas. Centrist candidates
 with ties to major tribes dominate the new Parliament.
 The so-called one-man, one-vote amendment to the Electoral Law was ratified by
 -Parliament in January,- nearly 4 years after it was first promulgated by royal de-
 cree. The amendment allows voters to choose only one candidate in multiple-seat
 districts. In-the largely tribal society, citizens tend to cast their first vote for family
 -members, and any-additional votes in accordance with their political leanings.
 Hence,.the amendment limits the chances of some non-tribal candidates, including
 -women, to be elected.
 . Women have the right to vote, and women's-groups encourage women to vote and
 to become active in the political-process. There is one woman in the cabinet. She
 and two other womeir were appointed to the Senate. Fifteerr women were elected
 to municipal posts in 1997, bringing the total number of women-in such posts to
 28, including one- as mayor of Khirbet Al Wahadneh, near Ajloun. None of the 17
 female candidates won seats in the October parliamentary elections.
 Of the 80 seats in the lower chamber, 9 are reserved for Christians, 6 for Bed-
 ouins, and 3 for the Circassian or Chechen ethnic minorities.
 The Palestinian community, estimated to be slightly over one-half the total popu-
 lation, is not represented proportinately in the Government. Only 7 of 24 ministers,
 6 of 40 senators, and 11 of 80, lower house deputies are of Palestinian origin. The
 - electoral system gives greater representation to areas that have few inhabitants of
 Palestinian origin.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International And Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation Of Alleged Violations Of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and publish and disseminate findings critical of government policy.
 However, the Press and Publications Law restricts the publication of information
 about the military and security services, which, in effect, prevents the publication
 by local groups of reports alleging torture and other abuses committed by the secu-
 rity services.
 The ICRC is permitted to visit prisoners and assess the condition of security de-
 tainees, including those held by the General Intelligence Directorate.
 The local chapter of the Arab Organization for Human Rights and the Jordanian
 Human Rights Society (JURS) are registered with the Government. The AOHR has
 drawn public attention to alleged human rights abuses and has pressed the Govern-
 ment to bring charges against political detainees or to release them promptly. In
 February the AOHR released its annual report detailing human rights abuses in
 1996. The Minister of Information called it "more of a political statement than a fac-
 tual, realistic, and objective report." The JHRS was licensed in November 1996. It
 released a statement in May calling on the Government to expand the freedom of
 the press.
 In June Human Rights Watch/Middle East issued a report on the amendments
 to the Press and Publications Law entitled, A Death Knell or Free Expression?. The
 report was covered in the Arabic and English press.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based On Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, Or
 Social Status
 Although the law does not distinguish between citizens on the basis of race,
 women and minorities are treated differently under the law and may face discrimi-
 nation in emploent, housing, and other areas.
 Women.-Violenc against women over the age of 15 is common. Reported inci-
 dents of violence against woman do not reflect the full extent of the problem. Medi-
 cal experts acknowledge that spouse abuse occurs frequently. However, cultural
 norms discourage victims from seeking medical or legal help and frustrate an objec-
 tive assessment of the extent of such abuse.
 Abused women have the right to file a complaint in court against their spouses
 for physical abuse, but in practice, familial and societal pressures discourage them
 from seeking legal remedies. Marital rape is legal. Nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) such as the Jordanian Women's Unions, which has a hot-line for victims
 of domestic violence, provide assistance in such matters. Wife beating is technically
 ounds for divorce, but the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority
 a    the Koran to correct an irreigious or disobedient wife by striking her.
 The Criminal Code allows leniency for a person found guilty of committing a
 "crime of honor," a euphemism that refers to a violent assault against a female by
 a male relative for alleged sexual misconduct. Law enforcement treatment of men
 accused of "honor crimes" reflects widespread unwillingness to condemn or take ac-
 tion against the problem. The press reported 24 such cases in 1997. However, these
 figures likely understate the actual number of cases, as most "crimes of honor" are
 not reported by the press. The actual number of "honor crimes" is believed by a local
 expert to be 4 times as high. The police regularly imprison women who are liable
 to decme victims of "honor crimes" "for their own protection."
 According to the law, a "crime of honor" defense may be invoked only by the de-
 fendant who "surprises his wife or any close female relative" in the act of adultery
 or fornication, in which case the male perpetrator of the 'honor crime" is not guilty
 of murder. Though few defendants can meet the stringent requirements for a crime
 of honor" defense, which require that the defendant must personally have witnessed
 the female victim engaging in sexual intercourse, they are not tried for murder and
 convicted offenders raes rele     than 2 years in prison. In contrast to "honor
 crimes," the maximum penalty for first-degree murder is death, and the maximum
 penalty for second degree murder is 15 years. More commonly, such defenses rely
 on the male relative having acted in the heat of passion upon hearing of a female
 relative's alleged sexual transgression, usually without any investigation on the part
 of the assailant to determine the veracity of the allegation before committing an act
 of violence, and murdering his wife, sister, niece, or cousin. Women may not invoke
 this defense for murdering a male relative under the same circumstances; nor may
 they use it for killing men who attempt to rape, sexually harass, or otherwise
 threaten their "honor.'
 In May a man who killed his sister invoked an "honor crime d defense and received
 a 3-month sentence. In contrast, two women, Amira Salem and Eidah Hussein, who
 killed Salem's husband for physically and emotionally abusing her, were sentenced
 
 
 1500
 to death and hanged. In January a man was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment
 for killing a man who had harassed and made unwanted sexual advances toward
 his sister over a long period of time.
 Women experience legal discrimination in matters of pension and social security
 benefits, inheritance, divorce, and the value of testimony in court (see Section i.e.).
 The Government provides men with more generous social security benefits than
 women. The Government continues pension payments of a deceased male civil serv-
 ant to his heirs but discontinues payments of a deceased female civil servant.
 Under Shari'a, female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance,
 and the non-Muslim widows of Muslim spouses have no inheritance rights. A sole
 female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male
 relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs
 have the duty to provide for all family memers who need assistance. Shari'a re-
 gards the testimony of two women to be equal to the testimony of one man. This
 technically afpplies only in religious courts but in the past has been imposed in civil
 courts as well, irrespective of religion. Under Shari'a, men are able to divorce their
 spouses more easily than women. Marriage and divorce matters for Christians are
 adjudicated by special courts for each denomination. The Government bans married
 women from applying for diplomatic posts. There are two female judges.
 The law requires a married woman to obtain her husband's permission to obtain
 a passport (see Section 2.d.). Married women do not have the legal right to transmit
 Jordanian citizenship to their children. They may obtain citizenship for their non-
 Jordanian husbands who may then confer citizenship on the children. However, in
 practice, such an application can take years, and in many cases citizenship may still
 ultimately be denied to both husband and children. Civil law grants women equal
 pay for equal work, but in practice this law is often ignored.
 Social pressures discourage many women from pursuing careers. Nonetheless,
 women have employment opportunities in many professions, including engineering,
 medicine, education, and thelaw. Women constitute approximately 14 percent of the
 work force. Women's -groups stress that the problem of discrimination is not only
 one of law but also of women's lack of awareness of their rights or unwillingness
 to assert those rights. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization re-
 ported in 1995 that women who work in agriculture average 15-hour days and earn
 less than men. The Jordanian chapter of the Business and Professional Women's
 Club gives seminars on women's rights and assists women in establishing small
 businesses. Members of the royal family work actively to improve the status of
 women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare in the
 areas of education and health. However, government efforts in these areas are con-
 strained by limited financial resources. Education is compulsory to age 15. The chil-
 dren of Iraqi citizens living in Jordan without residence permits are not permitted
 to attend school.
 The Government safeguards some children's rights, especially regarding child
 labor. Although the law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working, child
 peddlers work the streets of Amman. The Ministry of Social Development has a
 committee to address the problem and in most cases removes the children from the
 streets, returns them to their families or to juvenile centers, and may provide the
 families with a monthly stipend. However, the children often return to the streets.
 The law prohibits corporal punishment in schools.
 Although the problem is difficult to quantify, social workers believe that there is
 a significant incidence of child abuse in families. The law specifies punishment for
 specific abuses against children. Social workers believe that the incidence of sexual
 crimes is significantly higher than reported. Rape or sodomy of a child under 15
 years of age carries the death penalty.
 fllegitimate children are entitled to the same rights under the law as legitimate
 children. In practice, however, they suffer severe discrimination in a society that
 does not tolerate adultery. Most illegitimate children become wards of the state or
 manage a meager existence on the fringes of society. In either case, their prospects
 for marriage and other than menial employment are extremely limited.
 People With.Dsabilities.-High unemployment in the general population restricts
 job opportunities for the disabled, estimated by.the Ministry of Social Development
 to number 100,000. Eighty percent of disabledcitizens receive monetary assistance
 from the Government. T'he Government passed legislation in 1993 requiring future
 public buildings to accommodate the needs of the disabled and the retrofitting of ex-
 isting public buildings, but implementation has been slow. Since 1993 the Special
 Education Department of the Ministry of Social Development has enrolled approxi-
 mately 10,000 mentally and physically disabled persons in public and private sector
 training courses. It has placed approximately 400 disabled persons in public and pri-
 
 
 1501
 
 vate sector jobs. The law requires that 2 percent of the available jobs be reserved
 for the physically disabled. Private organizations and members of the royal family
 actively promote programs to protect and promote the interests of the disabled. Jor-
 dan articipates in the Spcial Olympics with the active encouragement of the royal
 Inigenous People.-The country's indigenous people, nomadic Bedouin and East
 Bank town dwellers, have traditionally heen the backbone of popular support for the
 Hashemite monarchy. As a result, they have generally enjoyed considerable influ-
 ence within the political system. They are disproportionately represented in senior
 military, security, and civil service jobs. Nevertheless, the Bedouin face some social
 and economic discrimination.
 Religious Minorities.-In general Christians do not suffer discrimination. Chris-
 tians hold government positions and are represented in the media and academia ap-
 proximately in proportion to their presence in the general population, which is esti-
 mated at 6 percent. Baha'is face some societal as well as official discrimination.
 Christian and Baha'i children in public schools are not required to participate in Is-
 lamic religious instruction.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government granted citizenship to all
 Palestinians who fled to Jordan in the period after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and
 to a large number of refugees and displaced persons who arrived as a result of the
 1967 War. However, most refugees who fled Gaza after 1967 are not entitled to citi-
 zenship and are issued 2-year passports valid for travel only. Following Jordan's ad-
 ministrative and legal disengagement from the West Bank in 1988, Palestinians re-
 siding in the West Bank received 2-year passports valid for travel only, rather than
 the 5-year Jordanian passp rts they had received previously. In October 1995, King
 Hussein announced that West Bank residents without other travel documentation
 would again be eligible to receive 5-year Jordanian passports. The Government has
 stressed, however, that these passports are for travel only and do not connote citi-
 zenship (see Section 2.d.) Palestinians residing in Jordan suffer discrimination in
 appointments to positions in the Government and the military, and in the awarding
 of university scholarships.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right Of Association.-Workers in the private sector and in some state-
 owned companies have the right to establish and join unions. Unions must be reg-
 istered to be considered legal. The law prohibits union membership for non-citizens.
 Over 30 percent of the work force is organized into 17 unions. Although union mem-
 bership in the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU), the sole
 trade federation, is not mandatory, all unions belong to it. The Government sub-
 sidizes and audits the GFJTU's salaries and activitiei. Union officials are elected
 by secret ballot to 4-year terms. Although the Government cosponsors and approves
 the timing of these elections, it does not interfere in the choice of candidates.
 Labor laws mandate that workers must obtain permission from the Government
 in order to strike. Unions generally do not seek approval for a strike, but workers
 use the threat of a strike or wildcat action as a negotiating tactic. Strikes are pro-
 hibited if a labor dispute is under mediation or arbitration. If a settlement is not
 reached through mediation, the Ministry of Labor may refer the dispute to an indus-
 trial tribunal by agreement of both parties. If only one party agrees, the Ministry
 of Labor refers the dispute to the Council of Ministers and then to Parliament. The
 tribunal is an independent arbitration panel of judges appointed by the Ministry of
 Labor. The decisions of the panel are legally binding. Labor law prohibits employers
 from dismissing a worker during a labor dispute. There were no reported strikes in
 1997.
 The GFJTU belongs to the Arab Labor Organization, the International Confed-
 eration of Arab Trade Unions, and to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right To Organize And Bargain Collectively.-Unions have, and exercise,
 the right to bargain collectively, the Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination,
 but the ICFTU claims that the Government does not adequately protect employees
 from antiunion discrimination and that the Government has dismissed public-sector
 employees for political reasons. Workers may lodge complaints of anti-union dis-
 crimination with the Ministry of Labor, which is authorized to order the reinstate-
 ment of employees discharged for union activities. There were no complaints of
 antiunion discrimination .lodged with the Ministry of Labor in 1997.
 The national labor laws apply in the free trade zones in Aqaba and Zarqa. Private
 sector employees in these zones belong to one national union that covers both zones
 and have the right to bargain collectively.
 
 
 1502
 c. Prohibition Of Forced Or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids compul-
 sory labor, except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster. Compul-
 sory labor is not practiced. The law does not specifically prohibit forced or compul-
 sory labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Labor law
 forbids children under the age of 16 from working except as apprentices. At age 13
 children may begin part-time training for up to 6 hours a day, with night work pro-
 hibited. Ministry of Labor inspectors attempt to enforce the law on child labor, but
 in practice enforcement often does not extend to some small family businesses that
 employ underage children. Education is compulsory to age 15. Families in remote
 areas frequently keep some school-age children at home to work. Child peddlers
 work on the streets of Amman (see Section 5). The law does not specifically prohibit
 forced or compulsory labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur
 (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions Of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The Gov-
 ernment periodically adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based on
 the recommendations of an advisory panel representing workers, employers, and the
 Government. The lowest minimum wage rate on the schedule is about $112 (80 di-
 nars) a month, including allowances. Workers earning the lowest wage find it dif-
 ficult to provide a decent living for their families. The Government estimates the
 poverty level at a monthly wage of about $91 (65 dinars) per month for a family
 of three. A study conducted by the Ministry of Social Development found that
 150,000 families, or 21 percent of citizens, live at or below the poverty level. Nine
 percent live in "abject" poverty. The Government provides assistance to 33,000 indi-
 gent families.
 The law prohibits most workers from working more than the customary 48 hours
 a week, and 54 hours for hotel, restaurant, and cinema employees. Workers may not
 work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more that 60 hours of over-
 time per month. Employees are entitled to 1 day off each week.
 The law does not apply to domestic servants, who do not have a legal forum to
 address their labor grievances and have no standing to sue in court for nonpayment
 of wages. Abuse of domestic servants, most of whom are foreign, is widespread. Im-
 prisonment of maids and illegal confiscation of travel documents by employers is
 common. Complaints of beatings, underfeeding, and rape generally are not reported
 to officials by victims, who fear losing their work permits and being sent back to
 their nation of origin should they file a complaint. Domestic servants are generally
 not given a day off.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements for workers, includ-
 ing the presence of bathrooms, drinking water, and first aid equipment at work
 sites. The Ministry of Labor makes an effort to enforce health and safety require-
 ments but is hampered by the lack of qualified inspectors. The inspectors do not
 have the power to order firms to comply with health and safety standards. The law
 does not require employers to report industrial accidents or occupational diseases
 to the Ministry of Labor. Workers do not have a statutory right to remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking the loss of their jobs.
