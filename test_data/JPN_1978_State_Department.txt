 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are thriving. Basic freedoms are guaran-
 teed by the Japanese Constitution and secured by a just
 and efficient legal.system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State is not aware of any instances
 of torture in Japan.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in prac-
 tice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guar-
 anteed by law and respected in practice. Amnesty Inter-
 national reports for 1977 do not identify any political
 prisoners under detention in Japan.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. The accused are guaranteed
 a public trial with defense counsel and the right to
 cross examination. In addition, they are protected
 from self-incrimination and from the application of ex
 post facto laws. Japan's court system, including the
 appellate division, functions effectively.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Japanese authorities are prohibited from entering
 
 (871)
 
 
 372
 homes without first obtaining a legal warrant. This
 prohibition is observed in practice and the standards
 for issuing such warrants are adequate to guard against
 arbitrary searches.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Basic human needs in Japan are provided for primarily
 by the social infrastructure that has developed along
 with Japan's economy. Free education through high
 school is available to all, and Japan has the highest
 rate of literacy of any major country. Food, shelter
 and health care are available widely in good quality,
 with the Government increasingly acting as the provider
 of last resort to the needy. Welfare standards are main-
 tained more by the efforts of the private sector than by
 the Government, for the Japanese employer traditionally
 assumes a "lifetime" paternal responsibility for the
 welfare of his employees and their families. Because
 disparities in income distribution are smaller in Japan
 than in any other industrialized country, Japanese at
 all income levels share in the nation's prosperity.
 Of note in the international sphere has been the
 Japanese Government's provision of food, shelter and
 health care to the over 2,000 refugees admitted from
 Indochina. It has recently decided to give permanent
 residence status to a limited number of them and has
 become a major donor to refugee programs of the United
 Nations High Commission for Refugees.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are quaranteed by Japan's Constitution,
 protected by law and respected in practice.
 
 
 373
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Citizens have and freely exercise the right to change
 their place of residence, to travel freely both within
 Japan and abroad and to emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in-the Political Process
 All adult citizens share the right to vote, and this
 right is enjoyed in practice. Vote is by secret bal-
 lot. Political interest groups can and do organize
 and engage in a full range of political activity. Six
 opposition parties, ranging from a communist party to
 a moderate conservative party, are very active. Labor
 unions are well organized and play an essential role in
 bringing workers into the political process. Elections
 are completely open and accurately reflect the public
 will. The various civil and political liberties are
 quaranteed to all citizens without regard to sex or
 social condition.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State knows of no requests by any
 organizations to investigate human rights conditions
 in Japan.
