 BURUNDI
 President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was overthrown in a military coup on July
 25, 1996. The National Assembly and political parties operate under significant con-
 straints. The regime headed by self-proclaimed interim president, Major Pierre
 Buyoya, abrogated the 1992 Constitution and the 1994 Convention of Government.
 The Buyoya regime promulgated a decree on September 13, 1996 which replaced the
 Constitution during the so-called Transition Period. Under this decree, the National
 Assembly does not have the power to remove the President of the Re public. The
 Prime Minister, appointed by the President, replaces the President in the event of
 the President's deat or incapacity. Under the abrogated Constitution, the President
 of the National Assembly replaced the President. The judicial system is controlled
 by the Tutsi minority.
 Buyoya holds power in conjunction with the Tutsi-dominated establishment forces.
 The country has been engaged in a civil war marked by ethnic violence, which in-
 cludes fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and armed Hutu rebel groups.
 The fighting has caused widespread civilian casualties since its beginning in Octo-
 ber 1993.

 Security forces consist of the army and the gendarmerie under the Ministry of De-
 fense, the judicial police under the Ministry of Justice, and the Documentation Serv-
 ice under the presidency. The army and the security services remain committed to
 protecting the interests of the Tutsi minority. The security forces committed numer-
 ous, serious, human rights abuses.
 Burundi is poor and densely populated, with over four-fifths of the population en-
 gaged in subsistence agriculture. The small modern sector, based- largely on the ex-
 port of cffee and tea, has been damaged by an economic embargo imposed by neigh-
 boring states in July 1996. The ongoing violence since 1993 has caused severe eco-
 nomic disruption and dislocation. Large numbers of internally displaced persons
 have been unable to produce their own food crops and depend largely on inter-
 national hum ana      as  nce. Government efforts to privatize parastatal enter-
 p rises are at a virtual halt. Per capita national income is estimated at less than
 $200 per year.
 The human rights situation remains poor. Despite Buyoya's avowed intention to
 end abuses by the military forces, security forces continued to commit numerous, se-
 rious, human rights abuses, which the Government was largely unable or unwilling
 to prevent. Perpetrators generally were not punished.
 Military forces committed extrajudicial killings, including- massacres of unarmed
 civilian Hutus. With their superior firepower and wide dispersion, the armed forces
 committed the most widespread abuses. Tutsi civilian extremists sometimes accom-
 panied the armed frces during_ operations, and the armed forces permitted them
 to engage in violence agnt Hutus. There continued to be numerous disappear-
 ances. There were- credible reports of torture of prisoners. Prison conditions remain
 life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and lengthy p retrial detention are problems. The
 court system suffers from a lengthy backlog. The dysfunctional justice system could
 not effectively address-the country's problems because of its lack of independence,
 inefficiency, administrative disruption, and the partiality of its Tutsi officials. Au-
 thorities infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government controls nearly all
 the media. The- Government restricts freedom of assembly and prohibits political
 demonstrations. The Government limits freedom of association. The Government
 place some restrictions on freedom of movement.
 According to an intern         a       De orgation  hman s  or gni tion, fewer civilians- were
 killed that in the previous year;, however, serious incidents of ethnically motivated
 destruction and extrajudicial killing occurred throughout the country.
 Government efforts to restore-security were inadequate. Armed troops, civilian mi-
 litias, and rebel forces killted  thardand ethnic rvals, including
 women, children, and the elderly. Land mines killed and injured many persons,
 mostly noncombatants. Members-of the armed forces, vigilante groups, and rebel
 tups committed serious human rights violations with impunity. The continuing
 lack of accountability for killings and ethnic violence and impunity for those respon-
 sible for the 1993 coup attempt and tenethnic massacres that followed contributed
 significantly to national insecurity.
 S Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Legal and societal dis-
 crimination against women- continues to be a seriou problem; violence against
 women also occurs. Ethnic discriminationagainst-Hutus is widespread. The Twa
 (Pygmy) minority remains_ marginalized-economically, socially, and~plitically. The
 Governmentcannot protect the rights of children or prevent discrimination against
 the disabled.
 Tutsi militias committed serious abuses. However, a human rights.organization
 reported-that there were fewer instances of armed Tftsi vigilantes engaging in vio-
 lence against Hutus.
 Hutu rebel forces committed serious abuses, including massacres of both Ilutu
 and Tutsi civilians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Fixtrajudicial Killing.-Amnesty international estimated
 that between October 1993 and August 1997. Approximately 200,000 people were
 killed in ethnic-violence,G according to independent reports. An international relief
 -organization estimated that between 4,500 to 9,000 persons (an average of 500 to
 1000 persons per month) were killed during the first 9 months of the year.
 According to international observers, during the month   of January, in
 Buteganzwa and Rang Communes, Kayanza province, government troops sum-
 manly executed 200 -to 300 young Hutu men as well   a number of women and
 children, while forcibly resettling the local Hutu population into regroupment
 camps. According to an international human rights organization, on January 5, sol-
 
 
 diers and vigilantes attacked civilians in Bukeye Commune, Muramvya province,
 killing 26 persons.
 On January 10, in Muyinga province near the Kobero border crossing, according
 to a number of sources, gendarmes killed between 122 and 128 Burundian Hutu ref-
 ugees who had been expelled from Tanzania and were believed to belong to an
 armed rebel group. Following this incident, the regional military commander was
 replaced and the gendarmes taken into custody.
 On March 1, according to an international human rights organization, soldiers
 killed 37 persons in Muhuta Commune, Bujumbura Rural province. On March 27,
 at the village of Mitonto, Rumonge Commune, Bururi province, government troops
 killed 147 civilians, according to independent press reports. The Government ini-
 tially claimed that its troops had killed only 4 persons, but later revised the total
 number of deaths to 57 persons. On April 1, the Government announced that it had
 sent an investigation team into the area.
 On May 7, according to a Western observer, government troops killed 10 to 15
 persons and wounded a number of others in Isare Commune, Bujumbura Rural
 rvince. On May 11, according to an international human rights organization, sol-
 iers ordered civilians in Kanyosha Commune, Bujumbura Rural province, to as-
 semble, then fired upon them, killing 15 persons. Several sources reported that on
 May 15, at the pentecostal church of Mugendo, Bujumbura Rural province, soldiers
 arrested 45 persons, executed 42 of them, and wounded three other persons.
 According to a Western observer, on June 6, soldiers based at Mugendo,
 Bujumbura Rural province, killed 17 civilians who were returning to their homes
 in Muhuta Commune, Bujumbura Rural province.
 On June 13, according to a Western source, in Bujumbura Rural province, govern-
 ment troops fired on villagers participating in a funeral ceremony, killing six per-
 sons and wounding four others.
 In early August, an antitank mine detonated in Cibitoke province killing nine per-
 sons, according to an international relief organization.
 The Government concluded the trials of several hundred persons accused of con-
 spiracy in the ethnic massacres following the October 1993 death of former Presi-
 dent Melchior Ndadaye. According to an international human rights organization,
 44 persons were convicted and sentenced to death during 1997. More than 100 per-
 sons have been convicted and sentenced to death since March 1996. On July 31, the
 Government executed six of those convicted.
 The three persons accused of the 1995 killings of Italian religious workers in
 Bururi province have not been brought to justice. According to a high-ranking offi-
 cial, the Government is seeking the extradition of the accused perpetrators from
 Rwanda and Uganda, to which they are believed to have fled following their "escape
 from custody" in 1995.
 The Government's investigation of the June 1996, killing in Cibitoke province of
 three expatriate employees of the ICRC by unknown gunmen has not produced any
 arrests. The Government claims that Hutu rebels were responsible for the murders,
 but others accuse the army.
 In early August, FRODEBU party parliamentarian Paul Sirahenda and his chauf-
 feur disappeared in Makamba province. Sirahenda's burned-out car was found near
 the Tanzanian border. Sirahenda and his chauffeur were not found. According to
 FRODEBU, Sirahenda is the twenty-third regular or alternate FRODEBU par-
 liamentarian killed since the October 1993 coup. In 1996 the military forces claimed
 that they had arrested 25 suspects involved in some of these killings and disappear-
 ances. However, none of the suspects has been tried for any of these killings or the
 attempted killings of several prominent Hutu politicians.
 On January 2 and 3, according to an international human rights organization,
 Hutu rebels attacked the commune of Bubanza, Bubanza province. They killed 14
 persons and injured 9 others.
 On January 12 and 13, according to an international human rights organization,
 Hutu rebels attacked the commune of Rugombo, Cibitoke province. They killed 22
 persons and wounded 4 others.
 On March 8, three people were killed in Kanyosha commune, Bujumbura rural
 province, by Hutu rebels, according to an international human rights organization.
 On March 19 and 20, according to a Western observer, Hutu rebels attacked three
 regroupment camps in Buganda Commune, Cibitoke province and killed 153 per-
 sons.
 On July 20, in the Kabonza section of Nyanza-Lac Commune, Makamba province,
 Hutu rebels killed 13 civilians, burned a number of houses and stole cattle, accord-
 ingto a Western source.
 Hutu rebels killed Hutu civilians who refused to pay "taxes" to the rebels.

 b. Disappearance.-Human rights groups reported that abductions and disappear-
 ances were commonplace throughout the year. Disappearances were the result of
 both ethnic and political rivalry. Reliable numerical estimates are not available. See
 Section L.a. for information regarding the June 13 disappearance of FRODEBU
 party parliamentarian Paul Sirahenda.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the decree of September 13, 1996, and the suspended constitution prohibit
 these abuses; however, members of the security forces continued to torture and oth-
 erwise abuse persons.
 Conditions n state-run prisons were life threatening and characterized by severe
 overcrowding and inadequate hygene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Pris-
 oners must rely on family memers to provide an adeuate diet, and officials ac-
 knowledged that digestive illness was a serious problem among the prisoners.
 Women were housed separately from men. UN. human rights monitors and rep-
 resentatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were permitted to visit
 prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, and exile; however, arbitrary arrest and detention are problems. The law
 places no limit on the total length of pretrial detention. Presiding magistrates are
 authorized to issue arrest warrants. Regular police and gendarmes can make arrests
 without a warrant but must submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours
 of any arrest. A magistrate can order the suspect released or confirm the charges
 and continue detention, initially for 15 days, then subsequently for periods of 30
 days as necessary to prepare the case for trial.
 The law requires arrest warrants. The police must follow the same procedures as
 magistrates, but have detained suspects for extended periods without announcing
 charges, certifying the cases, or forwarding them to the Ministry of Justice as re-
 quired. There were numerous instances of arbitrary arrest. Bail was permitted in
 some cases. According to a human rights organization, incommunicado detention ex-
 ists, although the law prohibits it.
 The disruption of the political process and the general level of insecurity severely
 impeded the judicial process. There are reportedly more than 7,000 pretrial detain-
 ees, or about 80 percent of the prison population
 Ex-president and Parena party leader Jean-Baptiste Bagaza has been under
 house arrest since March 16. H-e is accused of plotting against the life of the Presi-
 dent and illegal possession of military weapons.
 On July 4, 44 of the 79 people detained for alleged involvement in the 1993 coup
 attempt were arraigned be ore the Supreme Court; 29 entered pleas. All 29 pled not
 guilty.
 Around September 1, Louis Ntureka, FRODEBU member and accountant of the
 National Assembly, was arrested at a roadblock in Bujumbura and accused of being
 in contact with armed Hutu rebels. On September 2, Callixte Masabo, an agron-
 omist and FRODEBU member who is the director of the Government's regional de-
 velopment society of Rumonge in Bururi province was arrested and accused of being
 in contact with armed- Hutu rebels. Around September 5, Doctor Sylvere Sakubu,
 a member of the 47-member national committee of FRODEBU, was arrested at his
 home in Bujumbura and accused of being in contact with armed Hutu rebels., On
 September 18, Uprna party leader Charles Mukasi was arrested and released the
 same day for conducting an unauthorized press conference.
 One human rights organization estimates that the authorities hold from 500 to
 1000 political detainees.
 The Government has not used forced exile as a means of political control. How-
 ever, many people remain in voluntary exile in Belgium, Kenya, Tanzania, Zaire,
 and elsewhere. Many senior officials keep their families outside the country. A num-
 ber of officials of the government of deposed president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
 fled the country in August 1996, and have not returned.
 e.Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The September 1996 decree provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is not independent and is dominated
 by Tutsis. According to an international human rights organization, Hutus ac-
 counted for only 5 percent of the country's 638 judges. Most citizens assume that
 the courts promote the interests of the dominant Tutsi minority; members of the
 Hutu majority believe that the Tutsi-dominated judicial system is biased against
 them.
 The judicial system is divided into civil and criminal courts with the Supreme
 Court at the apex. The military forces have a separate judicial system.
 Citizens do not have regular access to civilian and military court proceedings, al-
 though trials are theoretically public. Defendants are presumed innocent and have
 the right to appeal. While defendants have a right to counsel and to defend them-
 
 
 selves, few have legal representation in practice. The civil court system functioned,
 although the lack of a well-trained and adequately supported judiciary constrained
 expeditious proceedings. In 1996 criminal courts were reestablished in Bujumbura
 and in the provincial centers of Gitega and Ngozi. Besides the frequent lack of coun-
 sel for the accused, other major shortcomings in the legal system include a lack of
 adequate funding and trained personnel and an outmoded legal code. Many citizens
 have lost confidence in the system's ability to provide even basic protection. The
 vast majority of those arrested on criminal charges since October 1993 remained in
 custody awaiting trial.
 According to an international human rights organization, during the year, the
 criminal courts initiated trials of 474 defendants in cases related to the 1993 ethnic
 massacres that followed the killing of former president Ndadaye. Foreign lawyers
 provided under United Nations' auspices helped defend some of the accused.
 The courts handed down approximately 150 sentences in these trials. There were
 38 persons sentenced to death, 6 of whom were hanged on July 31; 59 others given
 riSen sentences; and 24 acqitted. Many others remain in detention and have not
 aced trial (see Section 1.d.). The six executions were the first civilians executed
 since 1982.
 There are no clearly identifiable political prisoners. However, charges brought
 against defendants in nonpolitical crimes are sometimes politically motivated.
 At year's end, the Government continued its prosecution of approximately 20 de-
 fendants accused of participation in the 1993 coup and killing of former president
 Ndadaye, including several past and present members of the military forces. The
 prospect of any serious punishment of these senior defendants appeared remote.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1996 decree provides for the right to privacy, but according to reports, the authori-
 ties generally do not respect the law requiring search warrants. Security forces are
 assumed to monitor telephones regularly.
 The armed forces reportedly destroyed the homes of persons forced into regroup-
 ment camps (see Section 2.d.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-Continuing insecurity has limited international humanitarian relief oper-
 ations in some areas.
 Government forces forced Hutu peasants to leave their homes in Bubanza,
 Bujumbura Rural, Bururi, Karuzi, Kayanza, and Muramvya provinces and move
 into regroupment camps, according to international relief agency officials.
 According to an international human rights organization, the army burned large
 numbers of civilian homes during military operations in Bubanza, Bujumbura rural,
 Bururi, Cibitoke, Gitega, Karuzi, Makamba, and Muramvya provinces. A local
 source near Isale Commune, Bujumbura Rooral province, reported that after an
 antitank mine detonated on July 13, the army retaliated by burning homes in a 5-
 square-kilometer region near the incident.
 On March 25, according to an international relief organization, three cars deto-
 nated antitank mines in Bujumbura. Seven persons were killed; one person was re-
 ported missing. On April 6, according to an international relief organization, one ad-
 ditional antitank and three antipersonnel mines were detonated in Bujumbura,
 wounding three persons.
 On April 14, according to an international human rights organization, Hutu rebels
 attacked Hutu refugees who had returned from Tanzania at a camp in Mutongo
 commune, Muyinga province, killing three persons and wounding four others. On
 April 30, according to a Western observer, Hutu rebels attacked a seminary in
 Bururi province, killing 43 persons and wounding 40 others.
 On May 1, in Minago commune, Bururi province, according to a Western observer,
 two persons, including a Catholic nun, were killed when their vehicle detonated a
 land mine.
 On May 19, according to an international observer, Hutu rebels launched three
 attacks which killed 66 recently returned Burundian Hutu refugees in Cibitoke
 province. On June 7, a Hutu rebel attack in Bubanza province resulted in the- death
 of one civilian, according to a Western observer.
 According to various sources, on June 30, in the Kiriri neighborhood of
 Bujumbura, an antitank mine exploded under the car of Burundi's National Assem-
 bly Speaker. The speaker's wife and chauffeur were wounded, and a soldier riding
 in the car was killed. The speaker was not in the car at the time. On July 13, an
 antitank mine detonated near Isale Commune, Bujumbura Rural province, wound-
 ing three persons, according to a local newspaper.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no restrictions imposed on the press
 by the decree of-September 13, 1996; however, the regime owns the only newspaper
 and the two major radio stations.
 The Government-owned Le Renouveau, which is published 3 times per week, is
 'the only-mewspaper that appears regularly. Other newspapers, including at least
 one opposition newspaer, appear irregularly. Newspaper readership remains lim-
 ited. Political tracts an news sheets continue to circulate. These represent a variety
 of olitical viewpoints, sometimes of.an extremist nature.
 There were reports of a number.of instances in which security forces harassed for-
 eign journalists.
 Most citizens rely on the two government-owned radio stations.for information.
 One station-broadcasts in Kirundi Language, the other in French and Swahili, with
 limited programming in English. There is one independent radio station, Radio
 Umwizero, financed by the European Union, which broadcasts in French and
 Kirundi. Citizens also receive the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Voice of
 America, and other international broadcasts. The clandestine radio station that had
 supported the political -opposition during 1996 was not operating at year's end.
 No laws or regulations limit academic freedom. Although no persons were per-
 secuted for what they published or said, the University of 'Burundi remains pri-
 marily a monoethnic..Tutsi institution. Tutsi students discouraged -utus from re-
 turning to attend the university.
 b. Freedom of Peacefu Assembly and Association.-The Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. The September 1996 decree prohibits political demonstrations. The
 regimehad banned-politcal parties immediately following the July 1996 coup. How
 ever, the Government has arrested leaders and members of the FRODEBU,Parena,
 and Uprona political parties (see Section 1.d.), thereby limiting freedom of associa-
 tion.
 The September 1996 decree permits political parties to operate. They were active
 in the interior during the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right. There is no state religion, and the Government made no
 attempt to restrict freedom of -worship by adherents of any religion. However, au-
 thorities arrested four clerics on charges of aiding Hutu rebels. According to inter-
 national observers, two Catholic priests, the head of the Baptist Church and the
 Quaker director of a hospital, all Hutus, were arrested and charged with aiding
 Hutu rebels. One of the Catholic priests was tried and sentenced to 2 years in pris-
 on; the other has been held without charge since August 1. The Baptist cleric and
 the Quaker hospital director were released. The Government has little ability to pro-
 tect politically targeted members of the clergy.
 d.  Freedomn of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights; however, the Government has in
 some instances restricted citizens' foreign travel for political reasons. The Govern-
 ment says that the restrictions are for legal, not political, reasons. For example, the
 Government refused to permit the departure of National Assembly speaker Leonce
 Ngendakumana from the country. Ngendakumana was summoned by the state pros-
 ecutor for questioning on six occasions since October 10, 1996. He has not been for-
 mally charged but the Government has prevented him from leaving the country be-
 cause, the Govenent has said, he is under investigation.
 In June former president Ntibantunganya left the protection of a foreign ip-
 lomat's residence where he had sought refuge following the July 1996 coup. He was
 since permitted to travel freely in the country.
 The border with the Democratic Republic of Congo has been officially reopened.
 Despite the economic embargo, citizens continue tombe able to travel in and out of
 the country.
 In 1996, in Karuzi province, the Government initiated a polic. of frcible resettle-
 ment of rural populations into regrupment camps, ostensibly to better protect
 them. At its peak this policy resulted in the regroupment of nearly 300,000 people
 into 40 to 45 regroupment camps.
 In September there were a total of 230,000 people in regroupment camps, accord-
 ing to an international relief organization. The camps were in Bujumbura Rural,
 Bururi, Karuzi, Kayanza and Muramvya provinces. International observers believe
 that some of the 46,000 people in camps or internally displaced people in Cibitoke
 province may also be regrouped people. The vast majority of persons in regroupment
 camps are Hutu, although some are Tutsi.
 The Government has announced its intention to permit regrouped persons in
 Karzi, Kayanza, and Muramvya provinces to depart. Beginning in June, in
 Kayanza province, the Government allowed 35,000 regrouped persons to return to
 
 
 33
 their homes, according to an international relief agency. On September 9, deteriorat-
 ing security conditions caused the Government to halt temporarily the departure of
 regrouped people in Kayanza province.
 According to a number of sources, the army often destroyed the houses of re-
 grouped persons. It reportedly razed hundreds of homes in this process. For those
 in the camps, some farming is possible, although only with permission of the mili-
 tary authorities. Serious health, water, and malnutrition problems exist in many
 camps. Those who are found in the hills without a camp pass are considered to be
 rebels and often are shot by government soldiers, according to a number of sources.
 Hutu rebels reportedly shoot Hutus who remain outside the camps. The rebels be-
 lieve that these Hutus inform the military forces about the rebellion.
 Travel is possible in many parts of the country. However, armed rebel activity,
 particularly in parts of Bubanza, Bururi, Cibitoke, and Makamba provinces, makes
 travel in some areas perilous. In a number of regions, the population is segregated
 into Tutsi areas and Hutu areas.
 A large proportion of the populations of the provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza,
 Bujumbura Rural, and Karuzi are estimated to be internally displaced persons. Hu-
 manitarian agency officials believe that up to 600,000 citizens may be internally dis-
 placed. The high level of insecurity in affected areas continues to make accurate as-
 sessment of the number of internally displaced persons difficult, or to provide ade-
 quate humanitarian assistance for them.
 According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 78,000
 refugees were repatriated from Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of
 Congo during the year. In addition, according to the UNHCR, at year's end about
 247,000 Burundian refugees, most of them Hutu, remain in Rwanda, Tanzania, and
 the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some of these persons fled as early as 1972, and
 many fled following the assassination of former president Ndadaye in 1993. Some
 fled the country during the year, but the UNHCR is unable to estimate their num-
 ber.
 The Government has approved first asylum in recent years.
 According t the UNHCR, there are approximately 20,000 citizens of the Demo-
 cratic Re pubic of the Congo in Burundi, many of whom claim asylum. About 1,000
 new Congolese sought asylum during 1997.
 The Rwandan refugee community is divided into two groups: Those who fled the
 1994 ethnic massacres in Rwanda and were officially registered as refugees by the
 UNHCR; and those who came in earlier waves of refugees, some as early as 1959.
 The pre-1994 refugees, numbering about 200,000, are not officially registered with
 the UCR and have largely been integrated into Burundian society.
 The UNHCR helped repatriate 800 officially registered Rwandan refugees in 1997.
 Other Rwandan refugees not registered with the UNHCR also repatriated on their
 own. Virtually no Rwandan refugees registered with the UNHCR remain in the
 country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The September 1996
 decree makes no provision regarding elections. The 1992 Constitution and 1994 Con-
 vention of Government wereboth suspended by the Buyoya military regime, which
 assumed power on July 25, 1996, in a bloodless coup. On that date, the regime dis-
 solved the National Assembly and banned political parties. On September 13, 1996,
 Major Buyoya announced the restoration of the National Assembly and political par-
 ties with certain restrictions.
 In practice, the National Assembly cannot function normally until it determines
 under what authority it can act. Many members are unwilling to operate under the
 authority of Buyoya's decree.
 The 81-seat National Assembly operates under significant restraints. It lacks op-
 erating funds, salaries for staff, office supplies, and fuel for official vehicles. The last
 elections to fill the Assembly were held in June 1993. Not all of those elected are
 still living, and many have left the country. Under the 1992 Constitution, deposed
 president Ntibantunganya was to have remained in office until 1998, when legisla-
 tive elections had been scheduled.
 The September 1996 decree stipulates that the National Assembly consist of Par-
 liamentarians elected in 1993 who sat in the previous National Assembly. Under the,
 decree, the President may appoint additional parliamentarians, but he has not yet
 chosen to exercise this power. While the National Assembly has nominal budgetary
 oversight, the September 1996 decree allows the Council of Ministers to enact a
 budget if the National Assembly fails to do so. The decree also gives the President
 
 
 the authority to declare a state of emergency by decree and without reference to the
 National Assembly.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or indigenous people
 in elections or politics. In practice, however, both women and the ethnic Twa (Pyg-
 mies) are underrepresented in government and in politics. Women currently hold 2
 of 27 cabinet seats and were elected to 9 of 81 seats in the National Assembly. How-
 ever, one of the nine was killed in Cibitoke province in 1995. Although Twa con-
 stitute about 1 percent of the population, there are no Twa in either the Cabinet
 or the National Asembly (see alo Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups received var  g degrees of cooperation from govern-
 ment ministries and local authorities. The ocal human rights group Iteka continued
 to operate and publish a newsletter on the human rights situation.
 Human Rights Watch/Africa visited during the year. The United Nations Center
 for Human.Rights has an office in the country. The work of human rights organiza-
 tions was hampered, however, by insecurity in the countryside and by the Govern-
 ment's inability, and in some cases unwillingness, to protect human rights workers.
 Citing security concerns, local military authorities refused access to some areas
 of the interior to journalists, human rights workers, and international relief officials.
 Militant extremists, both Hutu and Tutsi, threatened the lives of people investigat-
 ing human rights violations.
 'On May 27, the Government submitted a request to the U.N. Security Council
 that an international, tribunal be established to try-those implicated, in the events
 of 1993. U.N. Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan declined to- recommend the establish-
 ment of such a tribunal in the form proposed: and under the prevailing cir-
 cumstances.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The September 1996 decree explicitly provides equal status and protection for all
 citizens, without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion, or opinion.
 However, the Government failed to enforce effectively all the decree's provisions.
 Hutus continue to perceive, correctly, that there is discrimination against them by
 the Tutsi-dominated Government.
 Women.-Violence against women occurred, but there was no documentation of its
 extent. Wives have the right to bring physical abuses charges against their hus-
 bands; in practice, they rarely do so. Police normally do not intervene in domestic
 disputes, and the media do not report incidents of violence against women, including
 Tape. There were no known court cases dealing with the abuse of women.
 Women face both legal and societal discrimination. There continue to be explicitly
 discriminatory inheritance laws and discriminatory credit practices. Although by
 law women must receive the same pay as men for the -same work, women are far
 less likely to hold mid-level or high-level positions. In rural areas, women tradition-
 ally perform hard farm work and have less opportunity for education than men.
 Children.-The law provides for children's health and welfare but the Government
 cannot adequately adrss the needs of the large population of orphans resulting
 from the violence since 1993. Many of the victims of massacres were children. The
 Government provides elementary education at nominal cost through grade 6; about
 60 percent of school-age �children are enrolled. It also provides subsidized health
 care for all family members.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated access to buildings-or Xovernment services for people with disabil-
 ities. The rudimentary economy effectively excludes the physically disabled from
 many types of employment.
 Indigenous People.-The Twa (Pygmy) minority remains marginalized economi-
 cally, socially, and politically. Most Twa continued to live in isolation, uneducated,
 and without access to government services, including health care. The Twa remain
 essentially outside of the political process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The principal national problem continued to
 be ethnic conflict between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis. The Tutsis
 have historically held power and still control the military force and dominate edu-
 cated society. The 1996 coup deposed president Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, and re-
 placed him with Major Buyoya, a Tutsi.
 Ethnic discrimination against Hutus, who constitute 85 percent of the population,
 affects every facet of society, including the Government, the military forces, and the
 judiciary. o    en  utus serve as Cabinet ministers in the Government, but real
 
 
 power rests with Buyoya and the Tutsi-dominated army. The Government continued
 its program of Hutu military recruitment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Labor Code nominally protects the rights of
 workers to form unions, although the army, gendarmerie, and expatriates working
 in the public sector are prohibited from union participation. Most union workers are
 urban civil servants.
 According to the Confederation of Free Unions of Burundi (CSB), the country's
 first national umbrella trade union, 60 percent of the 75,000 formal private sector
 employees are unionized. All employees in the public sector except those involved
 in activities related to public security are unionized.
 Since gaining its independence from the Government in 1992, the CSB has been
 financially dependent on a system of checkoffs, as are local unions. In 1995, a rival
 umbrella trade union, the Confederation of Burundi Unions (Cosebu), was founded.
 Both Cosebu and the CSB represented labor in collective bargaining negotiations in
 cooperation with individual labor unions during the year.
 Unions are Tutsi-dominated, reflecting the act that it is mainly Tutsis who are
 employed in the formal sector of the economy. The unions have also been strong
 supporters of the Government.
 The Labor Code permits the formation of additional unions or confederations out-
 side the CSB. When settling disputes in which more than one labor union is rep-
 resented, the law stipulates that the Minister of Labor will chose the union rep-
 resenting the greatest number of workers to participate in the negotiations.
 The Labor Code provides workers with a restricted right to strike. The restrictions
 on the right to strike and to lock out include: All other peaceful means of resolution
 must be exhausted prior to the strike action; negotiations must continue during the
 action, mediated by a mutually agreed upon party or by the Government; and 6
 days' notice must be given. The law prohibits retribution against workers participat-
 ing in a legal strike, and this provision is upheld in practice.
 Unions are able to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code recognizes
 the right to collective bargaining, formerly acknowledged only by ordinance. Since
 most workers are civil servants, government entities are involved in almost every
 phase of labor negotiations.
 Public sector wages are set in fixed scales in individual contracts and are note
 affected by collective bargaining. In the private sector, wage scales also exist, but
 individual contract negotiation is possible.
 The Labor Code gives the Labor Court jurisdiction over all'1abor dispute cases,
 including those involving public employees.' Negotiations are conducted largely
 under the supervision of the tripartite National Labor Council, the Government's
 highest consultative authority on labor issues. The Council represents government,
 labor, and management and is presided over and regulated by the Minister of Labor.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from firing or otherwise discriminating
 against a worker because of union affiliation or activity. This right is upheld in
 practice.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits the performance
 of forced or compulsory labor by adults and children, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices' and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The Labor Code states that children under
 the age of 16 cannot be employed by "an enterprise" even as apprentices, although
 it also states that they may undertake occasional work that does not damage their
 health or interfere with their schooling. In practice, in rural areas children under
 age 16 do heavy manual labor such as transporting bricks in daytime during the
 school year.
 Children are legally prohibited from working at night, although many do so in the
 informal sector. Children are obliged by custom and economic necessity Wo help sup-
 port their families by participating in activities related to subsistence agriculture,
 in family-based enterprises, and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The formal minimum wage for unskilled work-
 ers is $0.40 (145 francs) per day in the cities of Bujumbura and Gitega, and-$0.35
 (120 francs) in the rest of the country, with a graduated scale for greater skill levels.
 This amount does not allow a worker and family to maintain a decent standard of
 living, and most families rely on second incomes and subsistence agriculture to sup-
 plement their earnings. A survey of day-labor wage rates in nine provinces by an
 
 
 36
 international organization revealed that actual wages ranged upward from $.30 per
 dal.
 unionized employees, particularly in urban areas, generally earn significantly
 more than the minimum wage. Public sector wages are set by agreement between
 the Government and either the CSB or Cosebu.
 The Labor'Code stipulates an 8-hour workday and 40-hour workweek, except in
 cases where workers are involved in activities related to national security. Supple-
 ments must be paid for overtime. The Labor Code establishes health and safety
 standards requiring an employer toprovide a safe workplace and assigns enforce-
 ment responsibility to the Minister of Labor. However, the Ministry does not enforce
 the code effectively. Health and safety articles in the Labor Code do not directly ad-
 dress workers' rights-to remove themselves from a dangerous work situation.
