 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic became a democracy in 1993 following free and fair
 elections in which Ange Felix Patasse, candidate of the Movement for the Liberation
 of the Central African People, was chosen President. Citizens also elected an 85-
 member National Assembly; no party holds a majority. In 1994 a Constitution pro-
 viding for multiparty democracy was accepted in a national referendum. The judici-
 ary is subject to executive interference.
 The Government faced major crises during the year in the form of three mutinies
 by members of the armed forces. In April 200 soldiers protested their poor living
 conditions and the Government's failure to pay salary arrearages. The Government
 eventually paid the back salaries and restored order with the help of the French
 army. Following the mutiny, the President suspended political activity and public
 assembly, and restricted free movement out of the country. The political opposition
 demanded the resignation of the Government and new elections. In May approxi-
 mately 500 soldiers again rebelled, ostensibly to protest the Government's transfer
 of control of the arsenal from the army to the Presidential Guard. More than 100
 people were killed, many children were wounded, and soldiers detained the presi-
 dent of the National Assembly and other officials as hostages at Camp Kasai in the
 capital. French troops overwhelmed the rebels, who apparently had intended to
 overthrow the Government. After international diplomatic intervention and the ef-
 forts of civic leaders, the crisis was resolved in June with the formation of a Govern-
 ment of National Unity, a coalition arrangement that included members of major
 political parties. The agreement also included a protocol to increase the constitu-
 tional powers of the Prime Minister. Patasse appointed Jean-Paul Ngoupande to
 that post.
 In mid-November the attempted arrest by the Government of former army officer
 Andre Saulet incited an ethnically based revolt by rebel government troops from the
 Yakoma ethnic group, supporters of former president Kolingba, a relative of Saulet.
 
 
 The Yakoma, excluded from the current Government, comprised at least half the
 army. Some civilians, including several magistrates and private sector professionals,
 supported the rebellion goals of dismissal of President Patasse and the establish-
 ment of a new government. Four Organization of African Unity Francophone heads
 of state, from Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Gabon, brokered an initial cease-fire.
 Negotiations for a lasting settlement continued into 1997 under the leadership of
 former Malian President, General Toumani Toure.
 The military forces and the National Gendarmerie, under the Minister of Defense,
 share internal security responsibilities with the civilian police force, under the direc-
 tion of the Minister of Public Security. Under President Patasse, the Presidential
 Security Guard was reduced in size and responsibility. Security forces committed se-
 rious human rights abuses.
 The Central African Republic is a landlocked and sparsely populated country,
 most of whose inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture. Annual per capita gross
 domestic product is estimated at $357. Principal exports are coffee, cotton, timber,
 tobacco, and diamonds. The 1994 currency devaluation raised producers' prices,
 boosted rural income, and constrained consumption. The military and civil unrest
 during the year resulted in significant decreases in public revenues and higher un-
 employment.
 The Government's human rights record remained the same, and serious human
 rights abuses continue in certain areas. There were credible reports of routine sum-
 mary executions of suspected bandits by security forces. Police torture and beatings
 of detainees continued. The President granted amnesty to rebel forces, and the Gov-
 ernment did not prosecute members of the armed forces who had committed abuses
 during the April and May mutinies. Some type of amnesty is expected for the No-
 vember mutiny. Other human rights abuses included harsh prison conditions, abuse
 of prisoners, prolonged detention, limits on judicial independence and efficiency, re-
 strictions on freedom of assembly and association, infringements on citizens' right
 to privacy, some limits on freedom of religion, restraints on press freedom to criti-
 cize the Government, a pattern of discrimination and violence against women, and
 discrimination against Pygmies.
 Local human rights monitors expressed concern over the extended detention in ex-
 ces of legal limits of ex-officials from the previous regime charged with corruption;
 some of these cases went to trial, but many remained pending. The new Constitu-
 tional Court named in January was sworn in during November.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings (former Interior Minister Grelombe was killed by unknown persons during
 the November mutiny) but there were credible reports that the army and gendar-
 merie forces routinely conducted summary executions of suspected bandits in border
 regions. The Government did not prosecute members of the security forces for these
 killings or for other killings. Many prisoners died in custody at the Comissariat in
 connection with the repression of banditry, according to the Human Rights League.
 Soldiers killed an estimated 200 persons during the army mutinies. President
 Patasse granted amnesty to the soldiers who had mutinied in April and May. As
 proposed by the mediation team, amnesty for the November rebellion was pending
 at year's end. The Government neither investigated nor prosecuted members of the
 armed forces for abuses committed during the mutinies.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found
 guilty of physical abuse, the police continue to beat and otherwise abuse criminal
 suspects. There were reliable reports of abuse of prisoners. At one police station po-
 lice tortured and abused all the individuals detained. Many deaths of prisoners due
 to official abuse were reported to the courts, but with no evident response taken.
 The Government has not punished those responsible. The August-September Na-
 tional Conference on Defense (Etats-Generaux) recommended the abolition of special
 secret police units due to their abusive treatment of detainees and their operation
 as a parallel and secret arm outside the normal enforcement structure.
 Prison conditions are extremely harsh. Cells are overcrowded, and the basic neces-
 sities of life, including food, clothing, and medical care, are in short supply and rou-
 tinely diverted by prison officials for their personal consumption. Prisoners are fre-
 quentlyforced to  rform uncompensated labor at the residences of government offi-
 cias.  ale and emale prisoners are confined separately in Bangi, but together
 elsewhere. Minors are routinely housed with adults and subjected to abuse. Follow-
 
 
 47
 ing the May civil unrest, prisoners fled the infamous Ngaragba prison unhindered.
 Despite promises to construct a new facility, the Government has reopened the pris-
 on.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that persons detained
 in cases other than those involving national security must be brought before a mag-
 istrate within 96 hours. In practice, the authorities often do not respect this dead-
 line, in part due to inefficient judicial procedures. Judicial warrants are not required
 for arrest. By law, national security detainees, defined as "those held for crimes
 against the security of the State," may be held without charge for up to 2 months.
 Although previous governments used the national security provision of the law to
 arrest opponents for exercising internationally recognized human rights, the Patasse
 Government has not detained any persons for such actions.
 Prolonged pretrial detention is a problem. Roughly one-half the male prison popu-
 lation are pretrial detainees. In September 1995, the criminal court began its first
 session in 2 years. On the docket were the cases of Kolingba regime (1981-93) offi-
 cials charged with corruption who, in some cases, had been detained more than 18
 months without trial. These cases remain pending, and some of the officials remain
 in custody. A parliamentary commission also investigating Kolingba-era corruption
 released its reports to the Ministry of Justice, but by year's end the Government
 had not published them.
 The law does not permit the use of exile, and the Government did not employ it
 in practice. The Government has repeatedly stated that any person in exile for
 strictly political, rather than criminal, reasons may return without fear of persecu-
 tion. At year's end, there were no known political self-exiles. Former Empress Cath-
 erine, wife of former Emperor Bokassa, briefly returned from exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but there are reliable reports of periodic executive interference.
 The judiciary, which consists of regular and military courts, was reorganized in
 the 1994 Constitution. Legislation implementing this reorganization was passed at
 the beginning of the year.
 In criminal cases, the accused are presumed innocent and have the right to legal
 counsel, to public trial, to be present at their trials, and to confront witnesses. The
 Government generally respects these safeguards in practice, but inefficient adminis-
 tration of the law, shortages of trained personnel and material resources hinder the
 process. The criminal court, for example, did not convene for 2 years for lack of
 money. Court proceedings are open to the public and frequently broadcast on na-
 tional radio.
 The August-September National Conference on Defense addressed many of the
 abuses in the military justice system and established long term recommendations
 for improvement.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although some observers note that
 anticorruption statutes at times appear to have been applied more rigorously to
 former officials of the previous regime than to current officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government on rare occasions abused the law that prohibits invasion of the home
 without a warrant in civil and criminal cases. Police did, however, use Title IV of
 the Penal Code, governing certain political and security cases, which allows them
 to search private property without special authorization. The Government also mon-
 itored the telephones of some opposition figures and cut their telephone lines after
 the April mutiny.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 speech and the press. Although the Government generally allows the press to oper-
 ate freely, it restricts press freedom to criticize the Government.
 Citizens spoke freely and publicly about political developments, the President's
 handling of certain issues, and political parties. Opposition leaders, in particular,
 used press statements, manifestos, broadsides, and copies of open correspondence to
 the Government to circulate their views. Although not all this documentation was
 published in the government-controlled media, the Government made no apparent
 effort to censure, seize, or halt circulation of these materials elsewhere.
 More than a dozen private newspapers were published over varying intervals,
 openly discussing a wide variety of views on political and social issues. The authori-
 ties did, however, restrict the ability of the press to criticize the Government. Gov-
 ernment officials sued several journalists following accusations of corruption pub-
 lished by their newspapers. Many journalists regarded this as official harassment.
 In August 1995, the editor of former President Kolingba's Rassemblement
 Democratique Centrafricaine party newspaper was sentenced to 2 years in prison
 
 
 for defamation after publishing an article that accused President Patasse of conspir-
 ing to murder a labor leader. In January another journalist, a member of the opposi-
 tion coalition CODEPO, was jailed for 1 month because he had accused the Presi-
 dent of violating the Constitution in becoming president of his own political party.
 The court found that no justifiable complaint was lodged against him by President
 Patasse, and released him. In a separate case in September, a journalist from the
 independent newspaper Le Novateur was arrested by presidential guards, and jailed
 for 5 days without trial. He was subsequently reapprehended, tried, and sentenced
 to 5 months in prison for criticizing the slow due process of the judiciary system
 and for accusing a senior ma strate of incompetence.
 The Government owns andcontrols one newspaper, which appears only sporadi-
 cally, a more regular wire service news bulletin, and a radio and television station.
 Government reluctance to allow opposition access to the media was criticized by the
 opposition as a blatant effort to impede its activities. A private radio station, Africa
 No. I which is based in Libreville Gabon has been operating since 1995, and a
 church-affiliated station began opeiations the same year. The Government refused
 to allow the establishment of other private radio stations for fear that they would
 become voices for the opposition. The Government has not yet set up the High
 Council of Communication to regulate the management of private media and help
 enforce press ethics. The Government did not impede foreign journalists in their
 work.
 The Government respects academic freedom. University faculty and students be-
 longed to many political parties and expressed their views without fear of reprisal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but the Government at times restricted this freedom. A 1992
 decree requires organizers of demonstrations and public meetings to register with
 the Government 48 hours in advance and also prohibits political meetings in schools
 or churches. The Government forbade public assembly and demonstrations during
 the aftermath of the April military revolt; no such order was issued after the May
 or November crises. Police dispersed a November demonstration by civil servants
 over pay and working conditions, using tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring a num-
 ber of protestors, and arresting 13 persons.
 Associations are required to register with the Government to enjoy legal status.
 All political parties must register with the Ministry of Public Security in order to
 participate legally in politics. While the Government usually grants registration ex-
 peditiously, in one case in 1995 it revoked a party's registration after the Ministry
 of Justice mounted a legal challenge based on the party's religious nature.
 There are more than 20 registered political parties and a variety of nonpolitical
 associations. The Government allowed them to hold congresses, elect officials, and
 publicly debate policy issues without interference.
 'c. Freedom of Religion.-iThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, but in-
 cludes fixed legal conditions and prohibits what the Government considers religious
 fundamentalism and intolerance. A 1994 constitutional provision prohibiting reli-
 gious fundamentalism is widely understood to be aimed at Muslims. There is no
 state religion, and a variety of religious communities are active. Religious organiza-
 tions and missionary groups are free to proselytize, worship, and construct places
 of worship. However, religious groups must register with the Government, and any
 group whose behavior the Government considers subversive remains subject to sanc-
 tions, although it imposed no sanctions on any group during the year.
 d. Freedom of Moverent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Peo ple are free to move within the country, but police and other offi-
 cials harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at checkpoints along major
 intercity roads and at major intersections in  angi he Government effectively
 prevented former President Kolingba and members of his family and other dig-
 nitaries of the former regime fromleaving Bangui. Some citizens, when attempting
 to leave the country, were informed by immigration authorities that their names
 were on unspecified official lists that forbade their departure. For example, in Sep-
 tember Henri Pouziere, a well-known lawyer who lived in Libreville, Gabon and who
 recently defended a journalist, was refused permission to board an airplane for polit-
 ical reasons. After an investigation, he was authorized to leave the country. Another
 member of the opposition group Front Patriotique Pour Le Progres originally was
 forbidden to leave Bangui for anada, his place of residence, because he was sus-
 pected of organizing a plot against the regime. Following pressure by the Human
 Rights League on the Ministers of Justice and Interior, he secretly fled the country.
 The Government continued to work with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in hosting Chadian and Sudanese refugees.
 Most refugees who were registered with the National Commission for Refugees re-
 mained in the country without difficulty. Many Chadians, however, have been ac-
 
 
 cused of criminal activity. Applicants for asylum are generally well-treated and
 often accepted. Chadian applicants, however, have been viewed with suspicion and
 have appealed to the UNI-CR for assistance.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised their constitutional right to change their government by demo-
 cratic means in the 1993 presidential and parliamentary elections. International ob-
 servers deemed the elections free and fair. In 1995, for the first time in its history,
 the Parliament passed a vote of censure to change the Government.
 The Constitution provides for multiple political parties and increased the powers
 and independence of the legislative and judicial branches at the expense of the exec-
 utive branch. Local elections scheduled for 1994 never took place due to budget re-
 strictions. In the interim, the Government appointed three successive mayors of
 Bangui, which engendered criticism from prodemocracy forces as reneging on a com-
 mitment. By-elections held in October 1995 to fill two vacant parliamentary seats
 were harshly criticized by the opposition for alleged irregularities.
 Of the 85 Parliament members, three are women. One of the 20 Cabinet members
 is a woman. There are few Muslims in government. About 10 Muslims serve in the
 National Assembly.
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), who represent from 1 to 2 percent of the national population,
 are not represented in the Government and have little political power or influence,
 although they voted in large numbers in the 1993 election.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation (NGO) with multiple goals, including publicizing human rights violations and
 pleading individual cases of human rights abuse before the courts. The LCDH dis-
 tributed its pamphlets describing individuals' rights and judicial information to the
 prisons, police stations, courts, schools, and NGO s.
 In the April and May mutinies the LCDH played an important role as mediator
 to help safeguard democratic institutions. In a letter to the President and govern-
 ment authorities, the LCDH criticized the Government's harassment of the press,
 excessive pretrial detentions in violation of the law, summary executions of sus-
 pected bandits, and the deaths of suspects while inplice custody in Bangui. Several
 other NGO's, including the Movement for the Defense of Human Rights and Hu-
 manitarian Action and the Central African Red Cross, pursued human rights activi-
 ties, including prison visits. The Government did not attempt to hinder any such
 activities.
 There were no known requests by international human rights organizations for
 visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 gard to wealth, race, sex, or religion, but the Government does not effectively en-
 force these provisions, and significant discrimination exists.
 Women.--Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs but it is impos-
 sible to quantify its extent as data are lacking, and victims seldom make reports.
 The courts try very few cases of spousal abuse, although litigants cite this abuse
 during divorce trials or in civil suits for damages. Some women reportedly tolerate
 abuse in order to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their
 children. The Government did not address this issue during the year.
 Despite the Constitution's provisions, in practice women are treated as inferior to
 men economically, socially, and politically. Women in rural areas, moreover, suffer
 more discrimination than women in urban areas. Sixty to 70 percent of urban fe-
 males go to primary school, while only 10 to 20 percent of their rural counterparts
 do. Overall, at theprimary level, females and males enjoy equal access to education,
 but the majority of young women drop out at the age of 14 or 15 due to social pres-
 sure to marry and bear children. Only 20 percent of the students at the University
 of Bangui are women. There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of female
 wage earners.
 Polygyny is legal, although this practice faces growing resistance among educated
 women. There is no legal limit on the number of wives a man may take, but a pro-
 spective husband must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether he in-
 tends to take further wives. In practice, many couples never formally marry because
 men cannot afford the traditional bride payment. Women who are educated and fi-
 nancially independent tend to seek monogamous marriages. Divorce is legal and
 
 
 may be initiated by either partner. The law does not discriminate against women
 in inheritance and property rights, but a welter of conflicting customary laws often
 prevails. A new family code drafted in 1995 by a conference sponsored by the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs is designed to strengthen women's rights. The proposed family
 code still awaited National Assembly approval at year's end.
 The Association of Central African Female Jurists' clinic advises women of their
 legal rights. It also published pamphlets in conjunction with the Ministry of Social
 Affairs on the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) and on food taboos.
 Children.-Although there is no official discrimination against children, the Gov-
 ernment spends little money on programs for children. There are few church and
 other NGO projects for youth. Most children are behind in their studies because of
 education strikes in the early 1990's. Education is compulsory beyond the age of 5,
 but parents are not prosecuted for truancy. Many Bangui street children survive by
 begging and stealing. Some are street vendors, part of the informal economy. Sev-
 eral charitable organizations strive to assist them.
 Courts interpret the Penal Code as forbidding parental blows or injuries to chil-
 dren under age 15. The proposed family code is designed to strengthen children's
 rights. For example, illegitimate children would have the same rights as those born
 in wedlock.
 An ordinance of February 22 formally abolished FGM, which is widely condemned
 by international health experts as damaging to bothaphysical and psychological
 health. This traditional practice is found in certain rural areas, and to a lesser de-
 gree in Bangui, and is performed at an early age. Approximately 45 to 50 percent
 of females have undergone FGM. A campaign of awareness organized by the Min-
 istry of Social Welfare and women's NGO's reduced the incidence of FGM in some
 rural areas. In 1996 the court registered one case of FGM that resulted in death.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no codified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several government-initiated programs designed to assist
 the disabled, including handicraft training for the blind and the distribution of
 wheelchairs and carts by the Ministry of Social Services. There is no legislated or
 mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice some minorities
 are treated unequally. In general, the countrys indigenous Pygmies have little abil-
 ity to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions, and the allo-
 cation of natural resources. In particular, indigenous forest-dwelling Pygmies are
 subject to social and economic  scrimination and exploitation, which the Govern-
 ment has done little to correct. Pygmies often work for villagers at wages lower than
 those paid to members of other groups. The LCDH received reports and photos of
 a Pygmy child tortured by a villager who accused him of stealing at his farm. The
 villager had burned the child's hands. The court convicted him and sentenced him
 to prison.
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peulh) herders, claim to
 have been singled out for harassment by the authorities, including shakedowns by
 police, due to popular resentment of their presumed affluence. Muslims play a pre-
 ponderant role in the economy.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are about 90 ethnic groups, and in the
 past there was little ethnic balance at the higher levels of government. Under the
 Kolingba regime, members of the minority Yakoma ethnic group held a dispropor-
 tionate number of senior positions in government, the armed forces, and state-
 owned firms. The Patasse Government has brought about a more representative
 ethnic balance in government. Even so, observers note that members of northern
 ethnic groups close to the President are a majority in Patasse's Cabinet and also
 receive favorable treatment in government appointments.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Labor Code, all workers are free to form
 or join unions of their choosing without prior authorization. A relatively small part
 of the population has exercised rights of association, chiefly wage earners such as
 civil servants.
 The current Labor Code does not refer to trade unions by name, a change from
 previous versions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) had requested this
 change to reflect the proliferation of new unions. There are now five recognized
 labor federations, including the Organization of Free Public Sector Unions and the
 Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC). The USTC and its member unions
 continue to assert and maintain their official independence from the Government.
 The USTC never resolved its 1995 dispute with the Government concerning salary
 arrears.
 
 
 Unions have the right to strike in both the public and private sectors. To be legal,
 strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of demands, the employer's re-
 sponse to these demands, a conciliation meeting between labor and management,
 and a finding by an arbitration council that union and employer failed to reach
 agreement on valid demands. The union must also provide 8 days' notification in
 writing of planned strikes. The Labor Code states that if employers initiate a lock-
 out that is not in accordance with the Code, then the employer is required to pay
 workers for all days of the lockout. Other than this, the Code does not provide for
 sanctions on employers for acting against strikers. It is not known to what extent
 this policy is actually followed. The May teachers' strike resulted in the detention
 of 14 union members for violation of the "Law of the Freedom to Work." The detain-
 ees were released after 1 day.
 Labor federations are fee to affiliate internationally. The USTC is affiliated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In November police disbanded
 a demonstration by the Civil Service Trade Unions, who struck for better pay and
 working conditions. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets. They injured some
 demonstrators and arrested 13 persons.
 The Labor Code accords trade unions full legal status, including the right to sue
 in court. It requires that union officials be employed full-time in the occupation as
 a wage earner, but they nonetheless conduct union business during working hours.
 The Code does not specifically provide that unions may bargain collectively. While
 collective bargaining has nonetheless taken place in some instances, the Govern-
 ment is usually involved in the process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service and were in the
 process of revision at year's end. The nonpayment of salary arrears and higher
 consumer costs attributed to the 1994 devaluation continued to be the major com-
 plaints of the unions. The Government is undertaking reform in the civil service,
 including restructuring financial services.
 The law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or union activity. The Labor Code does not state whether employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code, and there were no reports of forced labor. Uncompensated
 prisoners are forced to work for government officials or magistrates.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age is forbidden by law, but the provision is only loosely enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice child labor is common in many sec-
 tors of the economy, especially in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor must set minimum wages by decree. Agricultural workers are guaranteed a
 minimum of $15 (cfa 7,800) per month, while office workers are guaranteed $36 (cfa
 18,000). Minimum wages differ among the various sectors. The minimum wage
 assures a family the basic necessities but is barely adequate to maintain a decent
 standard of living. Most labor is performed outside the wage and social security sys-
 tem, especially by farmers in the large subsistence agriculture sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 40 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Household employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. The law also requires that there be a minimum rest period of 48 hours.
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service neither precisely defines nor actively en-
 forces them, a matter about which the ILO has expressed concern to the Govern-
 ment for many years. The Labor Code states that a labor inspector may force an
 employer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions, but it does not provide the
 right for workers to remove themselves from such conditions.
