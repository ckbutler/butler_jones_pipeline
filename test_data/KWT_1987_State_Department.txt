 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's amirs, drawn from the al-Sabah family, have
 traditionally governed in consultation with the commercially
 powerful families and other community leaders. The 1962
 Constitution contains detailed provisions on the powers and
 relationships of the branches of government and on the rights
 of citizens. Kuwait's National Assembly has institutionalized
 a degree of consultation with the ruling family and served as
 an outlet for popular expression, including criticism of the
 Government. However, in July 1986 the Amir decreed the
 National Assembly's dissolution, citing the breakdown in
 cooperation between the executive and legislative branches at
 a time when the nation faced serious economic and security
 problems. It remains unclear when the Assembly will be
 reconvened, but the Amir has given assurances that Kuwait,
 unique in the Gulf region for its historical commitment to a
 popularly elected legislature, will not abandon its
 parliamentary process.
 Kuwaitis are a 40 percent minority in their own country,
 outnumbered by expatriate workers and the large resident
 Palestinian community. Kuwaiti citizens are around 70 percent
 Sunni Muslim; the remainder are Shi'a Muslim and a tiny
 minority of Christians. As a consequence of the Iranian
 revolution and the Gulf war, Kuwait's leadership faces the
 threat of Iranian-inspired subversion focused on the Shi'a
 community. Meanwhile, the majority Sunni community has
 experienced an Islamic revival, which frequently conflicts
 with the attitudes of the traditionally moderate members of
 the merchant class. Kuwait has upwards of 350,000 long-term
 Palestinian residents, many in their second generation.
 Non-Kuwaitis are given due process under the law but have few
 other civil and political rights.
 Kuwait maintains a small military force that includes army,
 navy, and air force units. Its security apparatus is centered
 in the Interior Ministry, whose Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID) is responsible for ordinary criminal cases.
 The Ministry's Office of Kuwait State Security (KSS) is charged
 with investigating internal security-related offenses. There
 is some overlap in CID's and KSS' operations; in terrorism
 cases, for example, both are active in investigations. The
 two offices work in collaboration with the country's uniformed
 police force, which is also under the Ministry's jurisdiction.
 With its large oil reserves, Kuwait enjoys a high standard of
 living. Its per capita gross national product was estimated
 at $10,700 as of 1986.
 In addition to dissolving the National Assembly, the Amir's
 July 1986 decrees imposed a system of prior censorship on the
 Kuwaiti press that remains in effect. The Government has
 stated that it is preparing a new press law that would do away
 with prior censorship, but it is unclear when the law will be
 enacted. The Amir's 1986 decrees added to existing
 restrictions on the political and civil rights of all Kuwaiti
 residents, women and non-Kuwaitis in particular. However, the
 Government rarely violates the integrity of the individual,
 and there is an independent judiciary.
 In 1987 there was an upsurge in terrorist incidents, primarily
 bombings of local oil facilities. Measures adopted by the
 Government to combat terrorism and the increased political
 turbulence in the region have resulted in increased
 restrictions. The State Security Court conducted trials of
 
 
 1210
 KUWAIT
 Kuwaiti citizens, all believed to be Shi'as, for bombings and
 subversive.activities. Some defendants received the death
 penalty, yet to be implemented, but the majority were
 acquitted. The terrorist acts have resulted in heightened
 tensions between the Sunni and Shi'a communities, but there
 have been no major sectarian disturbances.
 Kuwait's security organizations continue to have an expanded
 role, particularly with regard to the expatriate community,
 which has been the object of increased surveillance. The
 security organizations have also made greater use of their
 authority to deport foreigners summarily. The Government has
 rejected calls by the Islamic movement for adoption of a legal
 code based on Islamic law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings, but
 four persons died in terrorists incidents. In May the bombing
 of the locaL TWA agent's office claimed the life of an
 employee, and the bombing of a petroleum facility, also in
 May, resulted in the death of the suspected perpetrator. In
 July two other presumed bombers were killed in a car-bomb
 explosipn. The incidents were attributed to Kuwaiti Shi'a
 citizens loyal to Iran. There were no summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Unofficial butoknowledgeable sources in both the Sunni and
 Shi'a communities believe that authorities tortured at least
 some of the 12 Kuwaiti Shi'as arrested in January and February
 1987 for involvement in the bombing of oil facilities. No
 details on the torture are available, but the purpose was to
 obtain confessirns and leads on suspects at large. Reportedly,
 detainees' family members were also abused. There are reports
 that senior officials, on learning of the torture and
 mistreatment, ordered that such practices be stopped.
 In its-1987 Report covering 1986, Amnesty International (Al)
 expressed concern about allegations it had received of torture
 and ill-treatment by the State Security Intelligence Agency.
 AI said that most such allegations concerned foreign nationals
 who were detained for short periods and subsequently deported.
 Alleged methods included beatings and having hot water thrown
 on the detainee's head.
 In routine criminal cases, police and security officials,
 without authorization, occasionally use physical violence when
 interrogating persons suspected of committing criminal acts.
 These incidents do not appear to be systematic or condoned.
 Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to receive rough treatment than
 Kuwaitis, and the seriousness of the suspected crime also
 appears to play a role.
 
 
 1211
 KUWAIT
 Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a defense in
 Kuwait's courts, and confessions or other evidence obtained
 through torture are not admissible. The courts often hold
 police officers to account for abuses. In September the press
 reported that three police officers had been fined, sentenced
 to 3 months' imprisonment, and suspended from duty for 1 year
 for torturing the relative of a suspect.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines, with
 facilities for inmates' recreation and vocational training.
 By and large, prison guards treat inmates humanely, and the
 Government provides food and other necessities. Prisoners,
 including convicted terrorists held in maximum security
 facilities, are allowed to receive family and International
 Red Cross visits. Young offenders, few of whom are imprisoned,
 are separated from persons charged or convicted of serious
 crimes. There is no policy of discriminatory treatment among
 prisoners for racial or religious reasons. There are credible
 reports of substandard conditions in the detention centers,
 where expatriates facing deportation are typically held for
 several days prior to their departure.
 Kuwait's legal process, based primarily on the Napoleonic
 code, is also inspired by Islamic law, but punishments such as
 mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. In 1987 there were no reports of persons being
 detained for political reasons. The penal code affirms a
 person's right to due process and stipulates that a detainee
 may not be held for more than 4 days without charge. A
 prosecutor's approval is required for detention periods beyond
 24 hours. Thereafter, the suspect either must be released or
 charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize detention for up to
 an additional 21 days. Further detention pending trial may be
 authorized by a judge. Warrants are required unless a person
 is apprehended in the act of committing an offense. These
 legal safeguards are generally observed, with arrests being
 made openly and for specific violations of law. Reports of
 incommunicado detention are rare. Road blocks and spot checks
 of outdoor gatherings of expatriates, especially of South
 Asians, are used sporadically by the police during searches
 for illegal immigrants and contraband liquor. Persons without
 proper identification may be detained by the police under the
 procedures described above.
 In 1987 there may have been some cases of arbitrary detention
 in connection with the investigation of oil field bombings irk
 January. Besides the 12 Kuwaiti Shi'as detained and charged
 for the bombings, other local Shi'as, Kuwaiti and expatriate,
 were picked up, held for questioning, and subsequently
 released, according to informed sources. Some of these
 detainees appear to have been kept in custody without charge
 beyond the 4-day limit-and, like the 12 accused, held
 incommunicado and in solitary confinement for an undetermined
 period.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a noncitizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled without charge or judicial recourse if the
 authorities deem him a troublemaker or security risk. The
 number of expatriates deported has declined since 1986, when
 approximately 27,000 were expelled as part of a sustained
 
 
 1212
 KUWAIT
 security crackdown in response to a terrorist attack on the
 Amir's motorcade in May 1985. As in previous years, the vast
 majority of deportations in 1987 were due to illegal entry
 into Kuwait or expiration of residency permits.
 There is no forced labor in Kuwait.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and, except for the
 State Security Court, provides for public trials and the right
 of appeal. Judges are appointed by the Amir at the
 recommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals
 serving as judges usually receive lifetime appointments, while
 the many non-Kuwaiti judges serve under I- to 3-year contracts,
 which are renewable. Judges may be removed by the Justice
 Ministry for cause, but such removal is reportedly rare.
 By law, all defendants in felony cases must be represented by
 attorneys, court-appointed if necessary. In cases of
 misdemeanors, which include crimes punishable by less than 3
 years' imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, and the court
 is not required to appoint a defense attorney. The courts
 give consideration to defendants' allegations of police
 mistreatment in reaching verdicts and sentencing. Defendants
 tried in absentia have the right to an additional appeal.
 There are no reports of government interference in judges'
 issuance of verdicts or of discrimination against defense
 counsel. The court-appointed attorney of a'defendant unable
 to engage his own lawyer is not always given adequate time to
 prepare a defense. Translation of court proceedings to ensure
 their understanding by non-Arabic-speaking defendants is
 sometimes inadequate.
 Defendants' rights are not always fully respected in the State
 Security Court, which convenes on an ad hoc basis to handle
 cases deemed of an internal security nature. Composed of
 judges normally serving in other courts, this tribunal conducts
 its proceedings in closed sessions; its judgments are not
 subject to appeal. Defendants are permitted to have an
 attorney.
 In June the Court issued its verdicts in the 2-month trial of
 16 Kuwaiti defendants, 4 in absentia, for oil field bombings
 in June 1986 and January 1987. Six of the accused received
 the death penalty, two were acquitted, and the rest drew
 prison terms. In July the court acquitted 30 of the 40
 persons, all but 2 of them Kuwaiti citizens, charged with
 assaulting policemen and circulating seditious pamphlets. The
 10 persons convicted received prison terms ranging from 6
 months to 7 years. All defendants were believed to be
 Shi'as. In the latter case, most defendants were in their
 early twenties or late teens, and one accused, age 14, was
 sent to juvenile court for trial. The Amir has yet to give
 his approval, as required, to the death.sentences, jUst as he
 has failed to sanction the executions mandated by the Court
 last year for the attack on him in 1985 and the bombing of two
 local cafes in July 1985.
 The general view is that the State Security court, like other
 Courts, is independent and that, despite its exceptional
 procedures, allows defense attorneys to conduct an active
 defense on behalf of the accused. Various informed sources,
 including government critics, deny that there are any
 political prisoners in Kuwait. In March the State Security
 
 
 1213
 KUWAIT
 Court acquitted a Kuwaiti citizen charged with spreading
 "false rumors" about Kuwait's internal situation and working
 to "undermine the country's prestige abroad" in statements he
 had made while in the United States.
 In its 1987 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the fairness of trials of possible "prisoners of
 conscience" before the State Security Court. The report cited
 the November 1985 case of Kamil Hussein Ali Dashti, who was
 sentenced to 5 years in prison for having written a leaflet
 calling for the overthrow of the Government.
 According to the Constitution, military courts have
 jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the
 armed or security forces, except during periods of martial law
 (which has never been declared in Kuwait). However, it was
 the State Security Court, not a military tribunal, that tried
 a military officer in March 1986 for distributing
 antigovernment pamphlets.
 The Amir has the power to pardon or commute sentences passed
 by either civilian or military courts and does so through the
 publication of an annual list of commutations following
 Kuwait's independence day, February 25. In 1987 the Amir's
 commutations covered over 900 prisoners held for common crimes
 but did not apply to terrorists or others convicted by the
 State Security Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in
 practice. Search warrants are required, unless the police are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or
 there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter premises are issued by a
 public prosecutor. Expatriates, and particularly common
 laborers and servants who live in accommodations provided by
 their employers, may have their premises searched by the police
 with authorization only of the employer. Items arriving by
 post for personal or institutional use are usually not opened
 before delivery unless the contents are suspected of being
 pornographic. In a statement in February, the Information
 Minister denied that there was any interference by authorities
 in the delivery of personal mail.
 In 1986 the Government restricted Kuwaiti males' right to
 marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval in advance
 would henceforth be required. The Government's action
 apparently was motivated by concern over how to meet its
 responsibilities toward the children of non-Kuwaiti spouses
 residing outside the country. The Government, and the public
 at large, were also concerned about the growing number of
 Kuwaiti males opting to wed foreigners rather than Kuwaiti
 nationals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions respecting these freedoms are often
 subject to such conditional phrases as "in accordance with
 conditions and manner specified by law." The Kuwaiti or
 foreign resident feels free to offer his opinion in private
 
 
 1214
 KUWAIT
 without fear of official retaliation. However, no one may
 make a written or public attack upon the Amir and the ruling
 family, upon Islam, or upon leaders of Arab states. Kuwait
 has an active Censorship Department, which reviews all books,
 films, videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering
 Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes. Radio and
 television are government owned and controlled.
 The Amir's July 1986 decrees that amended the press law to
 impose prior censorship on the Kuwaiti press and otherwise o
 tighten press curbs remain in effect. These decrees also
 authorized the Government to suspend for up to 2 years any
 publication found to be serving foreign states or
 organizations, receiving assistance from foreign sources
 withdut the approval of the Information Ministry, or
 publishing material conflilcting with Kuwait's national
 interests.
 The revised censorship regulations also toughened existing
 penalties for violators, prescribing prison sentences of up to
 3 years and fines up to $17,000 for offending publishers,
 editors,'aid journalists. As before, the press was forbidden
 to publisf material that contained direct criticism of the
 Amir and the ruling family, involved official confidential
 comaunicatiop4 or treaties and agreements with other states,
 might disturb relations with Arab and friendly states, or, in
 a final category, "might incite people to commit crimes,
 create hatred, or spread dissension among the people." Prior
 to the Amir's- decrees there was selective enforcement of the
 list of proscribed topics; violators were usually only issued
 warnings, Since July 19.86, however, government censors have
 reviewed press items befpre thei;, pUblication and ensured
 complic8 e by excising off-ending material or having it
 rewritten.
 There were no reports in 1986 or 1987 of newspapermen being
 arrested Qr journals being confiscated or suspefded. In March
 a court,: ruling in. favor of" a plaintiff who claimed the local
 daily, Al-Anba, had slindered him, ordered it to cease
 publication for a week. The paper resumed normal publication
 following the week's suspgnision. In December 1986, an issue
 of the local da ilyAl-Rai AI-Aam, failed to appear on
 newsstands, as the paper's management withheld publication for
 a day in protest over the censor's excision of a specific
 article. An estimated 15 foreign journalists residing in
 Kuwait and associated with local newspapers were summarily
 deported in 1986, following the July decrees. There have been
 no repQrts of deportations in 1907, and the work of some
 journalists expelled last year continues to appear in the
 local press; at least occasionally.
 Since the July 1986 decrees, senior government officials have
 held periodic meetings with Kuwait's chief editors. At an
 October meeting, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Shaikh Saad
 al-Abdullah urged the editors to feel free to print all
 legitimate news and avoid being intimidated by the press
 restrictions or practicing self-censorship. He said the
 Government was preparing a ldng-awaited press law that would
 eliminate prior censorship, but gave no indication when the
 new law would be enacted. By law, publishers lose their
 license, issued by the Information Ministry, if their
 publication does not appear for 6 months. The publisher of
 the leftist-oriented journal Al-Talia'a reduced publication
 from a weekly to a semiannual basis following the July 1986
 decrees, reportedly in order to protest the decrees while
 
 
 1215
 KUWAIT
 maintaining compliance with the 6-month requirement. On
 occasion, the Government has rejected applications for
 licenses to publish new daily papers, claiming that Kuwait's
 seven existing dailies (five in Arabic, two in English) are
 sufficient to present diverse viewpoints. Overall, despite
 censorship, the Kuwaiti press is vigorous and publishes a
 variety of opinions on numerous issues, especially on
 international and Middle Eastern affairs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned. Political activity finds some
 outlet in informal social gatherings-known as "diwaniyyas."
 The Constitution protects the right to private assembly,
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings which are
 peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three people desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately, but to issue a public
 statement) must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by ignoring the request.
 During the April-June trial for oil field bombings, several
 unauthorized demonstrations took place outside the court
 building, reportedly to protest authorities' mistreatment of
 the defendants. Perhaps 200 persons participated in these
 demonstrations, chanting slogans and carrying banners. There
 were no reports of clashes with police or other violence, nor
 were there any arrests. No other mass gatherings of a
 political nature were held in 1987.
 Kuwaiti citizens are free to establish and join trade unions.
 However, only government employees and the petroleum, banking,
 and airline sectors are unionized; the majority of union
 members are civil servants. Unions may draw up their own
 constitutions, formulate their own programs, and join
 international confederations. Many Union activities are
 funded by the Government and are subject to official
 approval. During the 1986 elections for the Kuwait Federation
 of Trade Unions' (KFTU) governing board, there were
 indications that the Government was promoting its 'preferred"
 candidates over leftist competitors. Official pressures on
 the Federation to balance its historical relationship with the
 pro-Soviet bloc World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), ease
 its longstanding leftist outlook on domestic issues, and
 devote itself solely to nonpolitical concerns appear to be
 continuing.
 Workers have the right to bargain collectively. The right to
 strike is recognized, but in recent years there have been few
 work stoppages, and in 1987 there were no reports of any.
 Kuwaiti labor/law has a provision allowing for compulsory
 dissolution of any union that "commits an act considered to be
 violating the provisions of this law and of the laws connected
 with the preservation of public order and morals." Expatriate
 workers, who comprise the majority of the labor force, are
 permitted to join unions after 5 years' residence.
 Non-Kuwaitis are considered "associate members" of unions and
 are not permitted to vote, hold office, or create new unions.
 Since each union must be formed by and have several Kuwaiti
 members, expatriate unskilled workers have no union
 representation.
 Professional groups, bar associations, scientific bodies, and
 labor unions are permitted to establish international contacts
 
 
 1216
 KUWAIT
 without government interference. The KFTU, grouping the
 government and petroleum workers, is a member of the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions as well as
 the WFTU. Kuwait is an active tripartite member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is absolute,"
 but must not "conflict with public policy or morals." Kuwait's
 state religion is Islam; the Sharila (Islamic law) is,
 according to the Constitution, "a main source of legislation."
 The ruling family and most of the prominent Kuwaiti families
 are Sunni Muslims. There is no overt official policy of
 discrimination against Shi'a Muslims, who'constitute 25 to 30
 percent of Kuwait's citizenry. However, Shi'as are seldom
 appointed to sensitive government positions.'� There are
 credible reports of Shi'a tmployees in the oil-industry losing
 their jobs or being denied promotion following'the series Of
 oil field bombings, attributed tO Shia's, that Kuwait witnessed
 in 1987. Kuwait has a tiny Arab Christian minority; there are
 a number of expatriate Christian congregations and churches.
 Expatriate practitioners of Eastern religions, e.g., Hindus,
 Sikhs, and Buddhists not recognized by Islam7 are not allowed*-
 to establish blacea Of worship but may worship privately in
 their homes: PtoselytiZing-ofMuslims'by non-Muslims is'
 prohibited.
 In recent years, pressure from Islamic groups has resulted in
 the National Assembly's barring the future granting'of
 citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibiting all importation of
 alcoholic beverages, and repeatedly attempting to establish
 Islamic law as the basis for all legal process. Assembly
 members also pressured, with some success, those campuses of
 Kuwait University which were sexually integrated to separate
 the sexes in the classrooms and other facilities, such as
 cafeterias.,The Government accommodated the National
 Assembly's demands for the application of some fundamentalist
 principles but blocked attempts in the Assembly to apply
 Islamic law across the board. Commercial law, for'example,' is
 based on Western practice, and the collection of interest can
 be enforced by court order."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military -
 service. Those serving'in the military must receive permission
 from the Defense Ministry before traveling abroad. Although
 there are no different legal standards regarding the internal
 or foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice
 husbands can preient their wives and minor children from
 leaving ehe country.
 There are instances in which citizens' passports are suspended
 temporarily. Generally, this has applied to criminal
 suspects, although at the end of 1985 upwards of 8,500
 Kuwaitis were barred from traveling-abroad because of debts
 remaining from the collapse of an extraofficial stock market 4
 years earlier. Most of these persons have since had their
 travel rights restored." In June the Interior Ministry's
 Director of Investigations stated that during the past year
 
 
 1217
 KUWAIT
 15,528 persons had been banned from traveling, while the ban
 had been lifted for 6,410 persons. Representatives of
 societies, associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to
 and participate in international meetings must receive prior
 permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto,"
 some persons have been stripped of Kuwaiti citizenship and
 deported. Such actions appear to be rare, and in some cases
 have been based on the voluntary acquisition by the individual
 of foreign citizenship. In other instances, persons have been
 deprived of their citizenship for terrorist or subversive
 activities. In 1987 various defendants convicted by the State
 Security Court for such activities were deprived of citizenship
 and faced deportation on completion of prison sentences. Also
 in 1987, an amendment to Kuwait's Nationality Law made it
 easier to withdraw citizenship from naturalized Kuwaitis for
 criminal activity.
 All non-Kuwaitis over the age of 21 residing in Kuwait must
 have the sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not
 extend permanent residence to its expatriate population, and
 1987 amendments to the Alien Residence Law mandate stiffer
 penalties--fines and, in some cases, prison sentences--for
 expatriates who reside in Kuwait illegally or are not properly
 documented. At the same time, in September the Government
 announced a 3-month amnesty period for all illegal foreign
 residents to allow them to regularize their status. Employers
 have the power to restrict job mobility and the continued
 residence in Kuwait of their expatriate employees. Many
 expatriates (including some government employees, such as
 teachers) must surrender their travel documents to their
 employers, thus preventing them from leaving the country
 without the employer's consent. Those employed by government
 agencies are given residence visas which require an exit
 permit or "no objection" letter in order to leave the
 country. In accordance with the law, non-Kuwaitis convicted
 of crimes are routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries. Exceptions have been made for those, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees and have been permitted to remain in
 Kuwait or sent to third countries. While most members of
 Kuwait's large Palestinian population have Jordanian passports,
 others are stateless and carry Lebanese or other Arab
 laissez-passers. In recent years, the Government has indicated
 that laissez-passer holders could stay even without sponsors.
 Palestinian youths over 21 years of age who travel or study
 outside Kuwait often have difficulty rejoining their families
 in Kuwait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Kuwait has no formal democratic institutions. Consequently,
 most of its citizens do not have a say in the choice of
 leaders or in changing the political system. The Al-Sabah
 have ruled Kuwait for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution
 limited succession to descendants of Mubarak the Great, the
 ruler at the turn of this century. In practice, the ruler and
 senior family members choose the Crown Prince from either the
 al-Jaber or the al-Salim branch of-the al-Sabah. Under the
 Constitution this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the
 
 
 1218
 KUWAIT
 National Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler
 and, under him, in ah appointed Council of Ministers,-
 currently humbering'23, who'se chairman by tradition is the
 Crown Prince.    -
 Upon independence in 1961, Kuwait inaugurated a National
 Assembly cbmposed of 50 deputies, electea by secret ballot,
 plus cabinet members, sitting exofficio. The electoral law
 provided9that candidates for the National Assembly be
 self-nomihathd, with multiple'candidates permitted to compete
 for- the 50 seats. 'A "grandfather claute" effectively limits
 suffrage to adult males who resided in Kuwait bdfore 1920 and
 maintained a-residehice there until 1959, and their adult male
 descendants. In 1986 the National Assembly approved an
 amendment to the 1966 Nationality Law that delayed for 10
 years/until 1996, th6-granting of voting rights to Kuwait's
 so-called "iscbnd 6ategory" citizens. The latter are certain
 long-time Arab and'non-Arab-reuidents'who do not meet the
 "pre-1920" qualification. The Nationality Law was further
 amended in 1987 to extend from 20 to 30 years the period that
 naturalized Kuwaitis must wait before acquiring the right to
 vote. .Efforts since 1982't6 gain suffrage for women have been
 unsuccessful.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir
 in July-1986, remains inefE&ct, and it is dhclear when it
 might be restored.- Beside" dissolving the Assembly for an
 indefinite-period; the 1986 decrees suspeided various
 conti-tutibfial provisions, iicluding article 107, which
 specified that, within 2 months of the Assembly's dissolution,
 either spebi~l elections be held for a hew Assembly or the
 dissolved-o~d be reinstated. The Assembly previously had been
 dissolved in 1976 and Aot reinstated until 1981. In the
 Assembly's absence, the Amir rules by decrees having the force-
 of law.
 The Assembly's'1986"dissolution represented a'setback for
 citizbehs" political rights. -Far from being a rubber stamp, it
 had served over tHeyears as an important forum for the
 expression of diverse political views, some sharply at odds
 with those-of the Govetriment and-not all serving the cause of
 civil and human rights. The most recent elections, held in
 February 1985, featured generally fair and hard-fought
 campaigns by competing candidates. While the Assembly rarely
 rejected government-proposed legislation, it was capable of
 exerting sufficient pressure'on the Government to cause it to
 modify its legislation to satisfy the Assembly's desires. In
 its review of government policy and programs, the Assembly
 asserted its prerogatives, frequently questioning ministers
 and criticizing their performance. Indicative of the
 willingness-of both the Assembly and the judiciary to
 challenge the Government, in June 1986, Kuwait's
 Constitutional Court ruled against the executive in a major
 decision. The Court found that the Assembly had the authority
 to investigate past actions by ministries and to examine
 Central'Bank records; the Government had contended that the
 Assembly could only inquire into current ministerial
 activities and was not authorized to examine Bank records.
 In his announcement of the 1986 dissolution decree, the Amir
 mentioned the lack of cooperation and dialogue between the
 Government and the Assembly at a time when Kuwait was facing
 major economic problems, serious threats to its security, and
 other ills. In February the Government mounted its annual
 voter registration campaign, announcing that all newly
 
 
 1219
 KUWAIT
 eligible voters should have their names inscribed on the lists
 maintained by registration committees in the various electoral
 districts. There are reports of former parliamentarians
 petitioning the Amir for the Assembly's restoration. In May
 the Government established an appointive consultative body,
 the Supreme Planning Council, and named to it members of the
 dissolved Assembly as well as Islamic religious leaders,
 government ministers, and other prominent personalities.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their tribal
 and religious leaders, the heads of the prominent merchant
 clans, and to the ruling family itself through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal discussion groups to which anyone can
 come and freely speak his mind. That custom has endured, as
 has the tradition that the Amir should govern in consultation
 with the other community leaders. Following the Assembly's
 dissolution in 1986, cabinet ministers instituted the practice
 of setting aside several hours 1 day a week to receive the
 public in their offices.
 While most male Kuwaiti citizens can participate directly or
 indirectly in the political process, noncitizens, who
 outnumber Kuwaitis by three to two, have no role. Kuwait has
 been reluctant to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti
 origin, with the exception of certain stateless Bedouin.
 Naturalization of even Kuwait-born persons is rare.
 Citizenship has been extended only to a few Palestinian
 families who made significant contributions to Kuwait before
 the early 1970's. The Government has established a committee
 to revise criteria for granting citizenship, but the results
 of its deliberations are not expected in the near future.
 Expatriates seldom engage in political activities for fear of
 exposing themselves to possible deportation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has permitted visits by representatives of
 international human rights organizations. In April the
 Amnesty International's Secretary General visited Kuwait to
 attend a conference of the Arab Bar Association. He also
 reportedly met with government officials, including the Under
 Secretaries of the Foreign and Interior Ministries. The visit
 was publicized by the local media. In its 1987 Report, AI
 noted that it had urged Kuwaiti authorities to investigate
 reports that nine people were tortured following their arrest
 in March 1985 and that eight others had died under torture
 between March and November 1985. AI said that no reply was
 received. Some prominent Kuwaitis are members of international
 human rights organizations, such as the Arab Organization of
 Human Rights. There are no human rights groups in Kuwait, but
 the Government has an in-house Council on Human Rights,
 composed of senior officials and working-level experts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in the society,
 though less so than in some other.Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 
 
 1220
 KUWAIT
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted tp drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher educati6n inside and outside
 the country. 'Women have the right to litigate against men
 (for example, in child custody suits). In recent years,
 growing numbers of Kuwaiti women have'joined the work force,
 and are able to compete for government and corporate
 employment. Some have reached senior government positions, up
 to the level of assistant under secretary.
 Womei are well represented in the field of education,
 including at the university level. As yet, there are no
 female judges, but in 1986 the Government named the first
 woman'as a prosecutor. The Government has restricted women
 from being assigned abroad in Kuwait's diplomatic service,
 although Kuwaiti women have represented Kuwait in financial
 meeting's, 'such as those, of the Paris Club.
 There is no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the
 administration of Kuwait's extensive social welfare programs,
 designed to provide housing, family allowances, retirement
 incomd-' medical care, education, and employment. Although
 some members of Kuwait's Shila min'rkity perceive themselves to
 be largely excluded from leadership positions in the,
 Governrment,'mahy have achieved great wealth, and there is no
 evidence that they are discrimihated pga *nst in matters of
 social welfare. - However," foreign residehts, who constitute
 about 60 pgicmtht Of t)ie country'is totai population of  -
 1,700,b0-d'o not4share in many of- the rights.and"benefits

 estabIl1s ints 1'above 49 percent), real estate, and shares, on

 White-collar and skilled expatriate vbrkers earn the same base
 pay as Kuwaitis, but receive less in fringe  benefits.
 Benefits restriite' to Ku4aiti citizens include higher
 goverimenV'salaries, additilonal government stipends and social
 allowances, and, in general, retirement pensions. 'Resident
 expatriates are entitled to medical benefits.. Public
 schooling is offered, with some egceptions,o only to children
 of expatriates who arrived in Kuwait prior to 19.57, although
 the Government subsidizes tuition for students in a number of
 Arabic.language elementary ahd secondary schools. Kuwaitis
 are given preference for admission to 'the' Uni-versity of Kuwait
 and, bedause of limited space for new enrollees, non-Xuwaiti
 University entrants may equal np nore than 10 percent of the
 number 6f Kuwaiti entrants. 'Uhskilled expatriate workers
 usualy-Vre not permitted to bring their families to Kuwait.
 Some of these workers live in crowded apartments or worK camps.
 CONDITLONS OF-t:ABOR
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public And private septor, with the oil
 industry'treated separately. The law limits the workweek to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days leave per year,
 establishes a compensation schedule for industrial accidents,'
 and sets a minimum age of 18 years for full-time work, or 14
 years for part-time work. Women are permitted to work except
 in "dangerous industries and tra'S harmful to the health,"
 and are promised "equal remuneration to that of aman provided
 she does the same work." There is no legal minimum wage, but
 this has little impact in practice since Kuwait is not a
 low-wage country.
 
 
 1221
 KUWAIT
 Reflecting the importance of the petroleum industry in Kuwait,
 the law governing employment in this sector is more generous
 than the-general laws. It provides for a 40-hour workweek,
 overtime pay for shift work, 30 days' annual leave, and a
 generous sick leave policy. By and large, employers appear to
 respect provisions of the labor law and provide suitable
 working conditions, although some abuses occur in the treatment
 of unskilled foreign workers, particularly household maids and
 servants.
 There are two ministerial orders that supplement the above
 laws. Number 14 (1970) established an interministerial board
 to resolve labor disputes, and number 42 (1979) created a
 permanent commission to coordinate activities in the field of
 public health and occupational safety.
