 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a 77-member unicam-
 eral legislature chosen in free elections. In 1992 national elections saw the peaceful
 transfer of power from a center-left government to a center-right government, with
 a realignment of power within the National Assembly as well. Members of the Su-
 preme Court preside over a judiciary that is constitutionally independent but sus-
 ceptible to political pressure. The Assembly has important powers to question and
 censure Cabinet ministers; such censure results in automatic dismissal of the min-
 ister in question.
 The Ecuadorian military has significant autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed ac-
 cess to revenues from the nation's oil exports, and from civil aviation, shipping, and
 other economic activities. The military has maintained a low profile in domestic poli-
 tics since the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police, responsible
 for domestic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls under the ci-
 vilian Ministry of Government and Police. There were various credible allegations
 of human rights abuses by the security forces, especially the National Police, during
 1993.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 nflation remained high, between 30 to 40 percent in 1993. Most Ecuadorians are
 employed in the informal sector, either as urban street vendors or rural agricultural
 workers; rural poverty is extensive and unemployment is very high.
 Ecuadorians enjoy, both in law and in fact, a wide range of freedoms and individ-
 ual rights, but serious human rights problems have not yet been eliminated. These
 
 
 include some instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and other mistreatment of
 prisoners and detainees, impunity for human rights abusers, violence by para-
 military grups in rural areas, lengthy detention before trial, a politicized court sys-
 tem, and pervasive discrimination against women, blacks, and Indians. The most
 fundamental concern is over shortcomings in the Ecuadorian legal and judicial sys-
 tem. People are subject to arbitrary arrest; once incarcerated, they may wait years
 before coming to trial. Often, the only way to avoid these problems is through the
 payment of bribes to a variety of officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicil Kilnng.-eThere were no known politically mo-
 tivated killings in 1993. There were, however, cases of extrajudicial killing of crimi-
 nal suspects by the polie, who often act with impunity in such cases, because dis-
 ciplinary action for such activities is the responsibility of the police itself, and
 crimes by police officers are tried in special police courts.
 The Catholic Churh-affliated Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU)
 reported a total of 32 extrajudicial kihlingsin 1993, of which 24 were attributed to
 the security forces (which include the police, armed forces, prison employees, and
 other authorities). At least one of these cases later proved to be due to a traffic acci-
 dent. Marines killed three people in an anticrime sweep in the port city of
 Guayaquil. The Marines carried out this sweep because the Navy is the dominant
 branch of the Rsmed forces in that port city and the Government reportedly did not
 trust the police to do the job. The armed forces asserted that those killed were
 criminals who offered armed resistance, but no investigation was undertaken into
 the killings because they were killed in a  irefight, in which several Marines were
 wounded, and because they were among the targets of the sweep. In addition to the
 casualties, 39 people were arrested in the sweep.
 Not long ar the Marines' sweep, the police mounted a similar operation in
 Guayaquil in which 65-year-old Antonia Mera de Molineros was shot and killed by
 police who entered her home by mistake. The police admitted the mistake and
 apologized. Alleged death squads murdered 14 persons in midyear in Guayaquil. All
 of the victims were known criminals who had been recently released from custody;
 one was still clutching his release paper. The Gusyaquil-based Ecuadorian Com-
 mittee on Human and Union Rights (CEDHUS) originally reported that it had evi-
 dence that the death squad was made up of police officers. Nevertheless, in July
 three common criminals were assted and charged in the death squad killings.
 Indigenous organizations continued to charge that indigenous people were the tar-
 get of violent and lethal reprisals by paramilitary groups during illegal land inva-
 sions and other squatter demonstrations. The paramilitary greups ar adrmed secu-
 rity guards hired by private landowners to protect their property. These forces often
 use military-like uniforms; some are reportedly operatedor trained by former mili-
 tary or polce officials, but there is no evidence of complicity with active-duty mili-
 tary or police personnel.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of politically motivated disappear-
 ances during 1993. The Committee of Families of Victims of Repression organized
 weekly demonstrations in the main plaza of Quito and lists 11 cases of disappear-
 ances since 1986 in its pamphlets, the latest occurring in 1992. In seven of thes
 cases the perpetrators are unknown; the group alleges police involvement in the
 other four.
 Prosecution of those responsible for the 1988 disappearance of the Restrepo broth-
 er continued to move very slowly. The highest ranking official charged in the case,
 ex-Commander of the Police General Gilberto Molina, who escaped from custody in
 October 1992, remained a fugitive. In June the char  against Molina was changed
 from covering up the disappearance and presumed  eath of the two to being one
 of the perpetrators of the crime itself. Molina issued a statement attacking the court
 for making such a charge without any solid evidence that a murder had taken place.
 Two other police officers charged in the case remain in custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and similar forms of intimidation and punishment are prohibited
 by law, there were continued reports of physical mistreatment by police of suspects
 and prisoners. There were few reports of officials being punished for such abuses.
 The CEDHU published detailed reports on suspects claiming to have been tortured
 by the police, frequently naming police officials alleged to be responsible and often
 including photographs of the victims with their wounds. The Government took no
 action to respond to the CEDHU reports.

 By law, police officers may be tried only before police courts in closed sessions.
 The practical effect of this is immunity from prosecution, with the occasional excep-
 tion of some high-profile cases, such as that of the Restrepo brothers.
 Prison conditions in Ecuador's overcrowded detention centers generally continued
 to be very poor. Prisons in the tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those
 in the temperate highlands. The women's prison in Quito has notably better condi-
 tions than other facilities. There are no separate facilities for hard-core or dangerous
 criminals, nor are there rehabilitation programs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a governmental
 authority, but these legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention are often
 violated. Specific written orders must be signed within 24 hours of detention-even
 in cases in which a suspect is caught in the act of committing a crime. The suspect
 must be charged with a specific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All pris-
 oners have the right to a review of the legality of their detention within 48 hours
 of arrest, a review which is supposed to be carried out by the senior elected official
 (usually the mayor) of the locality in which the suspect is held.
 Incommunicado detention is not uncommon although it is legally prohibited. De-
 spite provisions of the Penal Code, the police often detain suspects without the re-
 quired written order. Even when an order is obtained, appropriate authorities
 charged with reviewing it to determine its validity often allow frivolous charges to
 be brought, either because of overwork or because bribes are paid by the accuser.
 In many instances, the system is used as a means of harassment in civil cases in
 which one party seeks to have the other arrested on criminal charges. Suspects are
 frequently detained longer than 24 hours before orders are signed, and few are
 charged within 48 hours of arrest. Preventive detention up to and including trial
 is legal under certain circumstances.
 In late August, the courts ordered a census to be taken in the 30 penitentiaries
 in the country to determine the number of people being held and their legal status
 as inmates. Several hundred prisoners were released or having served more than
 the maximum sentence for the crime for which they were accused without actually
 having been convicted and sentenced.
 Exile is not used as a tool of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Most nonmilitary defendants are tried by the reg-
 ular court system, although some indigenous groups try members privately for viola-
 tions of tribal rules. To depoliticize and modernize the court system, a major reform
 of the Supreme Court began to be implemented in January. The Supreme Court is
 now composed of 31 justices and 3 alternates chosen by Congrss from lists of can-
 didates submitted by the executive, the legislature, and the Court itself. The Court
 appointments are no longer coterminous with the term of the President, and terms
 of the judges are staggered so that one-third of the Court changes every 2 years.
 While these reforms were intended to distance the judiciary from political influ-
 ence, the ensuing selection process was no less political than in the past, with each
 party in the Congressdemanding its proportionate share of the Supreme Court. This
 made it much more difficult to arrive at decisions, and the Supreme Court failed
 to complete restructuring the superior courts because members could not agree on
 the candidates.
 Due process rights for criminal defendants are provided for by law but often not
 observed in practice. In theory, the accused is presumed to be innocent until proven
 g ilty. Defendants have the right to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal.
 They may present evidence but have the privilege not to testify against themselves,
 and they may confront and cross-examine witnesses. Although a public defender
 system exists, in practice there are relatively few attorneys available to defend the
 large number of indigent suspects. Trial is supposed to begin within 15 to 60 days
 of the initial arrest. in practice, however, as noted in Section 1.d., initiation of the
 trial phase can take years. Indigenous people and other minorities are dispropor-
 tionately affected by these delays as they are more likely to be poor and unable to
 buy their way out of pretrial detention.
 Bail is not generally available. Families of detainees sometimes intervene in an
 attempt to secure the prisoner's freedom through illegal means.
 Political activity is not sanctioned in any way by the judicial system, and there
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 are required to have a warrant to enter a private home or business, except in the
 case of hot pursuit. The police generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence. Police surveillance is permitted, but wiretapping is prohibited by
 the Constitution and the results of a wiretap are not admissible as evidence in
 court.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and this provision is generally respected in practice. However, the media and oppo-
 sition political figures criticized the Government's use of the media for its own plit-
 ical ends. With the exception of two government-owned radio stations all of the
 major media organs--television, newspapers, and radio-are in local private hands
 (foreign investment in the media is prohibited). Using a law (promulgated by the
 last military regime) that requires the media to give the Government free space or
 air time, the Government frequently required television and radio to broadcast gov-
 ernment produced programs featuring the President and other top administration
 officials. It also required newspapers to carry a minimum amount of news prepared
 by the National Secretariat of Social Communications.
 The media represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Gov-
 ernment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, par-
 ticularly with respect to stories about the military or corruption at high levels of
 national, provincial, or municipal government. There are 2 major daily newspapers
 in the capital, Quito, 5 in the pnncipal commercial center, Cua aui , and more
 than 20 additional papers published daily in other regions and cities. There are 4
 national television networks, 4 local and provincial television networks, and about
 300 radio stations. All are free of overt government censorship. Journalists working
 in the preparation and reporting of news (as opposed to opinion) must be graduates
 of an accredited Ecuadorian university journalism school, but the quality of inves-
 tigative reporting is generally poor.
 Ecuador has a large university system comprising both state-subsidized and pri-
 vate universities. The state universities are active in politics, particularly on the left
 of the political spectrum. The Government did not interfere in issues involving aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes. These rights are
 generally respected in practice. Public rallies require prior government permits,
 which are generally granted, although exceptions exist (see below). Numerous politi-
 cal demonstrations took place in the capital and the outlying regions, including two
 national strikes. In general, the security forces intervened in demonstrations only
 when there was violence against persons or property, and police showed restraint
 in the use of force.
 In January the Government refused to renew the permit for what had become a
 regular weekly demonstration by the Restrepo family and their supporters in the
 main plaza in front of the presidential palace. Then Minister of Government Roberto
 Dunn asserted that the demonstrations were too great a disruption and that, with
 the progress of the case through the courts, their usefulness had ended. Nonethe-
 less, the family and an increasingly smaller group of supporters continued to gather
 near the plaza each Wednesday in silent protest. On several occasions when the pro-
 testers attempted to become more vocal, the police used tear gas to break up the
 demonstration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination for religious
 reasons, and citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice. There is no offi-
 cial state religion. The population is nominally over 90 percent Roman Catholic, but
 there are active Protestant and Jewish communities in the major cities, and evan-
 gelical movements continue to attract new adherents. Numerous foreign-based reli-
 gious orders and missionary.roups are active in Ecuador.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution assures the right of all citizens to travel freely
 throughout the country, to choose their place of residence, and to depart from and
 return to Ecuador. These rights are respected in practice. Ecuadorian citizens who
 return to the country after residing abroad are not harassed or discriminated
 against by the Government.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the return to civilian rule in 1979, Ecuadorian citizens have actively exer-
 cised their right to change their national and local governments. Free elections re-
 sulted in the peaceful transfer of power to parties of opposing ideologies in presi-
 dential elections every 4 years. There are 17 legally registered political parties,
 spanning the ideological spectrum. Thirteen of the 17 parties, including 3 leftist par-
 ties, are representedin the Congress.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over the age of 18 and voluntary for illit-
 erate citizens. There are no restrictions on voting by women or by minority groups.
 Police officers and active-duty members of the mlitary forces cannot vote and there
 
 
 430
 is no provision for absentee voting. All citizens, regardless of sex, religion, socio-
 economic status, or ethnic origin, have the right to form and join political parties
 and to run for local or national office. Members of the clergy, however, are barred
 by the Constitution from election to the Congress, the presidency, or vice presidency.
 Candidates must belong to one of the recognized parties and cannot run as inde-
 pendents.
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating, and blacks, Indians, and women
 continue to be underrepresented in high positions in government. There are no spe-
 cific laws, customs, or policies that prevent women and minorities from attaining
 leadership positions. This underrepresentation results from the fallout of past prac-
 tices as well as present cultural and social forces which result in fewer women and
 members of minorities having the educational background or personal influence to
 enter leadership positions. Nevertheless, grassroots community groups, particularly
 among the indigenous population, enjoyed increasing success in pressuring the
 central Government to assist them.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights groups such as CEDHU and the regional Latin American
 Human Rights Association (ALDHU) are independent and actively monitor human
 rights issues in Ecuador. These groups, particularly CEDHU, have been outspoken
 in their criticism of the Government's record on specific cases, and CEDHU has
 taken a particular interest in defending the human rights of the poor. In August
 the armed forces contracted with ALDHU to provide human rights training to the
 military, and the police concluded a similar training agreement with ALDHU in De-
 comber. International human rights organizations also operate without hindrance in
 Ecuador.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, reli-
 gion, sex, or social status, discrimination against women is pervasive in society, par-
 ticularly with respect to educational and economic opportunity. The women's move-
 ment blames culture and tradition for inhibiting achievement of full equality for
 women. There are fewer women in the professions or working as skilled laborers
 than men, and salary discrimination is common. Although violence against women,
 including within marriage, is prohibited by law, it is a common practice. Many rapes
 go unreported because or the victims' reluctance to confront the perpetrator. To date
 the Government has not addressed this question as a serious public policy issue.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the welfare of children,
 but has not taken effective steps to promote it. Government resources to assist chil-
 dren are limited, although several private organizations are very active in programs
 to assist the street children. Especially in the urban areas, the children of the poor
 often experience severe hardships. It is common to see children as young as 5 or
 6 years old selling newspapers or candy on the street to support themselves, or to
 augment the family income. There also were reports in the media of rwing pros-
 titution among girls under 18 in urban areas. In rural areas, young children often
 must leave school at an early age to help out on the family's plot of land.
 Indigenous People.-The vast majority of the rural population of approximately 5
 million (slightly less than 50 percent of the population) is made up of peasants of
 Indian or mestizo ancestry, most of whom live in varying degrees of poverty. Land
 is scarce in the more heavily populated highland areas; infant mortality, malnutri-
 tion, and epidemic disease are common; and potable water and electricity are often
 unavailable. The rural education system is seriously deficient. Efforts to improve liv-
 ing standards for indigenous peop e were hampered by the Government's reluctance
 to change traditional spending patterns, especially those favoring the cities. Indige-
 nous people enjoy the same civil and political rights as other citizens and also have
 several special privileges designed to allow them to manage their own affairs within
 their own communities. This is especially true in the Amazon area, where indige-
 nous groups have claim to specific land areas. (These areas are more like park re-
 serves than Indian reservations.) The Amazon indigenous groups in particular have
 begun to play a very active role in the decisionmaking process involved in the use
 of their lands for oil exploration and production. Many indigenous groups partici-
 pated actively with the Ministry of Education in the development of the bilingual
 education system used in rural public schools.
 Private paramilitary groups, sometimes working in conjunction with the police,
 were used to break up occupations of land by indigenous groups in rural areas. In
 1991-92, the Government announced strengthened controls over private guard
 
 
 forces and other armed groups that were not properly registered. In 1993 the Gov-
 ernment arrested the members of a private security force, who had been hired to
 protect the property of the Yuracruz Agroindustrial Company, following the rape
 and murder of a 77-year-old indigenous woman. The security force at Yurcruz was
 replaced by periodicpatrols by the police.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of the rural, northern coastal
 area of Ecuador includes large numbers of black citizens. They suffer widespread
 poverty and pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to educational and
 economic opportunity. There were no special government efforts to address these
 problems.
 People with Disabilities.-While people with disabilities are not legally discrimi-
 nated against, there are no laws to guarantee access for the handicapped, nor are
 they provided any other special government assistance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers the right to form trade unions. Workers not free to form trade unions in-
 clude public security and military officials, and public sector employees in
 nonrevenue earning entities. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of
 workers required for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA)
 considers too stringent a limitation at the plant works council level. In 1993 the ILO
 reiterated that the Government should bring the Labor Code into compliance with
 international standards on this issue.
 While employees of state organizations enjoy full rights similar to that of the pri-
 vate sector, the majority of public sector employees technically are prevented from
 joining unions and lack collective bargaining rights. Nevertheless, most public em-
 ployees maintain membership in some labor organization, and the Government fre-
 quently is hampered by "illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, action is virtually
 never taken against striking public workers.
 Approximately 8 to 9 percent of the work force is organized. There ar four large
 labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affiliation.
 Ecuador also has numerous labor federations unaffiliated with the four labor cen-
 trals such as the Teachers' Organization, the National Artisans and Mechanics
 Con1iederation, and numerous peasant groups. None of the main labor centrals is
 firmly connected to any one political party.
 There are few restrictions on workers' right to strike, except for public servants
 and workers in some state enterprises. A 20-day cooling off period is required before
 declaring a strike. The 1991 Labor Code revisions limit solidarity strikes or boycotts
 to 3 days, provided that they are approved by the Labor Ministry. In a legal strike,
 workers may take possession of the factory or work place, thus ending production at
 the site, and receive police protection during the takeover. All salaries and benefits
 must be paid by the employer during a legal strike; and strikers and their leaders
 are protected by the Labor Code. Illegal strikes, however, far outnumbered the legal
 ones as public employees protested the Government's proposals to modernize gov-
 ernment operations and privatize state enterprises.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Ecuador has a highly seg-
 mented labor market with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, posi-
 tions in state enterprises or in medium- to large-sized industries. The vast majority
 of the economically active population is either unemployed or underemployed in the
 informal sector, and most rural labor is not organized. The Labor Code requires that
 all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union must negotiate
 collectively when the union so requests.
 The NW CFA found that a 1991 Labor Code provision calling for the formation
 of a single central committee composed of at least 50 percent of the workers con-
 cerned in institutions, both public and private, which deal with social or public func-
 tions and in which there is no works council, did not take into consideration the
 possibility that less than 50 percent of the workers could be organized. The CFA
 also dealt with a complaint concerning a requirement that collective bargaining
 agreements involving entities of the State be cleared with the National Secretariat
 for Administrative Development (SENDA) to assure that funds had been budgeted.
 In this case, the ILO requested that the Government establish a means for direct
 consultation on agreements among employers, workers, and SENDA. Finally, the
 ILO decided that a special cooling off period prior to any strike action for public en-
 tities which deal in essential services was acceptable.
 The new Labor Code streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by
 requiring workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimina-
 tion against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities
 
 
 upon the union's request. Despite the reforms promulgated in November 1991, em-
 ployers consider the Labor Code to be highly unfavorable to their interests and a
 aisincentive to the hiring of union members and to employment in general. Employ-
 ers often try to avoid hiring additional workers and unionization by substituting
 machinery or workers or "atomizing" their production processes to maintain plants
 employing less than the number needed to form a union. Employers are not per-
 nutted to dismiss a worker without the express permission of the Ministry of Labor,
 rulings which are not subject to judicial review. Dismissals ruled as unjustified by
 the Ministry of Labor require a  ent to the worker of large indemnities or separa-
 tion payments by employers, aithough the reforms have set a cap on such payment.
 The Labor Code provides for resolution of labor conflicts through an Arbitration
 and Conciliation Board comprised of one representative of the Ministry of Labor,
 two from the union and two from management. The CFA expressed concern that
 the 1991 Labor Code revisions provide for compulsory arbitration if no agreement
 is reached, contrary to the principals of freedom of association. The Government pro-
 vided the ILO an explanation of the law but did not change it.
 A maquila (in bond) law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary workers
 for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on association
 rights in the maquila law in practice it is difficult to organize temporary employees
 on short-term contracts. The maquila system allows a company and its property to
 become a free trade zone wherever it is located. Many such zones have been estab-
 lished; most are dedicated to textiles or fish processing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 both the Constitution and the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Persons less than 14 years old are
 prohibited by law from working except in special circumstances such as apprentice-
 ships. Those between the ages of 14 and 18 are required to have the permission of
 their parent or guardian to work. In practice, enforcement of child labor laws is seri-
 ously inadequate. In rural areas, many children begin to attend school sporadically
 at about 10 years of age in order to contribute to household income as farm laborers.
 In the city many children under age 14 work in family "businesses" in the informal
 sector, shining shoes, collecting and recycling garbage, or as street peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor has the principal role
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out with a corps of labor inspectors who are
 active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek a 15-
 day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other variable employer-provided bene-
 fits such as uniforms and training opportunities.
 The minimum wage is set by the Ministry of Labor every 6 months in consultation
 with the Commission on Salaries, but also may be adjusted by Congress. Enforced
 by the Ministry of Labor, the basic minimum wage is very low and is not adequate
 to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. As of September,
 the minimum wage plus mandated bonuses totaled approximately $88.43 (a/172,000)
 a month. Most organized workers in state industries and formal-sector private en-
 terprises earn substantially more than the minimum wage and also have significant
 other benefits. Because it is so low, the minimum wage is the operative wage in
 many informal sector activities where the majority of the economically active popu-
 lation is employed.
 The Labor Code also provides for general protection of workers' health and safety
 on the job. In the formal sector occupational health and safety is not a major prob-
 lem. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition even if there is a
 hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from the
 Ministry of Labor come to the workplace and confirm the hazard; that inspector ma
 then close down the workplace. The Government enforces health and safety stan-
 ards and regulations through the Social Security Institute. There are no specific reg-
 ulations governing health and safety standards in the agricultural sector, and, in
 practice, there is no enforcement of safety rules in the small informal sector mines
 that make up the vast majority of the mining sector.
