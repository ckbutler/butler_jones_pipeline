 UNITED ARAB EMIEATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven Emirates established
 in 1971. None has any democratically elected institutions or political parties. Each
 emirate retains control over its own oil and mineral wealth and some aspects of in-
 ternal security, although the Federal Government asserts primacy in most matters
 of law and government. Traditional rule in the emirates has generally been patriar-
 chal, with political allegiance defined in terms of loyalty to the tribal leaders. Politi-
 cal leaders in the emirates are not elected, but citizens may express their concerns
 directly to their leaders via traditional mechanisms, such as the open majlis, or
 counci. In accordance with the 1971 Constitution, the seven emirate rulers con-
 stitute a Federal Supreme Council, the highest legislative and executive body. The
 Council selects a President and Vice President from its membership; the President
 in turn appoints the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Constitution requires the
 Council to meet annually, although individual leaders meet frequently in more tra-
 ditional settings. The Cabinet manages the Federation on a day-to-day basis. A con-
 sultative body, the Federal National Council, consisting of advisors appointed by the
 emirate rulers, has no legislative authority but questions government ministers in
 open sessions and makes policy recommendations to the Cabinet. The judiciary gen-
 erally is independent, but its decisions are subject to review by the political leader-
 ship.
 Each emirate maintains its own independent police force. While all emirate inter-
 nal security organs theoretically are branches of one federal organization, in prac-
 tice they operate with considerable independence.
 The UAE has a free market economy based on oil and gas production, trade, and
 light manufacturing. The Government owns the majority share of the petroleum
 production enterprise in the largest emirate, Abu Dhabi. The Emirate of Dubai is
 likewise an oil producer, as well as a growing financial and commercial center in
 the Gulf. The remaining five emirates have negligible petroleum or other resources
 and therefore depend in varying degrees on federal government subsidies, particu-
 larly for basic services such as health care, electricity, water, and education. The
 economy provides citizens with a high per capita income, but it is heavily dependent
 on foreign workers, who comprise at least 80 percent of the general population.
 The Government continued to restrict human rights in a number of areas includ-
 ing the denial of the right of citizens to change their government and the right to
 a speedy trial, and limitations on the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and asso-
 ciation. The press continued to avoid direct criticism of the Government and exer-
 cised self-censorship. Women continue to make progress in education and in the
 work force, but some discrimination persists. The Government limits worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture. The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading
 treatment. There are consistent but unconfirmed reports from foreign prisoners of
 beatings and coerced confessions by police during initial detention. The Government
 conducted internal investigations of these reports, and maintained that they were
 groundless. Shari'a courts frequently impose flogging (except in Dubai) on Muslims
 ound guilty of adultery, prostitution, and drug and alcohol abuse. In practice, flog-
 ging is administered in accordance with Shari'a so as to prevent major or permanent
 injuries. The individual administering the lashing traditionally holds a Koran under
 
 
 1824
 the arm and swings the whip using the forearm only. According to press accounts,
 punishments for adultery and prostitution have ranged from 39 to 200 lashes. Indi-
 viduals convicted of drunkenness have been sentenced to 80 lashes.
 The Federal Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that convictions in the Shari'a courts
 do not necessarily require the imposition of Shari'a penalties on non-Muslims, but
 sentences have been carried out in a few cases.
 In June a Shari'a court in Fujairah sentenced three Omani nationals convicted
 of robbery to have their right hands amputated. The Fujairah prosecutor's office
 stated that it did not intend to carry out the sentence.
 In central prisons holding long-term inmates, prisoners are provided with food,
 medical care, and adequate sanitation facilities, but sleep on slabs built into the cell
 walls, with one blanket under them and a second covering them. Only some blocks
 of the central prisons are air-conditioned during the intense heat and humidity of
 the summer. The Government is gradually phasing air conditioning into the prisons.
 Currently, prisoners with medical conditions are placed in air-conditioned rooms
 during the summer months. Prisoners not under investigation and not involved in
 drug cases may receive visitors up to three times each week and may also make
 occasional local telephone calls. In Dubai Emirate, prisoners convicted of drug-relat-
 ed offenses also may receive visitors and make telephone calls.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law. The laws of each
 emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause.
 Under the Criminal Procedures Code, the police must report arrests within 48
 hours to the Attorney General, who must determine within the next 24 hours
 whether to charge, release, or order further detention pending an investigation. The
 Attorney General may order detainees held for up to 21 days without charge. After
 that time, the authorities must obtain a court order for further detention without
 charge.
 Although the code does not specify a right to a speedy trial, authorities bring de-
 tainees to trial in reasonable time. Trials may last a substantial period of time, de-
 pending on the seriousness of the charges, number of witnesses, and availability of
 judges. There is no formal system of bail, but the authorities may temporarily re-
 lease detainees who deposit money or an important document such as a passport.
 The law permits incommunicado detention, but there is no evidence that it is prac-
 ticed. Defendants in cases involving loss Qf life, including involuntary manslaughter,
 may be denied release in accordance with the local custom of protecting the defend-
 ant from the victim's aggrieved family. Bail is usually permitted, however, after a
 payment of "diya," a form of financial compensation for death or injury cases.
 Review of criminal cases by the office of the President in Abu Dhabi and bureau-
 cratic delays in processing prisoners or releasiig them sometimes result in detain-
 ees serving additional, unnecessary time in the central prisons (see Section I.e.).
 Some bureaucratic delays have kept prisoners incarcerated for as long as several
 months beyond their court-mandated releasedates.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary, but its decisions are subject to review by the political leadership.
 There is a dual system of Shara (Islamic) and civil (secular) courts. The civil
 courts are generally part of the federal system and are answerable to the Federal
 Supreme Court, located in Abu Dlhabi, which has the power of judicial review as
 well as original jurisdiction in disputes between emirates or between the Federal
 Government and individual emirates. Courts and other parts of the judicial system
 in the Emirate of Dubai tend to maintain independence from the federal system.
 The Shari'a courts are administered by each emirate but are also answerable to
 the Federal Supreme Court. In 1994 the President decreed that the Shari'a courts,
 and not the civil court, would have the authority to try almost all types of criminal
 cases. The decree did not affect the emirates of Dubai, Umm Al-Qaiwain, and Ras
 Al-Khaimah, which have lower courts independent of the federal system.
 Legal counsel may represent defendants in both court systems. Under the new
 Criminal Procedures Code, the accused has a right to counsel in all cases involving
 a capital crime or possible life imprisonment. Only the Emirate of Dubai has a pub-
 lic defender's office. If the defendant is indigent, the Government will provide coun-
 sel. In Dubai, however, the Government provides indigents counsel only in felony
 cases. The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that a defendant in an appeals case has
 a "fundamental right" to select his attorney and that this right supersedes a judge's
 power to appoint an attorney for the defendant.
 The right to legal counsel is interpreted to mean that the accused has access to
 an attorney only after the police have completed their investigation. Thus, the police
 
 
 1825
 can question accused persons-sometimes for days or weeks, as in narcotics cases-
 without the benefit of legal counsel.
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. There are no jury trials.
 A single judge normally renders the verdict in each case, whether in Shari'a or civil
 courts; three judges sit for Dubai felony cases. All trials are public, except national
 security cases and those deemed by the judge likely to harm public morality. Most
 judges are foreign nationals, primarily from other Arab countries; however, the Min-
 istry of Justice has trained some UAE citizens as judges and prosecutors.
 Each court system has an appeal process. Death sentences may be appealed to
 the ruler of the emirate in which the offense was committed or to the President of
 the Federation. Non-Muslims tried for criminal offenses in Shari'a courts may re-
 ceive civil penalties at the discretion of the judge. Shari'a penalties imposed on non-
 Muslims may be overturned or modified by a higher court.
 The Office of the President in the Abu Dhabi Emirate (also known as the Diwan),
 following the traditional prerogatives of a local ruler, maintains the practice of re-
 viewing many types of criminal and civil offenses (such as alcohol use, drug-related
 cases, firearm use, cases involving personal injury, and cases affecting tribal har-
 mony) before cases are released to the prosecutor's office. The Diwan also reviews
 sentences passed by judges and reserves the right to return cases to the courts on
 appeal. The Diwan's involvement leads to long delays prior to and following the ju-
 dicial process, causing prisoners to remain in prison after they have completed their
 sentence. Although there are reports of intervention by other emirates' rulers in spe-
 cific cases of personal interest, intervention does not appear to be routine.
 The military has its own court system based on Western military judicial practice.
 Military tribunals try only military personnel. There is no separate national security
 court system. In Dubai convicted criminals are eligible for executive pardon, often
 based on humanitarian grounds, once they have served at least half of their sen-
 tence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission, except in
 accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without a warrant
 and without demonstrating probable cause, officers' actions in searching premises
 are subject to review, and officers are subject to disciplinary action if they act irre-
 sponsibly. Officials other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a
 private home. Local custom and practice place a high value on privacy, and entry
 into private homes without the owner's permission is rare. There is no known sur-
 veillance of private correspondence. However, foreigners have received sealed publi-
 cations, such as magazines, through the international mail in which unprovocative
 pictures of the naked human figure have been blackened over with a marking pen.
 Family law for Muslims is governed by Shari'a law and the local Shari'a courts.
 As such, Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims. During 1996-97, in
 a case of a marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man, the bride's
 family filed a complaint against the groom resulting in his arrest. The responsible
 Shari'a court declared the union as illicit and the Christian man was convicted of
 fornication and sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment and 39 lashes. He eventually
 was released after having served several months in excess of his sentence. The lash-
 ing was not carried out.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech, most people, especially foreign nationals, refrain from criticizing the Gov-
 ernment in public. All published material is subject to Federal Law 15 of 1988,
 which stipulates that all publications, whether books or periodicals, should be li-
 censed by the Ministry of Education. The law also governs content and contains a
 list of proscribed subjects. Mindful of these provisions, journalists censor themselves
 when reporting on government policy, the ruling families, national security, religion,
 and relations with neighboring states. Following the November 1997 publication of
 an opinion column in the Sharjah daffy Al-Khaleej, which was perceived as indi-
 rectly critical of President Zayid, local journalists reported that the editors were ad-
 monished by the Ministry of Information, but no action was taken against the
 paper.
 Many of the local English and Arabic language newspapers are privately owned
 but receive government subsidies. Foreign publications are routinely subjected to
 censorship before distribution.
 All television and radio stations are government owned and conform to govern-
 ment reporting guidelines. Satellite receiving dishes are widespread and provide ac-
 cess to international broadcasts without apparent censorship. Censors at the Min-
 
 
 1826
 istry of Information and Culture review imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos and ban any material considered pornographic, violent, derogatory
 to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of the
 Government or the ruling families. The state telephone and Internet monopoly low-
 ered Internet prices and sought to encourage greater use of the Internet. The Inter-
 net monopoly uses a proxy server that appears to block material regarded as porno-
 graphic or as promoting radical Islamic ideologies, but does not appear to block
 news services or political expression unrelated to radical Islam, or material originat-
 ing from specific countries.
 The unwritten but generally recognized ban on criticism of the Government also
 restricts academic freedom, although in recent years academics have been more
 open in their criticism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government tightly re-
 stricts the freedom of peaceful assembly. Organized public gatherings require a gov-
 ernment permit. Each emirate determines its ownpractice on public gatherings.
 Some emirates are relatively tolerant of seminars and conferences on sensitive sub-
 jects. Citizens normally confine their political discussions -to the numerous gather-
 ings or majlis, held in private homes. There are no restrictions on such gatherings.
 The   Government tightly restricts freedom of association. Unauthorized political
 organizations are prohibited. All private associations, including children's clubs,
 charitable groups, and hobby associations, must be approved and licensed by local
 authorities; however, this requirement is enforced only loosely in some emirates.
 Private associations must follow the Government's censorship guidelines if they pub-
 lish any material.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion of all the emirates. Citizens
 are predominantly Sunni Muslims, but Shi'a Muslims are also free to worship and
 maintain mosques. In 1993 the Emirate of Dubai placed private mosques under the
 control of its Department of Islamic Affairs and Endowments. This change gave the
 Government control over the appointment of preachers and the conduct of their
 work. Most mosques are government funded or subsidized, and the Ministry of
 Awqaf and Religious Affairs ensures that clergy do not deviate from approved topics
 in their sermons.
 Non-Muslims are free to practice their religion but may not proselytize publicly
 or distribute religious literature. Major cities have Christian churches, some built
 on land donated by the ruling families. A new Catholic church was opened in
 Sharjah with a public ceremony in 1997, and the Government of Dubai Emirate do-
 nated a large parcel of land in 1998 for the construction of a facility to be shared
 by three Protestant congregations. Some emirates permit Hindu and Sikh temples
 to exist. There are no Buddhist temples, but Buddhists, along with Hindus and
 Sikhs in cities without public facilities, conduct religious ceremonies in private
 homes without interference. Other religious communities (mostly expatriates resid-
 ing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi) include Ismailis, Parsis, and Iranian Baha'is. In 1998
 Abu Dhabi Emirate donated land for the expansion'of Christian burial facilities and
 the establishment of the country's first Baha'i cemetery. The Government permits
 foreign clergy to minister to expatriate congregations. Non-Muslim religious groups
 are permitted to engage in private charitable activities and to send their children
 to private schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no limitations on freedom of movement or relocation within
 the country, except for security areas such as defense and oil installations.
 Unrestricted foreign travel and emigration are permitted to male citizens except
 those involved in financial disputes under adjudication, A husband may bar his wife
 and children from leaving the country. All citizens have the right to return. There
 is a small population of stateless residents, many of whom have lived in the UAE
 for more than one generation. They are Bedouins or the descendants of Bedouins
 who are unable to prove that they are of UAE origin. There is no formal procedure
 for naturalization, although foreign women receive citizenship by marriage to a
 UAE citizen, and anyone may receive a passport by presidential fiat. Because they
 are not of the original UAE tribal groups, naturalized citizens may have their pass-
 ports and citizenship status revoked for criminal or politically provocative- actions.
 It is believed that such revocations are rare.
 Citizens are not restricted in seeking or changing employment. However, foreign
 nationals in specific occupations, primarily professional, may not change employers
 without first leaving the country for 6 months. During 1997, in an effort to liberalize
 employment regulations, the Federal Government removed the 6-month ban from
 some of these professions. Foreign nationals involved in disputes with UAE citizen
 employers can be blacklisted by the employer with UAE immigration authorities, ef-
 fectively preventing their return.
 
 
 1827
 The Government has not formulated a formal policy regarding refugees, asylees,
 or first asylum. It may detain persons seeking refugee status, particularly non-
 Arabs, while they await resettlement in a third country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 There are no democratically elected institutions, and citizens do not have the
 right to change their government or to form political parties. Although there are
 consultative councils at the federal and emirate levels, most executive and legisla-
 tive power is in the hands of the Federal Supreme Council. The seven emirate rul-
 ers, their extended families, and those persons and families to whom they are allied
 by historical ties, marriage, or common interest wield most political power in their
 own emirates. Decisions at the federal level are generally made by consensus of the
 sheiks of the seven emirates and leading families.
 A federal consultative body, called the Federal National Council (FNC), consists
 of advisers appointed by the rulers of each emirate. The FNC has no legislative au-
 thority but may question ministers and make policy recommendations to the Cabi-
 net. Its sessions are usually open to the public.
 The choice of a new emirate ruler falls to the ruling family in consultation with
 other prominent tribal figures. By tradition, rulers and ruling families are presumed
 to have the right to rule, but their incumbency ultimately depends on the quality
 of their leadership and their responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers
 are accessible, in varying degrees, to citizens who have a problem or a request.
 Tradition rather than law has limited the political role of women. Women are free
 to hold government positions, but there are few women in senior positions. There
 are no female members of the FNC. However, in June, President Zayid's wife, Fat-
 ima, who is chairwoman of the UAE Women's Federation, announced the Govern-
 ment's intention to appoint a number of women as special observers at the FNC.
 These observers are to learn the procedures of the FNC, and it is expected that
 some may later be appointed as members. Although the small Shi'a minority has
 enjoyed commercial success, few Shi'a Muslims have top positions in the Federal
 Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent human rights groups. Government restrictions on free-
 dom of the press and public association make it difficult for such groups to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights restrictions. A human
 rights section exists within Dubai Emirate's police force to monitor allegations of
 human rights abuses. Informal public discussions of human rights, press reports of
 international human rights forums' activities, and media coverage of selected local
 human rights problems, such as foreign workers' conditions, are increasing public
 awareness of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law with regard to race, nation-
 ality, religious beliefs, or social status. However, there is institutional and cultural
 discrimination based on sex, nationality, and religion.
 Women.-There are reported cases of spousal abuse. Police units are stationed at
 major public hospitals so that victims of abuse may file complaints, or attending
 physicians may call upon the police to interview suspected victims of abuse. How-
 ever, women, are sometimes reluctant to file formal charges for social, cultural, and
 economic reasons, When reported, the local police authorities may take action to
 protect women from abuse. The laws protect women from verbal abuse or harass-
 ment from men, and violators are subject to criminal action. There continue to be
 credible reports of abuse of female domestic servants by some UAE and foreign em-
 ployers (see Section 6.e.).
 Prostitution has become an increasingly open phenomenon in recent years, par-
 ticularly in Dubai. Although no accurate statistics are available, substantial num-
 bers of women appear to be arriving from the states of the former Soviet Union for
 temporary stays during which they engage in prostitution and possibly other activi-
 ties connected with organized crime. Substantial numbers of prostitutes also appear
 to come from Africa and South Asia.
 Most women play a subordinate role in this family centered society because of
 early marriages and traditional attitudes about women's activities. Husbands may
 bar their wives and children from leaving the country (see Section 2.d.), and a mar-
 ried woman may not accept employment without her husband's written consent. Is-
 lamic law is applied in cases of divorce. Courts usually grant custody to the father
 
 
 1828
 regardless of the child's age in divorce cases. In most cases involving children under
 the age of 7 years, the mother is granted temporary custody, which then reverts to
 the father at the age of 7 years. Older children live with their fathers unless judicial
 authorities decide otherwise. A woman who remarries forfeits her right to the cus-
 tody of children from a previous marriage. Islamic law permits polygyny.
 Women are restricted from holding majority shares in most businesses. A wom-
 an's property is not commingled with that of her husband. Women who work outside
 the home do not receive equal 'benefits, such as housing, and may face discrimina-
 tion in promotion. In June 1995, the UAE Cabinet provisionally extended paid ma-
 ternity leave for citizen women in the private sector to 3 months at full pay from
 45 days, and up to 1 year's leave at half pay and a second year's leave at quarter
 pay.
 Opportunities for women have grown in government service, education, private
 business, and health services. According to UAE government figures, 19.4 percent
 of the country's work force in 1995 was female. The Federal Government publicly
 has encouraged women to join the work force, guaranteeing public sector employ-
 ment for all who apply. According to the available statistics, women constitute 100
 percent of nursery school teachers, 55 percent of primary school teachers, 65 percent
 of intermediate and secondary school teachers, 54.3 percent of health care workers,
 and 39.8 percent of all government employees. Cultural barriers and the lack of eco-
 nomic necessity have limited female participation. A symposium promoting the
 rights of women in the labor force was held in October 1996. Participants called for
 increasing rights granted to women including the elimination of the requirement
 that a husband give approval before his wife may work.
 Women continue to make rapid progress in education. 'They constitute over 75
 percent of the student body at the National University in Al-Ain, largely because
 women, unlike men, rarely study abroad.
 Women are officially encouraged to continue their education, and government-
 sponsored women's centers provide adult education and technical training courses.
 The Federal Armed Forces accept female volunteers, who may enroll in a special
 training course started after the Gulf War. The Dubai Police College recriits
 women, many of whom are deployed at airports, immigration offices, and women's
 prisons. As of late in the year, about 200 women had graduated from the College.
 The law prohibits cohabitation by unmarried couples. The Government may im-
 prison and deport noncitizen women if they bear children out of wedlock. In the
 event that the courts sentence women to prison for such an offense, local authorities
 will hold the newborn children in a special facility until the mother's release and
 deportation. Children may remain in this facility longer in the event of a custody
 dispute. In Dubai Emirate, unmarried pregnant women must marry the father of
 the child; both parties are subject to arrest for fornication.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Children who
 are citizens receive free health care, free education, guaranteed housing, and other
 perquisites of citizenship. A family may also be eligible to receive aid from the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Welfare for sons-and daughters who are under the age of
 18, unmarried, or disabled. There is no pattern of societal child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no federal legislation requiring accessibility for
 the disabled. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs sponsors centers
 that provide facilities and services to the disabled. Services range from monthly so-
 cial aid funds, special education, and -transportation assistance, to sending a team
 to the Special Olympics.
 National IRacial]Ethnic Minorities.-Discrimination based on national origin,
 while not legally sanctioned, is prevalent (see Section 2.d.). Employment, immigra-
 tion, and security policy, as well as cultural attitudes towards foreign workers, are
 conditionedby national origin.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no unions and no strikes. The law does
 not grant workers the right to organize unions or to strike. Foreign workers, who
 make up the bulk of the work force, risk deportation if they attempt to organize
 unions or to strike.                        I
 Since July 1995, the UAE has been suspended from the U.S. Overseas Private In-
 vestment Corporation insurance programs because of the Government's lack of com-
 pliance with internationally recognized worker rights standards.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law does not grant work-
 ers the right to engage in collective bargaining, and it is not practiced. Workers in
 the industrial and service sectors are normally employed undr contracts that are
 subject to review by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The Ministry of Interi-
 or's Naturalization and Immigration Administration is responsible for reviewing the
 
 
 1829
 contracts of domestic employees as part of residency permit processing. The purpose
 of the review is to ensure that the pay will satisfy the employee's basic needs and
 secure a means of living. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers must
 rely on conciliation committees organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Af-
 fairs or on special labor courts.
 Labor laws do not cover government employees, domestic servants, and agricul-
 tural workers. The latter two groups face considerable difficulty in obtaining assist-
 ance to resolve disputes with employers. While any worker may seek redress
 through the courts, this process puts a heavy financial burden on those in lower in-
 come brackets.
 In Dubai's Jebel Ali Free Zone, the same labor laws apply as in the rest of the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced. However, some unscrupulous employment agents bring for-
 eign workers to the UAE under conditions approaching indenture. The Government
 prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Labor
 regulations prohibit employment of persons under the age of 15 and have special
 provisions for employing those 15 to 18 years of age. The Department of Labor en-
 forces the regulations. Other regulations permit employers to engage only adult for-
 eign workers. In 1993 the Government prohibited the employment of children under
 the age of 15 as camel jockeys and of jockeys who do not weigh more than 45 kilo-
 grams (99 pounds). The Camel Racing Association is responsible for enforcing these
 rules. However, many sources report that a significant number of camel jockeys are
 children under the UAE minimum employment age. Relevant labor laws often are
 not enforced, as those who own racing camels and employ the children come from
 powerful local families that are in effect above the law. In September, a local news-
 paper reported the hospitaization of a 5-year-old, 20-kiloram (44-pound), aban-
 doned Bangladeshi child who had been employed as a jockey and whose leg had
 been broken by a camel. Otherwise, child labor is not permitted. The Government
 prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effectively (see
 Section 6.c.). The Government does not issue visas for foreign workers under the age
 of 16 years. Education is compulsory through the intermediate stage, approximately
 the age of 13 or 14 years.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-There is no legislated or administrative mini-
 mum wage. Supply and demand determine compensation. However, according to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, there is an unofficial, unwritten minimum
 wage rate that would afford a worker and family a minimal standard of living. The
 Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor contracts and does not approve any
 contract that stipulates a clearly unacceptable wage (see Section 6.b.).
 The standard workday and workweek are 8 hours a day, 6 days per week, but
 these standards are not enforced strictly. Certain types of workers, notably domestic
 servants, may be obliged to work longer than the mandated standard hours. The
 law also provides for a minimum of 24 days per year of annual leave plus 10 na-
 tional and religious holidays. In addition, manualworkers are not required to do
 outdoor work when the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius (112 degrees Fahr-
 enheit).
 Most foreign workers receive either employer-provided housing or housing allow-
 ances, medical care, and homeward passage from their employers. Most foreign
 workers do not earn the minimum salary of $1,090 per month (or $817 per month,
 if a housing allowance is provided in addition to the salary) required to obtain resi-
 dency permits for their families. Employers have the option to petition for a 6-
 month ban from the work force against any foreign employee who leaves his job
 without fulfilling the terms of his contract.
 The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities,
 and civil defense units enforce health and safety standards. The Government re-
 quires every large industrial concern to employ a certified occupational safety offi-
 cer. An injured worker is entitled to fair compensation. Health standards are not
 uniformly observed in the housing camps provided for foreign workers. Workers' jobs
 are not protected if they remove themselves from what they consider to be unsafe
 working conditions. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs may require
 employers to reinstate workers dismissed for not performing unsafe work. All work-
 ers have the right to lodge grievances with Ministry officials, who make an effort
 to investigate all complaints. However, the Ministry is understaffed and underbudg-
 eted; complaints and compensation claims are backlogged.
 Rulings on complaints may be appealed within the Ministry and ultimately to the
 courts. However, many workers choose not to protest for fear of reprisals or deporta-
 tion. The press periodically carries reports of abuses suffered by domestic servants,
 
 
 1830
 
 particularly women, at the hands of some employers. Allegations have included ex-
 cessive work hours, nonpayment of wages, and verbal and physical abuse.
