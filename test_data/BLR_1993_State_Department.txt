 BELARUS
 Belarus, which declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has yet to
 hold elections or to approve a new constitution. Belarus' form of government contin-
 ues to parallel closely that of the former Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviet the leg-
 islative branch, is technically the highest ruling body of the country; its chairman,
 Stanislav Shushkevich, is considered Head of State. Most power, however, continues
 to remain in the hands of the Council of Ministers, headed by Prime Minister
 Vyacheslav Kebich. The Council is the executive branch of government, and its de-
 crees have the force of law. It is still dominated by ex-Communist party members,
 as is the Supreme Soviet. The nationalist Belarusian Popular Front (BNF), the prin-
 cipal opposition group, holds less than 10 percent of the seats in Parliament. Politi-
 cal parties as such have yet to develop as a political force in Belarus. Shushkevich
 is supported by the democratic opposition, including the opposition Popular Front,
 in a dtion to many deputies in the mainstream. Shushkevich's major source of sup-
 port is his personal popularity among the Belarusian people. Kebich has the support
 of the "Belarus" faction in Parliament.
 The Belarusian Committee for State Security (KGB), while legally under par-
 liamentary supervision, in practice reports to the Council of Ministers as well as to
 the Supreme Soviet. Attempts in Parliament in 1993 to restore exclusive Council of
 Ministers' control over the KGB were not successful. Opponents of the Government
 reported no overt harassment from security services in 1993. Electronic monitoring
 of residences and telephones, however, reportedly continued. There were no reported
 human rights violations on the part of the military with the exception of hazing,
 which reportedly continues much the way it was practiced in the former Soviet
 Union.
 Belarus' economy is in decline. Many factories cut workweeks back to 4 days or
 less and continued the policy of giving workers mandatory unpaid vacations. The
 Government continued to pursue cautious reform of the state-owned sector with the
 stated aim of developing a socially oriented market economy." Parliament passed
 additional privatization laws, but the executive branch was slow to implement pri-
 vatization plans.
 Respect for human rights was mixed. Progress continued in some areas but
 flagged in others. Although little progress was made on political reform, the Govern-
 ment did not attempt to suppress political activity. Freedom of the press was re-
 stricted through the Government's virtual monopoly over forms of mass communica-
 tion and its desire to limit media criticism of its actions. It controlled the editorial
 content and policy of the largest circulation daily newspapers and of radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts. The Government did honor a longstanding request from the oppo-
 sition for television air time. In a marked contrast to the Soviet era, freedom of reli-
 gion is generally observed, although bureaucratic impediments remain. A govern-
 ment dispute with the Roman Catholic Church over its status in Belarus (and the
 status of Polish priests) eased somewhat. The Government, however, still has not
 recognized Archbishop Svyontek, a Belarusian of Polish origin, as the head of the
 Catholic Church in Belarus. Svyontek had been charged in the past by the Govern-
 
 
 795
 ment as being an agent of Polish agitation, particularly in Western Belarus where
 Polish influence is strong.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajuridical Killing.-Such killings are not known to
 have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions, disappearances, or secret
 arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The current Soviet-era Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person but
 contains no explicit ban on torture and other degrading forms of punishment. Police
 beatings were reported in detention centers and prisons. Credible sources report
 that the police severely beat up Gennadiy Shpak on March 19, 1993, when they de-
 tained him. The use of force is officially sanctioned in some instances. For example,
 it may be employed on prisoners found harming or threatening to harm other pris-
 oners or prison personnel. The Government claims to monitor and keep statistics on
 the use of force by prison guards. Prison authorities are required to report each such
 use of force by prison guards to the Prosecutor General's office. A medical evaluation
 of the prisoner is also required when force has been used.
 There were continued reports that prison conditions were substandard and treat-
 ment degrading. Inhumane prison conditions were reported in Grodno, Minsk, and
 Orsha. Amnesty International observers were officially denied access to the Grodno
 prison in March. The Government's justification was that the visit would provoke
 chaos and riots in the prison. A vice minister of internal affairs stated publicly that
 a radio broadcast about the prison had at the time created "a very complicated situ-
 ation" in the prison. He suggested that the delegation visit "any other prison but
 Grodno."
 Government officials claim that lack of space remains the chief obstacle to improv-
 ing prison conditions: the rising crime rate means more prisoners, and this fact, cou-
 pled with a decaying physical plant and local neighborhood movements opposed to
 the construction of newprisons, results in overcrowded prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Criminal procedures remain essentially
 unchanged from those in the former Soviet Union. Persons may be detained arbi-
 trarily and without an arrest warrant. The Criminal Code requires that detainees
 be charged or arrested within 72 hours. Once arrested and charged, defendants
 often spend many months awaiting trial. At the request of the state prosecutor, a
 detainee may be kept in pretrial detention for up to 3 months. This period may be
 extended at the request of either the regional or the state prosecutor for up to a
 maximum period of 1  years. Detainees may be allowed unlimited visits from their
 legal counsel. However, there were reports that some detainees had difficulty in
 gaining access to a lawyer. There is no provision for bail, and detainees may not
 correspond or receive family visitors without the express permission of the state
 prosecutor.
 Ministry of Internal Affairs' special forces staged a large-scale raid on February
 5 on the hotel Agat on the outskirts of Minsk, allegedly looking for persons involved
 in narcotics dealing and other illicit activity. Witnesses indicated that occupants (in-
 eluding some foreigners) were arbitrarily beaten and detained.
 Exile is not prscticed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system, retaining much of the Soviet
 structure, has three tiers: district, city or oblast (province), and republic. Higher
 courts serve as appellate courts, but many also hear trials in the first instance.
 Trials are generally public, although they may be closed on grounds of national
 security. In practice, however, attendance at open trials may be arbitrarily re-
 stricted. Defendants have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence on their behalf.The court appoints an attorney for defendants who
 do not have one. Some defendants reportedly had difficulty in gaining access to law-
 yers and court materials. Sergey Golubev, arrested for stealing, was denied access
 to an attorney by an investigator in the Pervomaiskiv region of Minsk. Although
 technically the burden of proof is on the prosecutor, as a practical matter the pre-
 sumption of innocence is not always strictly observed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners in 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic monitoring of residences and telephones continues. A law, revised in 1992,
 gives the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and certain border guard detach-
 ments the right to request permission to install wiretaps. Permission of a prosecutor
 is legally required before a wiretap may be installed. Except in cases of pursuit, a
 
 
 796
 search warrant, issued by the prosecutor, is needed in order to enter a private
 home.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of the press is provided for by existing
 legislation but is not yet fully observed in practice.
 The executive branch of the Government continued to use laws on slander to
 clamp down on criticism of government officials. According to the Belarusian League
 of Human Rights, government officials sued Supreme Soviet deputies Evgeniy
 Novikov, Pavel Kholod, and Alexandr Shut for their public criticism of the Govern-
 ment.
 The chairman of the regional council of the Logoisk region, Aleksander Kresik,
 sued Kholod and Shut for a newspaper article they published in Narodnaya Gazeta
 in March 1992 criticizing Kresik for corruption in his dealings with local govern-
 ment property. Kholod and Shut claimed that Kresik sold school buildings to his
 friends at prices well below market value. The suit was brought in December 1992
 and, despite numerous hearings in 1993, remained unresolved at year's end. Both
 opposition party members, Kholod and Shut stated that they feel there has been a
 concentrated effort on the part of the Government to single out opposition deputies
 for such suits. They assert only opposition deputies have been objects of such legal
 action.
 Novikov was sued by a state enterprise (Belgosstrakh) for his disclosures of cor-
 ruption at this company. Novikov was fined in 1992. He was subsequently sued in
 1993 by the same Judge Gorodnicheva who presided over his trial in a personal suit
 for a political statement he made that called into question the court's decision in
 the earlier case. This case was also unresolved at year's end.
 A deputy of the Borisov city soviet, Sergey Kolesnik, was reportedly fined by the
 courts for criticism of local executive branch officials. He was sued by deputy
 Borisov city administrator Galina Kuchuk in 1993 for his appeal alleging irregular-
 ities in the privatization process in Borisov. The suit was eventually dropped. Subse-
 quently Kolesnik and a group of other city-level deputies were sued for a public ap-
 peal they made in September to Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich about cor-
 ruption in housing in the Borisov city region. The Chairman of the City Executive
 Council, Stanislav Shidlovskiy, filed suit in March, demanding a public apology and
 10 million rubles. The court ruled that the deputies must apologize but dropped the
 monetary part of the suit.
 The law on the status of people's deputies grants them immunity from criminal
 prosecution but does not protect them from prosecution under the Civil Code, of
 which the slander laws, particularly the "Law on Honor and Dignity," are a part.
 The writer Svetlana Aleksievich was sued under these statutes (with reported back-
 ing from high-ranking military officials) by a group of mothers who lost sons in Af-
 ghanistan for her boo on the Soviet-Afghan war. Aleksievich wrote about atrocities
 committed by Soviet soldiers during the war. There were actually two suits which
 were tried concurrently--one brought by the mothers and one brought by an Afghan
 war veteran. The court dismissed the first suit in December. In the second suit, the
 court ruled   that Aleksievich  must publish   an  apology  in  the newspaper
 (Komsomolskaya Pravda) which originally published excerpts of her book.
 High-ranking officials also sued the Belarusian correspondent of the Russian
 newspaper Kommersant, Alexandr Starikevich. A court sentenced him in absentia
 to 15 days in prison for failing to appear in court in March. The court apparently
 ignored Starikevich's written appeal, reportedly submitted according to proper pro-
 cedures, to postpone proceedings by 4 days. As a consequence, Starikevich spent
 much of the year in Russia and was forced to hide from Belarusian authorities while
 in Minsk. Police reportedly made repeated and harassing visits to his home in
 Minsk.
 The Government retains a near monopoly on the forms of mass communication.
 It remained the owner and chief financial backer of nine major publications. There
 are approximately 30 newspapers in Belarus completely independent of government
 control. Most, however, are small and poorly funded. Of the six major daily news-
 papers, all are at least partially government controlled. The Council of Ministers'
 information division continued to exercise direct control over them, for example, by
 discussing editorial content and policy in meetings with government-sponsored
 newspaper editors. In one instance, the Parliament-sponsored newspaper Narodnaya
 Gazeta was reportedly threatened with loss of its lease in a government building
 for refusing orders to print an interview given by Prime Minister Kebich. All na-
 tional and most local papers were told to publish the article. Draft legislation to re-
 duce the degree of government control over the press failed to win the approval of
 the Supreme Soviet. A group of independent journalists, in an open letter to Prime
 
 
 797
 Minister Kebich, claimed they were often not informed of Council of Ministers press
 conferences, while journalists more sympathetic to the Government were always in-
 vited and given information not provided to independent journalists. The Belarusian
 legislature has given preliminary attention to a draft law on the press, which incor-
 porates to a significant degree parts of the opposition's original draft law. The draft
 law has been passed in the first reading, but it still requires a second reading before
 it becomes law.
 The State owns all radio and television stations, with the exception of a few cable
 stations that generally do not air news programs and are dependent on government-
 owned facilities. Radio and television generally avoid criticism of the Government
 and its leadership. The "Nika" news program, which sometimes aired the views of
 government critics, had its management changed in 1992; the program took a con-
 siderably softer line toward the Government in 1993. Minsk's most popular nonstate
 cable television station, Channel 8, was closed by the Government over a registra-
 tion dispute in January. The Government delayed the reopening of the station for
 most of 1993. On December 20, the Ministry of Communications allowed the station
 to begin rebroadcasting "on a trial basis." Broadcasts were scheduled to last until
 mid-January 1994 when a reevaluation of the station was scheduled to occur. Other
 local radio and television stations also were closed. Belarusians continued to receive
 television and radio broadcasts from the Russian Federation, including the tele-
 vision station Ostankino from Moscow, and can receive British Broadcasting Cor-
 oration news once a day over state facilities. In September the State Television-
 adio Company of Belarus granted the opposition BNF a longstanding request for
 air time. The BNF received about an hour of television air time with no conditions
 attached. BNF leaders regularly are interviewed on Belarusian radio and somewhat
 more sporadically on Belarusian television. A partially American-owned religious
 radio station began FM broadcasts in cooperation with a Belarusian partner in
 1993.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Demonstrations are still gov-
 erned by the Soviet law on demonstrations. Application to local officials is required
 10 days in advance. Public demonstrations occurred frequently. Both the BNF and
 the pro-Communist opposition often use Minsk's independence square to dem-
 onstrate their disagreements with the Government, despite a city government ban
 on demonstrations in that square due, allegedly, to the completion of a renewal
 project. Political parties-including the Communist Party-are allowed to function
 freely in Belarus, as are ethnic and professional organizations. The ban on the Com-
 munist Party was lifted in February. In May the Communist Party of Belarus (KPB)
 merged with the Party of Communists of Belarus (PKB) and adopted the latter
 name.
 The Supreme Soviet instituted a ban on political activity in the military, including
 membership by military personnel in political parties. The chairman of the
 Belarusian Military Association (BZV), Nikolay Statkevich, was dishonorably dis-
 charged from the armed forces for failing to resign from the organization he helped
 found. The BZV is a "nonpolitical patriotic military organization" which attempts to
 instill Belarusian soldiers and officers with a sense of pride in Belarusian history,
 language, and culture. Statkevich's supporters said that he was dismissed for his
 nationalist political views. Statkevich argued that his organization is not a political
 but a social and professional one.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is generally respected. A 1992 law
 on freedom of religious beliefs and organizations provides broad guarantees for free-
 dom of religion. Religious organizations are allowed to engage in cultural, edu-
 cational, and charitable activities. However, there is still some bureaucratic resist-
 ance to religion in general and toward the major churches and the Jewiih commu-
 nit in particular.
 he majority of Belarusians are Eastern Orthodox Christians. The Orthodox
 Church remains formally linked to the Russian Orthodox Church and recognizes the
 rimacy of the Moscow Patriarch. Some Belarusian nationalists have criticized the
 Church for being too closely tied to Moscow and not doing enough to serve the na-
 tional interests of Belarus.
 The Roman Catholic Church in Belarus claims some 1.5 million members, roughly
 15 percent of the population. Relations between the Catholic Church and the Gov-
 ernment remain strained because of the historical association of the Church with
 Poland, which ruled the western part of Belarus Ps recently as 1939. The Govern-
 ment still has not officially recognized Archbishop Kazimir Svyontek, a Belarusian
 of Polish origin, as the head of the Catholic Church in Belarus. In May, however,
 the Government received the first Papal Nuncio to Belarus. Belarus' one Catholic
 seminary, in Grodno, has not been able to meet the increasing demand for priests.
 
 
 798
 As a consequence, over 90 Polish priests were brought in and are working in
 Belarus.
 The Government continues to return churches previously confiscated by the Soviet
 government to the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. This slow process,
 marked by numerous property disputes between the Churches and the State and be-
 tween the two Churches, continues. Organizations that occupy what once was
 church property are also involved. A sit-in by congregation members in a Minsk
 Catholic church that had become a chamber music concert hall failed to resolve the
 ownership dispute.
 In addition to the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, 16 other religious organiza-
 tions and sects freely function in Belarus. Visits of missionaries from many coun-
 tries are frequent, and religious work is gnerally unimpeded. During 1993, how-
 ever, several government officials expressed their concern at the growing number
 of foreign Christian missionaries in Belarus. Some Belarusians intrpreted frequent
 Protestant proselytizing as harmful to Belarusian national interests. The Govern-
 ment began to require all persons wishing to engage in religious work in Belarus
 to present a formal invitation from a Belarusian religious organization in order to
 receive visas. Subsequently, two American Baptist missionaries waited for 3 months
 to receive extensions of their visas until they found a registered Mink church will-
 ingtosponsor their visit.
 Despite occasional bureaucratic difficulties, religious rallies were held without in-
 terfernce in conference halls and in stadiums, and proselytizing also occurred. Bi-
 bles and other freliumteri  ae available for sale in the Belarosian, Russian,
 and Polish languages.
 The Jewish community retains concerns over several main issues. The Jewish
 community is concerned, as are Christian churches, with the return of previously
 confiscated buildings and synagogues which have been turned into theaters, ware-
 houses, and meeting halls. Minsk continues to lack an adequate building for a syna-
 togue. Authorities promised to return a former synagogue to the Jewish community
 inMogilev by the end of 1993. Another concern is the construction of a group of
 apartment buildings on the old Jewish cemetery in Pinak. Following international
 protest government authorities ordered local officials to cease construction at the
 site. Mjor construction was reportedly terminated, although certain underground
 construction for plumbing, electricity, and other facilities continued on the buildings
 already erected.
 Government officials, national and local, held a commemoration on October 20 of
 the 50th anniversary of the destruction of the Minsk Jewish ghetto.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Soviet procedures remained in efect, at least on paper, for many as-
 pects of freedom of movement.
 Belarusian citizens were generally free to travel within the country. However, all
 adults are still issued internal passports, which serve as primary identity docu-
 ments and are required for travel, permanent housing, and hotel registration.
 The right to choose one's place of residence, although guaranteedby law, remains
 restricted in practice. Despi it ys formal abolition b the Soviet overnment in Octo-
 ber 1991, the "prpiska" (pass) system survives in Belars. All Blarusians are offi-
 cially required to register their places of residence and may not change them with-
 out official permission. The authorities limit the number of residence permits in
 Minsk and the five regional centers of Brest, Grodno, Mohelev, Vitebsk, and Gomel.
 However, according to government officials and other reliable sources, official per-
 mission was increasingly granted or denied to persons seeking to change their place
 of residence according to the availability of housing, with fewer denials than pre-
 viously.
 The Supreme Soviet approved the Interior Ministry's law on entry and exit in
 June. The law was to come into effect on January 1, 1994, and supersedes the 1991
 Soviet law on entry and exit in force in Belarus during 1993. The new law abolishes
 the former Soviet requirement of mandatory official permission for each trip abroad
 by authorizing Belarusians to receive "global" exit vis"as good for from 1 to 5 years
 and valid for travel to all countries. Limited issuance of the "global" exit visas began
 in August but is currently hampered by a 1- to 2-month processing period.
 Belarusian passports are being readied for printing. Some ofcialpassport holders,
 i.e., governmient officials, are already using the new passport. There are reports that
 the application process is long, with delays of several months reported. There were
 no reports of unjust or arbitrary refusals.
 Emigration from Belarus continued to decline, with fewer people applying to emi-
 grate in 1993 than in 192. Soviet legislation restricting emigration by those with
 access to "state secrets remained in force. However, only one would-be emigrant
 was refused an exit visa on grounds of pos   vessing  tate  rcrets," as compared to
 
 
 799
 six in 1992, and this person was eventually permitted to emigrate to Israel at the
 end of 1993. Belarusian draft-age men who had not previously received permission
 to travel abroad from the Belarusian military were also officially restricted from
 traveling abroad. However, there were no cases of would-be emigrants refused due
 to incomplete military service in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Political reform in Belarus stagnated in 1993, and the right of citizens to change
 their government, although guaranteed by law, remains to be tested in free elec-
 tions. The current Parliament was chosen for a 5-year term under Soviet election
 rules in 1990. In theory, voting is secret, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18
 years of age and older. In 1992 the BNF spearheaded a massive signature-gathering
 campaign in an effort to force a referendum on holding new parliamentary elections.
 The Supreme Soviet rejected the referendum, alleging that both the initiating group
 and the election commission had violated the referendum law. The opposition con-
 tinued to call for a referendum during 1993, arguing that rejection of the referen-
 dum undermined the Government's claim to le itimacy.
 At the same time it rejected the proposed referendum, the Supreme Soviet passed
 a nonbinding resolution calling for the passage of a new constitution and the hold-
 ing of new elections in March 1994. The resolution, however, lacked the force of law,
 and it is unclear whether elections will be held in 1994. A draft of the new constitu-
 tion is under review in the Supreme Soviet. Foreign legal experts, reviewing the
 document, found it significantly inadequate in numerous areas, most notably that
 of citizens' civil and political rights.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics and gov-
 ernment. Social barriers to women in politics, however, remain fairly strong, and
 most top leadership positions are held by men. There is one woman in a miniserial-
 level position, and women hold less than 5 percent of the seats in the Supreme So-
 viet. A number of women do, however, hold posts at the vice ministerial level.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights monitors reported bureaucratic obstacles and posturin on the prt
 of the Government when investigating alleged human rights violations. The
 Belarusian League of Human Rights, founded in 1992, reported that the courts re-
 fused to review appeals from the League on the pretext of procedural grounds. The
 League has close contacts with a variety of international organizations involved in
 human rights.
 Amnesty International visited Belarus in February. Except for the denial of per-
 mission to visit Grodno prison (see Section 1.c.), international organizations were
 not hindered in making visits to Belarus.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law on citizenship, passed by the Supreme Soviet, grants citizenship to any
 person living permanently on the territory of Belarus as of October 19, 1991. Those
 coming to Belarus after this date and wishing to become a citizen must submit an
 application, know the Belarusian language ( enough for communication'), agree to
 support the Constitution and laws, have a legal source of income, and have lived
 in the country for 7 years. (The 7-year residence requirement is waived for those
 who were previously citizens of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic and for
 those who are currently in the armed forces, who wish to become citizens, and who
 are prepared to take the oath of allegiance to Belarus.)
 Women.-Statistics are not available on the incidence of violence against women.
 Some fledgling women's rights organizations are attempting to increase awareness
 of women a issues in the country. Domestic violence against women often alcohol
 related, continues to be a significant problem in Belarus. Knowledgeable sources in-
 dicate that police generally are not hesitant to enforce laws against violence. Like-
 wise, the courts are not against imposing sentences. The problem, according to wom-
 en's groups, is a reluctance to report incidents of domestic violence. In addition to
 the regular court system, there are "communal courts" in which women can use
 pressure from friends, neighbors, and coworkers to help rectify such situations. Cer-
 tain women activists have pointed to the existence of discrimination in Belarusian
 legislation. One government decree on the privatization of housing, for example, is
 disadvantageous to women in terms of the amount of square footage available to
 them.
 Children.-Belarus ratified the international Convention on the Rights of the
 Child in 1993. Special benefits to families with children are considered substantial
 
 
 by local standards. Children's health-particularly as related to the consequences of
 the nuclear accident at Chernobyl-has been a concern of the Government which,
 with the hel of foreign donors, has received significant funding.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belarusians account for about 78 percent of
 the population of over 10 million; 13 percent are Russians, 4 percent Poles, 3 per-
 cent Ukrainians, and there are Lithuanians and Jews among the remaining 2 per-
 cent. The Belarusian language was made the official language, but Russian remains
 the predominant working language, with most of the population speaking Russian
 at home. The introduction of Belarusian as the mandatory language of instruction
 in schools is being phased in gradually. A movement is under way to make Russian
 the second official language. The Supreme Soviet adopted a law on national minori-
 ties in late 1992 which, in addition to forbidding discrimination, expressly prohibits
 officially asking, in written or oral form, about a person's nationality.
 People with Disabilities.-Facilities in Belarus, including transport and office
 buildings, often are not accessible to the disabled. A law mandating accessibility to
 transport, residences, businesses, and offices for the disabled came into force in late
 1992. A multiagency government council is to oversee the implementation of these
 provisions. The Committee was only recently established and has only started its
 activities. In addition, the law provides various social and material benefits for the
 handicapped. One advocacy group claimed that the law is not being enforced, al-
 though other groups say it is still too soon to tell how effective the law will be.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The independent trade union movement is still in
 its infancy. Although several independent trade unions exist, the former Belarusian
 branch of the U.S.S.R's All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions-currently the
 Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus (FTUB)-is by far the largest trade union
 organization. This so-called trade union of 5 million members is not considered inde-
 pendent in practice since it often follows government orders.
 The 1992 law on trade unions provides that workers have the right to form and
 join independent unions on a voluntary basis and to carry out actions in defense
 of workers' rights, including the right to strike. In practice, workers are often auto-
 matically inducted into the government-affiliated FTUB. Independent labor leaders
 believe that the official trade unions' control over social functions (such as pension
 funds), usually performed by the State, is an obstacle to the growth of true, inde-
 pendent trade unions. The independent trade unions include the Free Trade Union
 of Belarus (with about 10,000 members), the Independent Miners' Union (about
 6,000 members), the Confederation of Labor (3,000), and the Union of Air Traffic
 Controllers. In September the Free Trade Union of Belarus and the Independent
 Miners' Union created the Congress of Free Trade Unions of Belarus, an organiza-
 tion that intends to coordinate the actions of the two largest independent trade
 unions.
 No major strikes occurred during 1993. A threatened walk-out in June by the
 FTUB at a factory that produces specialized automated production equipment (as-
 semby lines) by special order was averted when the Government acceded to the
 union s demands.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation dating from the
 Soviet period provides for the right to organize and bargain collectively. Since the
 economy is still largely in the hands of the State, unions usually seek redress at
 the political level.
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was reportedly violated when
 Evgeniy Vozhik, a worker at the Minsk enterprise Elektronika and a FTUB council
 member, was fired under the guise of enterprise layoffs. According to union activ-
 ists, Vladimir Oichlik of the Ordzhenikidze factory was also dismissed for union-re-
 lated activity under a similar pretext. Mikhail Ustinovich was reportedly badly beat-
 en on the shop floor of the Bobruysk tire factory for trade union-related activism.
 The Belarusian law on trade unions (1992) prohibits discrimination for trade union
 activity. The Labor Code includes provisions for reinstatement of an employee
 (through arbitration and then court action) should it be determined that the firing
 was for union-related activity.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While there is no explicit prohibi-
 tion of forced or compulsory labor, it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Current labor law establishes 16
 years of age as the statutory minimum age for employment of children. In certain
 cases, such as the death of a family's chief wage earner, a 15-year-old may seek spe-
 cial permission to assume full-time employment. Reportedly, the Procurator Gen-
 eral's office enforces this law effectively.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Supreme Soviet sets a minimum wage, pe-
 riodically raised in response to inflation, which is effectively enforced. The minimum
 monthly wage is approximately $6 (30,000 Belarusian rubles). With inflation rising
 rapidly, the minimum wage is considered too low to provide a decent standard or
 living.
 The Labor Code sets a limit of 41 hours per week and provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. Because of the difficult economic situation, an increas-
 ing number of workers find themselves working considerably less than 40 hours per
 week. Often factories require workers to take unpaid "vacations" due to shortages
 of raw materials and energy and lack of demand for factory output.
 The law establishes minimum conditions of workplace safety and worker health;
 however, these standards are often ignored. No central, effective enforcement mech-
 anism exists. Factory safety brigades report directly to plant management and are
 thus widely considered ineffective.
