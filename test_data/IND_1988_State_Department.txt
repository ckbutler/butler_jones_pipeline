 INDIA
 India is the world's largest democracy, a secular republic
 with a political structure that incorporates Indian political
 traditions with aspects of the British parliamentary system.
 Free elections are held regularly at the national and state
 levels. As a result of the last general election in 1984,
 Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) Party holds almost
 75 percent of the seats in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of
 India's Parliament) and controls the Rajya Sabha (upper house)
 by a slight majority. It also controls the legislatures of 13
 of the 25 states and participates in the ruling coalition of
 one more. The elected state assembly in Punjab was dissolved
 in May 1987 and replaced by "President's rule" (direct rule
 from New Delhi), following political violence. Three other
 states are also under President's rule.
 The internal security apparatus combines national- and state-
 controlled paramilitary and police forces. While the 25
 states have the primary role in maintaining law and order, the
 central Government has responsibility for protecting the
 fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, both in
 law and in practice. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs
 controls the nationwide Indian Police Force, the paramilitary
 forces, and the intelligence bureaus. The state governments
 control their own police forces, the provincial armed
 constabularies, and some specialized police forces. In the 41
 years since India's independence, control of law and order
 operations has moved increasingly under the Home Ministry.
 This tendency stems in part from the rapid growth of the
 intelligence bureaus, which function with little reference to
 the state governments, and in part from the increased use of
 paramilitary forces against armed groups demanding separatism
 or revolutionary change. Military forces were used for
 internal control in the 1984 army action on the Golden Temple
 complex in Amritsar, Punjab, and in a subsequent military
 action there in 1988.
 The Indian economy is mixed. The central and state
 governments own and operate banks, air and rail transport,
 public utilities, and much heavy industry. The agricultural
 sector, manufacture of consumer goods, some heavy industry,
 and services other than financial are largely in private
 hands. Some rules regulating private economic activity have
 been relaxed. A population of over 800 million, growing at
 over 2 percent annually, places enormous pressure on available
 resources. Government estimates place more than a third of
 the population below the poverty line.
 There were no major new developments in the human rights
 situation in 1988. Observance of human rights varies
 significantly from state to state. India is a basically
 democratic polity with strong and legally sanctioned
 safeguards for individuals, and a vigorous free press.
 Nevertheless, India's many social tensions continue to
 generate significant human rights abuses. In 1988 the most
 serious human rights problems included terrorist killings and
 retaliatory killings by security forces in the Punjab;
 incommunicado detention of security suspects for prolonged
 periods without charge under antiterrorist laws; intercaste
 violence, linked to communal elements, against underprivileged
 groups, particularly in the state of Bihar; widespread reports
 that police were staging killings in fake "encounters";
 torture and illegal detention; the lack of control over police
 and the lack of vigorous investigation and prosecution by
 
 
 1329
 INDIA
 authorities in several states of police accused of rape and
 other mistreatment of suspects under detention;
 nonimplementation of laws affecting women's rights; the
 increase, regionally and numerically, of "dowry deaths"
 (murder of young married women for property reasons); and the
 significant abuse of indentured and child labor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing.
 The Government does not sanction political killing. In 1988
 stringent law and order measures were taken, particularly in
 the state of Punjab, to curb political violence. On the other
 hand, local political leaders are often involved openly in
 communal or caste-related violence, which often leads to
 killings, in various parts of the country.
 In Punjab the level of killings rose in the first 6 months,
 despite the enactment of the 59th Amendment to the
 Constitution int March to extend President's rule beyond the
 maximum limit of 1 year. Estimates of terrorist killings in
 Punjab vary. The Press Trust of India reported that 1,771
 persons were killed in Punjab by terrorists between January
 and June, including leaders of political parties and other
 organizations, policemen, journalists, and whole families. An
 average of 9 persons were killed daily compared to 3 killings
 a day during the same- period in 1987. On August 7, the Home
 Minister provided Parliament with an official and somewhat
 lower figure of 1,277 persons killed in the first 6 months in
 terrorist-related actions. The figure included 62 police
 deaths. He also announced that 169 terrorists had been killed
 in encounters with security forces, with 12 terrorists killed
 "otherwise." Terrorist actions included train derailments,
 bomb blasts in public places, and killings of migrant
 workers. Most victims of the'violence were unarmed Sikh and
 Hindu civilians, most of them killed by Sikh militants. In
 March terrorists killed 33 Hindus and Sikhs participating in a
 religious festival in Hoshiarpur.
 Separating deaths caused by politically motivated terrorists
 from deaths as a result of common crime is difficult because
 neither the press nor the Government makes a careful
 distinction between the two. While police have been
 instructed to distinguish between "normal" and "terrorist"
 crime, the authorities have not made detailed statistics
 available. Police at the local level have been accused by
 critics of subsuming "normal" crime under "terrorist" crime to
 delay or avdid investigation of police actions.
 In May, during an exercise code-named "Operation Black
 Thunder," security forces killed over 20 Sikh militants who
 had taken armed control of the Golden Temple complex in
 Amritsar and arrested 75 others. Both Hindu and Sikh
 observers credit the Government with showing restraint-, in
 contrast to the 1984 "Operation Blue Star" in which over 1,000
 people died and heavy damage was caused to the Golden Temple
 shrine itself. A number of corpses were discovered by
 security forces inside the complex, giving rise to charges
 that the militants had tortured and killed people they had
 captured there. During the year, the Government released 178
 Sikhs who had been arrested in the Golden Temple in the June
 
 
 1330
 INDIA
 1984 "Blue Star" operation, and who had been held in Jodhpur
 central jail, charged with waging war against the State. of
 the original detainees, 196 remain in jail.
 The 1987 Misra Commission on the anti-Sikh riots, which took
 place following Indira Gandhi's assassination in October 1984,
 recommended certain actions against those responsible for the
 riots. In October, shortly before the fourth commemoration of
 Mrs. Gandhi's death, six persons were sentenced to life
 imprisonment for killing four people during the riots. They
 were the first to be convicted and sentenced.
 Intercaste and political killings continued to plague Bihar,
 with Harijans ("scheduled," or lowest caste) the main victims
 of the assaults. Between January and August, 61 people were
 killed in the Jehahabad district of Bihar. Twenty-nine were
 killed in two incidents; one involved a mass killing of 18
 Harijans in their beds in June, and the other the killing of
 11 Harijans in August by suspected agents of the Yadavs (a
 pastoral caste), with control of land and cultivation as the
 motivating factor. There were charges that tardy police
 intervention increased the number of deaths in the incident.
 Bihar state authorities appear not to have provided adequate
 security to prevent such incidents, nor to have made active
 efforts to arrest members of the groups who commit the
 violence. The Union Home Minister reported that the killings
 were "the handiwork of the 'extremists,' out to destabilize
 the popular governments." The report recommended sending
 government paramilitary forces to Bihar to deal with the
 "militants." The Home Minister's decision launched massive
 arrests by state police, which was popularly viewed as a means
 of curbing villagers who demanded just wages and who protested
 against oppressive landlords. The connection between certain
 politicians, criminal gangs, and landlords in rural areas,
 where senas (private armies) and local police are used to
 resist demands for social and economic change, still exists in
 states such as Bihar. In turn, disadvantaged castes have
 increasingly joined the activities of radical groups there and
 in Andhra Pradesh.
 According to government figures, in the first half of 1988
 communal violence (primarily Hindu-Muslim) broke out in 238
 clashes in different parts of the country. By June, 33
 persons had lost their lives, compared to over 300 killings in
 689 communal riots in all of 1987.
 In the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, police and
 *Naxalites" (a loosely applied generic term for various Maoist
 radical groups), continued to clash. Violence increased in
 1988 as Naxalites retaliated against alleged human rights
 violations by the police. In the first 9 months, 30 people
 died in "encounters" between police and Naxalites. The Andhra
 Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee charged that 20 of these
 deaths resulted from "official barbarism." The group
 requested Amnesty International (AI) to inquire into the
 deaths of students, youths, and tribals involved in such
 "encounters." In both Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, critics
 accused the police of staging fake "encounters" with
 terrorists to cover up deaths in police custody and of wrongly
 attributing causes of deaths in custody. The police rarely
 suffered casualties in these encounters. The victims were
 invariably killed, rather than wounded or captured.
 In western India, communal violence was reported in the states
 of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In riots in the
 
 
 1331
 INDIA
 Maharashtrian cities of Pune and Aurangabad, more than 20
 persons were killed when political parties, including the
 Congress (I), inflamed religious rivalries as a means of
 winning votes in a local election. Order was restored only by
 a large police contingent operating under "shoot on sight"
 orders. No preventive measures were taken in advance of these
 disturbances, even though the Maharashtra Chief Minister
 reportedly said the administration had "anticipated" the riots.
 Anti-Sikh violence broke out in Bidar, Karnataka, on September
 14. The Indian press reported that at least 6 Sikh students
 were killed, 35 students were missing, and Sikh homes and
 businesses were singled out for arson and looting.
 Law and order in the Indian system is primarily the
 responsibility of the various states. The quality, training,
 and evenhandedness of police vary from state to state, as does
 the willingness of authorities to restrain political
 violence. The decision whether to institute judicial
 proceedings in cases of politically related violence often
 appears itself to be heavily political.
 Al's review of 1987 human rights violations issued in August
 1988, stated that in some areas the Government ordered
 measures to maintain law and order in the face of violent
 opposition by armed groups. On the other hand, the report
 attributed police excesses, arbitrary arrest, and prolonged
 detention without trial to the removal of legal safeguards in
 security laws, and "official failure to clamp down on
 lawlessness by India's national and state security forces."
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearances in the state of Punjab remain hard
 to investigate, as access by independent observers is severely
 restricted. Several Indian public figures have said privately
 that a small number of Sikhs have disappeared while in police
 custody, but no first-hand information to support these
 statements is available.
 In the nearby state of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the whereabouts of
 journalist Umesh Dhobal, missing since March 25 after
 investigating the UP Government's liquor licensing practices,
 remains unknown. The journalist's family lodged a report with
 the police following his disappearance, but no action was
 taken. In October, following a petition to the Supreme Court,
 the UP Chief Minister agreed to order a Central Bureau of
 Investigation (CHI) inquiry into Dhobal's case.
 Two inquiries into separate incidents in May 1987 in Uttar
 Pradesh have yet to be completed, and no charges have been
 brought. In the first incident at Meerut, members of the
 Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), made up mostly of Hindus,
 arrested "several hundred" Muslim men and shot "several
 dozen." Thirty-two others who were arrested "disappeared."
 The next day, AI reports, 80 unarmed men, women, and children
 were killed indiscriminately by members of the PAC.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment or punishment are prohibited by
 law in India. Confessions or information extracted by force
 cannot, by law, be admitted in court, although, significantly,
 under a 1987 provision of the Terrorist and Disruptive
 
 
 1332
 INDIA
 Activities (Prevention) act (TADA), a confession made to a
 police officer is admissible in evidence, provided the police
 have "reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily."
 The frequent press accounts of police brutality against
 detainees in obtaining confessions have fed widespread charges
 of police excesses.
 Throughout 1988, the press and human rights groups continued
 to report allegations of abuse of prisoners and suspects by
 police in many Indian states. Several cases of death in
 detention were publicized in Kerala. Persons under arrest
 reportedly died either from interrogation methods, or,
 according to police reports, committed suicide after
 interrogation.
 In the northeast, where ethnic and communal rivalries continue
 to fester, the police and paramilitary have been accused
 repeatedly of law enforcement excesses. Under the Armed
 Forces (special powers) Act in force in Nagaland, security
 personnel are not held legally accountable for their acts.
 Press reports of an offensive against insurgents in the Mon
 district in January described security forces encircling 2,000
 villagers and making arrests. The body of one of those
 arrested was returned the following day. The district
 superintendent of police reportedly confirmed that the victim
 had died under torture.
 In July the Home Minister confirmed that if any prima facie
 evidence of excessive or illegitimate use of force by a police
 officer was found, the delinquent officer would be liable for
 "severe punishment." However, few central Government or state
 inquiries were reportedly made into allegations of torture and
 rape of prisoners while in police custody. According to AI,
 in early 1988 compensation was paid to 60 of the Sikh
 detainees now in Jodhpur jail who had allegedly been tortured
 in Ladha Kothi jail, Sangrur, Punjab, between September 1984
 and January 1985. The Supreme Court set a July 1988 deadline
 for the completion of an inquiry into the conduct of the
 police officers involved, but no disciplinary action had been
 reported by year's end.
 In its review of 1987 human rights violations issued in
 August, AI expressed concern about reports of police torture
 and ill-treatment from many parts of India, resulting in
 dozens of deaths in custody. Many of the alleged victims
 belonged to the "scheduled" castes and tribes. There have
 been numerous claims of rape by the police of female members
 of these groups. However, even when pressure for an official
 inquiry is successful, further action reportedly is seldom
 taken. AI notes that no police officers were known to have
 been convicted of causing deaths in police custody.
 Press reports about prison conditions include charges of
 sexual abuse of prisoners, and the use of prisoners by prison
 officials for domestic labor. A petition was filed in the
 Supreme Court in 1985 on behalf of 1,400 children illegally
 detained in prison, all over India. By October 1988, the case
 had been adjourned 24 times and was still awaiting judgment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed
 of the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented
 by counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must
 
 
 INDIA
 either be remanded for further investigation or released.
 These provisions have been upheld by the Supreme Court and are
 generally respected. In Punjab, pursuant to the Disturbed
 Areas Legislation, arrest warrants are not required.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws in the event of threats to public welfare and national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 detention (up to 2 years) and for judicial review of such
 detention.
 The National Security Act (NSA) permits detention of security
 risks. To be released from detention under this law, a court
 must determine that all grounds for detention are invalid.
 The NSA was used in Punjab to place a number of persons in
 preventive detention following the imposition of President's
 rule in May 1987. Under NSA's strong special and preventive
 detention provisions, persons may be detained for up to 1 year
 (2 years in Punjab) without charge or trial on loosely defined
 security grounds but must be brought before an advisory board
 within 7 weeks of arrest, at which time the detainee may be
 released on the basis of "insufficient grounds.* Most of
 those detained under the NSA in Punjab have been released. On
 March 31, the Home Minister announced that 619 persons were
 detained under the NSA, of which 159 were in Punjab (compared
 to 109 in March 1987). Several hundred members of factions of
 the Akali Dal Party, including former chief minister S.S.
 Barnala, were detained under the NSA in May while peacefully
 demonstrating against the security forces' "Operation Black
 Thunder." In early June, 250 of these detainees were
 released, including Barnala. Other major Sikh political
 leaders remained in detention.
 Under the TADA, incommunicado detention is permitted. The
 TADA applies to a number of states, including Punjab and
 Gujarat. The Act permits maximum detention of 2 years, but
 provides the right of review and access to legal counsel. The
 Home Minister announced that, by March 1988, 2,681 persons had
 been arrested under the TADA in Punjab.
 Since then, 118 have been released on review or appeal. In
 Gujarat 2,289 persons were arrested under the TADA, many of
 them students and farmers protesting price increases and
 workers opposed to the contract labor system. Upon review,
 593 detainees were released.
 In March the 59th Amendment to the Constitution became law,
 permitting the Government to proclaim an emergency in Punjab
 on the grounds of "internal disturbance" and permitting
 President's rule for up to 3 years without prior parliamentary
 approval. The amendment annulled the 44th amendment, which
 protected the right to life and personal liberty even in an
 emergency. In its 1988 Report, AI concluded that the 59th
 Amendment would allow for contravention of the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a
 party, and could be used for large-scale arbitrary arrests and
 detention of persons expressing their opinions peacefully.
 The controversial civil rights provisions of the amendment
 have not yet been put into practice.
 Exile is not practiced as a punishment in India. With regard
 to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 1334
 INDIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for open trial in
 most cases but allows the judiciary, under certain
 circumstances, to hold closed proceedings. Such
 "circumstances" include proceedings involving official secrets
 or trials in which statements prejudicial to the safety of the
 State might be made. Sentences must, however, be announced in
 public.
 Generally, India's legal procedures assure a fair trial,
 although the process can be drawn out. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from an Indian bar that is fully
 independent of the Government. The Indian bar has a record of
 vigorously protesting infringements of human rights.
 Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of the judicial
 system.
 The judiciary is independent from the executive branch.
 Judges are selected by the Law Ministry following
 consultations with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
 Islamic religious law governs some noncriminal matters
 concerning Muslims, including divorce.
 The Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act (TAAA)
 permits the establishment of special courts sitting "in
 camera" and allows the identity of witnesses testifying before
 a special court to be kept secret. Under an unusual provision
 of the TAAA, a defendant charged with "waging war" carries the
 burden of proving his innocence, as in the case of the Jodhpur
 jail detainees. Civil rights groups charge that these special
 rules are contrary to the presumption of innocence customary
 in Indian law.
 In 1988 the judicial authorities in Punjab failed to bring to
 trial a number of alleged terrorists who had been charged, as
 well as some police offenders. Government officials claim
 they are unable to find witnesses to testify against
 terrorists.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches
 and seizures. In a criminal investigation, however, police
 may conduct searches without a warrant if obtaining a warrant
 would cause undue delay, but must justify such searches in
 writing. Under the Disturbed Areas Legislation, the
 authorities continue to have special powers in Punjab to
 search and arrest without a warrant and to shoot to kill under
 certain circumstances. They have also been granted a
 significant increase in telephone surveillance powers.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping of
 telephones and intercepting personal mail, is authorized "on
 the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of
 the public safety or tranquility." Censorship of mail is
 legal in certain circumstances, such a6 in a public emergency.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and expression are protected by the Constitution,
 and newspapers reflect a variety of political, social, and
 
 
 1335
 INDIA
 economic beliefs. The Government controls the allocation of
 newsprint, however, as well as the placement of government and
 public sector advertisements and has been accused of using
 these means to exert influence over the press. National
 television and radio, which are government monopolies, are
 frequently accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of
 the Government.
 The Government generally permits the print media to publish
 all but the most sensitive political and security stories,
 which come under the purview of an Official Secrets Act.
 Several major national publications published investigative
 reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press regularly champions human rights causes and criticizes
 perceived government lapses. A major event widely perceived
 as threatening press freedom was the Government's attempt in
 August-September to enact the Defamation Bill of 1988. The
 Government claimed that the Bill was necessary to prevent the
 press from slandering the reputation of citizens. It was
 passed by the lower house of Parliament but, following
 widespread, intense press and public pressure (including a
 September 6 nation-wide strike by nearly all journalists), the
 Government decided not to proceed. The measure's critics
 charged it would hamper investigative reporting, shift the
 burden of proof to the accused journalist, enforce stiff
 penalties of up to 5 years in jail, enable trials to be
 conducted "in camera," and force the mandatory presence of the
 accused throughout all defamation court proceedings.
 The Government was also accused of harassment when it
 initially denied the Indian Express group of publications a
 facsimile circuit to transmit materials between its Madras and
 Bangalore offices. The Editors' Guild of India condemned the
 Government for its "politically motivated" action against the
 Indian Express group, which is a leading opponent of the
 Gandhi administration. The Government eventually allowed the
 circuit to be established. The Government's banning in
 October of a controversial book by a prominent expatriate
 Muslim author on the grounds'that it would inflame
 intercommunal relations gave rise to charges of censorship.
 Films are reviewed by a Film Censorship Board before being
 licensed for distribution. The Board deletes material deemed
 offensive to either public morals or to religious or communal
 sentiment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations. These rights are respected.
 Government authorities sometimes require permits and
 notification prior to holding parades and demonstrations. At
 times of civil tension, local governments can ban public
 assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily, local governments
 respect the right to protest peacefully, including such
 traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which an
 office is surrounded by protesters who allow nobody to enter
 or leave, and sitdowns blocking public thoroughfares.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state in which all religious groups have
 the right to worship freely. Government policy does not favor
 any religious group, but communal tensions based on religious
 
 
 1336
 INDIA
 differences continue to be a social problem and pose
 challenges to the secular nature of the Indian polity.
 There is no bar to proselytizing by Indian Christians, but the
 Government limits the number of foreign missionaries. In
 Bihar confrontations have persisted between Christian
 missionaries and Hindu fundamentalists. Indian religious
 organizations may maintain communications with coreligionists
 abroad. Financial contributions from abroad are subject to
 scrutiny and licensing by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
 Despite acts in various states pertaining to the removal of
 obstructions to the exercise of religious freedom, Harijans
 (scheduled castes) are still prevented from entering Hindu
 temples in some areas. In June police in Rajasthan arrested a
 protest leader who attempted to defy the ban on the entry of
 Harijans into Hindu temples. The All-India Harijan League
 appealed to the Supreme Court July 14 to take action against a
 local religious leader who openly opposed the right of
 Harijans to enter Hindu temples.
 Generally, the Government has been careful to avoid placing
 restrictions on Sikh religious practices or on the management
 of Sikh places of worship. However, in May the Government
 promulgated an ordinance making it an offense to use any
 religious sites for political purposes. This Religious
 Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Ordinance also prohibits
 the use of temples for harboring persons accused or convicted
 of any crime. While designed specifically to deal with the
 Sikh places of worship in Punjab, the ordinance technically
 applies to all religious sites.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the
 country, except in certain border areas where, for security
 reasons, special permits are required. Foreign travel and
 emigration are without political restrictions. Millions of
 people of Indian origin live abroad. Foreigners (including
 diplomats) must obtain special permission to visit Punjab and
 Assam and are prohibited from visiting other sensitive border
 areas. Foreign journalists accredited to India may travel to
 Punjab without prior permission.
 India admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons at
 the time of partition in 1947 and granted them citizenship,
 integrating them fully into Indian society. Subsequent
 migration has largely been the result of upheavals in nearby
 countries, and some of the refugees in these migrations have
 not been granted citizenship or been fully integrated. In
 some cases, both the refugees and their hosts consider their
 stay temporary, although it may be for a long time.
 The most recent migrations have been of Bangladeshi Chakmas
 (estimated as high as 50,000 persons) into northeastern states
 and Tamils from Sri Lanka into Tamil Nadu. The Assam state
 government is committed to identifying "foreigners" who have
 entered that state with a view towards repatriating them,
 though almost none have been forced to leave. Tamils from Sri
 Lanka in Tamil Nadu are provided shelter and subsistence by
 the Government. The 1987 accord between India and Sri Lanka,
 aimed at settling the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, calls for
 repatriation of these refugees, and that repa4riation is under
 way.
 
 
 1337
 INDIA
 Several thousand Afghans have entered India since the Soviet
 invasion in 1979. Many have been resettled elsewhere, but
 nearly 5,000 currently are being protected and assisted by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 In addition, nearly 2,000 Iranian refugees are under the
 UNHCR's protection. Many were studying in India when the
 Iranian revolution came, but most had either arrived from Iran
 on tourist visas or fled on fraudulent documents to join
 Zorastrian, Baha'i, or Christian communities in India.
 Although India is not a signatory to the U.N. Convention and
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Government
 allows the UNHCR to operate normally, grants the refugees
 renewable residence permits, and otherwise behaves as a
 signatory; In 1988 there were no cases of forcible
 repatriation.
 India continues to provide humanitarian assistance and
 protection, to the large and vigorous Tibetan refugee
 communities in Dharamsala and elsewhere in India.
 The Government announced in October that strict instructions
 had been given to Indian troops on the Burma border not to
 turn away Burmese refugees. On October 25, the External
 Affairs Minister announced that 182 Burmese refugees had been
 allowed entry into India.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India is governed under a complicated but democratic
 parliamentary system. The Constitution provides for full
 adult suffrage. Elections are held regularly, involving
 multiple parties. A parliament can be constituted for not
 more than 5 years, except under constitutionally defined
 emergency situations. New parliamentary elections are due by
 the end of 1989.
 On the advice of the Prime Mihister, the President can declare
 President's rule, or a state of emergency, in any state in the
 event of: war, external oppression, internal disruption,
 collapse of the constitutional machinery in any state, or
 financial breakdown of the central or any state government.
 Under Presiderrt's rule, the central Government, through the
 Parliament and the President, directly controls the state by
 replacing the elected state government. At the present time,
 four provinces are under President's rule: Punjab, Tamil Nadu,
 Mizoram, and Nagaland.
 There are no legal barriers to female candidates for public
 office. India had a woman 2rime Minister, the late Indira
 Gandhi, who was Prime Minister from 1968 to 1977 and from 1979
 to 1984. Eight percent of legislators in the lower house of
 Parliament are women, and women legislators make up 3 to 4
 percent of state assemblies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The central Government, while tolerant of dissent within
 India, is sensitive to international allegations of human
 rights violations. AI representatives were denied permission
 to investigate human rights problems in the Punjab in 1988.
 AI's report, "India: A Review of Human Rights Violations,"
 
 
 1338
 INDIA
 criticized antiterrorist and preventive detention laws, under
 which it stated several thousand political detainees have been
 held without charge or trial, including hundreds of Sikhs in
 Jodhpur jail since 1984. The review urged the Government to
 restore legal safeguards, take steps to prevent torture and
 deaths in custody, and undertake impartial investigations into
 cases of illegal police actions. A government spokesman
 responded that most specific charges of human rights
 violations had proved to be baseless, adding that wherever
 charges had been proved, exemplary action had been taken
 against the guilty.
 Independent Indian human rights organizations are active and
 vocal. They include Citizens for Democracy, the People's
 Union for Civil Liberties and the People's Union for
 Democratic Rights, all of which send out teams to study
 specific allegations of human rights abuses. The Indian
 People's Human Rights Commission, formed in 1987, consists of
 jurists and human rights activists from all over India. The
 Commission set up a tribunal, with 11 ex-judges of the Supreme
 Court and high courts on the panel, to take up cases which
 appear to involve major violations of human rights by the
 State. A report on the first case taken up by the tribunal,
 on the 1986 massacre at Arwal, Bihar, was published in early
 1988. The report concluded that the police killing of 21
 people in this incident was indiscriminate, unnecessary, and
 unjustified. The tribunal made recommendations to prevent
 future recurrences of such incidents. There is no evidence of
 any action by the Government on these recommendations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Several provisions in the Constitution work in favor of women;
 however, deeply rooted traditions, in many cases tied to
 religious practice, tend to act against constitutional
 guarantees of equality. Since independence, women have been
 prominent in the fields of public service, medicine, and law
 although their numbers have remained small.
 The Government has under consideration a Draft National
 Perspectives Plan for Women: 1988-2000, whose main objective
 would be to remove gender bias in the law. The plan contains
 a proposal to reserve 30 percent of the seats in the
 Parliament, state assemblies, and local bodies for women;
 recommends more emphasis on the training of women; and
 includes recommendations on matrimonial property issues. No
 extra expenditure is envisaged to implement the plan, which
 has been a controversial subject among women's organizations.
 There is legally sanctioned discrimination against women
 manifested in various family, marriage, and inheritance laws.
 Females suffer a higher mortality, particularly in the 0-5 age
 group, resulting in an adverse and declining'ratio of 933
 females per 1,000 males, which may also be due, at least in
 part, to discriminatory attitudes. Female literacy is
 substantially lower than the national average of over 40
 percent. While school enrollmdnt of boys at the primary level
 has achieved near universality, only two-thirds to
 three-quarters as many girls attend primary schools.
 The midyear government report by the National Commission on
 Self-employed Women stated that 94 percent of Indian women
 work in the unorganized sector, i.e., a sector not controlled
 by labor laws. In spite of a statutory minimum wage fixed in
 
 
 1339
 INDIA
 each state, contractors set their own lower wage when
 employing woiqen, even though one-third of all households are
 supported solely by women, while in another third, they make
 50 percent of the financial contribution.
 These factors underscore the traditionally low economic and
 social value placed upon females, resulting in neglect of
 their nutritional, health, and educational needs.
 In recent years, attention has been focused on the incidence
 of "dowry death," i.e., deaths under suspicious circumstances
 of women unable to provide the additional goods demanded by
 their husband's family after marriage. Despite the
 strengthening in 1986 of the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961,
 the number of dowry victims increased in 1988. In August the
 Home Minister told the upper house that in Uttar Pradesh alone
 553 cases of dowry deaths (mostly by burning) were reported in
 1987. In the first 4 months of 1988, 291 dowry deaths had
 already been reported in Uttar Pradesh. The number of dowry
 deaths in West Bengal has also reportedly increased
 dramatically. From January to June 1988, 675 cases were
 reported, compared to 254 during the same period in 1987.
 Police officials said the cases were concentrated in the
 district of Midhapore. By law, every unnatural death of a
 woman in the first 7 years of marriage must be investigated by
 the police and a magistrate. Despite these measures, almost
 no one has been convicted of causing a dowry death-
 Sati, the practice of self-immolation by widows, has long been
 illegal in India. Following the sati7 of a young widow in
 Rajasthan in 1987, the state government strengthened an
 ordinance against abetting and glorification of the practice.
 This, combined with the central Government's Commission of
 Sati (Prevention) Act which became law in January, has had
 some effect in discouraging the glorification of such acts.
 According to press reports, the practice of branding women as
 witches still exists in some parts of the country. In the
 Singhbhum district of Bihar,'an estimated 200 women a year are
 labeled as witches and publicly killed. Many more are driven
 out of their villages to fend for themselves in local forests
 with poor chances of survival. The police reportedly justify
 their noninterference by claiming they can do nothing against
 deep-rooted, traditional superstition.
 The Government has initiated programs to improve the lot of
 the lower-caste Hindus who make up 15 percent of the
 population. The reservation system, whereby lower castes
 ("scheduled castes", "scheduled tribes," and "other backward
 communities") are offered preference in areas of empIoyment
 and admissions to educational institutions, attempts to
 further strengthen the legal protection accorded to these
 underprivileged and often victimized groups. The system has
 met with limited success. In some cases, higher-caste
 communities have mobilized against improving conditions for
 the disadvantaged, with violence sometimes resulting.
 Political controversy surrounds the question of which lower
 castes, tribes, and classes should be given preference in
 education, employment, and housing, when the program is
 perceived as threatening the economic position of higher-caste
 groups. In several states, the system of reservations for
 disadvantaged groups is manipulated for political gain by
 local party leaders.

 INDIA
 Minority religious groups continued to charge that they are
 victims of discrimination. Terrorist actions have increased
 violence and distrust between Hindu and Sikh communities.
 Although they are treated equally under the law, Sikhs,
 particularly young males, continue to be subjected to more
 rigorous security precautions than others in certain
 circumstances, e.g., airport security.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Indian workers and employers have the full constitutional
 right of association as defined by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). Confederations of both employer
 organizations and trade unions exist. Trade unions have the
 legally protected right to strike. Unions represent less than
 25 percent of the total of industrial workers but about 50
 percent of industrial workers in the "modern" sector. Most
 Indian workers (estimated at over 70 percent) are in the
 agricultural sector, traditionally unorganized, although
 recently trade unions have begun organizing efforts in that
 sector as well. Most Indian trade unions have some form of
 ties to a political party, national or local. Nevertheless,
 trade unions are usually adamant about preserving their formal
 independence from political parties, and in practice they have
 been known to differ from their respective political parties
 on labor-related issues. Major trade union organizations are
 affiliated with recognized international confederations, such
 as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and
 regularly participate in conferences of the ILO. The ILO
 maintains an office in New Delhi and on occasion complaints
 are filed there--often by Communist unions--alleging
 violations of ILO standards. The Government cooperates in the
 investigation of such complaints.
 Workers enjoy the right to strike in principle but, under the
 Essential Services Maintenance Act, the Government can ban
 strikes and require conciliation or arbitration in specified
 essential industries. Legal mechanisms exist for challenging
 the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope of
 this Act.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize (including protection against antiunion
 discrimination) and to bargain collectively has existed in
 Indian law for decades. Trade unions carry out these
 activities independently and without government or, in
 general, employer attempts to interfere. Police and judicial
 authorities are generally quick to protect peaceful union
 activities.
 In addition to the availability of normal civil and criminal
 courts, a system of specialized labor courts exists to hear
 and adjudicate labor-related complaints. New legislation
 seeking to modernize and streamline the bargaining process and
 the internal organization of unions was introduced in the
 Parliament in 1988 but, pending consultations with trade union
 and employer organizations, it was not acted upon by year's
 end.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of reaching
 industrial relations agreements and settling disputes, and
 trade unions are usually vigorous in defending worker
 
 
 1341
 INDIA
 interests in this process. Where collective bargaining fails
 to establish locally equitable wage levels, the Government may
 set up tripartite boards, i.e., including trade union
 representation, to determine them. Export processing zones
 exist at several locations in India but are not particularly
 active at the present time. Physical access to such zones is
 ordinarily limited, even to union organizers, and unions do
 not appear to be active within them.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Indian Constitution, and
 legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of
 "bonded labor." A Supreme Court decision has defined "forced
 labor" as~work at less than the minimum wage (minimum wages
 are usually set by the states, not the central Government).
 Under this unique definition, "forced labor" is widespread
 throughout India, particularly in rural areas. "Bonded
 labor," although illegal and actively opposed by the
 Government, also occurs among significant numbers of
 agricultural and construction workers. It is the result of a
 private, contractual relationship whereby a worker incurs or
 inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the
 debt, plus extensive interest. Since most of these workers
 are illiterate, these bonds may continue indefinitely
 (especially if the contractor lends them subsequent small
 amounts "an account").
 The Government estimates that, based on reports from the
 states as of March 31, there were 235,670 bonded workers in
 the country, of whom about 60,000 had been "rehabilitated" by
 government authorities. The Gandhi Peace Foundation, however,
 estimates the number at 10 times the government figure.
 Private and'political critics say that government efforts to
 free workers from their bonds are inadequate and rarely
 lasting. Private social organizations, such as the Council
 for Advancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Technology
 (CAPART), and some trade unions are active in identifying
 cases of bondage and pursuing them with relevant (usually
 state) officials. Even with better coordination and greatly
 increased resources to overcome the complicated jurisdictional
 division between the state governments and the central
 Government, the eradication of bonded labor is likely to be
 slow.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 It has been estimated that one-quarter of the world's child
 labor is attributable to India, where poverty and the lack of
 compulsory education make it an especially serious problem.
 According to a Labor Ministry survey, 1 out of 4 Indian
 children between the ages of 5 and 15 is working. Government
 statistics put the total at 17.5 million in 1985.
 In 1986 legislation passed both houses of Parliament to ban
 the employment of children in hazardous occupations and
 regulate their employment in others, and in 1987 the Labor
 Ministry announced a crackdown in 10 of the most blatantly
 abused sectors. In 1988 the Parliament's Public Accounts
 Committee requested the Government to consult with outside
 experts to set up educational programs for child workers and
 to change parental attitudes, to carry out "exemplary
 punishment" of erring employers, and to harmonize the various
 existing legislative controls on the practice. A Small Child
 Labor Division within the Labor Ministry has been created.
 
 
 1342
 INDIA
 Nevertheless, progress has been slow. Some employers of child
 labor have been openly defiant about continuation of the
 practice, and resisted attempts by the Labor Ministry at
 enforcement. As in the case of bonded labor, the central
 Government often points to the division of jurisdiction
 between the state governments and the central Government in
 dealing with the practice, and urges private organizations
 (including trade unions) to do more. Although almost all
 child labor abuses occur in sectors outside the traditional
 reach of labor organizations, trade unions have recently
 become more active in this field, often concentrating on
 "consciousness-raising" among women workers who work alongside
 their children. Despite all these efforts, enforcement of
 existing law appears inadequate to cope with the dimensions of
 the problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour
 workweek, and various standards for working conditions. These
 standards are generally enforced and accepted (indeed,
 improved upon by various enlightened employers and aggressive
 unions) in the modern industrial sectors, but are less often
 observed in older, smaller, and less economically robust
 industries.
 Occupational safety and health measures also vary widely,
 although this is an area in which both government and trade
 unions have become more active. Governmental resources
 devoted to inspection and enforcement of standards are
 generally recognized Lo be inadequate. While the basic wage
 varies according to the state and sector of industry, most
 "organized" workers receive much more than the minimum wage,
 especially when legislatively mandated bonuses and other
 benefits are included.
