 ITALY
 Italy is a functioning, democratic, multi-party republic with a
 parliamentary  system  of government based on a constitution
 approved  in   1947.   Legislative   power  is  vested   in  the
 Parliament, which is directly and freely elected on a basis of
 universal adult suffrage.   Executive authority is concentrated
 in  the   Council  of  Ministers.    Italy  has  an  independent
 judiciary. The chief of state, the President, is elected by the
 Parliament. Since 1947, the Christian Democratic Party has been
 the dominant party of government, though it has ordinarily ruled
 in coalition with one or more smaller parties. In 1983, for the
 first time since World War II, a Socialist Prime Minister,
 Bettino Craxi, took office.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the top
 10 in   the world   in gross national product     (GNP).  It  is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors, and by a dynamic private sector, especially
 at the level of small- and medium-sized companies.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly  influenced by Roman Catholic and social democratic
 traditions.   The Constitution contains strong guarantees of
 political and civil rights, which are rigorously observed in
 practice.
 Serious terrorist violence of both the right and left continued
 to decline over the period 1982-1983 through the effective work
 of police   and  magistrates.   While  terrorism has not    been
 completely defeated, the successes of the past two years have
 freed more law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which continues to be a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were three confirmed terrorist killings in Italy in 1983,
 which was a marked decline over the previous year.    Terrorists
 of both the left and right had hoped to provoke the military and
 police into imposing extreme security measures, the left-wing
 terrorists believing that this in turn would radicalize less
 extreme elements of the Italian left. This strategy has failed,
 in large measure due to the care and moderation with which the
 Government  and  law   enforcement  agencies have  utilized  the
 special powers granted them for dealing with the terrorist
 threat.  There are indications that various domestic terrorists
 have   received   some   support  from   outside   the  country,
 particularly from extremist Palestinian groups and Libya, and
 there are continuing allegations of direct or indirect East
 European   support.    Foreign   terrorist   organizations  have
 occasionally been active in Italy. There has been one attempted
 murder in 1983 in which the involvement of foreign terrorists
 has been confirmed. Organized criminal elements are presumed to
 be responsible for a majority of the killings which take place
 in Sicily and the Naples area.    In 1983, 78 murders had been
 linked definitely   to the Sicilian Mafia or the Neapolitan
 Camorra.  There are numerous other cases where the involvement
 of organized crime is suspected. Most noted was the car-bomb
 
 (1034)
 
 
 1035
 assassination in Palermo of Chief Investigating Magistrate Rocco
 Chinnici, his two body guards, and a bystander. The Government
 has appointed a High Commissioner with special powers to lead
 the fight against the Mafia. More recently, further steps have
 been proposed to improve coordination of the various agencies
 involved  in  the   struggle  against organized   crime  and  to
 centralize the anti-Mafia command structure.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of disappearance in Italy linked to or
 condoned by the state or its agents. The number of kidnappings
 by political terrorist groups declined dramatically in 1983, but
 did not stop entirely.     An apparently foreign group claimed
 responsibility for the June disappearance of a teenage Italian
 girl, Emanuela Orlandi.   The group called for the release from
 prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, who is serving a life sentence for
 the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981. Ms.
 Orlandi is still missing.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom  from   torture  is  guaranteed  by  law  and   generally
 respected in practice, although Amnesty International's 1983
 report indicated that it had received an increased number of
 allegations of torture and mistreatment of prisoners in Italian
 jails during 1982.    In July, 1983, four members of Italy's
 special antiterrorist police    were  sentenced  to  prison  for
 allegedly using force to extract information from terrorist
 suspects.   The  sentence  is   now  under  appeal.   Cruel  and
 degrading treatment or punishment is forbidden by law and is not
 practiced by governmental officials.   Conditions of confinement
 vary and some places of detention are outdated and crowded, but
 not inhumane or degrading.    Prisoners charged or convicted of
 terrorist acts are generally separated from ordinary criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight, and arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours. Habeas corpus does not exist under Italian law; however,
 as a further safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribunals" were
 recently  introduced   into  the  judicial   system.   They  are
 empowered to review available evidence in cases of persons
 awaiting trial and to decide whether continued detention is
 warranted.  In normal criminal cases, the duration of pre-trial
 detention permitted varies according to the gravity of the
 crime.  Such detention may extend up to three years before the
 initial trial, and theoretically may be extended up to three
 times that long under certain circumstances.   Detention through
 appellate procedures may theoretically extend for up to 10 years
 before a final verdict is rendered. At present there are over
 20,000 people in preventive detention awaiting trial.
 A  number  of private   human   rights organizations,   including
 Amnesty International, have expressed concern over the length of
 time spent in detention by persons charged in cases involving
 political terrorism. Attention was focused on the issue in 1983
 through the case of Professor Antonio Negri. Negri was arrested
 in April 1979 and charged with abetting armed insurrection and
 
 
 1036
 involvement in a number of specific acts of terrorism.       His
 trial, along with    that of   some 68 codefendants, underwent
 several postponements, at the request of both the prosecution
 and of the defense.    In June 1983, while still in preventive
 detention, Negri was elected to Parliament as a candidate of the
 Italian Radical Party, and thus released.      The radicals had
 putforward Negri's candidacy    as a protest    against  lengthy
 periods of pretrial detention in terrorist cases.    The Italian
 Parliament subsequently   stripped Negri of his parliamentary
 immunity from prosecution and ordered that he be reincarcerated
 pending trial. Negri has since gone into hiding and is believed
 to be outside Italy.
 In light of expressions of concern over the length of preventive
 detention, the Italian Government in September 1983 proposed to
 Parliament a reform of regulations governing the judiciary. The
 new measure would, among other provisions, reduce the maximum
 period   of  pre-trial   detention   allowable,   assure  faster
 processing of cases by reducing the case load on overworked
 magistrates, and allow for a more liberal policy on the granting
 of bail in certain cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is assured by law and observed in practice.
 Counsel for the accused     is mandatory and provided free if
 necessary.  The judiciary is independent of the executive, and
 there are no political or security courts.     All cases may be
 appealed  to   the  highest   appellate  court,  the   Court  of
 Cassation.  There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In  Italy  the concept of privacy     of  the home   is  legally
 safeguarded and generally respected by the authorities.      For
 example, searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out
 only   under   judicial  warrant   and   in  carefully   defined
 circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free  speech  and   a  free  press  are  assured  under  Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows full play for a wide
 spectrum of political views.   Although there is no censorship,
 publications may be seized for violation of obscenity laws or
 for   defamation   of  state   institutions   or  political   or
 ecclesiastical  leaders.   These   powers  are  seldom  invoked.
 Government-run radio and television are open to widely differing
 views, and there are a large number of private broadcasters who
 air vigorous debate on political and social topics.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens' right to free assembly is curtailed only in
 cases where security or public safety is endangered. Unions are
 not government-controlled, and their rights to organize, engage
 in collective bargaining, and strike are fully protected. They
 associate with international labor bodies freely and without
 interference.  According to figures published by Italian trade
 union organizations, almost half the labor force is unionized.
 
 
 1037
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed by
 the  Lateran  Pact  of   1929,  which  guarantees  the  Church's
 independence  and   sovereignty  in   religious   affairs.   The
 preeminent position of the Roman Catholic Church is enhanced by
 the facts that the Vatican is located within Italy and that the
 overwhelming majority of Italians are Catholic.    Nevertheless*
 all religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 limits imposed by the laws governing public order.  Individuals
 may profess and practice any religious faith.      Adherence or
 non-adherence to a particular faith does not confer special
 advantages or disadvantages.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad.  Emigration is unrestricted.    Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed their right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship.   Italy has been a haven for many
 persons fleeing persecution in their countries. There have been
 no cases of forced repatriation of political refugees in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Italy  is ruled democratically    under  its free parliamentary
 system.   Although  the  Fascist   Party  is  outlawed   by  the
 Constitution, there exists a wide range of organized and active
 political parties, from the far left of the political spectrum
 to the far right.    Election campaigns are free and open, and
 voting is by secret ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and
 regional, provincial, municipal, and ward councils are elected
 periodically.  Opposition groups are active and are frequently
 able to alter or reject government policies.     The regions of
 Trentino-Alto Adige and Val D'Aosta are organized
 under special statutes aimed at safeguarding the rights of their
 respective German- and French-speaking minorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The   Italian  Government  and   non-governmental  human  rights
 organizations support human rights throughout the world.   Italy
 participates fully in international human rights organizations.
 Non-governmental   organizations   are   free   to    investigate
 conditions in Italy and to publish their findings, as well as to
 attend trials and carry     out related   activities.  Political
 parties and religious groups participate in activities related
 to human rights.    Amnesty International has five offices in
 Italy.    Other  prominent   organizations   are   the  official
 Interministerial Committee for the Rights of Man, the Italian
 Consultative Committee for the Rights of Man, the Institute of
 Human Rights, and Caritas International.
 Amnesty  International's  1983  report  listed  several  serious
 concerns with   Italy, including   the delay   in trying people
 accused  of   "politically-motivated"  crimes,  imprisonment  of
 conscientious objectors, and    an  increase  in allegations of
 torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.     Freedom House calls
 Italy "free."
 
 
 1038
 ECOIOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATIOII
 The Government provides special funds for investment in southern
 Italy, whose development, for historical reasons, has been
 slower  than  that  of   the  north.   Despite  this historical
 distortion, education and economic and     social services are
 becoming available to all without invidious discrimination of
 any kind. As a country possessing an industrial market economy,
 Italy encourages the ownership of property alone as well as in
 association with others.    Italy is a prosperous, relatively
 developed country with a healthy population numbering 57,630,000
 (1982).   The growth   rate  in  1981 was   0.7 percent.    Life
 expectancy at birth was 73.4 years and the infant mortality rate
 per 1,000 live births was 14.3 in 1981. The adult literacy rate
 ws 98 percent in 1976. Primary school enrollment ratio was 102
 percent (1979).   The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 136 percent
 (1977). The per capita G14P in 1980 was $6,487,10.
 Women have equal status under the law, but they remain
 engaged in the continuing effort to maintain and strengthen
 their rights. Women participate freely in social and political
 life and continue to expand their economic role, although they
 are under-represented in the professions and management. There
 are traditional legal limitations on women's property rights
 within marriage, which derive from traditional Italian social
 values.   Strong private-sector demand    for  female labor has
 ensured a very low level of unemployment among women.      Women
 constitute about 27 percent of the labor force. Public economic
 and social services are extended on a nondiscriminatory basis.
