 LESOTHO
 Lesotho has lacked written legal guarantees of
 human rights since the suspension of its constitution
 in 1970, four years after it gained its independence
 from Great Britain. Respect for human rights has
 been undermined by continuing political turmoil and
 the'government's occasionally heavy-handed suppression
 of it. During the periods of greatest turbulence in
 1970 and 1974, several hundred persons were killed in
 incidents of protest against the regime, and Great
 Britain temporarily suspended its program of budget
 support until order could be restored. In August 1975
 Catholic and Protestant clergymen endorsed a nationwide
 interdenominational sermon deploring the deprivation
 of the Lesotho people of "their basic human rights."
 Since then, however, while continuing to curtail
 political and civil liberties, the government has
 shown increasing respect for the integrity of the
 person and has made an effort to improve the living
 standards of its poorest citizens. Instances of abuse
 of human rights of all kinds have declined as the
 regime has come to feel more secure, as foreign
 policy problems have diverted attention from domestic
 dissatisfaction, and as the nation's-energies
 are increasingly absorbed by the problems of assuring
 economic viability and providing basic needs.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Isolated instances of torture are believed to have
 taken place during the periods of political turbulence
 referred to above. During the last two years no such
 incidents have been alleged.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 During the last two years no instances of treatment
 or punishment of this kind have been alleged.
 
 
 c. Arbitrary-Arrest or Imprisonment
 Opponents of the regime face the possibility of
 arbitrary arrest and detention for renewable
 periods of sixty days without charge under
 emergency security legislation adopted in 1974.
 While this act has been freely used in the past,,
 no persons are thought to be currently detained
 under its provisions.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No trial is accorded to persons detained under
 the emergency security legislation referred to
 above. However, the judiciary in Lesotho has
 remained largely independent and will for the most
 part accord a fair public trial to persons whose
 cases are brought to the courts. Opposition
 leaders-who were imprisoned following the 1974
 attempt to overthrow the government received
 a full, public judicial hearing and were defended
 by legal counsel of their choice. None received
 the death sentence and several of the sentences.
 were successfully appealed to courts of review.
 On the tenth anniversary of Lesotho's independence
 in 1976 a general amnesty was proclaimed for many
 of these imprisoned leaders. Some 26 who were-not
 included in the amnesty still remain in prison.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Despite the continued existence of legal provisions
 for detention without charge, arbitrary invasion
 of the home has not been a significant problem
 during the last two years.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 One of the poorest countries in Africa, Lesotho is
 largely dependent on foreign assistance to improve
 the economic welfare of its people. Its record in
 addressing itself to the needs of its poorest
 
 
 62
 citizens has been good. However, in the central
 area of relations with South Africai its economic
 needs conflict with its political priorities.
 Prior to 1977, the government focused on economic
 development and the use of donor assistance to
 meet the needs of its rural poor in areas such as
 agriculture, health and education. In 1977,
 following increased friction with South Africa,
 Lesotho shifted to a policy of emphasizing self-
 sufficiency and economic independence from South
 Africa rather than development per se. The new
 policy implies greater attention to politically
 rather than economically motivated projects with
 the consequent danger of a lessened emphasis on
 attention to the needs of the poor. However, the
 government continues to stress a desire to commit
 the largest part of donor assistance to projects
 which will benefit the rural poor majority.
 While corruption exists in Lesotho, it has not been
 a major problem or diverted significant resources
 away from the poor into the hands of a small elite.
 Lesotho government officials do not set individual
 examples of ostentatious consumption or corruption.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Lesotho is free of restrictionb on thought and
 religion. The radio and most printed media are
 government controlled. However, there are some
 small independent newspapers which are occasionally
 critical of government policies. Unrestricted labor
 organization and activity are not permitted, but a
 trade union movement does exist and unions are
 allowed to bargain collectively with employers and
 enter into contracts. There are no legal guarantees
 of free speech, and in practice there are restrictions
 on freedom of speech. There are'sharp restrictions
 on freedom of assembly for purposes of political
 action.
 
 
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Until recently, there were few restrictions on travel
 and emigration. However, in December 1977 the
 government invalidated Lesotho passports for travel
 to Botswana in an effort to. gain greater control over
 dissidents, students and critics who might seek
 refuge in that country. On the other hand, Lesotho
 is giving strong consideration to acceding to the
 1951 Convention on Refugees and its 1967 Protocol,
 and welcomes refugees from other nations into its
 own country. There are no restrictions on domestic
 travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Political rights have been sharply restricted by the
 present government, which came to power in 1970
 through a coup d'etat following its unexpected defeat
 in free elections.   Charging election irregularities
 and the threat of communist-inspired subversion,
 Prime Minister Jonathan suspended the constitution,
 dissolved Parliament, nullified the elections
 and declared a state of emergency under which he
 ruled by decree until April 1975. Since that time an
 appointed National Assembly, which includes some
 representatives from the opposition, has acted as an
 interim legislative branch. Despite agitation, no
 plans have been announced for elections, and the
 Prime Minister recently stated that none were contem-
 plated.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Lesotho has not tried to cover up
 the violations of human rights that have occurred,
 and is willing to discuss past excesses openly. Most
 government officials believe the human rights
 
 
 64
 violations were unfortunate but necessary to maintain
 law and order during situations threatening civil
 war. The government has allowed outside investi-
 gation of alleged human rights violations. An
 Amnesty International representative attended the
 trials of the persons charged as a result of the
 January 1974 counter-coup attempt and provided relief
 assistance to the families of the imprisoned.
 Amnesty International protested the January 1976
 re-detention of former opposition leader Kolisang,
 who had just been released from 60 days imprisonment.
 He was given a final release shortly thereafter.
