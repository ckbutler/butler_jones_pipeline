 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, an army colonel who came to power in
 1976 through a bloodless coup. The role of the military in
 the Government is still influential but has steadily declined
 in day-to-day governance as Bagaza has appointed civilians to
 most key government positions. The National Party for Unity
 and Progress (UPRONA) is the only signficant political entity
 in Burundi. As head of the party and the Government,
 President Bagaza has a dominant policy role. He also has
 certain decree powers and appoints and dismisses judges. The
 dominance of the minority Tutsi over the majority Hutu ethnic
 group is the central political and social reality of Burundi
 which continues today through Tutsi control of emerging
 political institutions and the military. However, Bagaza has
 instituted a policy of tribal reconciliation and has appointed
 Hutus to all levels of government, which reflects an
 improvement in representation in the Government over past
 years.
 The armed forces maintain law and order. In addition, there
 is a regular police force responsible for civil and criminal
 offenses and a separate force of security police responsible
 primarily for internal state security, including the
 monitoring of dissent. The State Security Police have the
 same powers of arrest as the regular police and are subject to
 the same process of judicial review of detentions.
 Burundi is a very poor country with one of the highest
 population densities in Africa. Most Burundi earn their
 livelihood as subsistence farmers working small, privately
 owned plots. The small monetary economy is based on coffee,
 which accounts for 85 percent of foreign exchange. Recent
 gains made in food production and agriculture have been
 largely offset by the high population growth rate.
 Although there were some positive developments in the human
 rights scene in Burundi in 1986, the overall picture was
 clouded by the Government's intensified crackdown on freedom
 of religion. The Government seized six Catholic seminaries
 and all the property attached to them, suspended the
 church-run literacy classes, and closed the church in one
 Catholic parish. In addition, there were new arrests of
 priests and catechists accused of criticizing the Government,
 and missionary expulsions intensified. The Government
 released 47 Seventh-Day Adventists who had been imprisoned for
 refusing to perform community work on Saturday mornings.
 However, later in the year, two other Adventists were arrested
 for the same reason.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no allegations of killings for political motives or
 reports of summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances caused by the Government or by other groups
 were reported. Prison authorities reportedly could not
 account for all persons who had been detained, but whether
 
 
 BURUNDI
 those unaccounted for died in prison, escaped, or were
 released remains to be determined.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but cruel treatment of suspects
 or detainees has occurred in the form of beatings at the time
 of arrest or interrogation. The Government admits that
 isolated instances of abuse of prisoners by prison guards or
 officials do occur but insists that those responsible for such
 abuses are punished when discovered. In fact, two ranking law
 enforcement officials were sentenced to 6-year prison terms in
 1986 for torturing a man to death during his interrogation.
 Prison conditions are severe due to overcrowding and lack of
 adequate hygiene, medical care, and food. Prisoners are
 segregated according to the nature of their crimes, are
 allowed regular family visits, and participate in
 rehabilitative work programs, including agricultural
 production. Due to inadequate prison budgets, food rations
 are very limited, and there have been several reports of
 deaths in prison from starvation. Families are encouraged and
 expected to provide supplemental food and other personal items
 to their imprisoned relatives. The Government admits that
 this is a serious problem in the prisons and it is trying to
 improve conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In theory, police officers are empowered to detain suspects
 without an arrest warrant but must submit a written report to
 the public prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public
 prosecutor examines the report and can either order the
 release of the detainee or issue an arrest warrant valid for
 5 days. The public prosecutor must then state the charges
 before a magistrate in the presence of the detainee. The
 magistrate either releases the detainee or issues orders
 confirming the detention, initially for 15 days and
 subsequently for 30-day periods as necessary to prepare the
 case for trial. Bail is set only in cases of embezzlement or
 similar crimes involving financial wrongdoing.
 However, the prescribed procedures for arrest and imprisonment
 are not always followed. The elapsed time between an arrest
 and the notification of the public prosecutor often extends to
 several days, and detainees do not always appear before a
 magistrate within the allotted 5 days from arrest. In most
 cases, a judicial review of the arrest usually takes place.
 Relatives or consular representatives are almost always made
 aware of arrests or detentions, generally at the time of
 incarceration, and detainees are usually permitted to go to
 their homes prior to being brought to the place of detention.
 The Government does not exile its nationals. Citizens of
 other countries suspected of criminal activity or lacking
 proper residency documents are expelled.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not permitted under current law,
 but most citizens are expected to perform community service on
 Saturdays.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary's independence is limited by the requirement to
 adhere to the guidance and recommendations of the party, the
 Government, and the President. Judges are appointed by and
 serve at the pleasure of the President. Nevertheless, there
 is a high degree of autonomy in the court's daily
 administration of justice, and a number of procedural
 safeguards are generally observed. Though court decisions
 cannot be overturned by the executive branch, the President
 has the power to pardon or reduce sentences.
 Burundi has separate court systems to deal with military,
 civil/criminal, and state security cases. Military tribunals
 have jurisdiction only over military personnel. The State
 Security Court has jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel, and its proceedings need not be made
 public. As of the end of 1986, this court had not been used.
 Burundi law provides the right to counsel, and indigents are
 provided defense counsel by the State. Pretrial proceedings
 may involve lengthy investigations. The public prosecutor's
 office generally dismisses cases where the evidence in support
 of the charges is weak and only proceeds to trial when it
 believes guilt has been established.
 During the past 6 years, the Government has taken steps to
 improve the judicial system, and the 1984 Party Congress
 recommended additional judicial reforms. New courts have been
 created, the number of magistrates has tripled, and training
 seminars and conferences have been held. Simultaneously,
 however, prison populations have doubled or tripled, and the
 courts are hampered by a lack of trained legal personnel and
 by heavy case loads. It is estimated that as many as half of
 those currently incarcerated have not been tried and
 sentenced. In the case of the 47 Adventists arrested for
 refusing to perform community work on Saturday mornings, none
 ever appeared before a magistrate.
 At the end of 1986, there were at least five political
 prisoners and a number of political detainees in Burundi. In
 late 1985, two priests and three lay people were tried for
 insulting the Chief of State in a tract criticizing the
 Government's attitude toward religion; they were found guilty
 and are serving sentences of up to 5 years in prison. Amnesty
 International's claim of up to 50 political prisoners in
 Burundi includes the 47 Adventists, who have since been
 released. However, since October 1986, a priest who
 criticized the Government and two Adventists who refused to
 perform Saturday work have been imprisoned without trial.
 Another priest who criticized the Government was arrested in
 late December. There are also former ministers, from
 President Micombero's regime, in prison for criticizing the
 Government's religious policy.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of private correspondence and of the home
 are guaranteed in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 A judicial warrant is required for a law enforcement official
 to enter and search a private residence.
 Membership in the major political party and its affiliated
 organizations is open to all but is not required. The State
 
 
 BURUNDI
 Security Office monitors political dissent through the State
 Security Police and by employing paid informers who report on
 discontent and dissension as well as on criminal activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is limited. Defamation of the Chief of
 State is a crime, and criticism of the party and government
 policies or leadership is only permitted within government
 institutions, such as the National Assembly and the UPRONA.
 Academic freedom is also limited. At the primary and
 secondary school level, teachers are expected to support
 government policies. At the university, professors come from
 several different countries and are permitted to lecture
 freely in their subject areas, conduct research, and draw
 independent conclusions. Censorship occurs only in the case
 of sexually explicit foreign film material or publications.
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media. The French language daily and Kirundi language weekly
 are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 media are required to support the fundamental policies of the
 party and the Government. Some criticism of the Government is
 permitted in the printed press, but journalists are state
 employees and are subject to disciplinary action if their
 criticism goes beyond what is considered tolerable. The
 Government rarely interferes with the distribution of foreign
 news publications and never interferes with radio reception
 from foreign sources.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The express authorization of the Government is required for
 all political meetings. This effectively guarantees
 government control of all public forums and limits association
 for political purposes to participation in the party or its
 affiliated youth, labor, or women's movements.
 The party controls the trade union confederation, the National
 Labor Union or UTB, and has enforced this single trade union
 structure by means of legislation. The principal role of the
 UTB, to which virtually the entire salaried work force
 belongs, is to serve as an intermediary between workers and
 employers in labor matters. The UTB arbitrates individual and
 collective labor disputes and often forces employers to revise
 their practices. However, unauthorized advocacy of a strike
 or lockout is a criminal offense. Therefore, though they are
 technically permissible, there have been no strikes in recent
 years. The UTB participates in the International Labor
 Organization and is a member of the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity. In 1986 the UTB held an extraordinary
 meeting to adopt its statutes, and the proceedings were
 relatively democratic.
 The Government permits nonpolitical private associations, but
 requires that they be registered and accorded legal
 recognition before they may function.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom exists within strictly defined limits, as
 the Government considers religious organizations subject to
 
 
 36
 BURUNDI
 the same sorts of rules and restrictions which apply to
 secular organizations. All religious associations must
 receive approval from the Government to operate in Burundi and
 are expected not to engage in political activity critical of
 the regime in power. The authorities must be informed in
 advance of religious gatherings, which are limited to
 recognized places of worship, and religious services are
 authorized only after 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, after
 midday on Saturday, and all day on Sundays. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses sect is banned by the Government because its
 doctrine allegedly challenges certain precepts of civil
 authority. Consequently, members of the sect cannot openly
 carry out activities within the faith nor can they
 proselytize. There are no reports of persons being imprisoned
 for merely adhering to the sect's beliefs. The Seventh-Day
 Adventists' refusal to perform work of any kind on Saturday,
 their Sabbath, led to the closing of their churches and
 schools as well as the loss of their legal status in 1985.
 Between December 1985 and May 1986, 47 Adventists were
 arrested for their failure to respect the Government
 requirement that Burundi citizens perform community service on
 Saturday mornings, and a number of women and children were
 detained for 3 days for participating in an unauthorized
 religious gathering. The 47 were released in June, but in
 October, 2 others were arrested for the same reason. Between
 8 and 10 other Christians were also arrested during 1986.
 They were generally held for refusing to respect government
 restrictions and were released after a few days or weeks;
 these included religious leaders and laymen. Two Catholic
 priests, arrested for criticizing the Government, remain in
 jail.
 Over 140 missionaries were expelled in 1985. After an initial
 cutback, the expulsions resumed in 1986, resulting in the
 departure of around 70 more missionaries. Believing that they
 could no longer provide adequate services, an equal number
 left voluntarily, so that by year's end fewer than 200 foreign
 missionaries remained in the country. Church schools and most
 seminaries were placed under state control in 1986, and
 clerics were generally relieved from teaching positions. In
 addition, church-run rural literacy classes were suspended,
 depriving approximately 300,000 Burundi children and adults of
 one of the few means of bettering themselves. Informed
 observers believe that the Government is actively reducing the
 influence of the Catholic Church in Burundi because of its
 desire to establish clearly its civil authority as preeminent
 over other sources of influence. Church access to the media
 is curtailed by the longstanding suspension of a Catholic
 newspaper and of religious broadcasts.
 There are no barriers to the maintenance of links with
 coreligionists in other countries. Religious beliefs do not
 exclude people from participation in the party or from
 receiving social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although government
 policies discourage urban migration. Foreign travel and
 emigration are relatively free. However, prospective Burundi
 travelers must have exit visas as well as passports.
 Occasionally, the Government withholds these documents without
 explanation but apparently for political motives. Foreigners
 
 
 37
 BURUNDI
 wishing to leave Burundi have also occasionally been denied
 exit visas until they prove they have no outstanding debts.
 Long-time foreign residents of all nationalities wishing to
 stay in Burundi, including some missionaries, are experiencing
 increasing difficulty in renewing their residence permits.
 The Government cooperates closely with the office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Burundi claims to shelter 262,000 refugees, but most are
 long-time residents who are now well assimilated and therefore
 might be described more accurately as displaced persons. The
 UNHCR estimates that there are approximately 70,000 refugees,
 primarily Tutsis of Rwandan origin who fled to Burundi in the
 1960's. Many are well integrated in Burundi, although they
 may acquire citizenship only through marriage to a Burundi
 citizen. Refugees who fled from Burundi in the early 1970's
 and before continue to return and have full rights as
 citizens. The Government periodically repatriates Rwandan
 nationals who lack residence permits or who have been arrested
 on suspicion of criminal activities.
 Amnesty International has expressed concern about the
 situations of refugees and asylum seekers from Zaire. About
 1,800 Zairians, allegedly without proper papers, were expelled
 to either Tanzania or Zaire in September 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burundi citizens do not have the right to change their
 government. Political participation can take place only
 within the one-party structure, and voters can express
 dissatisfaction only by voting against incumbents. The
 President of the party is the sole candidate for President of
 the Republic. Power rests with the President and with the
 party's central committee. The party is open to all Burundi
 supporting its principles and claims a membership of
 approximately 1.4 million, about three-quarters of the adult
 population. The party regularly holds local and regional
 meetings, where party members discuss issues and make
 recommendations. While there are multiple candidates for
 party positions, balloting is not secret.
 Although the military retains influential presence in all the
 party organs and in the Government, its role in actual
 administration has declined markedly since 1979. Apart from
 the President, who holds the defense portfolio, only three
 military officers are currently cabinet members, and military
 officers hold 15 of the 69 central committee seats. The
 Constitution provides for a National Assembly, which was
 seated in 1982 with a 5-year mandate. The Assembly is
 comprised of 65 representatives, of whom 52 are elected by
 secret ballot under universal adult suffrage, and the
 remainder are appointed. All candidates were drawn from a
 list preselected by provincial electoral colleges composed of
 party and government officials. Two candidates were permitted
 for each elective seat. The balloting was evidently free, as
 several high party and government officials failed to win
 seats. The Assembly is not intended to be a separate and
 independent power but is expected to cooperate with and
 complement the executive and other institutions. Over the
 last 4 years, the National Assembly has actively debated
 government policy, occasionally expressing pointed criticism.

 BURUNDI
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations instruments on
 human rights, and its Constitution provides for the protection
 of such rights. There were no reports during 1986 of .requests
 for outside investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, '
 Language, or Social Status
 The minority Tutsi have for centuries dominated the majority
 Hutu. Civil strife in 1972, which culminated in government
 sanctioned massacres, resulted in the deaths of around 150,000
 Hutu and caused another 200,000 to flee to neighboring Rwanda
 and Tanzania. Since the advent of the Bagaza Government in
 1976, the level of ethnic tension has markedly declined.
 Thousands of Hutu refugees have returned to Burundi. While
 the Government is far from representative of the Burundi
 population as a whole (85 percent Hutu, 14 percent Tutsi, and
 1 percent other), Bagaza has appointed Hutus to all levels of
 government, including 5 to his 19-member Cabinet, and there
 are about 18 Hutu representatives in the 65-member National
 Assembly.
 Intermarriage has also contributed to a blurring of ethnic
 distinctions. The low level of economic development in rural
 areas affects both Tutsi and Hutu, making the difference in
 economic status between the two groups scarcely discernible in
 the countryside. However, because of their longstanding
 dominance of the Government and access to education, the Tutsi
 predominate in the modern economic sector. The military
 remains under Tutsi control. Maintenance of Tutsi domination
 is a chief objective of the regime. Nevertheless, there is no
 evidence that Hutus are denied equal protection under the law.
 Women in society hold a secondary position, although their
 status is undergoing considerable change from traditional
 patterns. The Constitution provides for legal equality. The
 legal code prohibits polygamy and the requirement of a dowry
 and allows women some control over family matters. Women
 still cannot inherit land and cannot take a salaried job if
 forbidden to work by their husbands. Although fewer women
 than men attain a formal education, once a degree is attained
 women can generally find suitable employment. The Government
 does not discriminate against women in hiring. Women are
 represented at all levels in the political life of the
 country. However, their main vehicle of political expression
 is the Burundi Women's Union which is affiliated with the
 party. The party remains dominated by males.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Worker rights are guaranteed by the Burundi Labor Code and by
 the National Collective Interprofessional Labor Convention.
 Working hours vary between 40 and 45 hours per week; Saturday
 afternoons, Sundays, and holidays are times of rest. Children
 under the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity, nor
 may children under the age of 16 be engaged in dangerous or
 strenuous work, but as a practical matter, many children are
 obliged by custom and circumstance to help their families in
 subsistence agriculture. Minimum health and safety standards
 are monitored and enforced in the modern economic sector by
 the Ministry of Labor. Burundi has a minimum wage of
 approximately $1.12 per day.
