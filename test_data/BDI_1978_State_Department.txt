 BURUNDI
 Conflict between the majority (85 percent) Hutu ethnic
 group and the minority (14 percent) Tutsi group has
 dominated the political, social and economic life of
 Burundi. While there are no important linguistic or
 cultural differences between these two ethnic groups,
 the minority has from ancient times dominated the
 majority. This has led on several occasions to violence
 stemming from the disproportionate sharing of power and
 wealth. An attempted coup in April 1972 by the majority
 Hutu against the Tutsi government resulted in a govern-
 ment-sanctioned bloodbath that left perhaps as many as
 150,000 dead and an equal number of refugees. The
 military government established by Colonel Jean Baptiste
 Bagaza in November 1976 proclaimed a policy of national
 reconciliation and reform designed to improve the living
 conditions of the rural poor, the great majority of whom
 are Hutu. An effective formula for more proportionate
 power sharing has yet to be developed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not sanctioned by law. Beatings occasionally
 occur during the questioning of common criminals,
 particularly if they have threatened violence against
 the police or are accused of having used force.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The current system does not impose cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Prisons are crowded
 and dirty, but prisoners are normally left to themselves
 and not abused. However, prisoners arrested in connec-
 tion with such crimes as rape or murder and those who
 violently resist arrest may be ill-treated. The Govern-
 ment claims to discipline police and prison officials
 
 
 guilty of abusing prisoners. The Department of State
 has no information to confirm or refute these claims.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The state has broad police powers which permit arbitrary
 arrests and imprisonment. Occasionally suspects are
 detained without trial. The sixty officials recently
 tried for misuse of funds had been held since they were
 arrested shortly after the establishment of President
 Bagaza's government in November 1976. The ex-Chief of
 Staff of the Armed Forces, seized at the same time,
 remains under house arrest and there may be a few
 others. To the knowledge of the Department of State
 there are no other political prisoners presently in
 detention.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 By law, all peisons arrested should receive a speedy'
 public trial, but the inefficiency of the judicial
 system and lack of trained legal personnel often
 cause long delays and unfairness. In 1976, however, the
 Bagaza Government began reform of the rural court system
 and purged corrupt legal officials. This has improved
 to a modest degree the timeliness and fairness of
 judgments rendered by the local tribunals.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is rare, but it occasionally
 happens in politically-related cases.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education.
 The reform-minded Bagaza Government's attention to
 fulfilling the vital needs of its citizens is reflected
 in its development budget for 1978. Planned expenditures
 were more than doubled, with the largest part of the
 increase going to investment in rural services. The new
 Five-Year Plan emphasizes increasing food produc-
 tion and improving government social services in rural
 areas.
 
 
 The current Government ended much of the blatant corrup-
 tion that occurred under the former administration. In
 August 1978, 44 of the sixty officials of the former
 regime tried for corruption were found guilty and
 sentenced to multi-year prison terms plus restitution of
 funds.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Religion, Press
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is generally respected in Burundi.
 However, missionaries' involvement in social work with
 the poor, who are mainly Hutu, has on occasion
 aroused government suspicion. Several foreign church-
 men, including a leading American missionary, recently
 have been expelled. There is also increasing pressure
 on the missionaries to perform non-theological educa-
 tional work mandated by the Government.
 The express authorization of the Government is requested
 for political assemblies and speakers. There is currently
 one newspaper in Burundi, Le Renouveau, published by the
 Ministry of Information. The Presidency provides general
 guidance on what is published, and in the past editors
 have been changed when stories displeased the leadership.
 Union des Travailleurs Burundais, the sole labor union,
 is an integral organization within the sole political
 party, L'Unite pour le Progres Nationale (UPRONA). It does
 have the power to strike, but only as prescribed by law and
 Ministry of Labor directives. While there was a recent
 wildcat strike at one plant, it is doubtful if the union
 would openly criticize or challenge the Government.
 While there are no senior women officials in the Government,
 promotion of the status of women is official policy. In
 the words of the President, women are encouraged "to speak
 up and participate in the management of the affairs of
 state. They must aid in the search for progress and develop-
 ment".
 
 
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement is free within Burundi, as is foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The military government rules by decree, without
 popular referendum procedures. The Government endeavors
 to control all political activity. Only one political
 party, the government-sponsored UPRONA, is permitted.
 The Government is currently in the process of naming
 provincial UPRONA officials and a secretariat staff.
 This structure is to prepare for elections of local
 officials who in turn are to elect intermediate offi-
 cials. UPRONA's plans call for the free flow of
 information up and down the organization. There is
 already some evidence of debate within the party
 organization. For the time being, the party remains
 under the supervision of the Supreme Revolutionary
 Council.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The previous Government refused to permit outside
 investigation of ethnic rivalries in Burundi after
 the communal violence of 1972-73. To the knowledge of
 the Department of State, the current regime has
 received no requests for outside assessments of its
 program on ethnic relations or other human rights
 matters.
