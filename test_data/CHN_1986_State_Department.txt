 CHINA
 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rules the People's Republic
 of China (PRC). A small group of leaders in several key
 organizations, including the Politburo and its five-member
 Standing Committee, the Military Commission, and the
 Secretariat share power within the party. Politburo Standing
 Committee member Deng Xiaoping is China's preeminent leader.
 Since achieving power in 1949, the CCP has continued China's
 long tradition of autocratic rule. The CCP justifies its
 leading role by invoking both Marxist-Leninist ideology and
 Confucian social ethics. The legal system, abandoned during
 the Cultural Revolution, has been resurrected and is being
 strengthened. Although the party continues to place important
 restrictions on basic political rights and civil liberties
 such as freedom of speech, press, and association, some of
 these controls have loosened in recent years. The Government
 does not tolerate fundamental criticism of the CCP or the
 Socialist system. Student demonstrations during December,
 however, challenged these prohibitions.
 China remains one of the world's poorer developing countries.
 As modernization of China's economy has progressed in the
 post-Mao period, the leadership has repudiated more and more
 aspects of the Soviet economic model, the basis on which it
 originally structured China's Socialist economy. Without
 changing the fundamental Socialist orientation of the economy
 or of the Government, individual and small collective
 enterprises have been allowed more leeway to operate, and many
 small state-owned enterprises and stores have been contracted
 out to individuals to manage. In addition, the rural commune
 system has been eliminated, and peasants now farm land leased
 from the Government under individually held contracts.
 The human rights situation in China improved slightly in 1986,
 with some limited progress toward realization of the 1982
 Constitution's formal guarantees of individual rights, and
 movement toward dispersal of political power within the
 Government, which remains subordinate to the party. Although
 not relinquishing its decisionmaking power, the party has made
 a gesture towards broader participation in the political
 process by reinvigoration of the National People's Congress
 (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference, as well as by holding multiple-candidate elections
 to local representative bodies and lower-level congresses.
 The concept of the rule of law has a short history in China,
 and many Chinese are unfamiliar with, or unaccustomed to, its
 operation. During 1986 the Government launched a 5-year
 program of universal legal education. High-level officials
 and party cadres attended special classes to study law.
 Training programs for persons engaged in legal work continued,
 and programs to popularize knowledge of laws began to operate.
 The Government carries on an extensive family planning program
 under provisions in the Constitution, the marriage law, and
 various administrative and party rules at national,
 provincial, and local levels. Implementation has varied
 widely from place to place--strict in the cities, more relaxed
 in the countryside where the bulk of the population lives, and
 loose in sparsely-populated minority and border areas.
 Although official Chinese policy prohibits coercive family
 planning, there have been numerous reliable reports in past
 years of coercive birth control practices at local levels,
 including forced abortions and sterilizations. Another
 
 
 684
 CHINA
 apparent result of the Government's effort to limit the
 country's birthrate has been the resort by some people in
 rural China who desire a male child to the traditional
 practice of female infanticide. Recent information, however,
 indicates that the number of such cases--always thought to be
 small--has declined.
 The trend toward greater toleration of religious activities
 has continued in 1986. The number of churches, temples, and
 mosques conducting religious services has expanded, as has the
 availability of religious training. Authorities, however, do
 suppress cults and other unofficial institutions as well as
 prohibit ties to foreign organizations.
 The leadership's policy of opening up to the outside world has
 become an integral part of China's evolution towards a less
 tightly controlled society. The October 1986 Sixth Party
 Plenum confirmed this by declaring it "basic, unalterable
 state policy." The Government has made the promotion of
 foreign trade and investment a fundamental part of its
 modernization drive. Travel and emigration controls have been
 loosened significantly in the recent past. Tens of thousands
 of Chinese go abroad every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives, while millions of overseas Chinese and
 hundreds of thousands of other foreigners travel to China.
 The party continues to seek to block unwelcome foreign
 influences, e.g. rock music and drugs, and party functionaries
 continue to monitor contacts with foreigners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No known government-sanctioned politically motivated killings
 occurred, although some deaths resulted from unsanctioned
 actions by local officials. A crime suppression campaign
 launched in the fall of 1983 continued in 1986, but less
 intensively. During this anticrime campaign, the death
 penalty has been-applied frequently, often without the
 opportunity to exercise the constitutional right of appeal to
 higher courts. Sources estimate that between 7,000 and 14,000
 persons were executed in 1983-86, among whom those known to
 have been charged with political crimes were only a small
 percentage.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons being abducted or disappearing
 at the hands of the security services.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 China's code of criminal procedure specifically prohibits the
 use.of torture. However, according to official statistics, of
 949 persons illegally detained during the first half of 1986,
 140 died or were injured, and torture reportedly was used in
 some cases. The willingness of central authorities to allow
 public discussion of such cases and take action against the
 perpetrators is new and significant. In December China signed
 the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment.
 
 
 685
 CHINA
 To indoctrinate the public and deter crime, the authorities
 sometimes subject persons convicted of serious crimes to
 public denunciation and humiliation at "mass sentencing
 rallies." At these rallies, often attended by thousands of
 people (including the families and neighbors of the convicted
 persons), the accused are denounced and their sentences
 revealed to the crowd. Policemen force prisoners to keep
 their heads bowed as a mark of contrition. Such "mass
 sentencing rallies" occurred in many places in 1986, with
 those sentenced to death often being transported to public
 execution grounds afterward.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Chinese law details a series of procedures to be
 observed in the handling of suspects, including use of arrest
 warrants and time limits for detention during investigation
 and trial, these safeguards frequently are ignored in
 practice. The illegal detentions referred to in Section l.c.
 above fell into three categories: those held by local cadres
 (officials), those carried out by police, and those carried
 out by persons involved in civil or economic disputes.
 Officials maintain that these cases increased 96.5 percent
 over the previous half-year period, but it seems more likely
 that the incidence has changed less than the willingness of
 victims to report violations and of the regime to admit that
 abuses occur and to punish the culprits. No provision exists
 for preventive detention. Other guarantees in the law include
 the right to counsel; however, a defense attorney normally
 does not enter a case until after the police and procurator
 have finished their investigation and the defendant has been
 formally charged.
 In July 1984, the NPC Standing Committee approved amendments
 extending the period of detention during investigation from
 2 to 4 months and the time limit for trials from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2
 months. In principle, these changes applied only to "serious"
 cases and required that extensions be approved by provincial
 procuratorates or courts. The NPC's action represented a
 probable reduction in the time limits earlier specified by the
 provinces. In practice, criminal cases in urban areas
 generally are processed well within the time limits. In
 remote areas there are provisions to extend time limits if
 necessary due to poor communications. The new regulations
 also authorized the use of bail for accused persons not
 considered "dangerous," but there have been no reports about
 its implementation, notwithstanding claims in the Chinese
 press that these amendments would "promote human rights."
 Sentencing to prison or labor reform usually entails
 participation in compulsory labor. Prison and labor reform
 camps are expected to be partially self-supporting if not
 operating at a profit.
 Under "labor education" provisions, those who commit "minor
 theft or fraud" or who have been expelled from their work
 units may be deprived of their civil liberties and subjected
 to "education through labor" for up to 4 years without trial.
 This nonjudicial sentencing procedure has been used frequently
 against political dissidents. Judgments are handed down by a
 public security office in consultation with representatives of
 local civil affairs units. The authorities made extensive use
 of this provision during the initial phases of the crime
 suppression campaign in 1983. In 1985 they continued to
 transfer more serious offenders (sentenced to "reform through
 
 
 686
 CHINA
 labor") from prisons in coastal areas to labor camps in remote
 areas of Xinjiang and Qinghai. Even after they complete their
 sentences, most of these prisoners will be denied permission
 to return to their homes in east China. In what amounts to a
 form of internal exile, they will be assigned jobs and become
 permanent residents of these underpopulated regions.
 No reliable figures exist for the number of political
 prisoners in China. Insufficient data makes an accurate
 estimate impossible. The Government denies that it has any
 political prisoners and insists that it imprisons only
 criminals and "counterrevolutionaries." The latter group
 includes some who had no clear political motive in breaking
 the law, but whose offenses (such as jailbreak or attacks on
 public buildings) the authorities nonetheless classified as
 "counterrevolutionary." Counterrevolutionary offenses are
 said to constitute about 1 to 3 percent of the number of
 criminal offenses. Overall, the number of such prisoners has
 dropped since the late 1970's, through natural attrition and
 with the "reversal of verdicts" (often initiated through
 political channels) of hundreds of thousands of persons
 sentenced as "counterrevolutionaries" during the Cultural
 Revolution. In 1986 cases of individuals accused of being
 counterrevolutionaries or having committed crimes of a
 political nature before the Cultural Revolution were being
 reviewed. Officials indicate that this reevaluation will be
 completed before the fall of 1987. There are as yet no public
 statistics on the progress of this inquiry, but many cases of
 reversals have been publicized.
 The total inmate population in labor camps and prisons may
 have increased since the beginning of the anticrime campaign,
 as tens of thousands of common criminals and persons
 considered socially undesirable have been processed through
 the courts. Partial figures which have become available
 suggest a total prison/labor camp population in the range of 2
 million to 5 million, although an estimate at the low end of
 the scale seems more plausible.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary is nominally independent but in practice
 follows party policy. There are presently no standing special
 political or security courts.
 Most Chinese trials are essentially sentencing hearings where
 defense representatives plead clemency for their clients and,
 with few exceptions, do not contest their guilt. The trials
 are preceded by extensive pretrial investigation carried out
 by the Public Security Bureau and/or the Procurator. Courts
 assume the guilt of any person brought to trial. There have
 been instances, however, where accused persons have
 successfully defended their innocence and been released.
 Defendants in criminal cases may appeal both verdicts and
 sentences to the next higher court. Appeals have resulted in
 both stiffer and reduced sentences for the accused.
 The criminal procedure code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles,
 and "personal secrets." In practice, attendance at public
 trials requires an admission ticket obtained from
 organizations selected by the authorities.
 
 
 687
 CHINA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Extensive regulation of individual and family life constitutes
 one of the distinctive features of the Chinese sociopolitical
 system. For most Chinese (particularly the 20 percent of the
 population who are urban residents), life revolves around the
 work unit, which provides not only employment, but also
 housing, ration coupons, permission to marry and have a child,
 and other aspects of ordinary life. The unit, along with
 personnel in "neighborhood committees," monitors a person's
 attitude and behavior and may report suspicious activity to
 the authorities. The unit acts as the party's enforcer at the
 local level, but its considerable autonomy may also be used to
 ignore or obstruct directives from the top. Recent economic
 reforms and a central policy of relaxing social controls have
 weakened the unit's interference in many aspects of daily
 life, however. In rural areas, where political control has
 always been more lax, the shift to family farming from
 collective farming, for example, has markedly decreased
 opportunities for arbitrary interference by local officials.
 China's leaders have made family planning a top national
 priority. They believe that economic modernization goals will
 be unattainable without a low birthrate, particularly given
 the current unusually high number of females of childbearing
 age, traditionally high Chinese birthrates, and recent medical
 advances leading to longer life expectancies. To achieve its
 goal of limiting China's population to 1.2 billion in the year
 2000, the Government discourages early marriage and promotes
 as an ideal a norm of one child per family. A massive,
 grassroots effort involving education, contraceptive
 counseling, free contraceptive devices, and economic and
 social incentives and disincentives supports this policy.
 The authorities have instituted various controls on marriage
 and childbearing. The minimum age for marriage is 22 for men
 and 20 for women, high by world standards but lower than
 previous CCP requirements. Each province sets guidelines
 (based on central government guidelines) for the desired
 number of children to be born during the year. Increasingly,
 grounds for waiving the one child rule have been expanded by
 provincial authorities, ranging from the birth of a
 handicapped baby and employment in particularly hazardous or
 undesirable occupations to the birth of a girl on the first
 try in some rural areas. In border regions and minority
 areas, where population densities are low, governmental
 control weak, and traditional attitudes strong, population
 growth guidelines are looser, allowing a second and sometimes
 third child per family. In some minority areas, such as
 Xinjiang, there have been no population planning restraints at
 all on minority populations, although Xinjiang is now in the
 "propaganda and investigation" stage of implementing a family
 planning policy for minorities. In Han Chinese areas,
 particularly urban locations, central guidelines generally
 have been adhered to more assiduously. Couples who sign a
 pledge to have only one child get a number of incentives:
 free health care for the child, a 5 percent increase in their
 pensions, priority in housing, schooling, and medical
 treatment, and a monthly bonus of about US$2. Couples who
 insist on having a second child reportedly have the right to
 do so in most cases. However, in addition to losing their
 monthly bonus, they may be required to repay any money already
 received and, in some instances, give up or return other
 benefits as well. The rise in rural incomes accompanying
 
 
 688
 CHINA
 economic reforms has reduced peasant responsiveness to
 economic sanctions. Moreover, employment in small collective
 or individual enterprises has weakened further the ability of
 agencies to enforce regulations. Local and central officials
 state that no permission is necessary for the first child.
 Although contrary to announced central government policy, in
 previous years significant numbers of those becoming pregnant
 without permission were coerced by local officials into having
 abortions, sometimes even in the later stages of pregnancy.
 Central government authorities have clarified that after the
 sixth month of pregnancy abortions should not be performed,
 unless the health of the mother is endangered. Reported
 instances of family planning malpractice occur for the most
 part in less developed rural areas, where local officials have
 translated central, guidelines into rigid quotas. Chinese
 authorities say they take measures against local officials who
 violate the Government's policy in this regard, but there have
 been few reports of punishment of such offenders. Central
 government guidelines for local family planning personnel have
 not been made public, nor have the limits, if any, on their
 authority. Chinese family planning officials have reiterated
 that the Chinese Government does not condone forced abortions
 or sterilizations, but admit that coercion, even though
 counter to official policy, does occur in some instances. In
 1986 high-level Chinese officials spoke out publicly against
 coercive practices and abuses in population control work, and
 it seems that the incidence of such cases has lessened.
 Chinese officials have stated that abortion ends 25-33 percent
 of pregnancies.
 According to a report in the September 12, 1986 China Legal
 News (Zhongguo Fazhi Bao), the Women's Association of Western
 Chongqing said that in 1984, 2,800 cases there involved either
 the drowning of baby girls or the mistreatment of women who
 gave birth to girls. Although the Association did not
 distinguish between the two categories, it is believed the
 great majority of incidents consisted of the latter type of
 abuse. Infanticide is illegal, and the press has published
 cases of persons punished for this crime.
 Contacts between Chinese and foreigners have increased
 considerably in recent years. Whereas Chinese citizens whose
 work did not require or permit contact with foreigners have in
 the past been warned or detained and questioned if they
 persisted in meeting foreign acquaintances, such instances
 appear to be rare today. Chinese seem anxious to strike up
 conversations with foreigners and often volunteer unorthodox
 political views. "English corners," where Chinese and
 foreigners can meet to talk in English, attract large numbers
 of people. The authorities in principle permit marriages
 between foreigners and Chinese but specifically prohibit
 Chinese citizens involved in confidential and other
 "important" work (such as diplomats and military personnel),
 as well as those serving prison sentences, from marrying
 foreigners. In practice, romantic liaisons between Chinese
 citizens and foreigners are less strongly discouraged than in
 the recent past, and cadres are not supposed to interfere if
 the parties seem sincere.
 The criminal procedure code requires the use of search
 warrants for gathering evidence, and they have been presented
 in cases involving foreigners. No reliable information exists
 on the extent to which this proviso is carried out in
 practice. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, if an
 
 
 689
 CHINA
 emergency situation should develop when carrying out arrest or
 detention, security authorities have the right to enter and
 search living premises without warrants or notification.
 Several years ago, reports suggested the use of electronic
 eavesdropping equipment to monitor suspected political
 dissidents. In December the NPC passed China's first postal
 service law guaranteeing privacy in written communication and
 prohibiting tampering with mail except as permitted by law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of
 the press, authorities do not permit open criticism of the CCP
 or Chinese socialism. Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang
 restated the party's policy of carefully controlling the print
 and broadcast media in a 1985 speech, when he maintained that
 "journalism work is the party's mouthpiece." Balancing this,
 a 1986 speech by Party Propaganda Director Zhu Houze
 encouraged papers to print the news as they saw it, to become
 more lively, and to reflect divergent attitudes. Editorials
 and commentaries calling for greater public debate appear
 frequently in the press and have been endorsed by top party
 leaders. Degrees of control vary from absolute, in the case
 of party organs such as the People's Daily, to looser for
 publications dealing with nonpolitical topics. In general,
 restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press have
 relaxed considerably in recent years, particularly since the
 Fourth National Writers' Conference of December 1984.
 One sign of the increased relaxation in the political
 environment has been the appearance in the press of articles
 by prominent theorists denounced during the 1983 spiritual
 pollution campaign. In mid-1986 an effort to revive the 1957
 slogan, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of
 thought contend" began. This slogan provides ideological
 underpinning for limited expression of differing opinions,
 while also serving to remind intellectuals of the pitfalls of
 taking criticisms beyond permissible bounds.
 The Government appointed a new Minister of Culture in 1986
 known for his outspoken views in defense of diversity. He
 quickly and publicly defended the new line. Nonetheless, the
 limits remain clear, and intellectuals are still concerned
 about the possible tightening up of restrictions. Officials
 canceled a planned art exhibition organized by veterans of the
 1979 Democracy Wall Movement as going beyond current bounds.
 The Government also closed one play prematurely despite its
 evident popularity.
 As part of this liberalization policy, the leadership has
 permitted greater, albeit still limited, access to various
 aspects of foreign culture. Foreign books and artistic works
 are still screened by authorities but more are available now
 than in past years. Foreign films are shown more frequently,
 and visits by foreign artistic groups are more common.
 Selected subscribers in universities and other institutions
 receive foreign periodicals. Tens of millions of Chinese read
 The Reference News, an officially published selection of
 largely uncensored translations from the foreign press.
 Coverage of foreign news in the open media has become more
 extensive and professional. Chinese listen freely to foreign
 broadcasts, and many universities iise the Voice of America
 (VOA) and other foreign radio broadcasts in their language
 
 
 690
 CHINA
 courses. In its weekly programing, Chinese television
 includes some programs from Western and other countries.
 Audiences in some major cities enjoy Chinese-language
 renditions of classical and contemporary Western plays.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association; in practice, however, the authorities
 circumscribe these rights. China has a wide variety and
 increasing number of professional and other associations, such
 as the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's
 Federation, the Chinese Writers' Association, and the
 All-China Sports Federation. These groups operate under party
 control. The authorities suppress or coopt groups which
 attempt to function independently.
 China's trade unions are closely controlled by the CCP. The
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) acts as the
 umbrella organization with which all trade unions must
 affiliate. With over 80 million members, the ACFTU enrolls
 about two-thirds of the urban work force. The Federation's
 prime function is to serve the State's interest by promoting
 labor discipline, enhancing labor productivity, conducting
 political and ideological indoctrination, and improving
 workers' educational and technical skills. Unions also
 perform a variety of social and welfare functions such as
 handling pensions and disability benefits, and operating
 clubs, eating facilities, nurseries, schools, and
 sanatoriums. Their duties also include the promotion of
 workers' safety. Although government officials may consult
 trade union leaders on wage policy, unions have no power to
 engage in collective bargaining.
 Chinese workers are not guaranteed the right to strike.
 Included in the 1978 State Constitution, this right was
 omitted in the 1982 revision as well as in the 1983 trade
 union constitution. However, a trade union spokesman said in
 1983 that this omission did not necessarily mean that strikes
 were illegal. He then described a narrow range of
 circumstances (e.g., risks to workers' safety) where strikes
 might be permitted for a brief time. There are no known
 instances of strikes on these issues, although there has been
 at least one instance of a strike over opposition to wage
 reform by workers protesting linking wages to productivity.
 Safety conditions in many industries are believed to be
 substandard, but statistics are not made public.
 In the last several years, the ACFTU has moved actively to
 expand its international ties. Claiming to have contacts with
 trade unions in over 120 countries or regions, the federation
 has stated its desire to establish links with foreign unions
 regardless of their affiliation with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Soviet-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions, or other organizations. The ACFTU
 conducts its busiest bilateral program with the Japanese labor
 federations, Domei and Sohyo. Since China joined the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1983, an ACFTU
 official has served as China's workers' delegate to that
 body. This representative was elected to an alternate seat on
 the ILO governing body in 1984. The ILO opened a regional
 office in Beijing in January 1985.
 Since 1981, workers' congresses have been established in most
 of China's large and medium-sized enterprises. Created in
 
 
 691
 CHINA
 principle to permit workers a role in enterprise management
 and selection of plant officials, the congresses have to date
 been largely limited to social welfare issues. The October
 1984 Party Plenum's decision on economic reform, although
 calling for "centralized and unilateral leadership" of
 enterprises and "strict labor discipline," also says that
 worker participation in management must be ensured, a presumed
 reference to the workers' congresses.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Reversing Cultural Revolution-era attempts to eliminate all
 religious practice, China's reformist leadership in 1978
 initiated a policy of limited religious toleration. The
 Constitution guarantees freedom of religious belief and
 specifies that no organization or person may compel citizens
 to believe or disbelieve in religion or discriminate against
 them because of religious preference. The Constitution also
 provides that religious bodies must not be subject to foreign
 domination--a provision affecting primarily the Catholic
 Church. Aside from these provisions, official policy forbids
 religious proselytizing other than at places of worship or
 believers' homes. Earlier, unpublished regulations reportedly
 also limited religious freedom to those over the age of 18,
 but church associations deny this.
 The authorities have required all religious bodies to
 affiliate with eight national organizations representing four
 religions--Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. Of the
 five Christian associations, two are Protestant (the
 Protestant Three Self Movement and the China Christian
 Council), and three are Catholic (the Patriotic Catholic
 Association, the National Administrative Council of the
 Catholic Church, and the Catholic Bishops College). Together,
 these associations--with different functional responsibilities
 but overlapping leadershipp--constitute the officially
 sanctioned national Protestant and Catholic Churches.
 Although the Government required all Protestant denominations
 to merge in the 1950's, congregations and individuals may
 follow preferences on such matters as forms of baptism. Since
 its separation from Rome 30 years ago, the Chinese Catholic
 Church has developed an independent theology and doctrines;
 for example, it rejects papal infallibility and supremacy,
 continues to conduct services in Latin, and supports the
 State's policy on birth control, provided church-approved
 methods are used. These five Christian associations and three
 organizations representing the other religions link religious
 bodies to the State and party.
 Within the limits of official policy, religious activities
 have expanded considerably in the last few years and appear to
 have been noticeably strengthened in the last 12 months. Many
 religious institutions which closed during the Cultural
 Revolution have reopened. In 1986 officials said there were
 over 30,000 churches, temples, monasteries, and mosques in
 service in the country. Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have
 reopened, often after being refurbished at government
 expense. In Tibet, nearly 500 lamaistic monasteries have been
 restored, many with government funds--still just a fraction of
 the 2,700 monasteries open before the Chinese suppression of
 the 1959 Tibetan uprising. Similarly, only a small number of
 monks have returned to monastic life in Tibet, although more
 are being trained at a government-funded institute in Lhasa.
 
 
 692
 CHINA
 Since 1981 the authorities have permitted the establishment of
 seminaries to train a limited number of young people in
 religious orders. The Catholic Church has 10 seminaries in
 operation. The Protestant Church, apart from its national
 seminary in Nanjing, operates nine other theological
 institutes, the newest in Shanghai. The Islamic Association
 runs nine institutes throughout China to train imams and
 Islamic scholars. The Buddhist Association has institutes in
 Beijing, Suzhou, and Nanjing, as well as Lhasa. The religious
 associations sponsor a variety of publications for believers,
 including scriptures, teaching material, theological journals,
 and hymnbooks. Since 1980 for example, the Protestant China
 Christian Council has printed and distributed over 1.3 million
 Bibles. Aside from appropriating funds for extensive
 renovation of temples, the Government provides other forms of
 direct and indirect financial support for religious bodies
 (e.g., tax exemptions for their rental income and cash
 subsidies to Muslimsfor observance of dietary law).
 The number of Christians has increased since 1978, with
 estimates of the total ranging from the official figure of 6
 million to a more likely 10 million to 20 million. This
 increase in believers has resulted in a severe shortage of
 places of worship, given the continued occupation of many
 pre-Cultural Revolution churches and temples by factories, the
 military, and other units. As a result, many congregations
 are forced to meet in believers' homes. Officials say there
 are 15 million actively practicing Muslims and that
 practitioners of Buddhism and Daoism run into the millions
 (actual numbers probably more closely total tens of
 millions). A pressing shortage of priests, ministers, monks,
 and imams exists because the older generation of religious
 leaders is dying off, and the number of recent graduates of
 religious training institutions remains inadequate.
 Despite the greater freedom of recent years, the authorities
 still react harshly to unsanctioned religious activity. Some
 Christians prefer to worship outside the officially recognized
 'patriotic" church system and to meet in unsanctioned "house
 churches." The public security authorities have in the past
 harassed these underground churches with measures including
 arrests in an attempt to force worshipers into an official
 church. In September 1986, the Western press carried reports
 that Public Security authorities had raided an unofficial
 Catholic seminary near Shijiazhuang in Hebei province on May
 29, and had taken over 40 Catholics into custody, some of whom
 were later released. Four Catholic seminarians were reported
 to have been arrested in the same area in June. In 1983 the
 NPC Standing Committee authorized the death penalty for those
 organizing secret sects which spread "feudal and superstitious
 ideas." This provision appears aimed at traditional animist
 and cult practices or plain criminal activity rather than at
 mainstream religious activities.
 Because of concern over divided loyalties, the authorities
 carefully monitor and control contacts between Chinese and
 foreign religious organizations. At the same time, they
 encourage Chinese religious leaders to meet foreign
 counterparts and take part in international meetings. Such
 international religious contacts have been broadened
 considerably during 1986, including visits to China by the
 United States-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation, Hong
 Kong's Roman Catholic Bishop John Baptipt Wu, and South
 African Bishop Desmond Tutu, who delivered a sermon in a
 Shanghai church. A delegation of Chinese Catholic leaders
 
 
 693
 CHINA
 from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan also traveled to the United
 States at the invitation of the Association of Catholic
 Colleges and Universities during the autumn of 1986.
 To gain support from important minority groups and create
 goodwill with Islamic nations, China in 1979 resumed giving
 permission to Muslim citizens to make the hajj. Over 2,200
 Chinese made the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1986, up slightly from
 the 1985 figure of 2,100. There are some indications that
 Chinese religious organizations may again be permitted to
 receive funds or gifts from foreign religious organizations
 --if no strings are perceived to be attached.
 On the other hand, the Government insists that the country's
 religious bodies must be independent of foreign control and
 warns against foreign attempts to interfere in Chinese
 religious affairs. The Government prohibits missionaries from
 practicing among Chinese citizens but has allowed some foreign
 clergymen to enter for brief periods to serve the resident
 foreign community. Foreigners with acknowledged ties to
 overseas religious institutions are permitted to work in
 China, often as English teachers, provided that they do not
 engage in open proselytizing. To date the Government seems to
 have overlooked minor infractions of this injunction.
 The authorities' concerns with alleged foreign interference
 are particularly directed at the Vatican, in part due to the
 Vatican's continued diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Chinese
 priests who publicly maintain their loyalty to the Pope are
 subject to arrest and imprisonment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Various formal and informal restrictions govern travel within
 China. Chinese citizens must have a written letter of
 introduction from their work unit to buy airplane tickets,
 secure hotel accommodations, or acquire ration coupons for
 purchase of basic food items in areas outside their places of
 residence. Those traveling by rail who plan to stay with
 relatives need not obtain letters of introduction but are
 still legally required to register with local police during
 their visits. In practice, however, many Chinese do not
 comply. With their higher income levels (particularly in the
 countryside), Chinese are traveling ever more frequently
 within the country, often ignoring bureaucratic requirements
 without much difficulty. For instance, availability of grain
 and other food in free market channels, combined with larger
 monetary incomes, means that lack of ration coupons no longer
 presents an effective barrier to travel. This increased
 mobility prompted the authorities to announce in April 1985
 the adoption of the country's first nationwide identity card
 system. This plan went into effect on September 6, 1985 under
 the auspices of the NPC Standing Committee. Local committees
 are working out details for eventual implementation.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely change their locality of
 residence or workplace. They are registered as residents of a
 particular jurisdiction. The authorities normally grant
 permission to move to another locality only for a change in
 employment. Rigid personnel policies, most notably the
 unwillingness of units to sanction an employee's transfer,
 make it difficult to change jobs. For newly employed ordinary
 workers in state enterprises, this situation changed with the
 introduction of a labor contract system as of October 1, 1986.
 
 
 694
 CHINA
 The contracts generally will run for 3 to 5 years, after which
 both parties may decide whether to renew. This will not
 immediately affect workers employed before October 1, who will
 continue to "enjoy" lifetime employment, without a stipulated
 right to leave to seek other work. The authorities have
 called for and have taken some steps towards reform of the
 personnel ;system, aiming at greater mobility among scientists,
 technicians, and certain other professionals. As part of
 efforts to develop commerce and industry in rural areas, the
 State Council issued a circular in October 1984 which
 authorized peasants to establish businesses in rural towns.
 . Significant numbers of farmers are moving into small and
 medium-sized cities. Strict policies discouraging rural
 migration to large cities continue. It is also difficult for
 ,urban residents to move to other cities for personal reasons.
 Nevertheless, large numbers of unregistered people reside in
 China's biggest cities, for example an estimated 1,000,000 in
 Shanghai and 700,000 in Beijing,
 With the relaxation of controls on foreign travel and
 emigration since the late 1970's, tens of thousands of Chinese
 now go overseas every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives. In November 1985, the Standing Committee of
 the NPC passed the "citizens exit and entry control law,"
 which went into effect February 1, 1986. The law states: "A
 Chinese citizen may leave or enter the territory without visa
 processing by showing a valid passport, or other valid
 certificates." With some exceptions, "all applications for
 exit on account of personal affairs... will be approved." The
 law denies exit to four categories of people--those involved
 in unsettled criminal or civil cases, those serving sentences,
 those placed under "education through labor," or those whose
 exit may harm China's national security or interests. It is
 not yet clear how liberally this law is being applied. China
 relaxed restrictions on internal travel by foreigners in
 .February 1985 by more than doubling the number of areas
 (.cities and counties) open to foreign visitors without special
 -permission. At present 436 cities or counties are open to
 visitors. Nevertheless, large portions of China remain
 officially closed.
 China does not revoke the citizenship of political dissidents
 and is not known to have exiled any dissidents. The
 authorities have welcomed the return for permanent residence
 of Chinese who had fled their homeland earlier in fear of
 Communist rule; such persons are also welcomed back for brief
 visits. In 1985, 17,830,000 tourists visited China, the vast
 majority of them residents of Hong Kong and Macao and overseas
 Chinese, including some political opponents and former
 refugees. The number of foreign visitors not of Chinese
 ancestry also has increased dramatically in recent years.
 More than 270,000 refugees and displaced persons from Vietnam
 and Laos have resettled in China since 1978. The number of
 new arrivals has dropped to around 100 per month. The
 authorities have also resettled over 2,000 ethnic Chinese
 permanent residents of the Mongolian People's Republic since
 1983, after that country's government expelled them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The CCP remains the paramount source of political authority
 and decisionmaking in the country. Within the party, a group
 of top leaders in several key organizations, including the
 Politburo and its five-member Standing Committee, the Military
 
 
 695
 CHINA
 Commission, and the Secretariat shares power. Under the
 doctrine of "democratic centralism," leaders at the top, after
 consultation within the party, make policy decisions which all
 party members are expected to support. Political debate and
 disagreement usually take place only before a decision is
 made; once announced, all party members are expected to follow
 the party line. Nevertheless, there are means by which party
 members and others can debate established policies. These
 include the presentation of alternate points of view or
 criticism in the party-controlled press, the use of academic
 journals to present differing interpretations of supposedly
 theoretical matters, selective enforcement of policies,
 exploitation Of policy ambiguities, manipulation of news
 coverage, and informal and unpublicized debate at party and
 government meetings. In 1986, however, Chinese economists and
 political theoreticians openly debated in academic journals
 and national newspapers a key national issue--the limits of
 economic reform. The October 1986 Sixth Party Plenum
 reiterated the call to "let a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred
 schools of thought contend", and following the Plenum
 officials called for publication of differing views on
 academic and theoretical matters. Top leaders have called for
 wider input and "greater democracy" in policy decisionmaking.
 Further experimentation with changes in political forms is
 being discussed under the rubric "political structural
 reform." Nevertheless, parties or groups opposing the CCP are
 forbidden.
 Early December 1986 student demonstrations in several Chinese
 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin
 called for greater democracy, including more participation in
 local elections, multicandidate slates, and open discussion of
 political development through wall posters and in the media.
 The Government responded to this outpouring of upwards of
 50,000 students with restraint, combining firmness with
 flexibility. Authorities avoided repressive policies and by
 the end of the year had arrested only a few, nonstudent
 activists.
 Over the past 5 years, the CCP has promoted a modest
 rejuvenation of eight "democratic" parties (formed before
 1949) as agents of its "united front" policy. Admittedly
 subservient to the CCP, the parties function as channels
 through which the authorities seek to mobilize support among
 various constituencies the parties claim to represent:
 intellectuals, former industrialists, returned overseas
 Chinese, former Kuomintang (Nationalist Party, the dominant
 party of Taiwan) military and civilian officials, and
 Taiwanese living on the mainland. As part of its efforts to
 give more visibility to these parties, the CCP increased their
 representation in the NPC and at the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference in 1983, and they have been
 allowed to reestablish party newspapers (generally for members
 only) and to recruit new adherents. Although the CCP
 periodically consults with the representatives of these minor
 parties on important issues, the parties, whose memberships
 total about 200,000, and whose leaders are aged, have little
 impact on fundamental national policy issues.
 The NPC meets once a year for about 2 weeks to debate and
 approve government policies and personnel changes. The NPC
 rarely rejects proposed government policies, although some
 have been modified as a result of delegates' concerns
 expressed behind the scenes. More important than the NPC as a
 whole is its Standing Committee, which meets several times a
 
 
 696
 CHINA
 year and has the power to approve laws. In 1986 the Standing
 Committee twice declined to pass a draft bankruptcy law
 proposed by the State Council, despite amendments and a
 last-minute plea by supporters for its adoption. This refusal
 to act occasioned unusual--though brief--press mention of the
 names of persons on each side of the debate. The law, in
 modified form, eventually passed toward the end of the year.
 Women have scored few breakthroughs in the male-dominated
 political establishment. At present, none of the 20 full
 members of the Politburo is female (although an alternate
 member is female), while just 3 women serve among the 45
 ministers and commission directors in the Government. About
 20 percent of NPC delegates are female. At present one woman
 serves as a provincial governor and one as a provincial party
 secretary.
 Minority ethnic groups--which account for 6.7 percent of the
 population and are concentrated in border areas like Xinjiang,
 Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia--are permitted a
 limited degree of autonomy. At its 1984 plenary session, the
 NPC adopted a national minorities law, essentially a
 compilation of post-Cultural Revolution policies and practices
 with few new departures. Like the Constitution, the new law
 provides that government heads of autonomous regions,
 prefectures, or counties should be members of the locally
 prevalent minority. Although vague on the extent of political
 autonomy for minority areas, the law clearly sets forth their
 rights to enjoy and develop their.own cultural traditions, use
 their own language, and practice their own religion. CCP
 policy is designed to .increase minority representation in the
 Government and party in minority areas to levels reflecting
 the minority's share of the population, and to assign senior
 positions to minority persons. However, many key positions in
 the autonomous regions continue to be held by Han Chinese.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known organizations within China which monitor or
 comment on human rights conditions. The Chinese regard their
 human rights record as an internal matter and generally see no
 justification for foreign concern about it. China does,
 however, participate in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission. In the past Chinese authorities have not
 responded even to factual questions on particular cases. In
 October 1986, however, officials did provide information in
 answer to a U.S. Embassy inquiry regarding a number of
 imprisoned priests and others thought to be "political
 prisoners." Chinese officials have been more willing to meet
 with U.S. Government officials and members of professional
 groups to discuss birth control policies, have provided
 increasing amounts of statistical data, and have facilitated
 visits to localities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. In the socioeconomic realm as in politics, however,
 women lag behind men despite progress in recent years. Female
 participation in the labor force has increased rapidly in
 recent years, reaching 36.4 percent of urban workers in 1984.
 Yet, women are concentrated in sectors such as light industry,
 
 
 697
 CHINA
 where wage rates are lower. Despite increased educational
 opportunities, the proportion of females in school drops from
 43 percent in primary grades to 26.2 percent of all students
 in universities; 70 percent of illiterates are women.
 Notwithstanding stiff punishment and official discouragement,
 prostitution, selling of women, and other traditional
 practices, such as arranged marriages, concubinage, and heavy
 dowries, continue to be reported from time to time.
 Minorities have benefited from the party's more liberal
 programs for them, which include special treatment in marriage
 and family planning, employment, and university admission.
 Nonetheless, the standard of living of minorities--many of
 whom live in poor, remote areas--remains below that of most
 Han Chinese. Some minorities complain of discrimination by
 the Han majority and the Government. Uygur students
 demonstrated on minority issues in Urumqi, Beijing, and
 Shanghai in December 1985.
 A February 1984 forum convened by the Secretariat set out the
 leadership's liberalization of political, economic, and social
 policies towards Tibet. Numerous subsequent speeches by party
 leaders have reiterated the theme. One result has been the
 rehabilitation of many members of former Tibetan aristocratic
 families, whose property is being restored and who are given
 figurehead positions in the Tibetan regional government.
 Three representatives of the Dalai Lama traveled to Beijing
 during October and November 1984 to discuss a possible visit
 by the exiled spiritual leader. At the conclusion of their
 talks, the representatives issued a statement ruling,out a
 1985 trip by the Dalai Lama to Tibet, but leaving open the
 possibility of one to other parts of China, including areas
 where ethnic Tibetans live. To date the Dalai Lama has not
 returned to China but, due to relaxed Chinese travel
 restrictions, in the past 2 years thousands of Tibetans have
 been able to travel to India to see him there.
 Social and other discrimination against former opponents of
 the CCP, intellectual critics of party leadership, former
 capitalists, and the children of members of these groups has
 been significantly curtailed in recent years.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Although no legislation establishing a minimum age for
 employment exists, state enterprises will not hire anyone who
 has not completed high school or lacks equivalent
 certification. Employment standards in the countryside,
 however, are hard to monitor and may be considerably more
 lax. Schools try to schedule some sort of "productive"
 activity as part of the curriculum, and children in rural
 areas often help out in farm activities. In the course of
 trying to universalize a system of compulsory 9 years'
 education, the Government is attempting to close off full-time
 employment opportunities (and thus the temptation to drop out
 of school) for those who have not finished minimum schooling.
 Conditions of work vary widely. In some impoverished areas,
 long, toilsome hours do not return even a bare living, and
 subsidies are required for survival. No minimum wage law has
 been promulgated. The Government tries to encourage
 productivity in state and collective enterprises, encouraging
 experimentation with various incentive systems.
