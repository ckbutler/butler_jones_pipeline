 LATVIA
 Latvia is a parliamentary democracy, having regained its independence in 1991
 after forced annexation and more than 50 years of occupation by the Soviet Union.
 Elections for the 100-seat Parliament (Saeima) held in the fall of 1995 were free and
 fair, but the election law barred some citizens from competing due to prior activity
 npro-sviet organizations or lak of fluency in the state language. The Prime Min-
 ister as chief executive, and the Cabinet are responsible for government operations.
 The iresident, as Head of State, is elected by the Parliament. The Saeima reelected
 President Guntis Ulmanis in a competitive election in June. The 1991 Constitu-
 tional Law which supplements the 1922 Constitution, provides for basic rights and
 freedoms. he judiciary is independent but not well-trained, efficient, or free from
 corruption.
 The security apparatus consists of: The national police and other services, such
 as the Speci Immiration Police, subordinate to the Ministry of Interior. municipal
 police operating under local  overnment control; the Counterintelligence Service and
 a prtective servce operating under the Ministry of Defense; and the National
 Guard, an element of the national armed forces, which also assists in police activi-
 ties. Parliament approved the Government's proposal to transfer the Border Guard
 Force from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Interior, effective January 1,
 1997. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces
 and the Constitution Protection Bureau (SAB) is responsible for coordinating intel-
 ligene activities. However, Interior Ministry forces, municipal police, and intel-
 ligene personnel sometimes acted independently of central government authority.
 Some members of the security forces, including police and other Interior Ministry
 personnel, committed human rights abuses.
 Traditionally dominated bY agriculture and forestry products, with military and
 other industrial production intrued by the Soviets, the varied economy is increas-
 ingly oriented toward the service sector. As the transition from a centrally planned
 to a market-oriented economic system continues, private enterprise in trade and
 services is thriving. About 80 percent of agricultural land is farmed privately, and
 60 percent of all land is now in private hands. In the industrial sector, progress to-
 wardi privatization and revitalzation is much slower. The currency remained stable
 and freely traded, unemployment was somewhat over 8 percent, and annual infla-
 tion was under 15 percent, down from 25 percent in 1995. Per capita gross domestic
 product (GDP) was slightly over $1,000. GDP began to rise slightly in 1996 as the
 economy recovered from the 1995 collapse of several commercial banks as well as
 from a severe governmental budget crisis.
 The Government generally respeted the human rights of its citizens and the
 large resident noncitizen community, although problems remained in certain areas.
 Members of the security forces, including the police and other Interior Ministry per-
 sonnel, continued to use excessive force; police and prison officers beat detainees
 and inmates. The Government did not take adequate disciplinary action against
 those responsible. Prison conditions remained poor. The inefficient judiciary did not
 always ensure the fair administration of justice. The Citizenship and Immigration
 Department (CID) continued to act arbitrarily in some cases concerning the resi-
 dence status of noncitizens, although independent observers noted improved per-
 formance and a reduction in the number of complaints. Over 100 asylum seekers
 continued to be detained without trial or final determination of their status until
 December, when Nordic countries accepted most of them for resettlement. Women
 are discriminated against in the workp lace. Spousal abuse and trafficking in
 women, as well as child prostitution and a~use are significant problems.
 Among key positive developments were the establishment of a Constitutional
 Court; establishment of a Presidential Consultative Council on Nationality Issues;
 naturalization of nnitizens under the 1994 Citizenship Law; and strengthening of
 an_ independent National Human Rights Office (NURO). Proponents of a restrictive
 alternative citizenship law failed to gain enough signatures to fome a referendum
 on their proposal. By year's end, in accordance with the 1995 Law on the Status
 of Former Soviet Citizens, the CID was preparing to begin issuing new travel docu-
 ments verifing the rights of approximately 700,000 noncitizen residents to reside
 in, leave, and return to the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrafidicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 1008
 C. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture. However, there were credible reports that police
 and prison personnel beat prison inmates as well as asylum seekers and other de-
 tainees. Some law enforcement personnel were prosecuted and others were fired for
 abusing detainees. In November, for example, three former members of the Riga
 municipal police were convicted and given prison sentences ranging from 3 to 6
 years for taking several persons hostage and extortingmoney from them in 1995.
 At least one guard was dismissed from the Interior Ministry for beating asylum
 seekers held at the Olaine Detention Center. Overall, however, oversight and pun-
 ishmnt for improper behavior remained inadequate to deter abuses of-authority by
 law enforcement personnel.
 One of the legacies of the Soviet occupation is the regular practice of hazing mili-
 tary recruits. Despite high-level efforts to end harassment and abuse of soldiers, the
 practices continued. Early in 1996, several military officers were convicted of abus-
 ing recruits in 1995. Punishments ranged from suspended sentences to prison terms.
 Prison conditions remained poor, despite new construction and foreign assistance,
 which has facilitated some improvements. Inadequate sanitation facilities, persist-
 ent shortages of blankets and medical care, and insufficient lighting and ventilation
 are common problems, as is the shortage of resources in general. The law continues
 to prohibit detainees await   trial from sending mail, but this prohibition is not
 unmverslly enforced. The NHRO drew attention to the fact that many prison facili-
 ties fail to meet minimum international standards, that prison medical personnel
 are not sufficiently independent of the prison administration, and that prisoners'
 correspondence with government officials (except the prosecutor) is subject to cen-
 sorship. The NHRO developed plans to work with the prison authorities to establish
 a human rights training program for prisn personnel.
 A detention center established at Olaine, outside Riga, provided substandard con-
 ditions for over 100 asylum seekers (including more than 40 children) who were held
 without trial until December, pending final determination of their status. Almost all
 were released and transported to Nordic countries, which had accepted them for re-
 settlement as refugees.
 The situation for some imprisoned children, who are not always separated from
 adults, remained poor. Children as young as 14 years of age were kept in unsanitary
 conditions, and suffer from disease and deprivation. Both boys and girls are subject
 to violence and possible sexual abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Ietention, or Ele.-There were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest. The responsibility for issuing arrest warrants was transferred from
 prosecutors to the courts in 1994. The law requires the prosecutor's office to make
 a formal decision whether to charge or release a detainee within 72 hours after ar-
 rest. Charges must be filed within 10 days of arrest. No detainee may be held for
 more than 18 months without the prosecutor presenting the case to the defendant
 and the court. Detainees have the right to have an attorney present at any time.
 These rights are subject to judicial review but only at the time of trial. There were
 credible reports that these rights are not always respected in practice, especially
 outside Riga.
 There were no reports of forced exile, which is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. However,
 the courts must rely on the Ministry of Justice for administrative support,
 The Supreme Court does not have a clearly established right to rule on the con-
 stitutionality of legislation or its conformity with the country's international obliga-
 tions. In June the-Parliament amended the Constitution and adopted legislation to
 establish a Constitutional Court to fulfill these functions. The new seven-judge
 panel is authorized to hear cases at the request of state institutions (the President,
 Cabinet, prosecutor, Supreme Court, local governments, or one-third of Saeima
 members) but not of individuals. The Parliament approved six of the judges to sit
 on the court, which held its first organizational meeting and elected an acting chair-
 man in December.
 Although the criminal justice system was organized according to the former Soviet
 model, the Government is reforming the judicial system. In 1995 it completed the
 establishment of regional courts to near appeals of lower court decisions. For more
 serious criminal cases, two lay assessors join the professional judge on the bench.
 There were no reports that the Government improperly influenced judges, but cor-
 ruption is reportedly widespread. Most judges have nadequate judicial training, and
 the court system is too weak to enforce many of its decisions. There is a lack of in-
 formation available on which to make informed decisions, especially outside Riga.
 Trials may be closed if state secrets might be revealed or to protect the interests
 of minors. All defendants have the right to hire an attorney, and the State will lend
 
 
 1009
 funds to destitute defendants for this purpose. Defendants have the right to read
 all charges, confront all witnesses, and may offer witnesses and evidence to support
 their case.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. Former Latvian Communist Party
 First Secretary Alfreds Rubiks continued to serve an 8-year prison term for attempt-
 ing to overthrow the independent Latvian State in 1991. While Rubiks' supporters
 describe him as a political prisoner, claimgin that he acted in accordance vith the
 prevailing Soviet legislation, there is no evidence that his conviction violated human
 rights standards.
 f.Arbitrary Interference With Pra, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that law enforcement authorities have a judicial warrant in order to inter-
 cept cit 'ns' mail, telephone calls, or other forms of communication. This protection
 is less comprehensive for the large noncitizen population.
 Information came to light in 1996 about the unsanctioned taping that reportedly
 took place in late 1995 of an international telephone conversation between the
 President and a private citizen who subsequently became the Prime Minister. The
 prosecutor's office was conducting an investigation on the basis of a tape recording
 provided by a journalist, but there was no reliable information about those who may
 have been involved in this illegal activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of
 speech and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 The 1991 Press Law prohibits censorship of the press or other mass media. Most
 newspapers and magazines are privately owned. New publications continued to ap-
 pear, but economic ifficulties forced others to close. Newspapers in both Latvian
 and Russian published a wide range of criticism and political viewpoints.
 A large number of independent television and radio outlets broadcast in both Rus-
 sian and Latvian, and the number of people receiving satellite television broadcasts
 continued to increase.
 The Law on Radio and Television contains a number of restrictive provisions regu-
 lating the content and language of broadcasts. No more than 30 percent of private
 broadcasts may be in languages other than Latian; in prime time, 40 percent of
 television broadcasts must be of Latvian and 80 percent of European origin. More-
 over, foreign investment may not exceed 20 percent of the capital in electronic
 media organizations.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities legally may
 not prohibit public gatherings. Organizers of demonstrations must provide advance
 notice to local authorities, who may change the time and place of public gatherings
 for such reasons as fear of public disorder. Numerous pub ic meetings and political
 demonstrations took place without government interference. However the Riga City
 Council regularly denied permission or sought to change the time and place of dem-
 onstrations by groups representing a portion of the noncitizen community.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. How-
 ever, the Law on Registering Public Organizations was amended in late 1993 to bar
 registration of Communist, Nazi, or other organizations whose activities would con-
 travene the Constitution. More than 35 political parties are officially registered.
 Noncitizens are prohibited from forming political organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional Law provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Although the Govern-
 ment does not require the registration of religious groups, the 1995 Law on Reli-
 gious Organizations specifies that religious organizations can enjoy certain rights
 and privileges only if they register. Under this law the Justice Ministry has reg-
 istered over 800 religious congregations, including Mormons, whose previous lack of
 official registration had created difficulties in obtaining visas and residence status.
 The only group denied registration was the Jehovah's Witnesses, whose appeal to
 the courts was still under review at year's end.
 Foreign evangelists and missionaries are permitted to hold meetings and pros-
 elytize, btthe law stipulates that only religious organizations in Latvia may invite
 them to carry out suh atvities. After the widely reported death of a Jehovah's
 Witness, whose religious beliefs affected her choice of medical treatment, the Presi-
 dent sent a letter to Parliament asking lawmakers to specily the rights and respon-
 sibilities of unregistered reigious organizations. He also suggested that the Saeima
 supplement the Criminal Code "with norms about inflicting physical or psycho-
 logical damage on a person and about threatening a person's legal rights as a result
 of activities by a religious organization." The Saeima Human Rights and Legal Com-
 mittees subsequently began considering a draft amendment to the Administrative
 
 
 1010
 Code which would have prescribed fines for undefined "activities' by unregistered
 religious organizations. The NHRO and Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that
 the provisions would violate international obligations in the field of religious free-
 dom. The Saeima took no final action on this matter.
 In July the Parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Religious Organiza-
 tions, 1 of which reduced the number of persons necessary to seek registration of
 a religious group from a minimum of 25 citizens to 10 persons residing permanently
 in Latvia. Another amendment stipulated that religious education may be provided
 to students in public schools on a voluntary basis only by representatives of Evan-
 gelical Lutheran, Roman Catholic, Old Believer, Baptist, and Orthodox religious or-
 ganizations. Students at state-supported national minority schools may also receive
 education in the religion 'characteristic of the national minority." Other denomina-
 tions may provide religious education, but may not do so in state-funded schools.
 d. F eedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens.
 The 1995 Law on the Status of Former Soviet Citizens stipulates that registered
 permanent resident noncitizens enjoy the rights to establish and change residences,
 travel abroad, and return to the country. The law also provides for issuance of new
 noncitizen travel documents verifying these rights. After numerous delays, the CID
 announced that it would begin issuing the first of these documents in March 1997.
 Prior to the issuance of new noncitizen travel documents, and in apparent contradic-
 tion with this law, the CID continued to require noncitizens departing with former
 Soviet passports to obtain separate reentry guarantees. The CUD also continued to
 issue temporary noncitizen identification documents, which are valid for 2 years and
 accepted as travel documents by most foreign countries.
 Although the Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR), it is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees and
 does not have a law or established policy on political asylum, including first asylum
 or granting refugee status. Most of those seeking refugee status are persons from
 the Middle East and Central Asia entering by land from Russia or Belarus and hop-
 ing to reach Scandinavia. Latvia usually attempts to return such asylum seekers
 to the country from which they entered, but neighboring countries are generally
 willing to accept only their own citizens or legal residents.
 One group of over 100 asylum seekers, originally detained in 1995, remained in
 detention without trial outside Riga until December. The authorities were unwilling
 to grant asylum to these persons, mainly of Iraqi origin, who were attempting to
 reach Sweden and other Western European countries. No other country was pre-'
 pared to accept these individuals and no formal mechanism was in place to evaluate
 their claims or to convey any status other than that of illegal alien. In December,
 following extensive consultations with Latvia and the UNHCR, Nordic countries
 agreed to accept almost all the persons detained at Olaine. Nordic ministers empha-
 sized that this was an extraordinary measure, noted that the Latvian Government
 had received a proposal for comprehensive refugee legislation, and "assumed" that
 Latvia would adopt and implement refugee legislation in accordance with the 1951
 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.
 There were credible reports that as many as several dozen asylum seekers were
 taken to border areas by Interior Ministry personnel and forcibly expelled or pres-
 sured to leave the country "voluntarily." This matter was under investigation by the
 Interior Ministry, the NHRO, and the Prosecutor's Office.
 In August the Government established an interministerial working group to draft
 a comprehensive policy and legislation on refugee and asylum issues that would be
 consistent with the relevant international norms. In late November the working
 group submitted a draft law on refugee and asylum matters to the Cabinet, which
 was expected to review the proposal and transmit it to the Saeima in early 1997.
 Government officials characterized the draft law as the fin-st important step in es-
 tablishing a national framework on asylum and refugee issues. The working group
 also began to analyze the conditions under which Latvia could accede to the 1951
 Convention and its 1967 Protocol Officials continued to stress that their ability to
 deal with these problems would be greatly facilitated if neighboring countries would
 agree to readmit illegal migrants who entered Latvia from their territories. While
 Latvia was able to negotiate readmission agreements with its Baltic neighbors and
 some Nordic countries, it was particularly hampered by the lack of similar agree-
 ments with Russia and Belarus.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. There were free and fair elec-
 tions for Parliament (the Saeima) in 1995, with the participation of numerous par-
 ties and factions representing a brad political spectrum. Candidates from 11 par-
 ties won Saeima seats, and 72 percent of eligible voters participated.
 International observers deemed the parliamentary elections free and fair, al-
 though the elections law barred the candidacy of any citizen who remained active
 in thle Communist Party or various other pro-Soviet organizations after January 13,
 1991. There was also a Latvian language requirement for candidates. In 1996 sev-
 eral former candidates from the Socialist Party (including former Communist Party
 leader Afreds Rubiks) were tried for making false statements about their past ac-
 tivities in connection with their 1995 candidacies. A few were convicted and given
 token fines; Rubiks was convicted but no penalty was added to the 8-year sentence
 he is serving for seeking to overthrow the Government in 1991.
 In November the Saeima adopted a law 'with similar restrictions on the can-
 didates for local elections scheduled to be held in March 1997. The Saeima reconsid-
 ered but did not alter these restrictions after widespread protests by the supporters
 of one official, the Mayor of Daugavpils, who was reportedly active in the Com-
 munist Party after January 13, 1991. The Saeima also rejected a proposal to allow
 noncitizen residents to vote in local elections.
 In June the Parliament fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to elect an indi-
 vidual to serve a 3-year term as President. The Saeima chose freely among four can-
 didates in a secret ballot that resulted in the reelection of the incumbent President.
 A parliamentary effort to restrict the pool of presidential candidates on the basis
 of language ability or past Communist activities was returned by the President for
 reconsideration and did not enter into force. The Saeima subsequently voted on all
 persons duly nominated, including Rubiks, who received 5 votes.
 Following the restoration of independence in 1991, citizenship was immediately
 accorded only to those persons who were citizens of the independent Latvian Repub-
 lic in 1940 and their direct descendants. Owing to the Russification policy pursued
 during the Soviet era, ethnic Latvians make up only about 54 percent of the total
 population and do not onstitute a majority in seven of the eight largest cities. More
 than 70 percent of the registered residents are citizens, almost 400,000 of whom are
 not ethnic Latvian.
 Under provisions of a 1994 law, various categories of noncitizens become eligible
 to apply for naturalization over a period extending from 1995 until early in the next
 century. Highest priority was given to spouses of Latvian citizens, citizens of other
 Baltic states, and persons born in Latvia. The law includes a Latvian language and
 residence requirement as well as restrictions on naturalization of several groups in-
 cluding former Soviet intelligence and military officers. The law requires applicants
 for citizenship to renounce previous non-Latvian citizenship, to have knowledge of
 the Constitution and Latvian history, and to take a loyalty oath.
 International observers, including the resident Organization of Security and Co-
 operation in Europe (OSCE) mission, credit the Government with establishing a
 competent and professional naturalization board with offices throughout the country
 to implement the 1994 law. Early experience suggested that the board sought to
 apply the law fairly. About 1,000 persons were naturalized in 1995 and 3,000 in
 1996. Of more than 33,000 persons ages 16 to 20 years who became eligible to apply
 for naturalization in 1996, only a few hundred expressed interest in doing so. The
 reasons for this relatively small number may include potential applicants' lack of
 confidence about their language ability, the restricted category of applicants eligible
 to seek naturalization in the firt 2 years, certain benefits that flow from noncitizen
 status (such as travel without visas to Russia and exemption from compulsory mili-
 tary service), and a sense that the legal status of permanent resident noncitizens
 is relatively secure. Moreover, there were amendments to the citizenship law in
 1995 that granted automatic citizenship (rather than requiring naturalization) to
 ethnic Latvians returning to the country as well as to persons successfully complet-
 ing secondary education in Latvian language schools. These amendments allowed
 several thousand additional persons to register as citizens.
 In early 1996 proponents of a much more restrictive alternative citizenship law
 exercised their right to conduct a signature campaign in favor of holding a referen-
 dum on this issue. The campaign fell about 5,000 signatures short of the number
 needed to force a referendum.
 International experts, government officials, and domestic human rights monitors
 agreed that Latvia must continue to place high priority and devote sufficient re-
 sources to implementing the naturalization law in a fair, impartial manner. These
 same observers also agreed that the Government must provide greater opportunities
 
 
 1012
 for noncitizens to learn Latvian. In 1996 the Government worked with the United
 Nations Development Program (UNDP) to begin implementing a long-term nation-
 wide Latvian language teaching program for adults and for children in non-Latvian
 schools.
 The CID, which has administrative rsponsibility for registering noncitizens, has
 frequently failed to implement properly and fairly laws affecting noncitizens, most
 often by denyg noncitizen residents' applications for permanent resident status.
 Negative CID decisions are subject to judicial review, and are frequently overruled.
 However, the CI   was sometimes slow in complying with ourt rngs that over-
 turned its negative decisions. The Minister of Interior personally criticized CID per-
 formanc in these areas which he cited as the reason to initiate changes in person-
 nel and procedures. While problems remained, independent observers noted im-
 provements in the quality o the CID's .performance as well as a reduction in com-
 plaints about its work during the course of 1996.
 There are no ethnic restrictions on political participation, and some nonethnic
 Latvians serve in various elected bodies. There was no mechanism for the many
 residents of Latvia who were not citizens to participate in the elections.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. During the year less
 than 20 percent of parliamentarians and none of the full ministers in the Govern-
 ment were women. A woman was Speaker of the Parliament (the second ranking
 official after the President) for about 1 year before being replaced in late 1996.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A growing number of nongovernmental organizations devoted to research and ad-
 vocacy on human rights issues, including prison conditions and women's and chil-
 dren's rights, operate without government restriction. Several organizations deal
 with issues of concern to local noncitizens and other nonethnic Latvians, presenting
 them to the courts and the press.
 The Government demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialog with nongovern-
 mental organizations working on human rights issues. It welcomed visits by human
 rights organizations and received delegations from, among others the OSCE, the
 Council of Europe (COE), and the United Nations. A resident OSC mission contin-
 ued to operate with a mandate to "address citizenship issues and other related mat-
 ters.'
 The Government continued to implement its national program for the protection
 and promotion of human rights, which was adopted in 1995 upon the recommenda-
 tions of key international organizations. In December the Saeima adopted a law
 strengthening the NHRO's status as an independent institution with a mandate to
 promote respect for human rights. Under an acting director, the NHRO continued
 to fulfill its mandate to provide information on human rights, inquire into individual
 complaints and initiate its own investigations on alleged violations. Its permanent
 director will be appointed by the Government, confirmed by the Saeima for a 4-year
 term, and subject to dismissal only under limited circumstances. Initial financial dif-
 ficulties for the NHRO were overcome when the Parliament allocated sufficient
 funds to facilitate a long-term agreement with the UNDP for training and other in-
 stitutional support.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gon, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 According to the 1922 Constitution, all citizens are equal under the law. In De-
 cember the Saeima decided to establish a working group to elaborate a second sec-
 tion of the Constitution that would strengthen the constitutional protection of basic
 human rights and freedoms. The 1991 Constitutional Law, which supplements the
 Constitution, states that "all persons in Latvia" are equal under the law regardless
 of race, sex, religion, language, social status, political preference, or other grounds
 and grants equal rights to work and wages to "persons of all nationalities." How-
 ever, the Constitutional Law only grants to citizens the right to occupy state posi-
 tions, establish political parties, and own land
 Women.-Sources indicate that domestic violence against women is fairly wide-
 spread and is often connected with alcohol abuse. There is anecdotal evidence sug-
 gesting that the entire legal system, including the courts, tends to downplay the se-
 riousness of domestic violence. Observers suggest that police are sometimes reluc-
 tant to make arrests in such cases. The NHRO began to work with the Interior Min-
 istry to assist victims of domestic abuse and train law enforcement personnel in
 d=ealin with this problem.
 Both adult and child prostitution are widespread and often linked with organized
 crime. There is no legislation in force that specifically addresses these problems. In
 
 
 1013
 May for reasons that remain unclear, the Parliament repealed the only such provi-
 sions contained in the Administrative Code.
 Women possess the same le$ul rights as men. The Labor Code prohibits women
 from performin "hard jobs or jobs having unhealthy conditions," which are specified
 in a lit agreed upon between the Cabinet and labor unions. Moreover, the code
 bans employment discrimination. In reality women frequently face hiring and pay
 discrimination, especially in the emerging private sector. It is not unusual to see
 employment advertising that speificaly seeks men. Sexual harassment of women
 in ihe workplace is reportedly common. Women apparently have not brought any
 discrimination suits before the courts.
 Women's advocacy groups are growing in size and number. They are involved in
 finding employ      or women, lobbying for increased social benefits, assisting vic-
 tims of domestic abuse, and opposing the hazing of military recruits.
 Children.-Although it is government policy to ensure children's rights to basic
 health, welfare, and education, there is no general legislation outlining these rgts,
 and the Government lacks the necessary resources to provide them fully. For exam-
 ple, despite the existence of mandatory education, published reports suggested that
 as manyas 15,000 shool-age children failed to attend school.
 Evidence sugests that a andonment and child abuse, including sexual abuse, are
 relatively widespread, as is child prostitution. A few children's advocacy groups are
 active, particularly in lobbying for legislation to protect children's rights and or in-
 creased welfare payments for children. Law enforcement authorities have won court
 suits to remove children from abusive parents and secured convictions in child me-
 lestation cases.
 Although legislation had long provided for the establishment of spcil institu-
 tions for rehabilitation and vocational training of juvenile offenders, the Govern-
 ment only opned the first such institution in 1996. This facility is designed to re-
 duce the number of juveniles housed in regular prison facilities who have committed
 relatively minor offenses.
 People With Disabilities.--There is no law banning discrimination agis the dis-
 abled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons. It does not en-
 force a 1993 law requiring buildings to be accessible to wheek hairs, and most build-
 ings are not. However, Riga has undertaken an extensive wheelchair ramp program
 at intersections.
 Religious Minorities.-There was no progress reported in apprehending the per-
 petrators of the 1995 bombing of a Riga synagogue.
 Nationsol/RaciailEthnic Minoaties.-Of Latvia s more than 2.5 million registered
 residents, there are more than 765,000 ethnic Russians, 100,000 ethnic Belarusians,
 almost 70,000 ethnic Ukrainians, and more than 60,000 ethnic Poles. Nearly
 400,000 persons belonging to national or ethnic minorities are citizens. Because the
 majority of persons beloni g to national and ethnic minorities are not citizens, they
 have difficulty participating fully in civic life. Noncitizans who are temporary resi-
 dents have particular difficulty, but the size of this gup has greatly dimiidshed
 since the adoption and implementation of the 1995 wawron tge Stahuts of Former
 Soviet Citizens who do not hold Latvian or any other citizenship.
 This law reiterates guarantees of basic human rights and provides noncitizens
 who have been permanent residents continuously since July 1, 1992, with the rights
 to change residence, leave and return, and invite close relatives to join them for the
 purpose of family reunification. It also requires the registration of noncitizens re-
 gardless of their housing status, helping to resolve cases of persons previously un-
 registered because they lived in former Soviet military or dormitory housing. The
 law also provides for issuance of new travel documents reflecting these rights (see
 Section 2.d.).
 Various laws prohibit employment of noncitizens in certain categories, some of
 which appear to-be reasonable restrictions (e.g., only citizens can serve as Latvian
 diplomats while others seem less justified (e.g., service as crew members on Latvian
 National Airlines). There are also a few distinctions in the manner of calculating
 eligibility for social benefits such as pensions, though there was progress in 1996
 toward eliminating some of these differences. At the request of the p~arliamentary
 human _rights committee, the NHRO undertook a major study of a2 differences be-
 tween the status of citizens and noncitizens to determine whether they may be in-
 consistent with constitutional provisions or international obligations and to rec-
 ommend revisions in legislation if necessary. The study, released in Deember, iden-
 tified 10 differences between the rights of citizens and noncitizens that the NHRO
 considered to be inconsistent with ofligations under the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights. These included restrictions on noncitizen employment as
 fNefighters, armed guards, private detectives, members of airline crews, and car-
 timatrneya, as well as holding licenses as pharmacists. The Nud RO found most

 other differences to be consistent with international standards and practices that
 allow a state to limit government employment, political participation, and some
 property rights to those persons who are citizens.
 The language law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions, enter-
 pries, and institutes" to know sufficient Latvian to carry out their profession. The
 law also requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian in
 order to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language law, there have been
 no reports of widespread dismissals, even in the city of Daugavpils, in which only
 15 percent of the population is ethnically Latvian. Moreover Russian is the prevail-
 ing language in state-owned industrial enterprises. Nevertheless, many nonethnic
 Latvians believe that they have been disfranchised and that the language law dis-
 criminates against them. In October the Cabinet issued regulations requiring Lat-
 vian language competence for a person to be registered and receive benefits as an
 unemployed   rson.
 Some ethnic Russians have also complained of discrimination resulting from the
 property laws, which do not allow individual noncitizens to own land. Moreover,
 noncitizens were given fewer privatization certificates (which can be used to pur-
 chase shares of stik and to privatize apartments and land) than citizens. However,
 the law does allow land ownership by companies in which noncitizens own shares.
 The Riga City Council adopted a decision in August requiring noncitizens
 privatizing their apartments to obtain an additional document from the CID regard-
 ing their eligibility to receive noncitizens' travel documents. The Minister for Envi-
 ronmental Protection and Regional Development used his authority to overturn this
 provision, arguing that it would have created an unjustified administrative require-
 ment, and it did not enter into force.
 The Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the language of instruc-
 tion in public schools where the pupils are primarily Russian speakers. It also sup-
 ports schools in eight other minority languages. Although all non-Latvian-speaking
 students in public schools are supposed to learn Latvian and to study a minimum
 number of subjects in Latvian, there are shortages of qualified teachers.
 Most state-funded university education is in Latvian, and incoming students
 whose native language is not Latvian must pass a Latvian language entrance exam-
 ination. However, there are several private institutions offering higher education in
 Russian. In midyear the Minister of Education declined to authorize establishment
 of a branch of the Moscow State University in Riga, but the issue may be revisited.
 A lively debate continued over proposals in a draft education law that all second-
 ary education in public schools be in Latvian by the year 2005. The Parliament was
 considering several hundred amendments to the education law, and it took no le-
 gally binding decision on the long term prospects of state-funded minority language
 education.
 In July the President took the initiative to form an advisory council of nationali-
 ties residing in the country made up of persons nominated by the Latvian Associa-
 tion of National Cultural Societies and other prominent persons active in the field
 of interethnic relations. The council includes members representing a broad range
 of national minority groups, with a mandate "to discuss the most serious problems
 in order to promote their solution at the level of executive bodies or legislative ini-
 tiative." Members of the council reportedly agreed that they would begin by working
 cooperatively to address questions relating to education, citizenship, and differences
 between the status of citizens and noncitizens. In December the advisory council
 began to consider concrete issues and to make recommendations regardingpossible
 changes in regulations and legislation. For example, the council reportedly asked
 the Labor Department to reconsider the cabinet regulation adopted in October that
 requires persons to demonstrate Latvian language competence to qualify for unem-
 ployment benefits.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Law on Trade Unions mandates that workers,
 except for the uniformed milit, have the right to form and join labor unions of
 their own choosing. Union membership, which had been about 50 percent of the
 work force in 1993, continued to fall as workers left Soviet-era unions that include
 management or were laid off as Soviet-style factories failed. In general the trade
 union movement is undeveloped and still in transition from the socialist to the free
 market model.
 The law does not limit the right to strike. Although many state-owned factories
 are on the verse of bankruptc  and seriously behind in wage payments, workers
 fear dismissal if they strike. Whie the law bans such dismissals, the Government
 has not effectively enforced these laws.

 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are developing contacts with Euro-
 pean labor unions and international labor union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threaten to fire
 union members. These businesses usually provide better salaries and benefits than
 are available elsewhere. The Government's ability to protect the right to organize
 in the private sector is weak.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or corn-
 ulsory labor, and it is not practiced. Inspectors from the Ministry of Welfare's
 abIr Department enforce this ban.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 15 years, although those from 13 to 15 years of age may
 work in certain jobs after school hours. Children are required to attend school for
 9 years. The law restricts employment of those under age 18, for instance, by ban-
 ning night shift or overtime work, State authorities are lax in their enforcement of
 child labor and school attendance laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government raised the monthly minimum
 wage to about $70 (38 lat), far below the amount which trade union officials de-
 scribe as the bare minimum for survival. Many factories are virtually bankrupt and
 have reduced work hours. The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maxi-
 mum workweek with at least one 24-hour rest period weekly, 4 weeks of annual va-
 cation, and a program of assistance to working mothers with small children. The
 laws establish minimum occupational health and safety standards for the work-
 place, but these standards are frequently ignored. Workers have the legal right to
 remove themselves from hazardous work situations, but these standards are fre-
 quently ignored in practice.
