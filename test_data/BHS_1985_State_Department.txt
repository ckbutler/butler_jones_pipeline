 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy with
 regular national elections. As a Commonwealth country, its
 political and legal traditions are similar to those of Great
 Britain, with emphasis on the rights of individuals. The
 Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) has governed since 1967 under
 the same leader, Sir Lynden Pindling.
 The country has a strong tradition of human rights
 observance. The Constitution provides for the protection of
 fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination by
 reason of race, origin, political opinions, color, creed, or
 sex, and its provisions are carried out in practice. However,
 treatment of illegal Haitian migrants has sometimes led to
 concern for their safety and well-being.
 The police and small defense force are generally well regarded
 by the populace, but, like other elements of the the society,
 have experienced some drug-related corruption. Vigorous
 parliamentary and public debate occured in 1985 concerning
 charges of high-level corruption examined in a year-long
 Commission of Inquiry which completed its work in December
 1984. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and narcotics
 addiction are serious societal problems.
 The country's human rights record remained good during 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no killings for political motives during 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment are
 prohibited by the Constitution. American citizens as well as
 Bahamians, however, have on occasion reported instances of
 police brutality. Redress for official abuse is possible
 through the courts but is rarely sought. In a public address
 at the end of 1984, the Chief Justice of the Bahamas Supreme
 Court stated that "the area of police questioning of suspects
 (leading to confessions). . . remains disturbingly
 unsatisfactory." Another Supreme Court Justice in February
 1985, while presiding over a criminal case in which both
 defendants alleged being beaten by police while in custody,
 stated in court that he was not at all satisfied that the
 police distinguished themselves in the way in which their
 investigations were conducted. He recommended that the police
 consult a legal advisor before they begin investigations and
 stated that the police need be on guard that their
 investigative techniques "do not lead to injustice."
 The downtown Nassau jail is crowded and unsanitary, with food
 barely adequate; conditions at the Fox Hill Prison are austere
 
 
 415
 THE BAHAMAS
 and overcrowded but somewhat better. The Freeport central
 lockup is unsanitary.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and requires that persons be charged without undue delay.
 This is observed in practice. Habeas corpus is respected,
 charges must be brought within 48 hours of arrest, and those
 arrested are allowed access to lawyers of their own choosing.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 An independent judiciary conducts fair and public trials. The
 Constitution entitles defendants to counsel, and access to
 defendants is freely permitted. Legal representation at
 public expense. is only provided in capital cases. There are
 no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence.
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives of its
 citizens. The sanctity of the home is safeguarded both by law
 and tradition and is normally respected in practice. The
 Constitution permits searches to occur only with a
 court-issued warrant. Nevertheless, the former Deputy Prime
 Minister told the Parliament on June 3, 1985 that he had proof
 his telephone had been tapped without the authorization of
 either the Attorney General or the Minister responsible for
 the state-run telephone company.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press exist in the-Bahamas. There are
 three privately-owned daily newspapers, one government-owned
 radio station, and one government-owned television station.
 There are several news weeklies, some of which are affiliated
 with political parties, including one affiliated with the
 leftist Vanguard Party. There is no political censorship or
 intimidation of journalists.
 Vigorous and spirited parliamentary and public debate followed
 a December 1984 report of the Commission of Inquiry
 investigation into drug-related corruption in the country.
 Sizable public rallies and demonstrations took place largely
 without incident. The press reported the debates and
 demonstrations without hindrance.
 The Spearker of the House, however, has on occasion directly
 ordered the press not to report on specific matters which had
 transpired at Parliament which he, for various reasons,
 expunged from the official House records. The press has
 acquiesed to these orders. On one occasion in November,
 however, after a Nassau daily inadvertently published an
 expunged remark made by an oppostion member of Parliament, the
 Speaker summarily revoked the accreditation of the reporter
 who had written the news article.
 
 
 416
 THE BAHAMAS
 While the press is free, opposing points of view in the
 Bahamas are not afforded accurate and fair radio/TV
 treatment. In September 1985, the Broadcasting Corporation
 (ZNS) Chairman, a Member of Parliament from the ruling party,
 rationalized the ZNS' progovernment slant by stating publicly
 that while the ZNS should cover "the other side of the
 argument fairly and accurately," the Government "is the
 Government and almost daily by definition will make news."
 Under legislation predating both independence in 1973 and
 majority rule in 1967, the ZNS permits paid political
 broadcasts only once a year and then only for 15 minutes.
 In late July 1985, when the opposition was able to purchase
 air time, its paid broadcast of its youth organization's
 annual convention was interrupted on several occasions with
 the insertion of music during at least two of the speeches.
 The ZNS proGovernment leanings and restrictions on paid
 political pronouncements place a significant limitation on
 opposition political groups in getting their views to the
 general public. This especially inhibits the opposition from
 reaching the nearly one-third of the population living in the
 family islands, who are heavily dependent on the ZNS for news
 (the three major daily newspapers do not generally reach the
 family islands).
 Following the September 1983 broadcast by NBC alleging
 drug-related corruption by high-level government officials,
 NBC affiliates have experienced some difficulties in operating
 in the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The Constitution protects the right to assemble freely and
 associate with others and specifically mentions political
 parties and trade unions.
 Labor unions are independent of the Government and are free to
 organize, assemble, bargain, and strike. Many unions are
 affiliated with counterparts in other countries and are
 represented in the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 The Secretary General of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the
 umbrella organization encompassing most major trade unions,
 also serves as President of the regional Caribbean Congress of
 Labor. Following a complaint by the TUC and the Bahamas Union
 of Teachers, the ILO's Freedom of Association Committee in
 1985 criticized the Government for its 1983 action in the
 "compulsory retirement" of the teachers' union president from
 his position as a high school principal for reasons the ILO
 committee concluded were at least partially based on his trade
 union activities. The Committee also deplored the fact that
 the Government, despite several requests, made no reply to the
 allegations.
 Prominent labor leaders are vocal in criticizing current labor
 law. The TUC has frequently called on the Government to
 ratify many ILO conventions, in particular numbers 87, 98, and
 140 relating to the right to join a union of his/her choosing,
 the right to organize in the work place, and paid educational
 leave.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, freedom of conscience is
 protected, and discrimination on the basis of creed is
 
 
 417
 THE BAHAMAS
 prohibited. Some members of the small Rastafarian cult
 believe they are singled out for persecution by the police;
 the police deny the allegations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There exists freedom of movement within and outside the
 country. However, the legal status of an estimated
 20,000-40,000 Haitians now residing in the Bahamas is
 precarious. In early September 1985, a treaty was signed
 between the Bahamas and Haiti legalizing the status under
 specified, restricted conditions of undocumented Haitian
 immigrants who arrived prior to December 31, 1980. All others
 are to be repatriated in an orderly and humane manner. A 2
 month amnesty period was declared for voluntary repatriation
 without prosecution. There has been criticism voiced in the
 past on the handling of previous forced repatriations of large
 numbers of illegal Haitians. The health and safety of Haitian
 migrants aboard unseaworthy or shipwrecked vessels in the
 Bahamas were imperiled on several occasions in 1985 by
 official Bahamian policy and actions designed to expedite.
 their departure from Bahamian territory. In August 1985, over
 130 Haitians were stranded on uninhabited Flamingo Cay when
 their boat ran aground. The Royal Bahamian Defense Force
 (RBDF) attempted to tow the vessel with the Haitians aboard
 back to.sea but abandoned its effort when it became clear the
 Haitian vessel would sink before it reached international
 waters. The Haitians remained on inhospitable Flamingo Cay
 for 2 weeks until rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy governed by a freely
 elected Prime Minister and Parliament, with a resident
 Governor General under the British Commonwealth system. The
 political process is open to all elements of the society.
 There are two principal political parties, the governing
 Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition Free
 National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for five
 years of internal self-government before independence in 1973
 and has held power without interruption since then. It
 currently holds 32 of the 43 seats in Parliament. The FNM, a
 more conservative party, holds the other 11 seats. The
 radical leftist party, the Vanguard, has no seats.
 The last general election was in 1982; new elections need not
 take place before 1987 but can be called sooner.
 The PLP has been charged with using its tenure in office to
 strengthen its position through politically motivated hiring
 and firing of officials and through selective issuance of such
 things as housing grants, scholarships, and government
 contracts. These practices are drawing increasing criticism
 from opposition figures as well as PLP dissidents. As an
 example of such practices, in January 1985 the Government
 attempted to block the reappointment of two medical doctors to
 the Bahamas Medical Council for what appeared to be political
 reasons; the Medical Association used its two independent
 appointments to reappoint the two doctors to the Council.

 THE BAHAMAS
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international organizations
 to investigate human rights conditions in the Bahamas. The
 Government has not generally been active in human rights
 affairs, but it has strongly criticized human rights
 violations in South Africa. Amnesty International did not
 mention the Bahamas in 1985. Freedom House rated the country
 "free" but noted that government power is partly maintained
 "by discrimination in favor of supporters and control over the
 broadcast media."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of the Bahamas is estimated to be 231,000, with
 a growth rate of 1.8 percent. The country is made up of some
 700 islands or cays; only 10 have populations of any size. Of
 these, two islands, New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama,
 contain over 75 percent of the population. Most economic and
 cultural activities take place on these two islands.
 The Government has sought to develop the other, "family"
 islands to curb the movement by young people to the two major
 centers of activity. Per capita gross national product was
 estimated at $5,552 for 1984. The rate of inflation for 1984
 was 4.6 percent, while the overall unemployment figure for
 1979 was 19.6 percent (for those between 14 and 19 it is
 estimated at 42.1 percent, and for those between 20 and 24)
 22.7 percent . The Government is continuing to attempt to
 reduce unemployment by creating new jobs in tourism through
 both private and public investment.
 The Bahamas has a good record of nondiscrimination on sexual,
 racial, and religious grounds. Notwithstanding the transfer
 of political power from the colonial era's white elite to a
 black majority (80 percent) in the 1960's, white Bahamians
 retain a visible presence in the country, hold high-level
 civil service and political posts, and are represented in
 Parliament. Life expectancy at birth is 69.58 years, while
 infant mortality is 20.60 per 1,000 births. The Bahamas has
 948 hospital beds, and Ministry of Health doctors make regular
 trips to the outer islands. 1978 statistics indicate that 80
 percent 6f the total population had access to safe water
 (urban 90 percent, rural 70 percent). Calorie supply as a
 percent of requirements was 84.63 in 1977.
 In education, the Government is continuing to place emphasis
 on technical and vocational training. Literacy rates have
 remained about 93 percent over the past decade, but the 1982
 primary school enrollment ratio fell to 88.22 percent. There
 has been a weakening of education in the public school system
 as result of shortages of teachers, equipment, and supplies as
 well as the physical deterioration of many schools. According
 to the Minister of Education, the results of the National
 Grade Level Assessment Tests taken in May and June 1985
 indicate "serious deficiencies" in the 163 public and 62
 private schools.
 Although there is no minimum wage law in the Bahamas, wages
 offered are generally considered to provide for decent living
 conditions. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1970 states that
 employers cannot permit their employees to work more than 48
 
 
 419
 THE BAHAMAS
 hours per week; the act also provides for a number of other
 worker benefits. It does not, however, address the question
 of child labor, but child labor is effectively discouraged by
 the requirement of cumpulsory education until the age of 14.
 Although there is no specific legislation dealing with worker
 safety, the office of the Director of Labor regularly checks
 all work places for lighting, safety, ventilation, maching
 protective guards, etc. Employers cooperate with these
 inspections and in implementing safety recommendations made
 from them.
 With a few minor exceptions women enjoy equal rights in both
 law and practice. Women participate prominently in all levels
 of Government and business, and are well represented in
 professional and private sectors. Women serve as Permanent
 Secretaries in ministries (the highest civil service
 position), in the legislative branch in elected and appointed
 capacities, and in the judicial branch. The Constitution
 does, however, make several distinctions between males and
 females regarding citizenship and the acquisition of permanent
 resident status. For example, female Bahamians can not bestow
 citizenship upon their spouses, but male Bahamians can.
 Drug abuse is a growing problem, especially among the younger
 generation affected by high unemployment. Primarily the
 result of spill-over from the drug traffic in transit to the
 U.S., the ready availability of cocaine has led to a high
 level of addiction. Several privately sponsored programs are
 attempting to address the problem. Government assistance to
 these efforts has so far been limited to a $10,000
 contribution to the programs of the National Drug Council.
 
 
 420
 BARBADOS
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Barbados is a
 constitutional democracy with a free, two-party democratic
 system of government. Its House of Assembly is the third
 oldest elected body in the.Western Hemisphere. Barbadians
 recognize the Queen of England as Head of State; she is
 represented by an appointed Governor-General. The Prime
 Minister is the Head of Government.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force ensures public order; it
 respects constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights.
 Its personnel and training have improved in recent years
 police morale is good, and public respect for the police force
 is high. Barbados has a well-established judicial system
 based on common law and British procedure.
 The country's economy is based on light manufacturing,
 tourism, services, and sugar.
 There were no changes in Barbados's excellent human rights
 record during 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killings for political motives were reported during 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1985 of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Prison conditions are humane,
 although some overcrowding has been reported as a result of an
 increase in the prison population, principally due to drug-
 related crimes. Prison facilities are being expanded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. The
 Constitution also guarantees the writ of habeas corpus; the
 authorities must bring detainees before a court of law within
 72 hours of arrest. Criminal defendants have the right to
 counsel, and attorneys have ready access to their clients.
 The use of any form of forced or compulsory labor is
 prohibited by law and that prohibition is respected.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.
 
 
 421
 BARBADOS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property can be entered and
 searched. The Government neither censors the mail nor
 restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or
 publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. The Caribbean
 Broadcasting Corporation Radio and Television Service is
 government-owned, but is independent of government control.
 Views opposing government policies are regularly reported.
 b.    Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government of Barbados observes the constitutional
 guarantees of peaceful assembly and private association.
 Various trade associations and private organizations function
 without government hindrance.
 Workers have the right to organize, to bargain collectively,
 and to strike. Fifty percent of the labor force is organized,
 and protests or strikes have occurred when collective
 bargaining has failed. Although one major union has ties to
 the opposition party, labor leaders and rank-and-file trade
 union members are motivated primarily by economic and social
 rather than political considerations.
 c.    Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. The Anglican and Methodist
 faiths predominate, but there are numerous active religious
 denominations and organizations throughout the country.
 d.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and lega-l residents move freely within and outside
 Barbados, a right guaranteed by the Constitution. Barbados
 has a small number of applicants for admission as refugees or
 asylees; these applicants are handled on a case-by-case basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In Barbados's parliamentary democracy, parties compete freely
 in honest elections held at least every 5 years. There are no
 impediments to participation in the political process;
 Barbadians over age 18 enjoy universal suffrage.
 The present Barbados Labor Party Government won elections in
 1976, and was reelected in June 1981, with 17 of the 27
 assembly seats. The differences between the government party
 and the opposition Democratic Labor Party are based more on
 history and personalities than on ideology. Both parties tend
 toward democratic socialist policies, and they have assumed
 
 
 422
 BARBADOS
 office in turn during three decades of self-rule. The "loyal
 opposition" criticizes the Government in a generally
 constructive fashion and would not hesitate to call attention
 to human rights abuses. A third party, the Workers Party of
 Barbados, was formed in early 1985, but has not contested an
 election.
 Prime Minister J.M.G.M. "Tom" Adams died suddenly in March
 1985, and was succeeded under the Constitution by Deputy Prime
 Minister H. Bernard St. John. The ruling Barbados Labor Party
 won a May by-election for Adams's vacant seat.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of human rights violations in Barbados
 during 1985, and human rights groups have not requested
 investigations. Barbados advocates strengthening the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations and the Organization of
 American States. The Government favors more investigations
 into alleged violations of human rights in other countries and
 the increased use of factfinding or observer teams to monitor
 controversial political and electoral situations. The
 Government has spoken out on human rights violations in other
 countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere and Africa.
 Several small groups in Barbados foster consciousness of human
 rights.
 The 1985 Amnesty International Report expressed concern over
 the use of capital punishment in 1984. Freedom House gives
 Barbados a rating of "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Barbados has a population of 252,000, with a growth rate of
 only 0.5 percent owing to continued emigration and a declining
 birth rate. The economy, which until 1980 had enjoyed several
 years of solid growth, suffered through a slack period between
 1981 and 1983.  An upswing in tourism and increased exports
 of light manufactures resulted in a 2.9 percent growth in
 gross domestic product in 1984. According to figures for the
 first half of 1985, stagnation in regional markets contributed
 to a more sluggish 1.0 percent annual growth rate. In 1983,
 per capita gross national product was $4,050.
 Citizens have long had access to public and private
 educational systems, and the adult literacy rate is 99
 percent. Primary school enrollment is compulsory. Looking
 ahead to future educational needs, the Government has begun to
 expand the secondary school system.
 Adequate medical care is available to all residents through
 local clinics and hospitals under the Government's health
 program. Government health insurance programs cover all
 Barbadians. Average life expectancy is 72.16 years, and there
 is one doctor for every 1,500 people. Infant mortality is
 14.2 per 1,000 live births.
 The legal minimum working age in Barbados is 16, a law which
 is respected. The work week is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks annual leave.
 Occupational safety and health conditions are in keeping with
 
 
 423
 BARBADOS
 International Labor Organization (ILO) standards. The minimum
 wage established by law is arguably less than that on which a
 person can be reasonably expected to live.
 Barbadian law does not discriminate on the basis of race or
 sex. Barbados is a signatory of the 1979 Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life.
 One cabinet member is a woman, and women are well represented
 at all levels in both the public and private sectors. Women's
 groups speak out on public issues and insist on being
 consulted by the Government on important issues.
