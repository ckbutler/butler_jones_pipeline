 MOROCCO
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Hassan
 II, who succeeded his father on the throne in 1961.
 Ultimate political authority remains concentrated in the
 Monarchy. At the same time, members of the Parliament have,
 since the election, engaged in discussion and criticism of
 government policies. In 1977, the Parliament passed a
 resolution calling on the government to release all
 political prisoners. Opposition parties are active, and the
 press is permitted to engage in discussion of government
 policies. Criticism of the institution of the monarchy and
 its powers is effectively prohibited.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Amnesty International has charged that torture is endorsed
 by Moroccan law enforcement authorities. It has also
 alleged that torture is not confined-to political prisoners.
 Reports of abuse have declined in frequency since the early
 1970's and consist mainly-of infrequent instances of alleged
 harsh interrogation measures.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are old and overcrowded. The government is seeking
 to improve them but lacks funds. It formed ad hoc committees
 of inquiry in 1978 following hunger strikes y- prisoners
 over prison conditions. These committees, one of which
 included opposition parliamentarians and doctors and lawyers
 from the private sector, succeeded in negotiating compromises
 which ended hunger strikes on at least three occasions.
 There were no new hunger strikes in 1979, but some problems
 have reportedly arisen involving inadequate medical care for
 prisoners.
 Since 1973-74, when approximately thirty persons were tried
 and executed for high treason, no persons have been executed
 for crimes against the state.
 The Government does not use exile as a punishment, but some
 political dissidents are in self-imposed exile. In the last
 two years, the government has allowed several prominent
 exiles, at least one of whom had been condemned to death in
 absentia, to return to the country without imprisonment.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As many as several thousand Moroccans were arrested or
 detained during the period after the coup attempts of 1971
 or 1972 and disturbances of early 1973. Most of those
 accused in the coup attempts were tried in military
 tribunals. Many of those implicated in the 1973 disturbances
 were held for prolonged periods without trial. However, the
 number of detainees was significantly reduced by trials,
 releases and amnesties between 1974 and 1979.

 Another 100 young Moroccans were arrested and detained
 without trial in the spring of 1977 on charges of taking
 part in clandestine and subversive leftist activities. Some
 were released in 1977 and 1978. An estimated 60 are still
 detained. According to a December 7 communique of a Paris-
 based organization, the appeals court in Rabat recently
 overturned those convictions. Based on its ruling, the
 court ordered the immediate release of 8 prisoners, and the
 deportation of one released French national.
 In brief, while there are still prisoners who were arrested
 or imprisoned arbitarily, the number is much smaller than
 what it was six years ago. Members of the major opposition
 party also make this assessment. Amnesty International is
 currently working for approximately 180 prisoners of
 conscience in Morocco. It is also investigating cases of
 people of Sahraoui origin living in Morocco who reportedly
 have been secretly detained without charge or trial.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Some persons engaged in or directly implicated in the 1971
 and 1972 attempts against the life of the King were summarily
 executed. Some detained after these incidents are still
 being held incommunicado. Most were tried in military
 courts; there is a small number of others who have never
 been tried.
 With the notable exception of the young men arrested in June
 1977 (see above) and possibly some Saharans, persons
 detained for anti-government activities since 1972 have been
 tried in open court. A representative of Amnesty International
 who attended the trials in late 1976 expressed his satisfaction
 with the conduct of the court. On the other hand, a later
 Amnesty International report alleged that at the 1977
 trials, the rights of the defendants to testify, to be
 informed of the charges against them, and to receive
 unimpeded representation by counsel were not respected. The
 Moroccan Ministry of Justice, in a press release of November
 21, 1977, pointed out that restrictions were necessary
 because both defendants and lawyers had violated court
 procedure by attempting to creat disorder and confusion.
 There were no changes in this situation in 1979.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There have been scattered press reports of intrusions into
 private homes by officials without observance of legal
 safeguards protecting individuals from" arbitrary searches,
 but there is no evidence of widespread abuse.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Government addresses social and economic problems
 through programs such as redistribution of state-owned land,
 subsidies, and liberal credit for farmers, social services,
 and low-cost housing. The proposed 1980 budget provides a
 modest (10 percent) increase in expenditures over 1979, as
 the "austerity" economic policies enter what is hoped will
 be their last year. The Government's presentation emphasizes
 that, despite the needs of the war effort, plus the other
 
 
 798
 pressures for austerity, Morocco remains determined to
 devote increased attention and resources to the social
 sector.
 Aside from national defense, the education sector receives
 the greatest budgetary allotments: about 21 percent of the
 budget for 1980.
 The Government has not met its development goals, especially
 those involving the rural poor. Morocco's emphasis on a
 capital intensive program limits the short-run benefit for
 Morocco's poorest citizens. An important exception is
 Morocco's major irrigation network program. Strong efforts
 have been made to combat illiteracy, but with little success
 so far.
 Morocco has a complex tax system. There are sales taxes on
 products, sales, and services. The income tax system
 exempts individuals with incomes below approximately $5,000.
 (Annual per capita income is $742.) The income tax rates
 increase progressively to 36 percent at the highest income
 levels. Housing and real estate taxes also have a heavy
 impact on the higher income brackets. Income and land
 distribution, however, remains severely imbalanced. In
 1977, for example, three percent of farmers owned 34 percent
 of the land and-accounted for 85 percent of the commercial
 agricultural production.
 Corruption exists. However, several institutionalized
 forces operate as a brake. For example, the local and
 national representatives elected in 1976-77 have proved to
 be a positive force in reducing the incidence of corruption
 among officials. The opposition party press frequently
 publicizes individual cases of suspiciously acquired wealth.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are all guaranteed under the 1972 constitution.
 Internal press censorship was lifted in 1977. Media
 criticism of the administration, social conditions, and all
 governmental institutions, with the notable exception of the
 monarchy, is commonplace. The Government prevented publication
 of a December 1978 opposition party resolution calling for a
 modification of the King's authority.
 The Government tolerates a wide range of political and
 religious groups. During the 1976-77 electoral campaign all
 parties were allowed to speak and to hold meetings, although
 the opposition was harassed, especially in the conservative
 countryside. In November 1979 the six year old ban on the
 national student union was lifted and that organization was
 vigorously active in 1979.
 Morocco is notable for religious tolerance. Although large
 numbers of Moroccan Jews left the country after the 1967 and
 1973 Arab/Israeli wars, about 18,000 remain in the country.
 The government has urged those who have left to return.
 The constitution guarantees the right to join trade unions
 and the right to strike. The Conferation of Trade Unions
 (UMT) is one of the oldest labor movements in Africa. Two
 unions allied with political parties compete with the UMT.
 
 
 799
 Although most strikes were conducted in 1979 without
 interference, government authorities acted under a 1958 decree
 in April 1979 to declare public sector strikes illegal and
 against the national interest. Over 600 striking teachers
 and health workers were arrested. Some 230 were tried and
 given sentences averaging one to two months. The Democratic
 Federation of Labor (CDT) protested both internally and to
 the ILO that the 1958 decree was invalid.
 Discrimination against women is prohibited by law. French
 educational traditions have opened some doors to Moroccan
 women. Nevertheless, this partial liberalization is limited
 for the most part to urban areas, while the role of women in
 the predominantly rural and traditional Muslim environment
 remains restricted, as it has been over the centuries. No
 woman has ever held a Cabinet position in Morocco, nor is
 there any woman in the 264-member parliament.
 The parliament has passed legislation protecting women's
 rights after divorce. The government with support from the
 Agency for International Development has also accelerated
 labor and family planning projects designed to improve the
 lot of women. Some 36 percent of children in primary
 schools are female, a slight improvement over the 32 percent
 in 1968 (year of last available data).
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco.
 Foreign travel "for political reasons" was sometimes
 restricted in years past, but not now. The difficulty in
 obtaining foreign currency imposes significant practical
 limitations, however, on would-be travellers.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is considerable opportunity for participation in
 Morcco's political life, given the diverse and well
 organized groups now functioning. Suffrage is universal.
 Including the majority independent party, five political
 parties are represented in the current parliament; two of
 these, a left-socialist party and a communist party,
 constitute the opposition. The opposition vigorously
 criticizes the government's policies in parliament and in
 its press. In recent years, there has been a noticeable
 increase in grass-roots involvement in local politics.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 International and other civil and human rights groups have
 been permitted to send observers to trials, and these
 observers have been received by officials of the Moroccan
 government. In January 1978, the Minister of Justice
 publicly invited Amnesty International or any other
 humanitarian organization to send impartial observers to
 visit Moroccan courts and prisons. Apparently no such
 observers have been sent to date. In 1979, the Prime
 Minister offered to a visiting western European legislator
 to make any prison available for inspection by appropriate
 persons.
 A Moroccan human rights association was formed in Rabat in
 June 1979 and subsequently established branches elsewhere in
 the country. It has condemned all forms of human rights
 violations, and has called for the government to respect the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition, it has
 asked the government to revise its legislation concerning
 women and children and to respect the individual citizen's
 rights, whatever his cultural, political, and ideological
 beliefs.
