 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro, who is Chief of
 State, Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Part, and com-
 mander in chief of the armed forces. President Castro exercises controlover all as-
 pects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organiza-
 tions, the government bureaucracy, and the state security apparatus. The Com-
 munist Party is the only legal political entity, and President Castro personally ap-
 proves the membership of the Politburo, the select group that heads the party. The
 party controls all government positions, including judicial offices.
 The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. Officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), which are led by Presi-
 dent Castro's brother Raul, have been assigned to the majority of key positions in
 the Ministr of Interior in recent years. In addition to the routine law enforcement
 functions of tegulating migration, controlling the Border Guard and the regular po-
 lice forces, the Interior Ministry's Department of State Security investigates and ac-
 tively suppresses organized opposition and dissent. It maintains a pervasive system
 of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, the raid response brigades, and
 the Comttees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR s). While the Government
 traditionally used the CDR's to mobilize citizens against dissenters, impose ideologi-
 cal conformity, and root out "counter- revolutionary" behavior, severe economic prob-
 lems have reduced the willingness of citizens to participate in the CDR's and there-
 by lessened their effectiveness. Other mass organizations also inject government
 and Communist Party control into citizens' daily activities at home, work, and
 school.
 The Government continued to control all significant means ofpreduction and re-
 mained the predominant employer, despite permitting some carefully controlled for-
 eign investment. Foreign  employers continue to contract workers through state
 agencies, which pay the workers extremely low wages while receiving large hard
 currency payments. The Government has also legaized some minor categories of
 self-employment. Although the Government forecast a modest economic growth rate
 of some 2.5 percent (down from a claimed 7.8 percent in 1996), the economy re-
 mained depressed due to the inefficiencies of the centrally controlled economic sys-
 tem; the deterioration of plant, equipment, and the transportation system; the col-
 lapse of trade relations with the former Soviet bloc; the loss of billions of dollars
 of annual Soviet subsidies; and the poor performance of the important sugar har-
 vest. For the seventh straight year, the Government continued its austerity meas-
 ures known euphemistically as the "special period in peacetime." Agricultural mar-
 kets, legalized in 1994, gave consumers wider access to meat and produce, although
 at prices beyond the reach of most Cubans living on peso-only incomes. The system
 of tourist apartheid" continued, with foreign visitors who pay in hard currency re-
 ceiving preference over citizens for food, consumer products, and medical services.
 Citizens remain barred from access to the tourism industrys hotels, beaches, and
 resorts.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. It continued systemati-
 cally to violate fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. There were several credible reports of
 death due to excessive use of force by the police. Members of the security forces and
 prison officials continued to beat and otherwise abuse detainees and prisoners. Pris-
 on conditions remained harsh. The authorities routinely continued to harass, threat-
 en, arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, and defame human rights advocates and
 members of independent professional associations, including journalists, economists,
 and lawyers, often with the goal of goading them into leaving the country. The Gov-
 ernment used internal and external exile against such persons, and political pris-
 
 
 oners were offered the choice of exile or continued imprisonment. The Government
 denied political dissidents and human rights advocates due process and subjected
 them to unfair trials. The judiciary is completely subordinate to the Government
 and to the Communist Party. The Government infringed, upon citizens' right to pri-
 vacy. The Government denied citizens the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and
 association. It limited the distribution of foreign publications and news to selected
 party faithful. The Government kept tight restrictions on freedom of movement, and
 some religious activities were restricted. The Government was sharply and publicly
 antagonistic to all criticism of its human rights practices and sought to thwart for-
 eign contacts with human rights activists. Discrimination against women and racial
 discrimination often occur. The Government severely restricted worker rights, in-
 cluding the right to form independent unions
 In April the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) again passed
 a resolution endorsing the report of the UNRC Special Rapporteur, which detailed
 Cuba's human rights violations. For the fifth consecutive year, the Government re-
 fused the Special Rapporteur permission to visit Cuba.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by government officials. However, there were several credible re-
 ports of death due to the excessive use of force by the national police; government
 sanctions against the perpetrators were typically light.
 On May 21, Guantanamo policeman Marcos Moran Peregrin reportedly shot 27-
 year-old Gaspar Torres Vegne. Three policemen apparently stopped Torres while he
 was riding home on his bicycle. The ensuing police search turned violent; Torres was
 struck and fell to the ground, where Moran shot him. Torres died in the hospital
 on June 3. The Guantanamo provincial court held a closed-door trial and sentenced
 Moran to 3 years in prison, one-half the sentence the prosecutors requested. Subse-
 quent to the trial, a human rights group protested the harassment by the police
 against Torres's nephew, Penis Fornier Torres, as an apparent reprisal for Fournier
 having prssed changes against Moran.
 During the year, at least seven explosive devices detonated in hotels and a res-
 taurant in Havana. One of the explosions killed an Italian tourist on September 4.
 On September 10, the Government announced the arrest of El Salvador citizen Raul
 Ernesto Cruz Leon and charged him with being the "material author" of the killings.
 At year's end, Cruz Leon remained in detention and had not been tried.
 In October 1996, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) is-
 sued its final report on the Government's July 13, 1994, sinking of the "13th of
 March" tugboat which killed 41 persons, including women and children. The IACHR
 concluded that the Government violated the American Declaration on the Rights
 and Duties of Man and found the Government legally obligated to indemnify the
 survivors and the relatives of the victims for the damages caused; at year's end, the
 Government had not yet done so.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners, but there
 were instances in which members of the security forces and prison officials beat and
 otherwise abused human rights advocates, detainees, and prisoners. For example,
 human rights groups in Pinar del Rio province reported that on March 21, police
 officer Luis Montano and another policeman beat Luis Reyes Ledesma and then
 forced him into a crypt at the Arroyo Mantua cemetery for 3 hours because Reyes
 refused to answer.the policemen's questions.
 Individuals linked to state security forces subjected human rights advocates to
 physical aggression and threats. On May 1, state security officers punched, kicked,
 and dragged human rights activist Ana Maria Agramonte from her home after she
 declined to restrict her movements during the May Day Communist Party celebra-
 tions. Agramonte was subsequently charged with disrespect and sentenced to 18
 months in prison on May 16, without the benefit of defense counsel.
 In June state security police in Cienfuegos detained human rights activists Miguel
 Angel Hernandez and Benito Fojaco. During the interrogations, they were put in a
 small storage cabinet and exposed to noxious fumes for over an hour before being
 released. In October state security police detained Fojaco and five other human
 rights activists in Cienfuegos. At year's end, they remained in detention and under
 investigation on charges of distributing enemy propaganda.
 In July state security officers conducted a search of the home of human rights ac-
 tivist Jesus Yanez Pelletier. The officers threatened Yanez Pelletier and his partner,
 
 
 warning that her children would be taken away should they continue their activi-
 ties. An officer pointed to one of her children's drawings that depicted a human
 rights theme and said that it showed that they were not raising the children prop-
 erly, that is, "within the revolution." The officer threatened to bring a government
 child specialist to "evaluate" the children and the adults' "fitness" to continue rais-
 ing them.
 Similarly, in August state security officers repeatedly threatened human rights
 activist Leonel Morejon Almagro (see Section l.d.) and his wife Zoiris Aguilar
 Callejas with the loss of their child. The officers warned that both parents might
 be sent to jail and the child might be taken from them to be raised by the State,
 unless they ceased their activities in opposition to the State.
 The Government continued to subject those who disagree with it to "acts of repu-
 diation." At state security instigation, members of state-controlled mass organiza-
 tions, workmates, or neighbors are obliged to stage public protests against those
 who dissent from the Government's policies, shouting obscenities and often causing
 damage to the homes and property of those targeted; physical attacks on the victims
 are not uncommon. Police and state security agents are often present but take no
 action to prevent or end the attacks. On May 31, four men attacked independent
 journalist Joaquin Torres at his home in Havana; the men then led an act of repudi-
 ation against him as police stood by without intervening. In June human rights ac-
 tivists in Pinar del Rio were subjected to acts of repudiation at their work places
 by fellow workers coerced into participating by government union foremen; police or
 local authorities ordered other activists to go to government facilities where they
 were also subjected to these acts.
 Prison conditions continued to be harsh. The Government claims that prisoners
 have rights, such as family visitation, adequate nutrition, pay for work, the right
 to request parole, and the right to petition the prison director. However, police and
 prison officials often denied these rights and used beatings, neglect, isolation, denial
 of medical attention, and other forms of abuse against detainees and prisoners, in-
 cluding those convicted of political crimes or who persisted in expressing their
 views. There are separate prison facilities for women and for minors.
 The IACHR reported that prison authorities subjected prisoners who protested
 their conditions or treatment to reprisals such as beatings, transfer to punishment
 cells, transfer to prisons far from their families, suspension of family visits, or de-
 nial of medical treatment. A member of the France-Liberte delegation that visited
 Cuba in May 1995 interviewed political prisoners and stated that lengthy and often
 incommunicado pretrial detention constitutes a form of psychological torture. State
 security officials also subjected dissidents to threats of physical violence, as well as
 to systematic psychological intimidation, sleep deprivation, imprisonment in cells
 with common criminals, aggressive homosexuals, or state security agents posing as
 prisoners, in an attempt to coerce them to sign incriminating documents or to be-
 come state security collaborators. Prison authorities often placed political prisoners
 in cells with common and sometimes violent criminals and required that they com-
 ply with the rules for common criminals.
 In December Amnesty International (Al) called on the Government to stop abu-
 sive treatment of Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina, and Francisco
 Herodes Diaz Echemendia, held in Combinado de Guantanamo prison. In September
 over 30 guards reportedly beat and badly injured the three prisoners while they
 were handcuffed. In October they were being held naked, in punishment cells with-
 out bedding, and being denied medical treatment. AI asked the Government to stop
 holding the prisoners in conditions it termed "cruel, inhuman, and degrading," to
 undertake an impartial investigation, and to punish those responsible for the
 abuses.
 Jesus Chamber Ramirez, sentenced to 10 years in prison for enemy propaganda
 and disrespect against government authority, was regularly denied family visits for
 insisting that he be treated as a political rather than a common prisoner. Chamber
 was transferred in July from Kilo 8 prison in Camaguey to Bayamo prison, closer
 to his family in Santiago de Cuba, but prison guards continued to bait him and
 order him to shout slogans favorable to the President. Chamber responded with con-
 trary slogans; as a result, he was charged and sentenced twice to additional 2-year
 terms for disrespect, with a possible third charge pending. I'I September, Chamber,
 whose prison term stands at 14 years, was again placed in solitary confinement for
 having shouted "down with Fidel." Chamber has held numerousrhunger strikes of
 short duration to protest poor prison conditions; he and another inmate, Julio
 Moralez Gonzalez, reported that they have been beaten and punished for demanding
 better treatment. At year's end, Chamber's third trial for disrespect was still pend-
 ing.
 
 
 484
 The rights to adequate nutrition and medical attention also were violated regu-
 larly. The IACHR described the nutritional and hygienic situation in the prisons,
 together with the deficiencies in medical care, as "alarming." Both the IACHR and
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur, as well as other human rights monitoring organiza-
 tions, reported the widespread incidence in prisons of tuberculosis, scabies, hepa-
 titis, parasitic infections, and malnutrition.
 Prison officials regularly denied prisoners other rights, such as the right of cor-
 respondence, and continued to confiscate medications and food brought by family
 members for political prisoners. State security officials in Havana's Villa Marista fa-
 cility took medications brought by family members for detainees and then refused
 togive the detainees the medicine, despite repeated assurances that they would.
 In January prison guards placed Leonel Morejon Almagro in solitary confinement
 for 4 days for trying to send a letter to Cardinal Ortega requesting his intercession
 for a pastoral visit, which authorities had denied to Morejon since his detention 10
 months earlier. On May 7, officials in Pinar del Rio's Kilometer 51/2 prison denied
 pastoral visits to Rosa Maria Pujol Llanes. Pujol's family had requested the visits
 ecause of Pujol's poor health and concern for her state of mind. Pujol reportedly
 lost over 50 pounds since entering prison; she is serving a 10-year sentence for "pi-
 racy."
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions by
 international or national human rights monitoring groups. Human rights activists
 continued to seek information on conditions inside jails despite the risks to them-
 selves and to their prison sources. On September 5, a military tribunal sentenced
 human rights activist Maritza Lugo to 2 years of house arrest for "bribery," for hav-
 ing attempted to smuggle a tape recorder into a prison in order to obtain direct tes-
 timony from inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Penal Procedures requires
 police to file formal charges and either release a detainee or bring the case before
 a prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest. It also requires the authorities to provide
 suspects with access to a lawyer within 7 days of arrest. However, the Constitution
 states that all legally recognized civil liberties can be denied to anyone who actively
 opposes the "decision of the Cuban people to build socialism." The authorities rou-
 tinely invoke this sweeping authority to deny due process to those detained on pur-
 ported state security grounds.
 The authorities routinely engage in arbitrary arrest and detention of human
 rights advocates, subjecting them to interrogations, threats, and degrading treat-
 ment and conditions for hours or days at a time.
 On July 16, the Government arrested the four members of the "internal dissident
 working group" (economist Martha Beatriz Roque, professor Felix Bonne Carcasses,
 lawyer Rene omez Manzano, and Vladimiro Roca Antunes), because of their peace-
 ful activities in expressing their disagreement with the Government. In May and
 June, the group sought international support for its political positions and non-
 violent dissent from the Government's policies. The working group also made a pub-
 lir appeal to citizens to exercise their legal right to abstain from participating in
 upcoming national elections. It held two well-attended press conferences with for-
 eign journalists. During the second press conference, the group presented 'The
 Homeland Belongs to All," a paper that outlined a moderate response to the plat-
 form document oT the Cuban Communist Party's fifth party congress. On July 16,
 state security agents launched coordinated raids against the working group mem-
 bers' homes and took the four members to police stations. State security officers
 searched their homes and seized books, papers, correspondence, and personal arti-
 cles such as typewriters and computers. In November the authorities transferred
 the four from Havana's Villa Marista state security facility to separate prisons: Roca
 to Ariza prison in Cienfuegos province; omez Manzano to Aguija prison in
 Matanzas province, Bonne to Guanajay prison in Havana province, and Roque to
 Manto Negro women's" prison, also in Havana province. At year's end, there were
 still no indications whether the Government would put the group on trial on charges
 of disseminating enemy propaganda.
 On June 25, the Government arrested medical doctor and human rights activist
 Dessy Mendoza at his home in Santiago de Cuba. Dr. Mendoza was detained be-
 cause of his efforts in February to alert the public, through the international media,
 about an outbreak of hemorrhagic dengue fever in Santiago de Cuba, which resulted
 in the death of about 30 persons. In June the Government finally acknowledged the
 outbreak and began a be ated fumigation effort in Santiago de Cuba, Havana, and
 elsewhere. In December the Government tried, convicted, and sentenced Dr. Men-
 doza to 8 years in prison for disseminating false information. The unhealthful condi-
 tions of his detention required his hospitalization.
 
 
 On October 9, 10 human rights activists in Santa Clara initiated a prolonged fast
 to protest the incarceration of Daula Carpio Matas, who had originally been sen-
 tenced to house arrest for a previous incident. At 4:00 a.m. on October 14, police
 raided the home where the fast was taking place and detained the occupants. On
 October 23, a court convicted the fasting dissidents of association to commit crimes
 and disobedience, and sentenced them to a variety of terms ranging from 18 months
 in jail to 18 months' probation. At year's end, six of the dissidents were continuing
 the fast, four of them in a hospital.
 The Penal Code also includes the concept of "dangerousness," defined as the "spe-
 cial proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in mani-
 fest contradiction of socialist norms." If the police decide that a person exhibits signs
 of dangerousness, they may detain the offender, bring him before a court, or subject
 him to "therapy" or "political reeducation." Government authorities regularly threat-
 en citizens with prosecution under this article. Both the UNHRC and the LACHR
 condemned this concept for its subjectivity, the summary nature of the judicial pro-
 ceedings employed, the lack of legal safeguards for the accused, and the political
 considerations behind its application. According to the IACHR, "the special inclina-
 tion to commit crimes referred to in the Cuban criminal code amounts to a subjec-
 tive criterion used by the Government to justify violations of the rights to individual
 freedom and due process of persons whose sole crime has been an inclination to hold
 a view different from the official view."
 The Government also used exile as a tool for controlling and eliminating the inter-
 nal opposition. Amnesty International noted that the Government had changed its
 tactics in dealing with human rights advocates, and "rather than arresting them
 and bringing them to trial, the tendency was to repeatedly detain them for short
 periods and threaten them with imprisonment unless they gave up their activities
 or left the country." In Augut the Government used these incremental, aggressive
 tactics to compel Diosmel Rodriguez, an activist from Santiago de Cuba, anc-Olance
 Nogueras, an independent journalist already under state-imposed internal exile in
 Cienfuegos, to leave the country.
 The Government has also pressured imprisoned human rights activists to apply
 for emigration and regularly conditioned their release on acceptance of exile. On
 several occasions, state security officers facilitated passes to prisoners to come to the
 capital for the express purpose of initiating exit procedures with foreign diplomatic
 missions.
 Amnesty International expressed "particular concern" about the Government's
 practice of threatening to charge, try, and imprison human rights advocates and
 independent journalists prior to arrest or sentencing if they did not leave the coun-
 try, which it said "effectively prevents those concerned from being able to act in pub-
 lic life in their own country."
 In August the Government began a campaign of intense harassment against
 Leonel Morejon Almagro, one of the founders of the Concilio Cubano, in an attempt
 to force him into exile. Morejon had been released from Ariza prison on May 9 after
 serving a 15-month sentence, ostensibly for disrespect. Upon his release, the au-
 thorities warned Morejon not to attempt to restart the Concilio, which in February
 1996 attempted to bring together over 130 prodemocracy groups for a meeting in
 Havana. The Government's state security apparatus prevented the meeting by
 launching a campaign of mass detentions and intimidation against more than 200
 would-be participants. State security officers repeatedly harassed Morejon's spouse
 and his close relatives, subjected them to numerous arbitrary house searches, and
 threatened them with possible detention if they did not disassociate themselves
 from him. Morejon was subjected to intense surveillance, and the authorities
 videotaped private, nonpolitical activities in an attempt to increase their pressure
 on him by obliging him to restrict his personal life. Since May, Morejon had been
 briefly detained two times and visited or called in for questioning by state security
 agents on more than a dozen occasions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for independ-
 ent courts, it explicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly (ANPP) and the
 Council of State, which is headed by Fidel Castro. The ANPP and its lower level
 counterparts elect all judges. The subordination of the courts to the Communist
 Party-which is designated in the Constitution as "the superior directive force of the
 society and the state"-further compromises the judiciarys independence.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. Panels com-
 posed of a mix of professionally certified and lay judges preside over them. Military
 tribunals assume jurisdiction for certain "counterrevolutionary" cases.
 The law and trial practices do not meet international standards for fair public
 trials. Almost all cases are tried in less than a day. There are no jury trials. While
 most trials are public, trials are closed when state security is allegedly involved.
 
 
 486
 
 Prosecutors may introduce testimony from a CDR member as to the revolutionary
 background of a defendant, which may contribute to either a longer or shorter sen-
 tence. The law recognizes the right of appeal in municipal courts but limits it in
 provincial courts to cases such as those involving maximum prison terms or the
 death penalty. Appeals in death penalty cases are automatic. The death penalty
 must ultimately be affirmed by the Council of State.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights advocates,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 political cases, is the defendant's confession, usually obtained under duress and
 without the legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. The authorities regularly
 deny defendants access to their lawyers until the day of the trial. Several dissidents
 who have served prison terms report that they were tried and sentenced without
 counsel and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf. Amnesty International
 has stated that "trials in all cases fall far short of international standards for a fair
 trial."
 The law provides the accused with the right to an attorney, but the control that
 the Government exerts over the livelihood of members of the state-controlled law-
 yers' collectives-especially when they defend persons accused of state security
 crimes--compromises their ability to represent clients. Attorneys have reported re-
 luctance to defend those charged in political cases out of fear of jeopardizing their
 own careers.
 On July 8, a court sentenced Radames Garcia de la Vega, founder of the "Cuban
 Youths for Democracy Movement," to 18 months at a correctional work center for
 having shown disrespect to Fidel Castro. Garcia de la Vega's prodemocracy group
 has called for reestablishment of political autonomy for the universities and an end
 to the practice of admitting students to university based on their identification with
 the revolution. After the sentencing, group member Nestor Rodriguez Robaina re-
 portedly shouted "Liberty" and "Long lve democracy." On July 25, a court sentenced
 odriguez to 18 months' imprisonment in Guantanamo for "contempt against the
 dignity of the court." The State deployed uniformed and plainclothes security agents
 around and inside the courthouse to preclude protests that had taken place at Gar-
 cia de la Vega's trial from recurring. Other members of the group were prosecuted
 shortly thereafter. Heriberto Fuste was given a 2-year sentence for disrespect to
 Fidel Castro, while due to ill health, Heriberto Leyva was given only a fine of about
 $50 (1,000 pesos-the equivalent of 6 months' median salary) and warned by state
 security officers to leave the country. In September the authorities transferred
 Rodriguez to a hospital following his 14-day hunger strike to protest the Govern-
 ment's crackdown on prodemocracy youths while it simultaneously hosted an Inter-
 national Youth and Student Festival (see Section 2.b.).
 According to Amnesty International, some 600 persons were imprisoned for var-
 ious political crimes. Other human rights monitoring groups estimate that 800 indi-
 viduals-not including those held for dangerousness-were imprisoned on such
 charges as disseminating enemy propaganda, illicit association, contempt for au-
 thorities (usually for criticizing Fidel Castro), clandestine printing, or the broad
 charge of rebellion, often brought against advocates of peaceful democratic change.
 In an October 1995 television interview, President Castro acknowledged and at-
 tempted to justify the existence of political prisoners in Cuba by stating that this
 was a normal practice in many other countries.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and correspond-
 ence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-controlled
 mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive and re-
 pressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere in the
 lives of all citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its
 ractices. The mass organizations' ostensible purpose is to "improve" the citizenry,
 ut in fact their goal is to seek out and discourage nonconformity. Citizen participa-
 tion in these mass organizations has declined; the economic crisis has both reduced
 the Government's ability to provide material incentives for their participation and
 forced many people to engage in black market activities, which the mass organiza-
 tions are supposed to report to the authorities.
 The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The Interior Ministry em-
 ploys an intricate system of informants and block committees (the CDR's) to monitor
 and control public opinion. While less capable than in the past, CDR's continue to
 report on suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption; unauthorized
 meetings, including those with foreigners; and defiant attitudes toward the Govern-
 ment and the revolution.
 The Department of State Security often reads international correspondence and
 monitors overseas telephone calls and conversations with foreigners. The Govern-
 
 
 487
 ment controls all access to the Internet, and all electronic mail messages are subject
 to censorship. Citizens do not have the right to receive publications from abroad,
 although newsstands in foreigners-only hotels and outside certain hard currency
 stores do sell foreign newspapers and magazines. The Government continued to jam
 US.-operated Radio Marti and Television Marti, although Radio Marti broadcasts
 regularly overcame the jamming attempts. Security agents subject dissidents, for-
 eign diplomats, and journalists to harassment and surveillance, including electronic
 surveillance.
 The authorities regularly search people and their homes, without probable cause,
 to intimidate and harass them. State security agents searched the homes of hun-
 dreds of political dissidents, human rights advocates, and independent journalists,
 seizing typewriters, personal and organizational documents, books, and foreign
 newspapers.
 The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited for-
 eign diplomatic missions, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses,
 and seized copies of foreign newspapers and other informational material.
 There were numerous credible reports of forced evictions of squatters and resi-
 dents who lacked official permission to reside in Havana (see Section 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and in-
 sults against officials carry penalties of from 3 months to 1 year in prison. If Presi-
 dent Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of State are the object
 of criticism, the sentence can be extended to 3 years. Charges of disseminating
 enemy propaganda (which includes merely expressing opinions at odds with those
 of the Government) can bring sentences of up to 14 years. Local CDR's inhibit free-
 dom of speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism. Police and state se-
 curity officials regularly harassed, threatend, and otherwise abused human rights
 advocates in public and private as a means of intimidation and control.
 The Constitution states that electronic and print media are state property and
 "cannot become in any case private property." The Communist Party controls all
 media as a means to indoctrinate the citizenry. All media must operate under party
 guidelines and reflect government views.
 Ia February government officials telephoned foreign correspondents to warn them
 against attending a seminar to which both official and independent journalists were
 invited. A state security crew videotaped the arrival and departure of all individuals
 attending the event. In April a state security crew videotaped the arrival and depar-
 tre of foreign diplomats who visited the home of independent journalist Olance
 Nogueras in Cienfuegos, and attempted to ask them questions as they departed.
 The International Youth and Student Festival took place from July 28 to August
 6 in Havana. The official, independent, and foreign media were all objects of intense
 scrutiny during this period. Government press officials publicly chastised the foreign
 correspondent5 cops on several occasions for not devoting more coverage to the fes-
 tival, and accused it of showing political bias b not doing so. Several independent
 journalists, including Raul Rivero, Mercedes Moreno, Luis Lopez Prendes, Ramon
 Alberto Cruz Lima, and Nicolas Rosario Rosabal, were warned by state security
 agents to stay away from the festival sites and its participants, and not to report
 on any aspect of the festival. Following the festival's closing ceremonies, the authori-
 ties punished three employees of the Cuban Radio and Television Institute (ICRT)
 for alowing the broadcast of a festival performance by the Charanga Habanera mu-
 sical group that was considered "obscene anantirevolutionary." Beatriz Ruiz, the
 musical director of the ICRT, was fired; assistant director Rene Arencibia was sus-
 pended for 3 months; and Jose Pulido, the producer of official government entertain-
 ment shows, was required to denounce his mistakes publicly before ICRT employees.
 The Government has since reinstated the three journalists but to different assign-
 ments. The Charanga Habanera group was prohibited from all performances or mu-
 sical activities and from traveling outside the country for 6 months. State security
 agents detained independent journalist Raul Rivero from August 12 to 15, after he
 spoke about the festival on Radio Marti, and strongly warned him to give up report-
 ing or leave the country.
 The temporary suspensions of official media representatives highlighted the dif-
 ficult ideological tightrope government reporters and editors must walk. The in-
 creased pressure on foreign and independent journalists to follow the party line also
 indicates the degree to which the Government continues to attempt to shape media
 coverage, even among groups nominally outside the official realm of control.
 The Government continues to subject independent journalists to internal travel
 bans, arbitrary and periodic (overnight or longer) detention, harassment of friends
 
 
 488
 and relatives, seizures of written manuals and computer and office equipment, and
 repeated threats of prolonged imprisonment. In July the authorities arrested inde-
 pendent journalist Lorenzo Paez Nunes and subsequently sentenced him to 18
 months in prison. According to his family, Hector Peraza was arrested in July and
 detained for 2 months the day after he received a visit from a "foreigner who gave
 him a computer." State security agents harassed family members when pressure on
 independent journalists was not successful in forcing them to abandon their work
 or their country. The daughters of independent journalists Ana Luisa Lopez Baeza
 and Maria de LOs Angeles Gonzalez Amaro were publicly insulted and lost their jobs
 because of their mothers' work. Raul Rivero's octogenarian mother's poor health was
 aggravated by two visits from state security officials who claimed that they would
 detain Rivero for alleged "subversive activities" and urged her to make Rivero leave
 the country. In August independent journalists Olance Nogueras and Lazaro Laso
 went into exile following months of continued harassment. The Government had
 specifically banned Nog eras from entering Havana; in July the authorities de-
 tained him while traveling to the capital and forcibly returned him to Cienfuegos.
 Many other journalists were subjected to detention and seizure of personal prop-
 erty. On May 31, four members of a neighborhood CDR assaulted independent jour-
 nalist Joaquin Torres Alvarez. They knocked to the ground Torres's mother, who
 needs a cane to walk, when she tried to come to her son's defense. Two policemen
 present during the assault prevented neighbors from assisting Torres.
 Amnesty International, the Inter-American Press Society, Reporters without Bor-
 ders, and the Committee to Protect Journalists repeatedly called international at-
 tention to the Government's continued practice of detaining independent journalists
 and others simply for peacefully exercising their right to free speech.
 The Government rigorously monitored other forms of expression and often ar-
 rested persons for the crimes of disseminating enemy propaganda and clandestine
 printing. In the Government's view, enemy propaganda includes materials such as
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international reports of human rights
 violations, and mainstream foreign newspapers and magazines.
 The Government prohibits all diplomatic miss ions in Havana from printing or dis-
 tributing publications, particularly newspapers and newspaper clippings, unless
 those pubiations deal exclusively with conditions in the mission's home country
 and receive prior government approval. It also infringed on diplomatic pouch privi-
 leges to seize allegedly subversive materials.
 In December 1996, the Government passed the Cuban Dignity and Sovereignty
 Law, which proscribes citizens from providing any information to, or seeking any
 information from, any representatives of the U.S. Government, which might be used
 directly or indirectly in the application of U.S. legislation. This includes accepting
 or distributing any publications, documents, or other material that the authorities
 might interpret as facilitating implementation of such legislation. Although no one
 has been charged with violating this law, it has raised concerns among many inde-
 pendent journalists.
 The Government circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms. The edu-
 cational system teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all other
 commitments. Academics and other government officials are prohibited from meet-
 ing with some diplomats in Havana without prior approval from the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs. The Government criticized a foreign mission's gift of books, which in-
 cluded works of fiction and a volume of sports history, to a provincial library. The
 Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate students' ideological character
 and note it in records that students carry throughout their schooling, which affect
 their future educational and career prospects. As a matter of educational policy, the
 Government often demands that teaching materials for courses such as mathematics
 or literature have an ideological content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 grants limited rights of assembly and association, these rights are subject to the re-
 quirement that they may not be "exercised against. . . the existence and objectives
 of the socialist State." The law punishes any unauthorized assembly of more than
 three persons, including for private religious services, even in a private home, by
 up to 3 months in prison and a fine. The authorities selectively enforce this prohibi-
 tion and often use it as a legal pretext to harass and imprison human rights advo-
 cates.
 In the weeks leading up to the International Youth and Student Festival, state
 security agents harassed dozens of human rights activists and independent journal-
 ists to warn them against approaching and interacting with any of the 10,000 for-
 eign participants whom it claimed would attend the event. Prodemocracy youth ac-
 tivists in Santiago de Cuba were imprisoned (see Section I.e.), and independent jour-
 nalist Raul Rivero was briefly detained for reporting on the event. State security
 
 
 agents withheld the identity cards of some activists to prevent them from legally
 leaving their homes during the festival. State security agents warned other activists
 that festival delegates, public festival activities, hotels, restaurants, and other tour-
 ist-related facilities were off-limits to them on penalty of incarceration.
 The Government denies citizens the freedom of association. The Penal Code spe-
 cifically outlaws "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministry of Justice, in con-
 sultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to give organizations legal rec-
 ognition. The authorities have never approved the existence or a public meeting of
 ahuman rights group.
 Along with recognized churches, the Roman Catholic humanitarian organization
 Caritas, small human rights groups, and several nascent fraternal or professional
 organizations are the only associations outside the control of the State, the Com-
 munist Party, and their mass organizations. The authorities continue to ignore
 these groups' applications for legal recognition, thereby subjecting members to po-
 tential charges of illegal association. All other legally recognized "nongovernmental"
 groups are affiliated with or controlled by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In recent years, the Government has eased the harsher
 aspects of its repression of religious freedom. In 1991 it allowed religious adherents
 to join the Communist Party. In 1992 it amended the Constitution to prohibit reli-
 gious discrimination and removed references to "scientific materialism," i.e., athe-
 ism, as the basis for the Cuban State. Nevertheless, the State prohibits members
 of the armed forces from allowing anyone in their household to observe religious
 practices, except elderly relatives if their religious beliefs do not influence other
 family members and are not "damaging to the revolution."
 With the advent of the scheduled visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II in January
 1998, on November 1 the Catholic bishops issued a public statement that appealed
 to the Government to recognize the Church's role in civil society. The document stat-
 ed that "freedom to hold mass must not be confused with freedom of religion," and
 asserted that the Church has a role to play in the creation of civil society, the fam-
 ily, as well as the temporal areas of work, the economy, the arts, sports, and the
 scientific and technical worlds. The bishops stated that the Church must open doors,
 prepare for a transformation, and help bring about reconciliation between all Cu-
 bans.
 In preparing for the Pope's visit, the Government further relaxed its restrictions
 on religion, especially towards the Roman Catholic Church. In June the Government
 grantdthe Church permission to hold its first outdoor mass since 1961. The Gov-
 ernment permitted a limited number of public masses since then. The Church also
 was allowed to conduct door-to-door visits to inform parishioners of the papal visit.
 On January 13, 1998, the Government allowed Cainal Ortega a live, 30-minute
 appearance on national television to speak about the papal visit. However, the Gov-
 ernent continued to limit strictly the Church's access to the media and refused to
 allow the Church to have an independent printing capability. It maintained its pro-
 hibition against the establishment of religious schools. The Government agreed to
 increase slightly the number of foreign priests and nuns allowed in the country.
 The Government continued to enforce a resolution preventing any Cuban or joint
 enterprise from selling computers, fax machines, photocopiers, or other equipment
 to any church. It also maintained a December 1995 decree completely prohibiting
 nativity scenes and prohibiting Christmas trees and decorations in public buildings,
 except those related to the tourist or foreign commercial sector. In 1996 the Govern-
 ment had held the semi-annual ANPP session on Christmas eve and Christmas day
 to manifest its nonacceptance of religious holidays. (Official recognition of all reli-
 gious holidays ended in 1961.) However, in December President Castro allowed
 Christmas to be recognized as a holiday as a one-time exception, as a special good
 will gesture in honor of the Pope's scheduled visit.
 Students who profess a belief in religion continue to be stigmatized by other stu-
 dents and teachers and have been formally disciplined for bringing Bibles or other
 religious materials to school.
 The Government requires churches and other religious groups to register with the
 provincial Registry of Associations to obtain official recognition. The Government
 prohibits, with occasional exceptions, the construction of new churches, forcing
 many growing congregations to violate the law and meet in people's homes, Govern-
 ment harassment of private houses of worship continued, with evangelical denomi-
 nations reporting evictions from houses used for these purposes. In April govern-
 ment authorities in Hoignin province detained Pentecostal pastors Emilin Morales
 and Roberto Rubie and ordered their informal chapels closed, The authorities have
 also threatened to close informal Protestant churches in the western towns of Moa
 and San German and evict the congregations from their premises. In September
 local government authorities allowed the Catholic Church to hold outdoor masses
 
 
 in the towns of Guines and Jaruco, but scheduled town " arties" to coincide with
 these services so that music and other distractions compete'  with the masses.
 The Government, however, relaxed restrictions on members of Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, whom it had considered "active religious enemies of the revolution" for their
 refusal to accept obligatory military service or participate in state organizations.
 The Government authorized small assemblies of Jehovah's Witnesses, t e o ening
 of a Havana central office, and the publishing of the group's magazine and other
 religious tracts.
 State security officials regularly harassed human rights advocates prior to reli-
 gious services commemorating special feast days or before significant national days.
 State security agents in Havana and Pinar del Rio went to the homes of activists
 only hours before the September 8 feast day and warned the activists to stay away
 from any church or face detention. State security officers retained activists' identity
 cards to prevent them from legally leaving their homes. Similar government harass-
 ment of human rights and opposition activists occurred during other anniversaries,
 religious commemorations, or other events, particularly on July 13, the third anni-
 versary of the Coast Guard's sinking of the "13th of March" tugboat which killed
 41 people. Nevertheless, church attendance in all denominations has grown in re-
 cent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Prior to 1997, the Government generally had not imposed legal restric-
 tions on domestic travel, except for persons found to be HIV positive, whom it ini-
 tially restricts to sanitoriums for treatment and therapy before conditionally releas-
 ing them to the community. However, state security officials forbade some human
 rights advocates and independent journalists from traveling outside their home
 provinces, and the Government began to sentence others to internal exile.
 In April the Council of Ministers approved Decree 271, aimed at stemming migra-
 tion from the provinces to the capitaf city. Human rights observers noted that while
 the decree affected migration countrywide, the decree was targeted at individuals
 and families from the poorer, predominantly black and mulatto eastern provinces.
 The Government imposed some restrictions on beth emigration and temporary for-
 eign travel. It allows the majority of persons who qualify for immigrant or refugee
 status in other countries to leave Cuba. In certain cases, however, the authorities
 delay or deny exit permits, usually without explanation. Some of the denials involve
 professionals who tried to emigrate and who the Government subsequently banned
 from working in their occupation. The Government refused permission to others be-
 cause it considers their cases sensitive for political or state security reasons. The
 Government also routinely denies exit permits to young men approaching the age
 of military service until the age of 27, even when it has authorzed the rest of the
 family to leave. The Government also has a policy of denying exit permission for
 several years to relatives of individuals who have successfully migrated illegally
 (e.g., merchant seamen who have jumped ship overseas; sports figures who "de-
 fected" while on tour abroad). However, in most of those cases approved for migra-
 tion to the United States under the September 9, 1994, U.S.-Cuban migration aree-
 ment, the applicants eventually receive exemption from obligatory service andre-
 ceive exit permits.
 Migrants who travel to the United States must pay fees of $550 per adult, $350
 per child, and airfare. These fees-which must be paid in dollars-are equivalent
 to 2 years of a professional person's salary. In April 1996, a ministerial decree
 reced   the fee by one-half for needy individuals. However, by years end, 490 of
 the individuals initially approved still could not pay the travel amount.
 The Penal Code provides for imprisonment from 1 to 3 years or a fine of $15 to
 $50 (300 to 1,000 pesos) for unauthorized departures by boat or raft. The office of
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that it recards any
 sentence for simple illegal exit of over 1 year as harsh and excessive. Under the
 terms of the May 2, 1995, U.S.-Cuba migration accord, the Government agreed not
 to prosecute or retaliate against migrants returned to Cuba from international or
 U.S. waters, or from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo, as a consequence of their
 attempt to emigrate illegally.
 In August 1994, the Government eased restrictions on visits by, and repatriation
 of, Cuban emigrants. Cubans who establish residency abroad and who are in posses-
 sion of government-issued "permits to reside abroad" may travel to Cuba without
 visas. The Government reduced the age of citizens eligible to travel abroad from 20
 to 18 years and extended the period for temporary stay abroad from 6 to 11 months.
 In November 1995, the Government announced that emigrants who are considered
 not to have engaged in "hostile actions" against the Government and who are not
 subject to criminal proceedings in their country of residence may apply at Cuban
 consulates for renewable, 2-year multiple-entry travel authorizations.
 
 
 491
 The Constitution provides for the granting of asylum to individuals persecuted
 "for their ideals or struggles for democratic rights against imperialism, fascism, colo-
 nialism, and neocolonialism; against discrimination and racism; for national libera-
 tion; for the rights of workers, peasants, and students; for their progressive political,
 scientific, artistic, and literary activities, for socialism and peace." The Government
 honors the principle of first asylum and provided it to a small number of persons
 in 1996. According to the UNHCR, five foreign nationals sought asylum or refugee
 status from the Government in 1996. There were no reports of the forced return of
 persons to countries where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the legal right to change their government or to advocate
 change. The Constitution proscribes any political organization other than the Com-
 munist Party. While the Constitution provides for direct election of provincial, mu-
 nicipal, and National Assembly members, the candidates must be approved in ad-
 vance by mass organizations controlled by the regime. In practice, a small group of
 leaders, under the direction of President Fidel Castro, select the members of the
 highest policymaking bodies of the Communist Party-the Politburo and the Central
 Committee.
 The authorities tightly control the selection of candidates and all elections for gov-
 ernment and party positions. At least 10 election petitions filed with candidacy com-
 mittees in Havana and Cienfuegos provinces were ignored, even though they carried
 the requisite number of signatures, according to Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, president
 of the Christian Liberation Movement, a dissident group. The candidacy committees
 are composed of members of mass organizations such as the CTC and the CDR and
 are responsible for selecting candidates, whose names are then sent to municipal
 assemblies which select a single candidate for each regional seat in the ANPP. A
 dissident or opposition candidate has never been allowed to run for office.
 The Government has ignored calls for democratic change. Although President Cas-
 tro signed the Declaration of Vina del Mar at the VI Ibero-American summit in No-
 vember 1996, in which government leaders reaffirmed their commitment to democ-
 racy and political pluralism, the Government continued to oppose independent polit-
 ical activity. In February 1996, the European Union suspended negotiations toward
 a cooperation agreement because of lack of progress toward political or economic re-
 form and in December of that year adopted the Common Position on Cuba, which
 is binding on all member states. It directly links improvement of European Union
 relations with Cuba to progress toward a democratic transition and an improvement
 in the human rights situation. The Government rejects any change judged incompat-
 ible with the revolution. The Government has systematically retaliated against
 those who peacefully sought political change.
 Although not a formal requirement, Communist Party membership is in fact a
 prerequisite for high-level official positions and professional advancement.
 Government leadership positions continue to be dominated by men. There are
 very few women or minorities in plicymaking positions in the Government or the
 party. There are two women in the 24-member Politburo and 18 in the 150-member
 Central Committee. The head of the Union of Communist Youth is a woman. Al-
 though blacks and mulattos make up over half the population, they hold only 5
 seats in the Politburo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not recognize any domestic human rights groups, or permit
 them to function legally. The Government subjects domestic human rights advocates
 to intense intimidation, harassment, and repression. In violation of its own statutes,
 the Government refuses to consider applications for legal recognition submitted by
 human rights monitoring groups.
 In its annual report the IAIRC examined recent measures taken by the Govern-
 ment and found that they "do not comprise the bedrock of a substantive reform in
 the present political system . ., that will permit the ideological and partisan plu-
 ralism implicit in the wellspring from which a democratic system of government de-
 velops." The IAHRC recommended that the Government provide reasonable safe-
 guards to prevent violations of human rights, unconditionally release political pris-
 oners and those jailed for trying to leave the country, abolish the concept of dan-
 verousness in the penal code and eliminate other legal restrictions on basic free-
 oms, cease harassing human rights groups, and establish a separation of powers
 so that the judiciary would no longer be subordinate to political power.
 
 
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights monitoring.
 In 1992 Cuba's U.N. representative stated that Cuba would not recognize the
 UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the Special Rapporteur.
 This policy remains unchanged. The Government consistently refused even to ac-
 knowledge requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit Cuba.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a black and mixed-race majority. The Constitu-
 tion forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, although evidence
 suggests that racial and sexual discrimination occur often.
 Women.-Violent crime is rarely reported in the press, and there are no publicly
 available data regarding the incidence of domestic violence. The law establishes
 strict penalties for rape, and the Government appears to enforce this law. Prostitu-
 tion has increased greatly in the last few years; press reports indicate that tourists
 from various countries visit specifically to patronize inexpensive prostitutes. Despite
 the Government's tight control over society in general, episodic government state-
 ments and efforts to crack down on prostitution appear to have little lasting effect.
 Most observers believe that the regime tolerates or tacitly encourages prostitution
 in order to boost its tourist industry, and the police appear to make arrangements
 with the prostitutes that allow them to function largely without interference. In No-
 vember the Dutch NGO Pax Christi released in book form a 1996 report on the
 human rights situation in the country. It noted that sex tourism was thriving and
 that it was tolerated by the Government as yet another way to attract hard cur-
 rency to the island. NGO representatives interviewed Cubans who described their
 country as "a brothel more than ever, only now it's for tourists from other coun-
 tries."
 The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and responsibil-
 ities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home, and pur-
 suing a career. Women are subject to the same restrictions on property ownership
 as men. The maternity law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave and grants work-
 ing women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 percent of all women
 work, and they are well represented in the professions.
 Children.-The Constitution calls on the Government to protect "family, mater-
 nity, and matrimony." It also states that children, legitimate or not, have the same
 rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Education is
 free and is grounded in Marxist ideology. State organizations and schools are
 charged with the "integral formation of children and youth." The national health
 care system covers all citizens. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children,
 other than in the area of prostitution where young girls (between the ages of 13 and
 20) form the bulk of the large number of prostitutes who cater to foreign sex-tour-
 ists.
 People With Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination based on disability,
 and there have been few complaints of such discrimination. There are no laws that
 mandate accessibility to buildings for people with disabilities.
 In March police forcibly removed visually-impaired and other disabled street-
 hawkers from the front of Havana's railway station. The disabled vendors attempted
 to hold a protest outside the capitol building, but police prevented the demonstra-
 tion and briefly detained some of the disabled protesters.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Many blacks have benefited from the social
 changes of the revolution, and much of the police force and army enlisted personnel
 is black. Nevertheless, there have been numerous reports of disproportionate police
 harassment of black youths. During the year, there were numerous credible reports
 of forced evictions of squatters and residents lacking official permission to reside in
 Havana. The evictions, exacerbated by Decree 217 (see Section 2.d.), primarily tar-
 geted individuals and families from the eastern provinces, which are traditionally
 areas of poor, black, or mixed-race populations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 The "demands of the economy and society" take precedence over an individual work-
 er's preferences. The law prohibits strikes; none are known to have occurred. Official
 labor organizations have a mobilization function and do not act as trade unions, pro-
 mote worker rights, or protect the right to strike. Such organizations are under the
 control of the State and the party.
 The Communist Party selects the leaders of the sole legal labor confederation, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC), whose principal responsibility is to ensure
 
 
 that government production goals are met. Despite disclaimers in international fo-
 rums, the Government explicitly prohibits independent unions and none are recog-
 nized. There has been no change since the 1992 International Labor Organization
 (11L0) finding that independent unions "do not appear to exist" and its ruling that
 Cuba violated ILO norms on freedom of association and the right to orgaze. Tho
 who attempt to engage in union activities face government persecution. Workers can
 and have lost their jobs for their political beliefs, including their refusal to join the
 official union. Several small labor organizations have been created, but function
 without government recognition and are unable to represent workers and work on
 their behalf. The Government actively harasses these organizations.
 The CTC is a member of the Communist, formerly Soviet-dominated, World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.--Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security (CETSS) sets wages and
 salaries for the state sector. Since all legal unions are government entities,
 antiunion discrimination by definition does not exist.
 In July the Government passed Decree Law 171, which imposed severe restric-
 tions on the right of private citizens to rent their homes, rooms in their homes, or
 motor vehicles, along with a new punitive tax. This decree law signaled an economic
 policy reversal by the Government. In 1993 the Government had removed some re-
 strictions on self-employment imposed in 1968 and allowed people to apply for li-
 censes to work in over 125 different occupations, expanded to over 160 in 1994. Be-
 sides adding another 20 occupational categories, in 1995 the Government removed
 its previous ban on self-employment licenses for university graduates. However, uni-
 versity graduates cannot get self-employment licenses in their professions and must
 remain employed in their state job to qualify for a self-employment license.
 There are no functioning export processing zones, although the 1995 Foreign In-
 vestment Law (Law 77), authorized the establishment of free trade zones and indus-
 trial parks. Law 77 continued to deny workers the right to contract directly with
 foreign companies investing in Cuba without special government permission. Only
 one foreign company has secured permission to employ workers directly. The Gov-
 einent requires foreign investors to contract workers through state employment
 agencies, which are paid in hard currency and, in turn, pay workers very low wages
 in pesos. Workers subcontracted by state employment agencies must meet certain
 political qualifications. According to Marcos Portal, Minister of Basic Industry, the
 state emomen agencies consult with the party, the CTC, and the Union of Com-
 munist Youth to ensure that the workers chosen deserve to work in a joint enter-
 prise.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains correctional centers
 where it sends people for crimens sc  as dangerousness. They are forced to work
 on farms or building sites, usually with no pay and inadequate food. The authorities
 often imprison internees who do not cooperate. The Government employs special
 groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan from other jobs, on special
 building projects. Microbrigades have become more important in the Government's
 efforts to complete tourist and other priority projects. Workers who refuse to volun-
 teer for these jobs often risk discrimination or job loss. However, microbrigade work-
 ers reportedly receive priority consideration for apartments. The military channels
 some conscripts to the Youth Labor Army, where they perform their 2-year military
 service working on farms that supply both the armed forces and the civilian opu-
 lation. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enorces
 this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Ernpoyment.-The legal
 minimum working age is 17 years. The Labor Code permits employment of 15- and
 16-year-olds to obtain training or fill labor shortages. All students over age 11 are
 expetedo to d     0to 45 days of theier    r vacation to farm work, laboring
 up to 8 hours per day. The Ministry of Agriculture uses voluntary labor" by student
 work brigades extensively in the farming sector. The law requires school attendance
 until the ninth grade, and this law is generally respected. The Government prohibits
 forced and bonded child labor and enforce  s prohibition effectively (see Section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage varies by occupation and
 is set by the CETSS. The minimum monthly wage for a maid, for example, is $8.25
 (165 pesos); for a bilingual office clerk, $9.50 (190 pesos); and for a gardener $10.75
 (215 pesos). The Government supplements the minimum wage with free medical
 care and education, and subsidized housing and food. Even with these subsidies,
 however, a worker must earn far more than the averag e      mnt  eto support
 a family. Corruption and black market activity are rampant. The Government ra-
 
 
 tions most basic necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, and cooking gas, which
 are in very short supply.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions, such as mining. The Government also reduced the workday in some govern-
 mental offices and state enterprises to save energy. Workplace environmental and
 safety controls are usually inadequate, and the Government lacks effective enforce-
 ment mechanisms. The Labor Code establishes that a worker who considers his life
 in danger because of hazardous conditions has the right not to work in his position
 or not to en age in specific activities until such risks are eliminated. According to
 the Labor Code, the worker remains obligated to work temporarily in whatever
 other position may be assigned to him at a salary prescribed by law. Industrial acci-
 dents apparently are frequent, but the Government suppresses such reports.
