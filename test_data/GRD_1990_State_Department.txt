 GRENADA
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Grenada's
 parliamentary form of government, with a Governor General as
 titular Head of State, was suspended in 1979 by the Marxist
 People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) and then restored in
 October 1983 following the joint U.S.-Caribbean intervention.
 The second postrevolutionary election was held on March 13,
 1990, following the death in December 1989 of Prime Minister
 Herbert Blaize who had prorogued Parliament in August 1989
 rather than face a potential no-confidence vote. In a free
 and fair election in March no- political party received a clear
 majority. Following several days of inconclusive negotiations
 among the parties, the Governor General appointed Nicholas
 Brathwaite as Prime Minister, who successfully formed a
 majority government around the National Democratic Congress
 (NDC) parliamentarians-
 Political and civil rights are provided for by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The Emergency
 Powers Act of 1987 gives the Government authority to suspend
 most civil rights should the Governor General declare a state
 of national emergency. While provisions of the Act have never
 been applied,-opposition politicians during the Blaize
 administration objected strenuously to the Act, citing
 existing governmental authority as being sufficient to deal
 with any potential national emergency.
 National security in Grenada is the responsibility of the
 600-member Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF), which includes a
 75-man paramilitary Special Services Unit (SSU) and a 30-man
 coast guard unit. The RGPF and its elements are controlled by
 and responsive to the civilian government.
 Grenadians are free to pursue economic goals in a free market
 environment. Major improvements in infrastructure have
 accompanied economic growth, which has averaged 5 percent
 annually in real terms over .the past several years. Economic
 development in agriculture, construction, tourism,
 transportation, and communications has been aided by a return
 of Grenadian capital and substantial economic assistance
 following restoration of democratic government in 1983.
 Grenadians enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights.
 Areas of human rights concern in 1990 included questions about
 alleged mistreatment of some prisoners and domestic violence
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.

 GRENADA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reported incidents of torture in Grenada in 1990. One
 of the prisoners convicted in the 1983 murder-executions of
 Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, four Cabinet ministers, and
 seven other government and private individuals, alleged
 harassment and mistreatment by prison officials, specifically
 that she had been denied visits for up to 6 months at a time,
 that the light in her cell was kept burning 24 hours a day,
 and that the prison commissioner had looked into her cell
 while she was using her sanitary facilities. Other prisoners
 in the Richmond Hill Prison have complained of lack of
 exercise opportunities and poor diet. The newly elected
 Government appointed a prison visitation committee in 1990 to
 visit the prison periodically. The committe made several
 reports to the Government on conditions in the prison, but
 these reports had not been made public by year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to law, police have the right to detain persons on
 suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in
 practice. If the detainee is not charged within this time, he
 must be released. In 1990 no one was detained for political
 reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal
 charge. Formal arraignment or release of the arrestee must be
 decided within 60 days. These procedures were generally
 followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with
 treason can only be accorded bail upon recommendation of the
 Governor General.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 observed in practice. Those arrested and charged are brought
 before an independent judiciary and are allowed access to a
 lawyer of their choice. For capital crimes, the courts
 appoint lawyers when the accused cannot pay for his defense.
 In other cases, indigent defendants are assigned counsel if
 the case reaches the appellate stage. Following a
 determination by a judicial hearing that there is sufficient
 evidence to substantiate a criminal charge, the defendant is
 remanded for trial. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a
 shortage of judges and facilities, a significant amount of
 time can pass before those charged are brought to trial.
 In the cases of the 17 former PRG and army officials convicted
 of the October 1983 murders of Maurice Bishop and others, the
 Government took particular care to afford a fair public trial,
 which included an appellate process lasting from May 1988
 until September 1990. Fourteen defendants were sentenced to
 death, and three were sentenced to long prison terms. The
 appeals process, which ended on September 19, was heard by a
 three-person panel of Caribbean jurists (none from Grenada)
 
 
 627
 GRENADA
 who were appointed to constitute the Grenada appeals court.
 The formation of this entity was made necessary because in
 1979 the PRG, of which many of the 17 defendants were
 officers, removed Grenada from the jurisdiction of the
 Organization of East Caribbean States (OECS) Supreme Court,
 which was Grenada's high court under the nation's
 Constitution, and designated the Grenada Supreme Court as the
 country's high court. The OECS Supreme Court decided in 1984
 that Grenada could not return to the Court until the trial and
 appeals process in the Bishop murder case was completed.
 Likewise, the right of appeal to the Queen's Privy Council was
 suspended by the PRG in 1979, and the Privy Council also
 declined to consider the readmission of Grenada to- the Council
 until the Bishop trial had been completed. There were no
 Grenadians on the prosecution team, nor any Grenadian defense
 attorneys in the appellate stage of the Bishop case. The
 Government of Grenada- has borne the. cost of both the
 prosecution and of the defense in the appeal, as it did
 throughout most- of the trial phase. The decisions of the
 appellate court and the Maurice Bishop murder trial had not
 been announced by year's end.
 Persons are not imprisoned without due process.
 There are no political prisoners. The 17 PRG and
 Revolutionary Army officials were convicted of capital crimes.
 f- Arbitrary Interference witW Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of these types of arbitrary
 interference. Warrants for searching homes are normally
 required by law except in cases of hot pursuit. In practice,
 warrants are obtained in the majority of cases before a search
 is conducted.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the
 Constitution and is freely exercised. There are five weekly
 newspapers and several papers that are published irregularly.
 Most are affiliated with political parties, but the two most
 widely circulated newspapers are independent. Newspapers are
 frequently critical of the Government. Flyers are
 occasionally distributed by remnants of the PRG's
 Revolutionary Military Council and the New Jewel Movement.
 Grenada has one government-owned radio station. In 199-0 the
 NDC Government issued a license for a new privately owned
 station, which as of year's end reached only a small part of
 the capital city. Opposition political parties were given
 equal access to air time on the government-owned radio station
 during the election campaign. In theory all political parties
 had to pay for air time for campaign announcements. However,
 during the 1990 political campaign, some parties complained
 that opposition parties were required to pay for air time,
 while the government party paid nothing.
 Grenada's television broadcasting system, purchased from
 American owners in September 1989, is a government-controlled
 station. However, proposed legislation under consideration by
 the Parliament at year's end may convert its operator to a
 statutory body. During the 1990 political campaign, all
 
 
 628
 GRENADA
 political parties were allowed to purchase television time for
 political campaigning.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any peaceful
 purpose. Supporters of political parties meet frequently and
 hold public rallies; permits are not required for public
 meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All groups enjoy freedom of religion. The Roman Catholic and
 Anglican faiths predominate, but there are many Presbyterian
 and Methodist as well as Evangelical church members.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada, and the right to
 enter and leave is guaranteed to all Grenadian citizens,
 except in special circumstances as outlined and limited by the
 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of Movement of Certain
 Persons. This law allows the Minister for National Security
 to restrict the travel out of Grenada of any person whose
 aims, tendencies; or objectives include the overthrow of the
 democratic and parliamentary system of government. Anyone so
 restricted may appeal after 3 months to an independent and
 impartial tribunal, presided over by an accredited lawyer
 chosen by the Chief Justice.
 No one was forcibly repatriated to Grenada in 1990. There
 were no official applications to Grenadian authorities for
 refugee status, although the Baha'i community includes
 Iranians who left their homeland to escape persecution. ,Work
 permits are granted to them, and they are allowed to practice
 their religion freely. The Government has allowed students
 and others to return to Grenada from Cuba and other Communist
 countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their Government through free and fair elections to be held at
 least every 5 years. Following the 1989 proroguing of
 Parliament to prevent a potential vote of no confidence in the
 Government, and the death of Prime Minister Herbert Blaize in
 December 1989, Grenadian parliamentary elections were held in
 March 1990. Sixty-six percent of the eligible voters in
 Grenada participated in the election, which resulted in the
 defeat of the ruling party. The NDC won 7 of the 15
 parliamentary seats outright. Following intense postelectoral
 negotiations, the Governor General named Nicholas Brathwaite
 as Prime Minister; Brathwaite was able to form a majority
 Government with the Members of Parliament elected by the NDC
 and others from other parties.
 The political system is not dominated by any particular ethnic
 group, nor are there any restrictions that limit participation
 of any elements of the Grenadian population.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, the Caribbean Institute for the
 Promotion of Human Rights (CARICARE), and a new Caribbean
 human rights group, CARIBCARE, are represented in Grenada.
 The President of CARIBCARE is the respected Grenadian
 journalist, Alister Hughes. All operate freely without
 government interference.
 The Government cooperates with visits from international human
 rights organizations and is responsive to inquiries from local
 human rights- groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination. Based on Race, Sex- Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of official discrimination in health
 care, employment, or education. There continue to be some
 reported incidents of unofficial joli discrimination against
 Guyanese and other foreign-horn residents. Women frequently
 earn- less than men performing the same workz such wage
 differences are less marked for more highly pa-id jobs.
 Women's rights activists contend that violence against women
 in Grenada is common, and that most cases- of spouse abuse go
 unreported to police authorities. To address this problem,
 one women's group instituted in December 1989 a crisis
 telephone hot line so that victim& of rape or spouse abuse
 have a mechanism for requesting support and assistance-. The
 police confirm that most cases of alleged abuse are not
 reported and others are settled out of court. Grenadian law
 stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment for a
 conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse
 vary according to the severity of the incident.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free ta organize independent labor unions. Local
 Labor Ministry officials estimate that approximately 40
 percent of the total work force is unionized. Restaurant,
 hotel worker, and government estate worker unions are
 expanding. Workers in the public and private sectors can and
 do strike legally if they give advance notification. A 6-day
 public sector strike in December 1989 for the payment of back
 wages caused the Government to sell 21 per cent of its
 controlling interest in the Grenada Telephone Company in order
 to pay the workers. Union leaders play a significant role in
 the political process, and one- labor leader serves in the
 Senate at the nomination of the government party. In 1990 all
 unions were free of government control, and none was given
 government support. Grenadian unions are affiliated with the
 Caribbean Congress of Labor, and the Government does not
 restrict union affiliation with any international labor
 organization, Communist-controlled or otherwise.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to engage in organizing and to participate in
 collective bargaining. There were no unionization attempts
 that were rejected by workers in 1990. Legislation compels
 employers to recognize a union which represents the majority
 
 
 630
 GRENADA
 of workers in a particular business. The law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers. If a complaint of discrimination arises,
 mechanisms exist for attempting to resolve it. After all
 avenues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted between
 union representatives and employers, both sides may agree to
 ask for the assistance of the Labor Commissioner. If the
 Labor Commissioner is unable to find a resolution to the
 impasse, the Minister of Labor can appoint an arbitration
 tribunal if both parties agree to abide by its ruling. These
 procedures are routinely and effectively used.
 There are no areas in which union organization and collective
 bargaining are discouraged or impeded by the Government,
 including the export processing zone. Several zone firms are
 organized and have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
 with their unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced labor, and no
 incidents of it were reported in 1990.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children (16
 years) is enforced in the formal sector by periodic checks
 made by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. Enforcement in
 the informal sector (i;e., family farms and small family
 businesses) is less effective.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legal workweek. However, the normal workweek
 seldom exceeds 40 hours; public sector workers are expected to
 work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with 45 minutes for lunch and
 15 minutes for one morning and one afternoon break. Health
 and safety standards set by the-Government are minimal and not
 effectively enforced. A legal minimum wage has been fixed for
 the agricultural sector only. The minimum daily wage for
 agricultural workers is $12, which would not provide a worker
 and his family a decent living. However, most agricultural
 workers receive other benefits from their employers. For the
 majority of agricultural workers, as is the case with other
 sectors, the minimum wage rate is determined by collective
 bargaining. Wages from full-time jobs normally provide the
 basis for a minimally decent standard of living.
