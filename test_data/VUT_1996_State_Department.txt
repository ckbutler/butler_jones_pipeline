 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a small South Pacific island nation of approximately 170,000 people
 which was jointly administered by Britain and France prior to its independence in
 1980, has a parliamentary form of government with a 50-member Parliament, a
 Prime Minister, and a President. The latter's powers are largely ceremonial, except
 when acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Political legitimacy is based
 on majority rule.
 The civilian authorities normally control the small police and paramilitary
 Vanuatu Mobile Force, however, a brief mutiny in October by elements of the VMF
 over pay issues shook the principle of civilian control. The mutiny was resolved
 without bloodshed.
 Subsistence and small-scale agricultural production and fishing support more
 than 80 percent of the population. Copra, cocoa, and beef cattle are the main cash
 crops. The service sector-government, tourism, and an offshore' financial center-
 provides most formal employment and represents the largest component of the coun-
 try's gross domestic product.
 Government control over much of the country's media, attempts to interfere with
 the independence of the judiciary, together with discrimination and violence against
 women, remain the major human rights problems.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-Con-
 stitutional prvisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. The law provides that prisoners
 shall have recourse to the Ombudsman, a constitutional position.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors, if requested.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests. Arrest is by warrant. The Constitutional provision that suspects must be in-
 formed of the charges and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in prac-
 tice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The courts are normally free of military or execu-
 tive interference. The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public trial,
 presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibition against double jeopardy,
 the right of judicial determination of the validity of arrest or detention, and appeal
 to the Supreme Court. However, the executive has tried to pressure the largely ex-
 patriate judiciary in cases with political implications (see Section 2.d.).
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, these provisions have not always been honored in practice.
 The Government controls much of the country's media, including a weekly news-
 paper, one AM and one FM radio station, and a limited-service television station
 confined to the capital, Port Vila, which provides English and French news service
 three times a week. In late 1994, an independent weekly, which has since expanded
 into semiweekly editions, began publishing. Opposition political parties and
 groupings occasionally publish newsletters, one of which developed into a
 newsweekly by mid-year.
 The December 1995-February 1996 coalition government headed by Prime Min-
 ister Serge Vohor continued the previous government's policy of pressuring both gov-
 ernment-owned and private media to limit the presentation of views with which it
 did not agree. A minister implicitly threatened to revoke the residency permit of the
 expatriate publisher of the independent semiweekly newspaper for allegedly irre-
 sponsible reporting. As the political crisis intensified just prior to the parliamentary
 vote that unsatedthe Vohor government in late February, Vohor ordered a broad-
 cast ban on all information relatin to his resignation revocation and the forthcom-
 ing extraordinary session of Parliament. The Pacific Islands News Association
 (PINA) condemned the ban.
 Some pressures on the media lessened following Parliament's selection of Maxime
 Carlot Korman to replace Vohor in February. However, the Carlot Korman govern-
 ment continued to restrict news disseminated by the government-controlled media.
 In May it banned Radio Vanuatu from broadcasting a Vohor press statement
 criticising the Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of the parliamentary
 vote which had unseated him. The Government reportedly also instructed Radio
 Vanuatu to submit all political statements and news items for prior review.
 Following a shift in political alliances, in September Parliament voted no con-
 fidence in the Carlot Korman government, and reelected Vohor as Prime Minister.
 Immediately following his reelection, Vohor promised to support press freedom.
 Vanuatu governments have not been as concerned over media reports directed to
 external audiences. PACNEWS, a Pacific regional news agency located in Vanuatu
 since 1994, continued to transmit stories throughout the region even when they in-
 cluded criticism of the country's leaders. Correspondents for international media are
 also allowed to report without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies; usually they are routinely granted.
 The Government does not restrict the forming of political parties and other
 groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected it in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denomina-
 
 
 796
 tions work without restriction. The Government apparently has not attempted to en-
 force the 1995 Religious Bodies Act, which the President refused to sign on constitu-
 tional grounds. The act gives the Government the right to register and potentially
 to control the activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Various governments have used their immigration powers to expel, or try to expel,
 as undesirable immigrants, expatriates with whom they were displeased. A minister
 in the first Vohor government (December 1995-February 1996) implicitly threatened
 to revoke the residency permit of the expatriate publisher of an independent, semi-
 weekly newspaper for allegedly irresponsible reporting (see Section 2.a.). The Carlot
 Korman government, in power from February to September, declared two expatriate
 jurists associated with the previous Vohor government undesirable immigrants. One
 was an Australian lawyer, who had unsuccessfully contested in court the legality
 of the February parliamentary session that elected Carlot Korman as prime min-
 ister. The other was a jurist, who the Vohor government had brought to Vanuatu
 before its ouster with the intention of appointing him a Supreme Court justice. Both
 departed the country in March. The second Vohor Government in October threat-
 ened to fire and expel the Supreme Court Chief Justice, who had sought to use the
 Court's judicial powers to issue warrants against leaders of a VMF mutiny in con-
 travention of a cabinet promise that the mutineers would not be punished. His ex-
 pulsion was suspended wvhile the Court heard his appeal of the immigration order.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4 years, through
 which citizens can freely change their government. The general elections held in No-
 vember 1995 did not give a majority to any of the three main political parties. Since
 the election, two short-lived coalition governments have he id office. The present
 Government, also a coalition led by Prime Minister Serge Vohor, assumed office in
 October.
 While outside observers generally consider the November 1995 voting to be fair,
 the Government's influence on the media prevented opposition parties from fully
 publicizing their views. That government, as well as successor governments, have
 also been acused of politically biased emploent practices.
 Traditional attitudes, in which males are dominant and females are frequently
 limited to customary family roles, hamper women from taking a more active role
 in economic and political life. One member of parliament is a woman, who also
 served briefly as a cabinet minister in the current government. A woman is mayor
 of the second largest town.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local human rights organizations,
 and Vanuatu's first, the Human Rights Forum, was founded in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disabili . Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1980 Constitution provides fundamental rights and freedoms to "all persons
 *** without discrimination on the grounds of race, place of origin, religious or tra-
 ditional beliefs, political opinions, language, or sex Despite constitutional and legal
 protections, women remain victims of discrimination in this tradition-based society.
 Due to high rates of unemployment, there are few jobs available to the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is believed to be com-
 mon, although no accurate statistics exist. Courts occasionally prosecute offenders
 using common law assault as a basis for prosecution since there are no specific laws
 against wife beating. However, most cases of violence agalnst women, including
 rape, go unreported because women, particularly in rural areas, are reluctant to re-
 port them  or ear of further abuse. In addition police are frequently reluctant to
 intervene in what are considered to be domestic matters.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly emerging
 from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general reluctance to
 educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote themselves pri-
 madily to childbearing. In announcing Vanuatu's ratification of the U.N. Convention
 on Elimination of all Fo ms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) at the 1995
 
 
 797
 U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, the then-Deputy Prime Minister stated that
 it would take time to implement the laws giving equal rights to women.
 The majority of women enter into marriage thugh "bride-price payment," a prac-
 tice that encourages men to view women as property. Women are also inhibited by
 tradition from owning land, and at least one women a advocate believes this limita-
 tion serves to underpin their secondary status. Many female leaders view village
 chiefs as a major obstacle to attaining social, political and economic rights for
 women. The National Council of Women organized seminars prior to the November
 1995 general elections to increase women's awareness of their political rights.
 Children.-Although the Government has made education a priority, access to
 education is limited and school attendance is not compulsory. Children are protected
 within the traditional extended-family system. Members of the extended family, par-
 ticularly paternal uncles, play an active role in a child's development. As a result,
 virtually no children are homeless or abandoned. There is no societal pattern of
 abuse, although cases of child abuse are occasionally reported.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled and no legislation mandating access for them. Their protection and care
 is left to the traditional extended family and to voluntary nongovernmental organi-
 zations.
 National Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is made up of Mela-
 nesians. Small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans
 are generally concentrated in two towns and on a few plantations; they experience
 discrimination with regard to land ownership. There is no evidence to suggest a pat-
 tern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of the limited basic services which the
 Government provides.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to organize
 unions. Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without gov-
 ernment permission.
 Approximately 29,000 persons participate in the formal economy as wage earners.
 There are five trade unions. The unions are grouped under an umbrella organiza-
 tion, the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions, a member of the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Government
 and ran a number of candidates under the Labor Party banner in the November
 1995 general elections, although no Labor candidate was elected to Parliament or
 received more than a small percentage of the votes.
 The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agriculture and
 fshing deters extensive union activity. In addition membership in the Vanuatu Pub-
 lic Servants Union fell dramatically following the Government's wholesale dismissal
 of hundreds of full-time public servants during a protracted general strike in 1994.
 The Supreme Court in February 1994 ruled      the union had not complied with
 its own rules when it undertook the general strike and declared the strike illegal.
 Combined union membership in the private and public sectors reportedly has fallen
 from more than 4,000 to less than 1,000 in the aftermath of the 1994 strike.
 The law prohibits retribution if the strike is legal. In the case of private-sector
 employees, violations would be referred to the Labor Department for conciliation
 and arbitration. In the public sector, violations would be handled by the Public Serv-
 ice Commission.
 In August 1995, Parliament passed a law requiring unions to give 30 days' notice
 of intent to strike, with a list of the names of intending strikers.
 There was no significant strike activity in 1996.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 3-member arbitration board appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The board
 consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management, and the
 senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the board,
 labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees. Unions
 and management, however, generally reach agreement on wages without having to
 refer the matter to arbitration. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are referred
 to the Commissioner of Labor. While the law does not require union recognition,
 once a union is recognized, it does prohibit antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 12 years of age from working outside of family-owned agricultural production, where
 
 
 many children assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of
 age is restricted by occupational category and conditions of labor, for example, re-
 strictions on employment in the shipping industry and on night-time employment.
 The Labor Department effectively enforces these laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. In February 1995, it was raise to a
 flat rate of approximately $143 (16,000 vatu) per month for both urban and rural
 workers. The previous minimum wage was approximately $93 for rural workers and
 $107 (13,200 vatu) for urban workers. The minimum wage would not support an
 urban family living entirely on the cash economy. Most families are not dependent
 solely on wages for their livelihoods.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek, with at least one 24-
 hour rest period weekly. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor Depart-
 ment, includes provisions for safety standards. However, the 1987 safety and health
 legislation is inadequate to protect workers engaged in logging, agriculture, con-
 struction, and manufacturing, and the single inspector attached to the Labor De-
 partment is hard pressed to enforce the act fully. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued em-
 ployment.
