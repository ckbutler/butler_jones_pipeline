 Belize became independent onSeptember 21, 1981, following 17
 years as an internally self-governing British colony. The
 political system of Belize is a parliamentary form of
 government with competing political parties and regular
 elections. The People's United Party has been the dominant
 political force in Belize since it led the movement for
 self-government and independence in the early 1950's. But the
 major opposition party, the United Democratic Party, won 48
 percent of the vote during the last national parliamentary
 election in 1979 and currently controls four of the eight
 municipal councils in Belize. including the Belize City Council.
 Human rights continued to be respected in Belize in 1983.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual are upheld by an independent
 judiciary and an equitable and efficient justice system. A
 free press and competitive electoral system also serve to
 protect civil and political rights.
 Belize's security apparatus consists of the Belize police force
 and the Belize Defense Force. The police force, a small
 organization with limited resources, has the principal
 responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of order.
 The Belize Defense Force, the country's 800-man army, is
 available to supplement the police force, for instance by
 assisting the police in a nationwide marijuana eradication
 carpaign in October 1983. However, it is called upon to
 perform such missions only infrequently.
 Belize is a developing country, and the small Belizean economy
 has been badly hurt by the recent world-wide recession. The
 Government supports a mixed economy; it is seeking foreign
 investment and encourages private sector development,
 especially export production.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom froms
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Politically motivated killings did not occur in Belize during
 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in Belize during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by the Belizean Constitution and
 does not take place.
 Sentences are generally lenient compared to sentences imposed
 elsewhere in the region. Although prisons are old and crowded,
 prisoners are humanely treated, adequately fed, and have
 comparatively generous recreational and social privileges. The
 
 (469)
 
 
 470
 press has occasionally reported incidents of alleged police
 brutality involving rough handling of suspects, generally young
 men. These incidents are not politically motivated or
 officially condoned. The Government is attempting to upgrade
 training for police personnel as a way of addressing this issue
 and related police matters.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and guarantees the right of habeas corpus. A person is
 entitled to be informed within 48 hours of his arrest of the
 reasons for his detention and to be brought before a court
 within 72 hours. Release on bail is allowed for all but the
 most serious, violent criminal offenses. These procedural
 safeguards are routinely observed. The Government recently
 proposed that powers of search and arrest be granted to the
 Belize Defense Force. The proposal was strongly criticized by
 the opposition and in the press, and no further action has been
 taken on it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution specifically guarantees due process and the
 rights of accused persons: presumption of innocence, privilege
 against self-incrimination, right to counsel, and public
 trial. Protection for the integrity of the person in law
 corresponds to the actual practice of the courts.
 When the Government recently proposed new legislation which
 would have eliminated trial by jury for certain firearms and
 drug offenses, the Belize Bar Association made a forceful
 intervention objecting to the proposal. Trial by jury has now
 been restored to the firearms bill, and the Government has
 agreed to hold hearings and restudy the question with respect
 to drug offenses. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive and is regarded as a guarantor of an equitable
 judicial system.
 There are no political prisoners in Belize.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the protection of family life,
 personal property, the privacy of the home, and recognition of
 human dignity. No violations of these guarantees have been
 reported during the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees these freedoms, which are respected
 in practice. Although the country's sole radio station is
 under Government control, the opposition and independent press
 is lively and unrestrained in expressing its views, including
 frequent criticism of the Government. There are seven
 privately owned and operated television stations in Belize
 
 
 471
 which carry largely foreign programs. The Government recently
 enacted a new broadcasting law which has prompted some charges
 that the Government will use the legislation to control
 television broadcasting. The Government has stated that the
 new law is necessary to bring television broadcasting into line
 with international copyright laws.
 b.. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and association
 and the right to form and belong to trade unions. These rights
 have not been infringed in practice. Permits are required to
 hold public meetings, but there have been no reports of
 difficulties in obtaining these permits. There are eight
 independent trade unions, representing about 10 to 15 percent
 of the labor force. The National Trade Union Congress of
 Belize is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions through membership in the Caribbean Congress
 of Labor. Belizean unions are primarily engaged in union
 activity such as collective bargaining, grievance handling, and
 labor education programs. Two of the smaller unions actively
 oppose the government; the others have no political affiliation
 and do not take a position on partisian political issues. The
 National Assembly recently took steps to ratify a number of
 International Labor Organization conventions, including those
 on freedom of association and protection of the right to
 organize and to engage in collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 -There is no state religion in Belize; a large number of
 Christian and a few non-Christian denominations worship freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on
 foreign travel and emigration. Emigration is principally
 motivated by economic reasons and not by political or human
 rights reasons. Emigrants frequently return for family
 virits. Aliens convicted of crimes, especially drug offenses
 or entry into Belize without proper permits, are usually
 deported to Mexico, regardless of their nationality. Belize
 continues to be a haven for displaced persons from other
 Central American countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Belize has never experienced a transfer of national political
 power from one party to another. Prime Minister George Price
 and the People's United Party have governed the country since
 the advent of internal self-government in 1964. Though the
 party's parliamentary majority gives it broad freedom to decide
 Government policy, its exercise of political power is
 constrained by several factors:  public opinion, a free press,
 an independent judiciary, and genuinely competitive electoral
 politics. All citizens over age 18 are eligible to register to
 vote; no group is denied the right to participate in political
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 31
 
 
 472
 activity. Approximately 90 percent of the electorate voted in
 the last general election in 1979, and the next general
 election is scheduled to be held in late 1984 or early 1985.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international entities have asked to investigate the human
 rights situation in Belize. A private human rights council and
 a branch of Amnesty International exist in Belize but have not
 played an active local role.
 Amnesty International's 1983 Human Rights Report does not cover
 Belize, while Freedom House in 1983 rated Belize "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Gross Domestic Product of Belize grew to $148.3 million in
 1982 or around $1,000 per capita for Belize's population of
 145,353. The rate of natural population increase is estimated
 to be 3.4 percent but is effectively reduced to nearer two
 percent through large-scale emigration. The ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption to nutritional requirements
 was 125 percent in 1977. The adult literacy rate is 92
 percent, and 85 percentof the school age population is
 enrolled in primary schools. The infant mortality rate was
 56.3 per 1,000 live births in 1983. The incidence of malaria
 and dengue fever increased in 1982 and 1983, and the health
 care system is not able to provide basic health care for all
 Belizeans. Real income declined in 1982, and unemployment and_
 underemployment are believed to have risen during 1983.
 Women in Belize have to contend with a variety of
 discriminatory mechanisms which are rooted in cultural, social,
 and economic structures. However, there is no official policy
 of discrimination, and the Government of Belize seeks the
 participation of women in the nation's political and
 developmental process. Belizean women are active in trade
 unions, political parties, and private voluntary
 organizations. They are prominent in national and local
 government and are well represented in the professions. The
 Governor General, who functions as Head of State, is a women.
 Women also hold officer and enlisted positions in the police
 and Belize Defense Force.
