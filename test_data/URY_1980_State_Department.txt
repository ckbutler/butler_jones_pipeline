 URUGUAY
 There were some improvements in the human rights situation
 in Uruguay in 1980, following eight years of stringent
 controls over individual and political rights. Although
 many foatures of the post-1973 authoritarian system remain
 in place, the country has begun a process of broader
 political participation.
 Until the early 1970's, Uruguay had long been a democracy
 with advanced social welfare policies. However, in the
 mid-60's, a period of national malaise reflecting two
 decades of economic stagnation culminated in severe urban
 terrorism by the Marxist-oriented Tupamaros. Civil institu-
 tions had great difficulty coping with this challenge.
 In reaction to these developments, the elected civilian
 government in 1972 passed a national security law. This
 law and subsequent legislation suspended or curbed individual
 liberties, expanded police and military powers and shifted
 national security cases to military courts.
 Conflict between the legislative branch and the armed
 forces over the conduct of the anti-terrorism campaign
 (which included disappearances, torture and arbitrary
 arrests), led to the closure of the congress in June
 1973. The trend thereafter was toward de facto military
 rule. The constitutionally-elected president was removed
 by the military in June 1976, and replaced by another
 civilian. Since then the armed forces, through a series
 of institutional decrees, have exercised control over
 the "civil-military" government.
 With democratic institutions largely suspended, anti-
 terrorist activities were conducted with little regard
 for individual rights. The 1971-73 campaign against
 the Tupamaros resulted in their virtual elimination.
 A second wave of security arrests, from 1975 through
 mid-1977, concentrated on communists and far-left activists,
 many of whom appear to have been arrested for participating
 in political activities which were legal when carried
 out. Other arrests, including members of labor, media,
 university and professional groups had little or no apparent
 connection with politics.
 The period from 1975 to 1979 was marked by suppression
 of political activities, de facto suspension of political
 parties, proscription of hundreds of democratic political
 leaders, severe restriction of freedom of expression,
 loss of independence of the judiciary, and intimidation
 of the legal profession. There were large numbers of
 detentions on political grounds. Torture and other forms
 of mistreatment of political detainees occurred during
 interrogation.
 Since 1978 there have been improvements in human rights
 observance. This trend accelerated in 1980. There has
 been a continued decline in violations of the integrity
 of the person. The number of substantiated reports of
 new political arrests and instances of prisoner mistreat-
 ment has been reduced. New detainees have been processed
 more rapidly, with most released within days. The gradual
 release of political prisoners, coupled with a relatively
 low number of new indictments, brought the number of
 political detainees to some 1,219 on December 1, 1980.
 Of the 1,219 detainees, at least 300 have been convicted
 of violent crimes.

 The government has continued during 1980 to pursue an
 economic policy of austerity and reform designed to provide
 a stronger and more efficient economy. Recent years
 have seen structural improvements and rapid economic
 growth, after several decades of stagnation. Despite'
 growth and the array of available social services, lower
 income groups, with incomes eroded by inflation and austerity
 measures, have been seriously affected.
 In 1980 the government began to implement major elements
 of its August 1977 political plan to restore constitutional
 order. While most leading politicians remain proscribed,
 or legally barred from political activity, some lesser
 figures have had their political rights restored.
 The government submitted a proposed new constitution
 to a plebiscite November 30, 1980. During the period
 just prior to the plebiscite there was extensive public
 debate and an upsurge in party activity. In a democratic
 vote, with full electoral guarantees,*Uruguayan voters
 rejected the proposed constitution which provided for
 a major continuing role for the military in government.
 As a result of this action, the government voided the
 1977 political plan and has begun to consider the nature
 and possible form of new measures to govern the political
 opening in Uruguay. Its new program is expected to be
 announced during 1981.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 During the period from 1972 to 1977, torture was used
 extensively to obtain information or confessions from
 suspected Tupamaro terrorists, and later from communists,
 leftists, and other political opponents. Methods used
 included electric shock, severe beatings and immersion
 of the head in water. Fewer reports were received in
 1978 and 1979. In 1979, Uruguayan authorities took internal
 measures to curb the use of torture.
 During 1980 there were occasional credible reports (fewer
 than in 1979) from victims, relatives and others of physical
 and psychological mistreatment during interrogation.
 No one has been apprehended or punished for torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The death penalty and brutal treatment are outlawed by
 Article 26 of the constitution of 1967. Intimidation
 and psychological abuse of detainees occurred in 1980
 but are less common than in the past, evidencing military
 curbs on such abuses. However, very harsh treatment
 still may occur during the initial period of detention
 for interrogation when prisoners are held incommunicado.
 Such treatment may consist of beatings, lack of food
 and/or water, isolation, hooding for extended periods,
 or deprivation of sleep. Both the police and the military
 handle initial processing of prisoners, and the kind
 of treatment is often determined by the type of charges,
 the prominence of the individual involved, and the unit
 handling the case.
 After indictment, almost all prisoners are confined in
 official detention facilities, with conditions for political
 detainees somewhat better than for common criminals.
 Prisoners are not normally mistreated at this stage,
 
 
 546
 although during 1980 there were some credible reports
 of abuse of prisoners by guards and other prisoners in
 Libertad prison. Health care and diet appear to be adequate.
 Prisoners are permitted to see visitors every two weeks
 under restricted conditions and to receive parcels and
 funds for canteen purchases. During the first half of
 1980, the International Committee of the Red Cross visited
 virtually all political detainees in Uruguay. An official
 of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith also visited
 40 political prisoners in two principal prisons.
 c. Disappearances
 Since 1978, there have been no reports of disappearance.
 A number of reported disappearances from earlier years
 have not been resolved. The practice of not informing
 families of arrest, whereabouts and health of prisoners
 detained for security reasons often continues. All such
 recent cases have been resolved once the authorities
 completed initial investigations and indicted or released
 the individual. The notification period for families   -
 and defense counsel has been successively reduced each
 year since 1978.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus and other constitutional guarantees against
 arbitrary detention have been effectively suspended in
 security cases. Uruguayan authorities insist that there
 are no "political prisoners", and that all "national
 security prisoners" were arrested for violent or common
 crimes or for subversive activities. However, the defini-
 tion of subversive activity has been expanded to include
 offenses such as "undermining the morale of the armed
 forces" and disrespect to military authorities.
 Government statistics indicate that in the period since
 April 1972 approximately 6,000 persons have been turned
 over to the military justice system. Over 1,300 were
 subsequently released without trial, and approximately
 3,500 others freed by judicial order for various reasons,
 many of them conditionally. There were an estimated
 1,500 prisoners under jurisdiction of the military justice
 system at the end of 1979 (either awaiting completion
 of trials or serving sentences) plus some 200 new detentions
 this year. Subsequent releases have reduced the number
 to about 1,219 as of December 1, 1980. A small number
 of persons, fewer than 50 at any given time, may be detained
 without formal charges under emergency security measures.
 Although the total figure is somewhat lower than the
 1,500 prisoners of conscience and other political prisoners
 estimated by Amnesty International in its 1980 report,
 there is significant independent evidence to support
 the Uruguayan government's figures. Of the 1,219 prisoners
 held, a certain number, once estimated by military author-
 ities at about 300, have been convicted of violent crimes,
 and many others of lesser but related offenses. However,
 in the absence of adequate guarantees in the military
 trial system, it is questionable that all those convicted
 received fair trials.
 The military penal code permits a prisoner to be held
 for as long as 10 days before being presented to a military
 judge. The ordinary penal code requires filing a charge
 within 24 hours and initiation of proceedings within
 48 hours. In practice, longer delays before indictment
 have been experienced in both systems.
 
 
 547
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under both the ordinary and military codes the Uruguayan
 court system relies on written proceedings in pretrial
 investigation, indictment, trial and sentencing. Terrorism,
 subversion, non-violent political offenses and other
 "crimes against the nation" are subject to adjudication
 under the military code. Confessions, sometimes obtained
 under severe physical and psychological pressure, remain
 the basis for most convictions. The judge, civil or
 military, decides on the basis of written briefs, and
 often confronts the accused only during arraignment and
 when sentencing. Cross-examination is a written procedure
 conducted through the judge. The evidence, arguments,
 and records are normally closed to the public and the
 press. However, the military appeals process provides
 for a public hearing in open court. During 1979 and
 1980, the authorities have permitted and even encouraged
 media coverage of certain cases.
 The military justice system remains secret and arbitrary,
 seriously limiting the rights and ability of the accused
 to mount an effective defense. Standards governing admis-
 sibility of evidence, especially confessional evidence,
 are less rigorous under the military than the ordinary
 penal code. Attorneys under the military code have little
 opportunity for an effective defense. Decisions of the
 military court system may be appealed to as high as the
 supreme court, although this appeals process is rarely
 used.
 Since 1978, Uruguayan authorities have sought to speed
 the work of the military court system, reducing the number
 of new cases involving significant pre-indictment delay.
 Accelerated processing of cases has reportedly reduced
 the total of prisoners awaiting indictment to about 100,
 and has permitted many to be granted release in a matter
 of days. The number of cases awaiting sentence in courts
 of first instance has declined from 400 in late 1979
 to about 100. During 1980, the supreme military tribunal
 reviewed 230 appeals cases, involving 707 defendants.
 Nonetheless, the system is still characterized by backlogs
 and administrative inefficiencies which delay processing
 and consideration of the mandatory second instance appeals
 of all sentences of more than three years.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission in its 1980
 report on Uruguay warns that the military judicial system
 still does not guarantee due process.
 Detainees are free to choose their own counsel, but find
 few civilian lawyers willing to plead cases before military
 courts. They therefore generally have to choose a court-
 appointed public defender, who may be a civilian attorney
 or a military officer familiar with courts martial procedure.
 Amnesty International and the International Commission
 of Jurists report that most prisoners have had a military
 officer without legal training appointed by the state
 as defense counsel. Counsel does not have access to
 clients prior to indictment. Recently, earlier indictment
 has allowed more rapid access by prisoners to counsel.
 Once the accused is indicted under the military code,
 counsel may see clients only in the presence of the author-
 ities. They may see them in private under the ordinary
 code. Counsel does not have full access to evidence
 under the military code. Defense counsels are limited
 by the system largely to sentence-bargaining and pleading
 for early release. There are no known cases where an
 
 
 548
 accused subversive, once indicted, has been acquitted
 under the military penal code.
 Approximately 500 prisoners were released in 1977, 600
 more in 1978, another 600 during 1979, and an estimated
 330 in 1980. Most were freed under a variety of parole
 programs. A prisoner on parole may be denied the right
 to travel, may experience difficulty in finding work
 and is subject to rearrest for parole violation. Persons
 detained under the military justice system sometimes
 continue to be held under emergency security measures,
 or are rearrested on new charges after completing their
 sentences.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home of persons suspected
 of terrorism, subversion or other crimes against the
 nationare suspended under the current emergency security
 measures but are still respected in non-security cases.
 Invasions of homes by security forces have been infrequent
 from 1978 to 1980. There are credible reports of telephone
 eavesdropping by security units.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The government is following policies designed to change
 Uruguay from a closed, inward-looking, highly protectionist
 public sector dominated and stagnant economy into a more
 open, free and competitive economy capable of self-sustained
 growth. The picture is now one of steady recuperation
 from the economic woes of the sixties and seventies when
 per capita incomes declined, capital was run down, balance
 of payments problems were chronic and inflation reached
 unprecedented levels. The gross national product (GNP)
 increased an estimated six percent in 1980. Annual per
 capita GNP growth averaged 5.2 percent in the period
 1975-79, while in the periods 1965-70 and 1970-75 it
 had been only 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.
 Development efforts have focused on increasing investment
 in agriculture and industry, where stagnation had made
 it impossible to sustain income levels and social programs.
 The population is well-fed (the calorie supply in 1978
 was 114 percent of individual requirement). There are
 government-sponsored social assistance programs for the
 poor and housing programs for middle and lower income
 groups. The right of private property is well-established
 and protected. Low mortality rates (infant morality
 is only 49 per thousand) and an average life expectancy
 of 71 years, one of the highest in Latin America, are
 the result of widespread availability of health care,
 free or at nominal cost. Free public education through
 the university level is available to all, although during
 1980, university entrance examinations were required
 for the first time. The adult literacy rate is 94 percent.
 Per capita GNP in 1979 was equivalent to $2,090 (1979
 dollars), one of the highest in Latin America. Employment
 percentages and hours worked have reached record high
 levels in 1980. However, the high inflation rate (83
 percent in 1979 and an annual rate of over 55 percent
 during the first eight months of 1980) continues to reduce
 the purchasing power of some consumers, especially those
 on fixed incomes or in the lower wage brackets, including
 rural workers. The government policy of increasing invest-
 ment while reducing government operating expenses, subsidies,
 
 
 549
 protection and holding down wage increases has led to
 a decline in real wages, although the effects were offset
 somewhat by relatively low unemployment (6.7 percent
 according to government data) and increased hours worked.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The press, radio, television and publishing industries
 continue to be restricted. They operate under a system
 of self-censorship, monitored by the National Office
 of Public Relations (DINARP). Under the emergency security
 measures, no discussion of the government's anti-subversive
 activities is permitted beyond official releases. No
 unfavorable comment on the armed forces is tolerated.
 There was a notable increase in media freedom during
 late 1980, with extensive public discussion and criticism
 on the government-proposed constitution, both in print
 and on radio and television. Journalists became increasing-
 ly bold in questioning government officials and in express-
 ing opposition to government policy in many areas. At
 the same time, there were continued counter pressures
 in the other direction. The editor of a leading monthly
 magazine was held for eight days; a radio news commentator
 was detained and harassed for critical comments on non-
 political subjects; and several of Uruguay's foremost
 journalists resigned under pressure after disputes concern-
 ing publication of controversial material. The government's
 power to dispense advertising and DINARP'S authority
 to monitor and interpret the self-censorship program
 continued to impose a restriction on media freedom.
 Most recently, the government has banned reporting on
 political party activity.
 Foreign publications from non-communist countries are
 freely available in Uruguay, although there were two
 reported instances in 1980 when an issue of a foreign
 weekly news magazine was prevented from appearing.
 The exercise of the right of public assembly, although
 controlled, improved during 1980, especially during the
 debate on the constitution. During the year, the govern-
 ment began to permit public meetings of a political nature,
 which allowed the two traditional political parties to
 expand their activities. A large number of political
 rallies were held by opposition groups during the period
 preceding the November plebiscite. Non-political'gatherings
 are generally conducted without interference.
 Labor unions do not have effective rights to organize,
 negotiate, or strike. The labor movement was virtually
 dissolved in 1973. In 1978, the government began informally
 to relax some of the constraints on organizing and bargain-
 ing, and democratic trade unions and their national confedera-
 tion began to revive. Although the government has prepared
 legislation to permit expanded labor activity, the law
 has not yet been enacted. The government continues to
 consult with the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 on this and other matters related to improving the situation
 of organized labor. Authorities continued during 1980
 to allow limited organizational and collective bargaining
 activities, although at mid-year there were several instances
 of reprisals taken by employers against the officers
 of newly-formed unions, and union leaders complained
 
 
 550
 of government harassment at different times during the
 late spring and summer.
 Uruguay is a secular state; religious freedom is constitu-
 tionally guaranteed and respected. There have been several
 indications during the year of government concern over
 the activities of liberal church-affiliated groups, but
 differences were resolved without incident. Jewish community
 leaders have pressed the authorities to be more aggressive
 in responding to occasional instances of anti-semitism.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no general restrictions on freedom of movement
 within Uruguay, foreign travel, or emigration. However,
 the government sometimes delays response or denies such
 rights as the renewal of passports in cases of persons
 suspected of past or present "undesirable association".
 The government has normally denied to political prisoners
 the option to depart the country rather than serve a
 prison sentence. During 1980, twelve dual-nationals
 imprisoned for political offenses were paroled and allowed
 to return to their foreign homelands. The last known
 case of forcible repatriation was in 1978.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 During the first months of 1980, there was no popular
 participation in the political process, and there were
 no popularly-elected, national government officials.
 Since that time, the government has permitted a marked
 increase in political participation, particularly related
 to consideration of a new draft constitution on which
 a plebiscite was held on November 30, 1980. During
 that period there was extensive party and public political
 activity of all forms.
 A majority of Uruguayans rejected the proposed new constitu-
 tion which was to be followed in 1981 by return to active
 status of the traditional parties and the selection
 of a new president and congressional elections. Some
 political leaders had criticized the nature, timetable
 and structure of the political opening. Government
 leaders announced that the transition to democracy would
 continue and a new program is expected to be announced
 during 1981.
 Restrictions on civil and political rights, applicable
 principally to leftist political groupings in the former
 Frente Amplio, still extend to thousands. The government
 has reviewed the cases of 468 proscribed politicians,
 primarily members of the two major traditional political
 parties, while ignoring political activists of the left.
 Of the cases reviewed, 150 had their proscriptions lifted
 by the end of 1979. During 1980, proscriptions were
 lifted on an additional 84 individuals, only a few of
 whom had played a major political role, leaving the
 number of proscribed politicians of the Colorado and
 Blanco parties at approximately 230, including all major
 political leaders.
 The rebuilding of the traditional Colorado, Blanco and
 Radical Christian parties was allowed to begin in 1980.
 Party "provisional commissions" were formed, intended
 to be representative of the proscribed leadership, and
 the first official contacts since 1973 between the govern-
 ment and representatives of the parties took place at
 
 
 551
 the end of August 1980. However, control of Colorado
 Party assets was removed from the existing party leadership
 in 1980 through restructuring of the party's "administrative
 commission".
 During 1980, the government used Institutional Act No.
 7 to dismiss several dozen employees for participation
 in activities of the traditional parties. In addition,
 The government continued to dismiss permanently tenured
 government employees suspected of subversive political
 beliefs under the Act, although on a diminished scale.
 Several thousand persons have been fired since July
 1977, many from the education system. Those retained
 are expected to execute a loyalty oath.
 Women in Uruguay are accorded equality before the law.
 They attend the university and pursue professional careers
 in large numbers. Women are scarce on the political
 scene, and few women currently hold high government
 office. Those who do hold high government office tend
 to occupy positions related to child care, education,
 social welfare, or family affairs. Traditional social
 patterns restrict employment opportunity for women in
 some cases, and equality of pay is not always granted.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-govermental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Uruguayan government attitudes toward investigation
 of alleged human rights violations have varied considerably
 over time. It has responded to inquiries made in the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission, which is considering
 the human rights situation in Uruguay under its confidential
 1503 procedures. Uruguay continues to cooperate with
 the ILO regarding trade union practices. However, the
 government still opposes the scheduling of a visit requested
 by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. Contact
 was resumed in 1979 with the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) concerning renewal of its activities
 on behalf of prisoners. An ICRC delegation visited
 virtually all political detainees in early 1980 and
 submitted a report to the Uruguayan government.
 Other organizations such as the National Academy of
 Sciences and B'nai B'rith, maintained dialogues with
 the Uruguayan government. The Latin American director
 of the Anti-Defamation League visited Uruguay at the
 invitation of the government in May when he met with
 authorities and interviewed 40 political detainees in
 the two principal prisons. Responsiveness to the concerns
 expressed in April 1978 by the American Bar Association
 mission continues to be shown by the government in administer-
 ing the military justice system.
 There are no non-governmental human rights organizations
 in Uruguay.
