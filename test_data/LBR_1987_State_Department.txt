 LIBERIA
 The Liberian Constitution provides for an American-style
 democratic system of government and guaranteed rights and
 freedoms for the individual. In practice, the legacy of recent
 military rule and the Liberian tradition of strong executive
 authority continue to prevent fulfillment of that ideal.
 Samuel K. Doe, who headed the Military Government which ruled
 from 1980 until the establishment of the Second Republic in
 January 1986, became President after elections in which Doe's
 claim of a narrow victory was widely believed to have been
 fabricated. He and his ruling party, The National Democratic
 Party of Liberia (NDPL), dominate Liberian political life.
 Three opposition parties are recognized and permitted to
 function. Of these, one participates in electoral politics,
 and two continue their boycott of the Government and
 legislature to protest what they regard as a fraudulent
 election.
 While Liberia is now ruled by a civilian government, the army
 continues to be a bulwark of the current administration.
 Liberia's armed forces number about 7,000 members and are
 engaged mainly in guarding border crossings and fulfilling
 certain internal security functions. The lack of military
 discipline, especially among poorly paid enlisted men,
 resulted in much petty harassment of civilians. The police
 force is small and poorly trained.
 Liberia's mixed economy is based primarily on iron ore, rubber,
 and timber and has been in decline since the mid-1970's. It
 continues to suffer from foreign exchange shortages, widespread
 corruption, low export prices, a crushing debt burden, and
 governmental mismanagement. However, in 1987 there was growing
 appreciation of the need for fiscal discipline, manifested by
 the Government's request for American financial experts to
 help improve and manage government finances.
 The human rights situation improved in 1987, but serious
 problems remain. Seven daily newspapers circulated in
 Monrovia, including two which reappeared after being closed in
 1986. Journalists played an active role in the Government's
 anticorruption campaign and also reported on some human rights
 abuses. Institutionally, the legislature, though dominated by
 the ruling NDPL, displayed some independence from the executive
 branch by rejecting three presidential nominees to the Supreme
 Court and defeating or tabling several pieces of legislation
 supported by the executive branch. An extensive network of
 internal checkpoints, which was instituted in reaction to the
 1985 coup attempt and fostered intimidation and shakedowns of
 civilians, was largely dismantled late in the year. Some
 persons were detained without charge on security grounds, but
 none were known to be held at year's end.
 On the other hand, the general weakness of the administration
 of justice throughout Liberia continues to be a significant
 national problem. Most judicial and police officials are
 poorly trained and unaware of their legal obligations. The
 level of awareness of constitutional guarantees is low among
 both officials and the population at large. Arbitrary arrests
 for petty offenses, even for lack of "due courtesy" to public
 officials, and general harassment by military personnel occur
 frequently, while prolonged detention pending trial, or even
 without charge, is commonplace. A new Chief Justice, who had
 promised widespread reform, was impeached by the legislature
 for what many view as political reasons after becoming
 involved in a major constitutional dispute with the President.

 LIBERIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings occurring in 1987.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of officially conducted torture in 1987.
 However, brutality by police and other security officials
 during the arrest and questioning of individuals is fairly
 common, and there have been no evident government efforts to
 halt it. In November three Liberian employees of the U.S.
 Embassy were detained following a traffic incident involving
 one of the President's vehicles. Two of the three were
 released after being held 5 days without charge and were
 examined by the Embassy doctor, who found they bore evidence
 of severe beatings. They were subsequently redetained, but no
 charges were filed. All three were finally released in January
 1988. A journalist arrested in August for photographing
 security officials without authorization alleged that he was
 beaten at the time of his apprehension. In May a student
 leader claimed that he was abducted and beaten by plainclothes
 security officers for several hours before-being released.
 Prison conditions, which have been bad for decades, remained
 poor in 1987. Cells are often small and without windows or
 ventilation. Food, exercise opportunities, and sanitary
 facilities are inadequate. The maximum security prison at
 Belle Yella is notorious for its harsh regimen, including hard
 labor and the impossibility of family visits to prisoners given
 its remote location. The cells at one military detention
 facility in Monrovia are said by former inmates to be 3 feet
 high with a dirt floor. Although the Constitution states that
 civilians may not be confined in any military facility, this
 provision is frequently ignored.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Although police must have a warrant for arrests and persons
 must be charged or released within 48 hours, these
 constitutional provisions are often ignored in practice,
 particularly in cases involving alleged security threats or
 violations. A woman arrested near the Ivorian border and
 accused of communicating with Liberian dissidents in Cote
 d'Ivoire was detained for several months in a military
 stockade without formal charges and without access to legal
 counsel. The journalist mentioned in the preceding section
 was held in a military cell for 5 days without being charged
 and without seeing a magistrate. Seventeen villagers from
 Nimba County were arrested and held for several weeks without
 formal charges after being accused by security officials of
 engaging in suspicious nocturnal dances and other activities.
 Gabriel Doe, a Liberian businessman with ties to the
 opposition, was detained without charge for 50 days,
 apparently because of security concerns arising out of an
 incident involving one of his fishing vessels.
 
 
 LIBERIA
 Prolonged detention of persons without charge frequently
 occurs as a result of administrative and judicial neglect.
 Reports surfaced in 1987 that at least 15 young people rounded
 up in a police sweep of suspected street criminals in 1984 are
 still being held at Belle Yella prison, without charges, over
 3 years later. Details of the case are unconfirmed; however,
 it is generally acknowledged in the legal community that many
 of those now being held in Liberian prisons have been
 "forgotten" by the judicial system. The poor condition of the
 prisons makes such delay of justice particularly egregious.
 Two prisoners reportedly died in custody in 1987 after waiting
 over a year for cases to be brought against them.
 An American priest, Father James Hickey, resident in Liberia
 for over 20 years, was detained overnight and ordered to leave
 the country after the Government declared him to be an
 "undesirable alien," apparently because of his political
 views. Although the section of the immigration law cited by
 the Government in his case requires a conviction before -
 deportation, Father Hickey was neither charged with a crime
 nor convicted. Several Lebanese nationals, accused of customs
 fraud and other economic crimes, were summarily deported in
 1987, also without benefit of judicial review.
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and the practice is
 firmly condemned by the Government. However, some have
 alleged that authorities in rural areas force local citizens
 to work on communal farms.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence and features similar judicial bodies, with the
 Supreme Court at the apex. The Constitution provides for
 public trials and states that there shall be no interference
 with the lawyer-client relationship. Nonetheless, the judicial
 system is often subject to manipulation, and reports of
 financial or political pressure on the courts are not uncommon.
 Despite constitutional provisions-for separation of powers,
 the judiciary has a history of succumbing to the wishes of the
 executive. In June President Doe requested the resignation of
 the entire Supreme Court, saying that the people had lost
 confidence in it. All five justices complied, avoiding a
 constitutional confrontation and allowing the President to
 reconstitute the bench.
 The new Chief Justice, Chea Cheapoo, accepted a presidential
 mandate to direct wide-ranging judicial reform and began a
 major reorganization of the courts with scant regard for
 constitutional provisions regarding removal of judges.
 However, his efforts came to an abrupt end in November when he
 was impeached by the legislature following a dispute with the
 President over his handling of what he described as an
 attempted bribery case. Cheapoo had arrested and detained two
 persons, including a municipal court judge, for allegedly
 attempting to bribe him. The Chief Justice facilitated media
 coverage of the arrest and repeated allegations of
 presidential involvement in bribery, The following day,
 President Doe overruled Cheapoo, ordered the two released, and
 asked the legislature to consider whether Cheapoo's actions
 were constitutional. In impeaching Cheapoo, the legislature
 found that he had overstepped his constitutional authority by
 arresting a sitting"judge. It also found his earlier
 dismissal of magistrates and other court officials to be
 
 
 156
 LIBERIA
 unconstitutional. While political considerations reportedly
 loomed large in this impeachment action, the legal issues
 involved in the bribery case and the impeachment proceeding
 were not clearcut. The incident prompted a significant
 political debate over the separation of powers and the
 constitutional prerogatives of both the executive and the
 judiciary.
 Persons have the right to legal counsel and to bail in
 noncapital offenses. Where the accused is unable to secure
 his or her own lawyer, the court is required to provide legal
 services, although this is rarely done for lack of resources.
 Traditional courts, presided over by tribal chiefs, are not
 bound by common law or conventional judicial principles; they
 apply customary and unwritten law to domestic and land disputes
 as well as petty crimes. These decisions may be reviewed in
 the statutory court system or appealed to a hierarchy of
 chiefs. Administrative review by the Ministry of Internal
 Affairs and, in some cases, a final review by the President
 may follow. Allegations of corruption and incompetence in the
 traditional courts are common. Local officials closed tribal
 courts on the Firestone plantation in July claiming that the
 traditional judges were abusing their authority.
 There were no known political prisoners held in Liberian
 prisons during 1987. However, several individuals have been
 detained for various periods (up to 2 months in one instance)
 pending "security investigations." None of the individuals
 involved was a political activist.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Military indiscipline remains a serious problem, reflecting a
 general lack of professionalism among poorly paid enlisted
 men. This surfaces in random shakedowns of civilians and
 arbitrary interrogations which, in some instances, have
 resulted in violence. In two separate incidents in July,
 members of the Special Antiterrorist Unit (SATU) shot and
 killed civilians, one after an apparently unsuccessful
 shakedown attempt and the other following a traffic
 disagreement. The soldiers involved were discharged and
 turned over to civilian authorities for prosecution.
 Interference in the lives of ordinary citizens occurs on a
 wider scale in rural areas, where local officials wield
 considerable power over the day-to-day activities of people
 and where proper police and judicial procedures are less
 likely to be followed. During the year, soldiers investigating
 alleged security threats in Nimba and Grand Cape Mount Counties
 reportedly harassed and threatened villagers, injuring some
 and causing others to flee into the bush. Legislators and
 other officials from Nimba County, the home of the leader of
 the unsuccessful 1985 coup attempt, publicly complained that
 soldiers and other security officials singled out citizens of
 the county for harassment. President Doe responded to these
 concerns by meeting with tribal leaders from the county in
 October and visiting the county in late November. Following
 his visit, he announced the closure of a substantial number of
 internal check points throughout the country, including many
 in Nimba County.

 LIBERIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Liberian press is lively, and, despite some degree of
 self-censorship, opposition viewpoints are presented, even on
 government radio and television. All media refrain from
 direct attacks on the President and certain other government
 officials. Seven daily newspapers are currently published in
 Monrovia, one of which is government controlled, and each of
 the four political parties began publication of party
 newsletters during 1987. Two daily newspapers, not published
 since mid-1986 because of government pressure, resumed
 publication in 1987 with President Doe's approval. Their
 return'to print encouraged the press to become markedly bolder
 in its investigations and editorials. When President Doe
 encouraged the press to investigate allegations of corruption
 in government, the newspapers began to publicize official
 corruption at a number of government agencies. One newspaper's
 revelations led to the dismissal of the Foreign Minister and
 two other officials for alleged involvement in a government
 scandal.
 On at least two occasions, government officials reacted
 harshly to newspaper articles critical of the Government. In
 February police officials summoned reporters from one newspaper
 to police headquarters following publication of an article
 alleging police brutality and reportedly demanded that the
 paper.also print their version of the incident. In October the
 Supreme Court cited three journalists for contempt of court for
 publishing reports which challenged the Chief Justice to
 substantiate his public allegation that some journalists are
 corrupt. The case was apparently dropped following the
 impeachment of the Chief Justice.
 The Government reinstituted mandatory official accreditation
 of journalists in-1987 and issued credentials to nearly 400
 print and broadcast journalists. Although there is no
 evidence that any application or request was denied, the Press
 Union of Liberia objected to the new procedure as a form of
 "prior restraint."
 The Constitution includes provisions for freedom of expression,
 including freedom of speech and of the press, but also
 stipulates that persons be held "fully responsible for the
 abuse" of this right. Decree 88a, passed by the military
 Government in 1984, declares the spread of "rumors, lies, and
 disinformation" a felony. Although this decree is widely
 believed to be unconstitutional, it has not been revoked or
 challenged in the courts and is therefore technically still in
 force. Government authorities have not invoked the decree in
 the past 3 years, and no individual has ever been convicted of
 a violation of it. Nonetheless, journalists and others view
 the decree as an undue restriction on freedom of speech and
 the press and continue to call for its abolition.
 Although no foreign publications are officially banned, the
 Government still prevents circulation of the magazine West
 Africa, which frequently publishes articles critical of the
 Liberian Government.
 The government-controlled Liberian Broadcasting System runs
 the only television station in Liberia and two radio stations
 which give priority to government news. The Government's
 rural communication network offers a combination of
 
 
 158
 LIBERIA
 entertainment and development information to otherwise
 isolated areas. Two religiously affiliated, politically
 independent radio stations are in operation and report
 critically on local events, though their news programs are
 subject to some government scrutiny.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional right to peaceful assembly and association
 is observed more often in urban areas than in rural areas. In
 1987 opposition groups conducted meetings and other
 organizational activities in the Monrovia area without
 interference from the Government. In some cases, meetings
 were allowed to be held in government facilities. However,
 government authorities in the countryside often prohibit
 opposition groups from holding meetings within their
 jurisdictions. Margibi County officials blocked several
 attempts by one opposition party to hold political meetings in
 the county in 1987. When opposition meetings do take place
 outside Monrovia, participants frequently are harassed. In
 May soldiers in Grand Bassa County arrested and detained
 several members of an opposition political party who were
 conducting a membership drive. A county official claimed that
 the persons concerned, who were teachers, were barred by the
 Constitution from participation in "active politics." (In
 fact, the Constitution does not enjoin members of any
 particular profession from political activity.)
 Opposition groups did not attempt to organize any significant
 public demonstrations in 1987, fearing that the Government
 would react harshly if they did. A 1986 Supreme Court ruling
 barred joint rallies and meetings of the collective
 opposition; however, leaders of the various opposition
 groupings meet on an informal basis without government
 interference.
 The ruling NDPL party maintains a task force, composed of
 several hundred young men, mostly unemployed, which opposition
 parties claim exists for the sole purpose of harassing and
 intimidating political opponents. After a number of violent
 confrontations with opposition members over the past few years,
 the NDPL task force maintained a lower profile in 1987. In
 January a number of task force leaders were detained on
 misdemeanor writs issued by the Ministry of Justice after they
 had threatened senior NDPL officials in an intraparty dispute.
 In July the United Peoples Party announced the formation of
 its own task force in reaction to perceived threats from the
 NDPL task force. Thus far, there have been no direct
 confrontations between the two groups. Although there is no
 formal policy within the Government requiring membership in
 the ruling NDPL, government employees are sometimes pressured
 to join the party. Most senior civil servants are members of
 the NDPL.
 Although Decree 2a, which bans student political activity on
 campuses, is technically still in effect, students participated
 in political activities during 1987. In August the Liberian
 National Student Union (LINSU), which has been harshly critical
 of the Government, held its first National Congress in 8 years.
 Student unions at the University of Liberia and Cuttington
 University also held elections without incident.
 Nonetheless, there were at least two attempts to restrict the
 activities of student organizations and their leaders. In
 March, after considerable debate, the legislature rejected a
 
 
 159
 LIBERIA
 Government-sponsored bill which would have banned LINSU. In
 July the acting President of LINSU and a prominent young
 member of an opposition party were dismissed from their
 positions as teaching assistants at the University of Liberia.
 The university administration claimed the move was unrelated
 to the political activities of the two, but no other university
 employees were dismissed at the time.
 Workers have the right to form unions, organize, and bargain
 collectively. Liberia has a national trade union federation,
 the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU), which is an
 affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, and several independent unions. Union organizing,
 collective bargaining, and the internal operations of trade
 unions'are largely free from government interference. PRC
 Decree 12 outlawing strikes and "any other type of labor
 unrest" is still on the books, but brief strikes have occurred
 despite this ban. The new labor code, which would supersede
 Decree 12 by permitting strikes under certain circumstances,
 has languished in the legislature since early 1986.
 The Government does not recognize the right of civil servants
 or employees of parastatals (public corporations) to unionize
 or to strike.' In March the legislature enforced this
 prohibition by invalidating the charter of the National
 Teachers Union. (The organization continues to function, but
 as an "association" rather than a union.) In August a
 Government-sponsored Civil Service Reform Bill was introduced
 in the legislature which gould codify these restrictions on
 government employees and also enjoin them from membership in
 political parties. *The LFLU, the independent unions, and the
 opposition political parties voiced strong opposition to the
 measure, however, and the legislature adjourned without taking
 action on the bill. In 1985 the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) noted that the Liberian Government's
 restrictions on government employees are in violation of ILO
 Convention 87 regarding-freedom of association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right of all Liberian citizens. No religion has
 preference over any other, and there is no established state
 religion. Christianity, brought by 19th-century settlers and
 spread through the interior by missionaries, has long been the
 religion of the political and economic elite. The majority of
 the rural population continues to practice traditional
 religions. Approximately 25 percent of the population is
 Muslim. The Liberian Council of Churches, an organization
 comprising most of the Christian denominations in Liberia,
 occasionally plays a prominent role in national affairs.
 Early in 1987, a Bong County court indicted over 300 members
 of the Poro, a traditional secret society based in rural
 areas, for criminal offenses related to attacks on Christian
 missions. Poro members alleged that Christian clergy were
 divulging 'Poro secrets in their quest to win converts.
 Charges against the indicted Poro members apparently were
 dropped after the two sides agreed, with the help of
 government mediation, not to interfere in each other's
 activities.
 
 
 160
 LIBERIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides every person the right to move
 freely throughout Liberia and to leave or enter Liberia at any
 time. Although domestic movement was impeded by the extensive
 network of internal checkpoints instituted in reaction to the
 1985 coup attempt, the majority of these checkpoints were
 dismantled late in the year. Police and military personnel at
 these checkpoints routinely searched vehicles and solicited
 bribes from passengers.
 While restrictions on the foreign travel of former political
 prisoners were lifted early in 1987, passport issuance was
 sometimes delayed, apparently for political reasons. Exit
 visas are required for all Liberians leaving the country.
 Though these were routinely granted in 1987, persons wishing
 to leave must first submit proof that they have paid taxes and
 utility bills.
 Refugees are not forced to return to the countries from which
 they have fled. In a few cases, however, the Government has
 sought to deport refugees who became involved in political
 affairs. In 1986 the Government arrested a South African
 refugee for participating in a political demonstration,
 claiming that by doing so he violated the conditions of his
 asylum in Liberia. The refugee was still being held in
 custody without charges at the end of 1987 pending government
 arrangements to deport him to another country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional provisions and universal suffrage, it
 has not conclusively been shown that citizens are free in
 practice to change their government democratically. The
 President and his ruling party, the NDPL, still have much more
 power than other branches of government and other political
 parties. Many officials from the former military regime,
 which was headed by President Doe, still hold positions of
 authority in the current Government, and the military, in
 general, still wields substantial influence in political
 affairs.
 The legislature became increasingly assertive in 1987,
 rejecting three presidential nominees for the Supreme Court
 and defeating or deferring several pieces of legislation
 supported by the executive branch. Nonetheless, the President
 can still count on legislative support on issues of prime
 importance to him. For example, after controversial remarks
 by the Chairman of the United Peoples Party (UPP) in August,
 President Doe convoked a special session of the legislature
 and reportedly demanded that the party be banned. No action
 was taken ultimately, but the heavy official condemnation of
 the UPP leader served to chill the political atmosphere. On
 another issue, the Cheapoo impeachment, the Senate was
 unanimous in its impeachment conviction, despite the fact that
 the general public was clearly divided on the issue. In each
 of these incidents, widespread dislike for the target of the
 President's ire helped him win legislative support. Opposition
 parties continue to boycott the legislature; however, a group
 of legislators, elected in 1985 on opposition tickets but
 taking seats as independents, has formed a caucus and
 functions as an informal opposition party.
 
 
 LIBERIA
 The Constitution prohibits the creation of a one-party state,
 ensures free and fair elections by secret ballot, and provides
 for an Elections Commission to monitor all political activities
 in the country. The elections law empowers the Commission to
 certify parties, conduct all elections, and count election
 ballots. The five Commission members are appointed by the
 executive for life and currently are all ex-NDPL members.
 Citing the widespread fraud that occurred during the 1985
 elections, the opposition has called for an independent
 vote-counting mechanism.
 Three opposition political parties are officially recognized
 by the Elections Commission--the United Peoples Party, the
 Liberian Action Party, and the Unity Party. A fourth party,
 the Liberian Unification Party (LUP), nad its charter revoked
 for failure to comply with financial requirements for
 registration.
 In June 1987, nonpartisan elections for traditional tribal
 chiefs were held by secret ballot. The Electicns Commission
 encountered great difficulty in educating the largely
 illiterate rural population in election procedures. Reports
 of vote-tampering and other irregularities also marred the
 elections. A group of 47 unsuccessful candidates, from a
 total of over 1,400 contenders, petitioned the Supreme Court
 to invalidate the announced results. The issue dissipated
 following an appeal to the chiefs from President Doe to accept
 the election results.
 The opposition UPP joined the NDPL in contesting byelections
 -for two legislative seats in December. Turnout for the
 elections, which were won by the NDPL, was very low.
 Controversy arose once more over vote counting procedures,
 although the UPP did not formally challenge the outcome.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international organizations are known to have sought the
 Liberian Government's cooperation in 1987 to investigate any
 alleged human rights violations. The Government permitted
 representatives from several groups, including Amnesty
 International and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, to
 observe controversial treason trials held in 1986. The
 Government received an official from the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in May and routinely permits
 representatives of the local Red Cross to visit prison
 facilities in the Monrovia area. The isolated maximum security
 prison at Belle Yella is generally considered off-limits to
 outside inspection, though a group of reporters was permitted
 to visit the facility in 1986.
 The National Alliance for Peace and Human Rights, a nonpartisan
 human rights organization formed by Liberians in 1986, lapsed
 into inactivity in 1987, in large part.because of
 organizational problems. While the Government never granted
 the group official recognition, there was no attempt to
 prevent it from meeting.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that "only persons who are Negroes or
 of Negro descent" shall qualify by birth or naturalization'to
 
 
 162
 LIBERIA
 be citizens of Liberia. The Constitution further states that
 only Liberian citizens can own real property. These provisions
 discriminate against many nonblack residents who were born in
 Liberia and consider it their home. Otherwise, there is no
 officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis of race,
 sex, religion, language, or social status. However, members
 of President Doe's Krahn ethnic group hold a disproportionate
 number of high posts in the Government and military and are
 widely believed to be given preference in competing for
 lower-level jobs.
 The status of women varies by region. In urban areas and
 along the coast, women can inherit land and property. In
 rural areas, where traditional ties are stronger, a woman is
 normally considered the property of her husband and his clan
 and is not usually entitled to inherit from her husband. In
 newly urban areas, many women are subject to both customary
 and statutory legal systems. Female circumcision is widely
 practiced by those Liberians following traditional religions.
 Women in Liberia currently hold posts in the Cabinet, the
 legislature, the judiciary, and professions throughout the
 modern economy, but remain underrepresented in most jobs in
 the wage economy.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Liberia's labor laws provide for minimum wages and set health
 and safety standards. The minimum wage of an agricultural
 worker, for example, is $2.00 per day. The workweek is
 normally 40 hours. Inspection is not rigorous, however.
 Employers are prohibited from employing children under 16
 years of age during school hours. This is a difficult statute
 to enforce, since many children are engaged in subsistence
 farming and only a minority ever attend school. Any employee
 can file a grievance with a labor inspector.
