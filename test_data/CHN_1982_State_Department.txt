 CHINA
 China's government is controlled by elements of the Communist
 Party, which is the source of all political authority and
 decision-making in the country. China has a long tradition of
 authoritarian rule and reliance on laws only to discipline
 unruly elements. Chinese emperors in successive dynasties,
 lasting until 1911, ruled by fiat, but their decisions were
 moderated by Confucian principles. Moreover, central control
 was often weak and did not extend to the local level, which
 was dominated by the landed gentry.
 The Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1921, has combined
 Chinese tradition with Leninist principles and methods of
 well-disciplined political organization and party control over
 the political, economic, and social life of the country. In
 practice, however, Mao Zedong's dominance of the party for
 most of the period from the Long March of the mid-1930's until
 his death in 1976 often departed from these principles and
 disrupted the political process.
 During the Cultural Revolution period (1966-76), a breakdown
 of central authority and the dispersion of political power to
 a number of groups not earlier involved in politics were
 accompanied by a major intensification of human rights
 violations. Millions of people were victimized by or enlisted
 in sometimes violent political campaigns, as the 'class
 struggle' advocated by Chairman Mao was vividly enacted. As
 central control was reasserted, actual administrative
 responsibility was borne for a time by the Chinese military.
 China, however, remains unusual among communist countries in
 the degree of political involvement by groups and individuals
 outside the core of the party leadership. At the same time,
 notwithstanding the existence of several small non-communist
 parties which have little influence, any alternative to
 one-party communist rule has been rigidly excluded throughout
 the period since 1949.
 Since 1976, the Chinese system has been in a period of
 transition and experimentation. The political authorities are
 moving away from many aspects of the Soviet model that
 previously guided their political and economic decisions.
 They are beginning to institute a functioning legal system,
 though the degree of independence it will be afforded remains
 to be seen.
 Within the Communist Party, power is divided among a group of
 top leaders in several key organizations, including the
 Political Bureau and its Standing Committee, the Secretariat,
 and the Military Commission. Despite his semi-retirement,
 Deng Xiaoping remains China's most influential policy-maker.
 China's leaders continue to justify their policies in terms of
 Marxist-Leninist ideology and the writings of Mao Zedong, but
 are careful to note that doctrine must be adapted to Chinese
 realities and that ideological tenets must be applied in the
 light of current conditions. This more pragmatic attitude
 has, in recent years, resulted in more flexible economic
 policies in both industry and agriculture aimed at rewarding
 individual initiative, while preserving the basic framework of
 a controlled economy, including common ownership of land and
 factories.

 Since Mao's death, the attention of the Chinese government has
 focused primarily on economic development and the restoration
 of political and social order. In an attempt to deal with the
 pervasive apathy and cynicism toward the Communist Party after
 the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China has begun to
 develop institutions which the Government states are designed
 to allow broader participation in the political process, and
 which the Communist Party also hopes will mobilize popular
 support and enthusiasm for its reform program. These
 institutions include the National People's Congress, the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and
 workers' congresses. Under the new state Constitution, the
 Congress's power to supervise other branches of the Government
 was strengthened at least in a formal sense. The Constitution
 envisions multiple candidate local elections, and experiments
 have already begun. The practical effect of these
 developments is not yet known.
 China's contacts with the outside have increased considerably
 in recent years, with tens of thousands of Chinese traveling
 abroad to study, conduct business, or visit relatives, while
 even greater numbers of foreigners have visited China.
 Emigration controls have also loosened significantly. Chinese
 can and do listen to the Voice of America and other foreign
 radio broadcasts. Cultural life, while still heavily
 regulated by the party, has become somewhat more lively and
 features some types of entertainment that are devoid of
 political content.
 While hundreds of churches, mosques, and temples have opened
 their doors for the first time since the early sixties,
 believers are excluded from the Communist Party and must
 exercise restraint in propagating their faith and in their
 contacts with foreign religious organizations. Much of the
 activity of these official religious organs is aimed at
 regaining central control over local informal religious
 groups, such as house churches, that have proliferated since
 the mid-1970's.
 Per capita income reached record levels in 1981 to stand at
 S230. Economic development strategy has turned to favor
 production of farm products and consumer products, both of
 which are now far more readily available than three or four
 years ago. Party leaders at the highest level recently have
 urged improvement in the living and working conditions of
 intellectuals, who were victims of past discrimination but
 whose talents are essential if China is to develop.
 Though the overall trend has been generally towards a more
 open society, the political structure has continued to impose
 significant restrictions on individual rights and freedom.
 The regime does not tolerate fundamental criticism of the
 Communist Party and the socialist system and tends to deal
 harshly with those who voice such criticism. Contacts with
 foreigners are subject to monitoring by an extensive formal
 and informal security network; Chinese not related to
 foreigners and whose occupation does not require such contacts
 may be warned or, in extreme cases, arrested if they persist
 in such contacts. Writers have been assured that exaggerated
 government criticisms of the past would not be repeated. At
 least one prominent writer criticized in 1981 for
 anti-government writing has continued to-publish after making
 a self-criticism. Nevertheless, artists and writers must be
 cautious in criticizing flaws in the regime and the socialist
 system so as not to suggest that these are the by-product of
 socialism or the party leadership.
 
 
 679
 During 1979, 1980, and 1981, Chinese authorities conducted
 extensive and effective campaigns against unauthorized
 publications, including wall posters, and arrested scores of
 dissidents involved in their promulgation. One person, Wei
 Jingsheng, was given a highly publicized -- though not public
 -- trial, an event that evoked some domestic support for Wei,
 who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Since that event,
 authorities have promulgated "labor education' regulations
 which permitted dissidents to be sentenced to labor camps
 without benefit of a trial. The fact that these anti-dissent
 campaigns were not repeated in 1982 can be attributed not to a
 softening of official attitudes, but to the effectiveness of
 the 1979-81 drives, which largely succeeded in silencing the
 small dissident movement (whose active adherents probably
 numbered several hundred). In addition to removing these
 persons from the political scene, these campaigns dried up
 important unofficial sources of information about human rights
 conditions.
 China's human rights record in 1982 had ups and downs within a
 longer-term positive trend since 1976. In general, there
 remains gradual movement towards a more open society, coupled
 with continuing harsh controls on fundamental dissent. In the
 latter area, perhaps the most noteworthy event of the year was
 one that did not happen: there was continued official silence
 about the disposition of the scores of dissidents and others
 -- including Catholic clergymen arrested in Shanghai in
 November 1981 -- who were detained in the preceding three
 years.  In 1982, Chinese authorities continued to monitor
 carefully their citizens' contacts with foreigners. In June,
 an American teacher in Beijing and her Chinese fiance were
 arrested. The teacher was charged with illicit activities
 designed to procure classified documents and expelled from
 China. Her fiance apparently remains incarcerated. There
 were also reports from several universities that Chinese
 students and faculty members who had what authorities deemed
 too much contact with foreign teachers were given warnings.
 Despite the trend towards loosening controls on foreign travel
 by Chinese citizens, regulations promulgated in 1982 make it
 more difficult for some university students to study abroad.
 New rules prohibit students from accepting private sponsorship
 (except from relatives) for their studies abroad and require
 them to work in China for at least two years after graduation
 before applying to go abroad.
 In one area, China moved to facilitate Chinese-foreign
 contacts. Regulations requiring all foreigners to obtain
 permits in advance in order to travel to any city or district
 in China were relaxed in October 1982. Foreign visitors with
 a Chinese visa may now travel by air or rail, without further
 formalities, to 29 major cities and tourist spots.
 In 1982, China mounted a campaign against economic crime and
 passed regulations allowing for swifter and more severe
 punishment of those convicted of smuggling, bribery, and such
 offenses. In January 1983, a local party official was
 executed for embezzlement and bribe-taking as part of this
 campaign. Similar regulations passed in 1981, applying to
 other types of serious crimes, were carried out in several
 cases in 1982. In one instance, five armed men who attempted
 to hijack a domestic airliner were tried, sentenced to death,
 and executed within five weeks of the incident.
 China made progress in 1982 in reestablishing a formal legal
 system which had been abandoned during the Cultural
 Revolution. A new state Constitution, which is the fourth
 
 
 680
 since 1949, provides for a formal structure in which political
 power is dispersed and contains provisions to protect the
 right of the individual to protest arbitrary official action.
 A new Communist Party constitution promulgated in 1982 also
 contains provisions designed to prevent over-concentration of
 power and emphasizes intra-party "democracy.' Again, whether
 these measures will have a significant practical effect cannot
 now be determined, given that both constitutions continue to
 emphasize the primacy of the Communist Party. Personnel
 shakeups in 1982 effectively continued the earlier trend of
 separating formerly overlapping party and government
 functions, apparently to give government officials clearer
 authority to deal with the problems of policy implementation,
 while the Communist Party continues to formulate basic policy.
 In other legal developments, the first civil procedure law in
 the history of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was
 promulgated for provisional use in 1982, filling a major gap
 in the legal system. The Government announced that over 300
 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have
 been implemented since 1979, when the drive to establish a
 functioning legal system began. The use of mediation
 committees -- informal groups of laymen who resolve about 90
 percent of China's civil disputes and some minor criminal
 cases,,at no cost to the parties -- continued to expand in
 1982. There are over 800,000 such committees, in both rural
 and urban areas.
 China's new economic policies allow individuals to have more
 voice inwhat they produce and in the quantity of output. In
 1982, the Government announced that 90 percent of China's
 rural production teams (the basic unit in the commune) had
 adopted "responsibility systems" which allow individuals or
 groups to make their own production decisions once state
 quotas are met. Free markets, where goods outside the quota
 system may be sold at market prices, are a common feature
 throughout China.
 In 1982, in keeping with the 'united front" policy aimed at
 boosting friendly relations between China and Chinese who live
 overseas, the Government announced that it had released
 several hundred Kuomintang prisoners, all of those still
 incarcerated following the civil war in the 1940's.
 The long-term trend of human rights in China for the
 foreseeable future will depend on the political situation. If
 China's leaders stick to their present course, emphasizing
 economic development -- including the policy of opening to the
 outside -- there are reasonable prospects for a continued
 relaxation of controls in some areas, although the bhn on
 fundamental political dissent will continue and any threat to
 the preeminence of the Communist Party will not be tolerated.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no allegations of political killings in China
 in the recent past, though many were killed or died as a
 result of violent political struggle during the Cultural
 Revolution. At present, two members of China's 'Gang of Four"
 (deposed leaders who were prominent during the Cultural
 Revolution) are under sentence of death, which -- unless
 commuted -- would be carried out in January 1983. Although
 the trials appeared to be highly political, Chinese
 authorities assert that these and others sentenced for
 Cultural Revolution-era activities were convicted of specific
 crimes, such as murder and treason, and not for errors of
 political judgment.
 
 
 681
 b. Disappearance
 There is little information available on the whereabouts of
 those dissidents arrested in the 1979-81 period. The
 Government has actively sought to rehabilitate many victims of
 the Cultural Revolution, but the whereabouts and fate of some
 remain unknown.
 c.  Torture
 In the aftermath of the fall of the so-called Gang of Four in
 1976, it was revealed that the use of torture to extort
 confessions had been common during the Cultural Revolution
 (1966-1976), and a government report stated that 10,000
 persons were prosecuted in 1980 for violations of citizens
 rights, including torture, occurring in 1979 and 1980.
 Official law and regulations now forbid the use of torture.
 Whether torture has in fact been eliminated is unclear, but
 there were no reports of torture reaching the US Government in
 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Chinese authorities continued in 1982 an anti-crime drive
 begun in 1981, emphasizing the need for prompt and severe
 punishment for those convicted of particularly heinous crimes
 of violence. In certain cases, after defendants were
 convicted, a separate "sentencing meeting" was held, attended
 by thousands of people. The principal purpose of such
 meetings was to make a public example of the defendant, since
 sentence had been passed at the trial. The accused would be
 publicly denounced, and his death sentence revealed. The
 defendant would then be led out of the rally and executed
 forthwith; pictures of the entire proceedings sometimes
 appeared in public court notices announcing the disposition of
 the case. Since information on such sentencing meetings is
 not regularly and systematically published by the Chinese, it
 is impossible to estimate how many might occur each year. On
 the basis of sketchy information, the approximate order of
 magnitude was probably around a few hundred.
 Current information about conditions in penal institutions is
 sparse. Inmates are expected to work, and penal authorities
 have indicated that the value of their labor is sufficient to
 pay the expenses of their incarceration. In a Beijing prison
 visited with official sanction by foreigners, inmates live in
 a crowded but sanitary environment.  In penal labor camps,
 some located in remote areas of China, conditions probably
 vary widely, and there have been reports of beatings in some
 camps, and restrictions on letters and family visits. In
 1981, China passed regulations allowing authorities to cancel
 urban residency permits for recidivists and those who escape
 from prison.  Such persons, when their prison terms are over,
 may have no realistic alternative to remaining in the prison
 area as contract laborers.
 The number of prisoners now held in labor camps is unknown,
 and estimates in the past varied considerably, including some
 ranging upwards of 100,000. It appears that the number has
 diminished significantly in recent years, due both to the
 'reversals of verdicts" of thousands of prisoners sentenced
 during the Cultural Revolution and earlier, and. to natural
 attrition.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Chinese law provides that a detained person should be
 released, on the request of himself or his family, if the
 
 
 682
 police have not followed proper arrest procedures. In
 practice, however, this proviso apparently is rarely, if ever,
 invoked. There is no provision for preventive detention. A
 suspect can be held for up to two months before being charged
 with a crime, though this period may be extended with the
 approval of higher authorities.
 Under "labor education" regulations, those who commit "minor
 theft or fraud" or who have been expelled from their work
 units may be sentenced without trial for up to four years of
 labor. This regulation has been used with some frequency
 against political dissidents. Sentences are handed down by a
 public security unit, in consultation with representatives of
 local civil affairs and labor offices.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal defendants in China have the right to counsel, and it
 is providedat little or no cost. Normally, however, the
 defense attorney enters the case only after the prosecutor has
 completed his investigation and the defendant has been
 indicted. In practice, Chinese trials resemble sentencing
 hearings, where defense representatives plead for clemency for
 their clients, whose guilt, with very few exceptions, is not
 contested., The trials are preceded by extensive pretrial
 investigation,.and it is assumed that any individual who is
 brought to trial is considered to be guilty. Chinese
 authorities have indicated that the conviction rate of those
 tried for criminal offenses is about 98 percent.
 Defendants in criminal cases may appeal both verdicts and
 sentences to the next higher level courts, normally the
 provincial high court. In the few cases where results have
 been publicized, appeals have sometimes resulted in reduced
 sentences for the accused.
 There are no standing special political or.security courts,
 though a special court was created to handle the "Gang of
 Four" trial. Although in theory China's courts are
 independent of party influence, in practice the party
 undoubtedly stage-manages trials having political
 significance, such as the "Gang of Four' trial and follow-up
 trials involving "gang" supporters.
 The criminal procedure code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles,
 and "personal secrets.' In practice, attendance at public
 trials requires an admission ticket, obtained from
 organizations selected by the authorities.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press,
 but in practice open criticism of Communist Party rule and the
 socialist system is not permitted. The 1979-81 suppression of
 unofficial publications succeeded in virtually eliminating the
 publication of dissident views. Many of the authorized
 periodicals and newspapers are published by the Communist
 Party, and all others, as well as radio and television
 broadcasts, are under tight party control.
 In this context, open criticism of improper policy
 implementation by government and party officials -- usually
 low or middle ranking -- is permitted and practiced by many
 newspapers.  It is assumed that this criticism is controlled
 
 
 683
 and used by the party for its own objectives. 'Letters to the
 Editor' columns are popular features; such letters are often
 inspired by the party to trigger investigations of alleged
 injustices. In 1982, the highest ranking figure criticized in
 the national press was a Vice Minister of Chemical Industries,
 alleged to have been involved in a bribery scheme.
 Access to foreign books and artistic works is sharply limited
 by the authorities. Foreigners living in China receive
 materials from abroad uncensored or can purchase them locally
 with foreign exchange. Foreign periodicals and magazines are
 available to selected Chinese citizens, primarily in
 universities. Millions of Chinese read the "Reference News,*
 an officially-controlled selection of translations from the
 foreign press, subject to censorship.
 Foreign journalists resident in China have on occasion been
 criticized by the authorities for their coverage of sensitive
 topics, such as the manuscript attributed to dissident Liu
 Qing in 1981.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly and
 association, but in practice these rights are severely
 circumscribed. Although contacts between Chinese and
 foreigners in China have increased considerably in the past
 four years, the authorities closely scrutinize such
 associations.
 The labor union structure is controlled by the Communist
 Party. The All China Federation of Trade Unions enrolls about
 half of the urban workforce. The primary function of unions
 is to foster labor discipline and enhance productivity.
 Unions do not engage in collective bargaining, and almost
 never exercise their constitutional right to strike -- a right
 specifically mentioned in the previous constitution but
 deleted in the new one. Unions also perform a variety of
 social and welfare functions.
 Worker congresses have now been established in many
 enterprises. All candidates to these congresses require party
 approval. These representative bodies in some cases have the
 authority to elect minor plant officials. The assemblies,
 which operate under the leadership of the party, serve only an-
 advisory role. China has a great number of professional and
 other types of associations, such as the Chinese Writers'
 Association, the All China Youth Federation, and the All China
 Sports Federation. These groups operate with official
 sanction, and, in nearly all cases, are controlled by a party
 committee within the particular association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The new Constitution states that citizens of the PRC enjoy
 freedom of religion and should not be compelled to believe or
 disbelieve, nor should they be discriminated against for
 belief or disbelief in religion. This improves upon the
 previous documents that gave preference to practitioners of
 atheism by granting them alone the right of propagation. The
 Constitution assures state protection of legitimate religious
 activities; illegitimate activities are defined as those that
 are counter- revolutionary, disruptive of public order,
 harmful to the health of the people, obstructive of education,
 or dominated by any foreign country.
 
 
 684
 
 In actual practice, religious activities have increased
 significantly in the past four years. Over 200 churches are
 said to be open. According to some official estimates, there
 are as many as four million Christians in China. Unofficial
 estimates are markedly higher. A Catholic seminary opened in
 Shanghai .in 1982, joining the already established Protestant
 seminary in Nanjing. There are several hundred mosques for
 over 13 million Muslims. Buddhist monasteries have resumed
 activities and have ordained small.groups of novice monks and
 nuns on several occasions since 1979. There has been
 considerable work done on the renovation of Lamaistic
 monasteries inTibet's thcee major towns since a reform
 program in Tibet was launched by Hu Yaobang and Wan Li's trip
 there in May 1980. In contrast to this, village level
 monasteries, which were closed and turned into other
 facilities such as grain storage warehouses during the
 cultural revolution, are apparently not being reopened. While
 the namber of practicing monks has increased over the last two
 years,-they are relatively few in number, closely controlled,
 and seem to be playing a largely showcase role. The
 government seems to be feeling its way on this score.
 On the other hand, persons with religious beliefs are not
 allowed to join the Communist Party. They are also excluded
 from many of the material, career, and other benefits which
 often accrue to party members and from effective political
 power or participation in China. The stated aim of the eight
 "patriotic" officially-sanctioned religious organizations is
 to ensure that all religious organizations accept the
 leadership of the party and the state. Chinese authorities
 periodically criticize *feudal superstitious activities,' a
 description-which appears to encompass many traditional
 Buddhist and Taoist practices but does not appear to be
 directed atChristian and-Muslim activities. In some areas,
 authorities.actively discourage persons under 18 from
 attending religious services. Many churches, mosques, and
 other shrines have reopened since the Cultural Revolution, and
 in some areas local governments have assisted with  heir
 refurbishment. However, some religious property remains
 occupied by military and other units.
 Chinese authorities carefully monitor and conttol contacts
 between ghinese and foreign religious organizations out of
 traditional concern over divided loyalties. Relations with
 the Vatican.continue to be strained, partly because of the
 Vatican's continued recognition of the claim of the
 authorities in Taiwan to be the Government of China. Equally
 important, the officially sanctioned Catholic Church in China
 does not recognize Vatican authority. A group of Catholic
 clergy and laymen loyal to the Vatican arrested in Shanghai in
 1981 remain incarcerated, as does Bishop Gong Pinmei, who has
 been in detention since the mid-1950's. Contacts with other
 foreign groups are allowed to a greater extent. A small group
 of Chinese Muslims has made the pilrimage to Mecca annually
 in recent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel*, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within China is subject .to numerous restrictions.
 Chinese citizens must have the permission of their work unit
 (expressed in a letter of introduction) in order to buy
 airline tickets, secure hotel accommodations, or acquire
 ration coupons which allow them to purchase basic food items
 in areas outside their place of residence. Those traveling by
 rail who plan to stay with relatives need not obtain a letter
 of introduction, but still are required to register with local
 police during their visit. In practice, many Chinese citizens
 
 
 685
 travel frequently within the country, and some ignore the
 bureaucratic requirements without reprisals.
 Chinese controls over travel abroad and emigration have
 relaxed signicantly in the past few years. Tens of thousands
 of Chinese citizens go abroad each year to study, conduct
 business, or visit relatives. The US Embassy and consulates
 in China issued around 16,000 nonimmigrant visas in fiscal
 year 1982 and turned down many thousands of other Chinese
 applicants who had secured travel documents from Chinese
 authorities but failed to meet US visa standards.' During the
 same period, 8,000 US immigrant visas were issued in China,
 with about 70,000 on the waiting list.
 Despite the trend towards loosening controls on foreign travel
 by Chinese citizens, regulations promulgated in 1982 make it
 more difficult for some university students to study abroad.
 New rules prohibit students from accepting private sponsorship
 (except from relatives) for their studies abroad and require
 them to work in China for at least two years after graduation
 before applying to go abroad. Chinese citizens cannot travel
 abroad as a matter of-right, and many who apply for passports
 are refused, though no statistics are available.
 Since normalization of US-China relations in 1979, several
 hundred Chinese residents regarded as local citizens by
 Chinese authorities have presented claims of American
 citizenship; in nearly all cases where their claims were valid
 they have been allowed to leave China under Chinese
 documentation. In the US-China Consular Convention, both
 sides agreed to facilitate the reunion of families and to
 facilitate the travel of persons who may have a claim
 simultaneously to both nationalities.
 There is no practice in China of revoking the citizenship of
 political dissidents.
 China has provided resettlement opportunities to large numbers
 of refugees, most of them ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asian
 countries. There have been two large waves. In the early
 1960's, 60,000 people resettled in China in the wake of
 anti-Chinese riots in Indonesia. Since 1977, China has
 accepted more than 250,000 refugees from Vietnam and about
 3,000 refugees from Laos. The number of new refugees dwindled
 to an estimated 1,000 in 1982. There were no known cases of
 repatriation of refugees, either forced or voluntary.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely move their residences about
 inside the country. Chinese are registered as residents of a
 particular locality and cannot change their residence without
 approval from the authorities, which would normally be granted
 only for reasons related to the resident's employment. There
 are many examples of Chinese working couples who live apart
 (except for holiday visits) because they are unable to get
 permission needed from the various bureaucracies involved
 (work units, public security offices) to live together.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Effective political participation takes place only within the
 Communist Party. There are no officially-tolerated opposition
 parties or groups nor do there appear to be any unofficial
 ones, due to the effective anti-dissent campaigns of the
 recent past. Within the Communist Party, "democratic
 centralism" prevails, which means that policy is made at the
 top by a few leaders and transmitted downward. In principle,
 strict discipline is demanded, so that political debate and
 conflict can take place only by informal mechanisms. There
 has in the past been significant contestation between groups
 in the party's top leadership.
 
 
 686
 Eight other parties exist in China and can make
 recommendations on behalf of their supporters, but they are
 very small and have no real effect on political, economic, or
 social decisions.
 Local assembly elections held in 1980 and 1981 provided the
 first opportunity for Chinese citizens to elect
 representatives directly in contests where there were at least
 two candidates, as required by law. In most cases, the local
 Communist Party heavily influenced the selection of
 candidates. In a few instances, however, avowedly non-Marxist
 candidates won elections, some of which were then set aside by
 party authorities. The Government has claimed that 30 percent
 of the victors in the elections were not members of the
 Communist Party.
 China's National People's Congress meets for only about two
 weeks a year to approve government policies, which, in turn,
 have been mandated by the Communist Party. The National
 People's Congress has never rejected a government policy,
 though some have been modified as a result of Congress
 concerns. While there is sometimes informal dissent from
 policy, there has never been a significant number of votes
 cast in opposition.
 China has'traditionally been a male-dominated society, and men
 continue to dominate the political process. There are very
 few women at the top party and government levels. For example
 onlyfour of he. 41 ministers of the central Government are
 .women. Participation by women increases on lower levels; about
 20 percent of the deputies elected to local assemblies in 1981
 were female, according to government reports.
 Minority ethnic and religious groups in border areas such as
 Xinjiang, Xizang (Tibet), Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan
 are permitted a'limited degree of local autonomy, official
 recognition of their languages, and favorable treatment in
 areas such as admission to colleges. The new state
 Conliittuti on stipulates that either the chairman or the vice
 chairman of the standing committees of people's congresses in
 autonomous regions, prefectures, or counties should be a
 member of the nationality group exercising limited autonomy in
 that particular area. However, actual political power
 continues to rest with the party leadership whose leading
 members are virtually always ethnic Han Chinese. Friction
 between Han Chinese and minority groups continues in various
 areas. The governments 0f the autonomous regions have not
 interfered with massive Chinese immigration to some areas,
 which has greatly changed their ethnic balance. The Chinese
 Government has attempted, thus far without success, to
 persuade the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet from exile.
 3. -'Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 China is a member of the UN Human Rights Commission and the UN
 Commission on the Status of Women. China has not been the
 subject of investigations or other human rights actions by
 official international organizations.
 According to press reports, a group of Hong Kong student
 leaders visited Beijing in May 1982 to discuss the fates of
 dissidents arrested in 1981. They were received by government
 representatives, but given little information. Chinese
 officials have not responded to requests from Amnesty
 International for meetings and information regarding human
 rights conditions. Amnesty International's concerns as stated
 
 
 687
 in its 1982 report for calendar year 1981 are the imprisonment
 of dissidents and their detention without trial. Freedom
 House describes China as "not free" and gives it a '6' rating
 on a descending scale of one to seven for both political and
 civil liberties.
 There are no known organizations within China monitoring human
 rights conditions.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 China faces massive problems in meeting the basic needs of one
 billion people. The Government has succeeded in providing
 basic nutrition, health care, and education. The average life
 expectancy of 68 years is very high for a country that ranks
 in the bottom half of developing countries in per capita
 income.
 Basic health care is available at no or modest cost to Chinese
 citizens. Urban standards of health care are significantly
 better than those in rural areas, as reflected in the
 different infant mortality rates -- an estimated 12 per 1,000
 in cities, as compared with 25 per 1,000 in the countryside.
 The Chinese Government has promulgated regulations which
 strongly discourage parents from having more than a single
 child. Through the use of social pressure and economic
 incentives and disincentives affecting material benefits such
 as pay and rations, it has succeeded in reducing the
 population growth rate from 2.0 percent in 1970 to 1.5 percent
 in 1981. In response to population control pressures, some
 families with too many children or who hold to the historic
 value system honoring males but scorning females have resorted
 to the practice of infanticide.
 The Chinese citizenry enjoys a simple but adequate diet. Some
 basic food items, such as grains and cooking oil, are
 rationed.. According to the World Bank, China's calorie supply
 exceeded nutritional requirements by about four percent in
 1979. Flexible economic policies in rural areas in recent
 years have resulted in the growth of free markets and have
 increased the quantity and variety of foods available to
 consumers. Previous discrimination against those with suspect
 backgrounds, including intellectuals and former capitalists,
 has been curtailed. In fact, party officials at the highest
 levels recently have urged improvements in the living and
 working conditions of intellectuals, whose talents are
 essential if China is to develop.
 The increase in Chinese per capita GDP from $219 in 1978 to
 8268 in 1981 has been accompanied by an increase in the supply
 of agricultural and consumer goods, reflecting the
 Government's emphasis on the development of agriculture and
 light industry. China's new economic development strategy
 represents a fundamental shift away from earlier reliance on
 the Soviet model, which stressed rapid growth of heavy
 industry and military expenditures.
 Money incomes in urban and rural areas increased by an average
 of three percent and 16 percent respectively in 1981,
 according to official figures. Real national income growth
 was estimated at three percent, with an inflation rate of
 about 2.5 percent. However, many foreign observers believe
 that overall inflation was significantly higher.
 Housing is crowded and poorly constructed in both urban and
 rural areas; rural localities, in particular, frequently lack
 basic amenities such as electricity and running water. Rents
 are extremely low, averaging about four percent of an urban
 dweller's income and ten percent of a peasant's, though many
 
 
 688
 peasants own their own homes and thus pay no rent.
 Construction of housing units is a priority item in the
 Government's econmomic plan.
 Unemployment in urban areas is a serious social problem in
 China. Youths graduating from high school or leaving at an
 earlier stage may have to wait many months or even three or
 four years before being assigned jobs. Estimates of urban
 unemployment range from four to ten million. To help
 alleviate this problem the Government has encouraged
 individuals, families, and small groups to set up their own
 enterprises, instead of relying on the state for job
 assignments. Labor service companies set up in many urban
 areas provide loans to help individual and collective
 enterprises become established.
 China's current goal is to provide universal elementary school
 education by 1990. According to a Ministry of Education
 announcement in April 1982, this goal has already been
 attained tin areas containing one quarter of the country's
 population (probably encompassing most of the urban areas in
 China) and is "nearing completion' in areas with another 60
 percent of the population. Although the male-female
 enrollment ratio is about even at the beginning of the
 educational process, it is in favor of males at ascending
 levels. Women reportedly account for about one-quarter of
 college students. Ninety-three percent of eligible children
 are enrolled in the first grade. Around 30 percent of the
 young people in the relevant age group complete high school,
 and around five percent of high school graduates attend
 college. The adult literacy rate was 76.5 percent according
 to the 1982 census.
 All land in China is owned by the state or by collective
 organizations such as communes. Property such as houses,
 particularly in rural and village areas, and consumer goods
 such as-television sets, radios, sewing and washing machines,
 and bicycles can be owned by individuals and passed on to
 descendants. The People's Bank of China plans to issue
 private bank loans for maintenance and expansion of
 residential properties as well as for purchases of higher-cost
 consumer durables, on an installment basis.
