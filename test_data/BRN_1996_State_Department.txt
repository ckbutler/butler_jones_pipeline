 BRUNEI
 Brunei Darussalam, a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of Bor-
 neo, is a sultanate ruled by the same family for 600 years.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of political power by
 former Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin to an appointed council of state, but in 1962 the
 Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency
 powers for 2 years. These powers have been regularly renewed, most recently by the
 current Sultan in July. Although not all of the articles of the Constitution are sus-
 pended, the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power. He also
 serves as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, chancellor of the national university,
 superintendent general of the Royal Brunei Police Force, and leader of the Islamic
 faith.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's office and is firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei's large oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with its small population, give
 it one of the world's highest per capita gross national products.
 Human rights remain broadly circumscribed. In practice citizens do not have the
 right to change their government, and they generafly eschew political activity of any
 kind, knowing that the Government and ruler will disapprove such activity and may
 punish them. Nor, constitutional provisions notwithstanding, do they genuinely ex-
 ercise the freedoms of speech, press, and association. Other human rights abuses,
 including discrimination against women and restriction of religious freedom, contin-
 ued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The media occasionally report allegations of police mistreatment of prisoners, but
 these reports cannot be verified. Reports of police mistreatment of prisoners are in-
 vestigated as violations of Brunei law. In 1988 caning became mandatoryr punish-
 ment for 42 drug-related and other criminal offenses and for vandalism. Since then,
 sentences of caning have been handed down and carried out in the presence of a
 doctor who monitors implementation and has the authority to interrupt and post-
 pone the punishment for medical reasons. It is not known how many persons are
 sentenced to caning each year.
 In October the authorities arrested two policemen for the rape of a waitress from
 the Philippines (see Section 5).
 Prison conditions range from fair to good. There is no overcrowding, and prisoners
 usually have a cell to themselves. Prisoners receive regular medical checkups. Re-
 mand cells at police stations are Spartan but adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for a prompt judicial
 determination of the validity of an arrest. However, those provisions, like the Con-
 stitution itself, may be superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation of
 the emergency powers. The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government occa-
 sionally has used the ISA to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity;
 however, information on the detainees is only pubished after they are released. Two
 former rebel leaders were pardoned and released, after undergoing "political retrain-
 ingo and swearing loyalty to the Sultan. The authorities assert they are holding one
 or two other former rebel leaders in detention under the ISA.
 Police officers have broad powers to make arrests without warrants. However,
 under normal circumstances, a magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest. War-
 rants are issued without this endorsement on rare occasions, such as when police
 are unable to obtain the endorsement in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.
 Under the colonial era Banishment Act of 1918, any person deemed to be a threat
 to the safety, peace, or welfare of Brunei, may be forcibly exiled either permanently
 
 
 or temporarily by the Sultan. Since independence, there have been no cases of ban-
 ishment of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution does not specifically provide for
 an independent judiciary. In mid-September, in a landmark legal decision, however,
 the appellate-level, High Court ruled that the Court has powers independent of the
 prosecution, and ordered a discharge in a car theft case under review, which
 amounted to an acquittal under the Criminal Procedure Code. So far the Govern-
 ment has not challenged the court's finding that magistrates have the legal power
 to discharge and acquit a defendant, even when the discharge is not requested by
 the prosecution.
 The judicial system consists of five levels of courts, with final recourse in civil
 cases available through the Privy Council in London. In January 1995, Brunei ter-
 minated appeal to the Privy Council in criminal cases. Procedural safeguards in-
 clude the right to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter, the right to a speedy
 trial, and the right to confront accusers. There were no known instances of govern-
 ment interference with the judiciary and no trials of political opponents.
 The civil law, based on English common law, provides citizens with a fair and effi-
 cient judicial process. Shari a (Islamic law) supersedes civil law in a number of
 areas, including divorce, inheritance, and sexual crimes.
 Two "returnees" (individuals accused or convicted of participating in the 1962 re-
 bellion, who fled or escaped the country, and subsequently returned) were released
 after going through "political retraining," and swearing loyalty to the Sultan, and
 government officials assert that only one or two such political prisoners are still in
 prison because of their role in the 1962 rebellion and their alleged refusal to re-
 nounce violence and pledge loyalty to the Sultan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-Al-
 though the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons,
 families, or homes, this rarely happens. There are occasional reports of mail having
 been opened prior to delivery.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is no law restricting freedom of speech
 and freedom of the press. However, the Government on a few occasions censored
 international newspapers and periodicals by removing or blacking out articles or
 photographs found to be objecto nable, particularly those potentially embarrassing
 to the royal family, critical of the Government or the Sultan, or those judged sexu-
 ally improper by censors. Magazine articles with a Christian theme are reportedly
 invariably censored. However, the rwing use of fax machines, the Internet, and
 access to satellite transmissions make it increasingly difficult to keep such material
 from entering. There appears to be less evidence that authorities are trying to pre-
 vent the entry of such material. The independently owned local newspaper appears
 to practice self-censorship in its choice of topics so as not to anger the Government
 but it has instituted a new feature of letters to the editor by which citizens--some
 by name and some anonymously-criticizee Government's handling of certain so-
 cial, economic, and environmental issues.
 Although the only Brunei-based television station is government-owned, two Ma-
 laysian television channels are also received locally. A 10-channel cable network of
 television stations is widely available. This network includes the Cable News Net-
 work, the British Broadcasting Corporation World News, and several entertainment
 channels.
 The Government's tolerance of political criticism has not been tested recently be-
 cause there is no organized opposition. Moreover, citizens generally make almost no
 criticism of their government. In the past, the Government has not hesitated to ar-
 rest those who attempted to propagate unwelcome political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes also has not been seriously tested in recent years. Following a 1967
 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to form in 1985 and
 1986. The Government severely restricted membership in bth, and disbanded one
 of them in 1988.
 The remaining party, the Brunei Solidarity National Party, which had been inac-
 tive for several years, held an assembly in February 1995, reportedly with the con-
 sent of the Government. About 50 people attended. In May 1995, the party presi-
 dent resigned. In a September 1995 interview in a local newspaper, he said that he
 had resigned after the Home Affairs Ministry warned him not to involve himself in
 political activity because he is a former political detainee. He told the interviewer
 that he was seeking authorization from the Government to resume political activity.
 There has been no public party activity since the February 1995 assembly.

 The activities of international service organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis, and
 the Lions, continue to be constrained by the Government which in 1995 reminded
 local leaders of these organizations that Muslims may not be members.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-The Constitution states that, "Te religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gon: Provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darussalan" In recent months,
 the Government has sporadically voiced alarm about "outsiders" preaching radical
 Islamic fundamentalist or unorthodox beliefs. Citizens deemed to have been influ-
 enced by such preaching (usually students returning from overseas study) have been
 "shown the error of their ways* in study seminars organized by orthodox Islamic
 religious leaders. The Government seems more concerned about these so-called Is-
 lanic opportunists" than unwelcome political views. Moreover, the Government
 does not hesitate to investigate and to use its internal security apparatus against
 these purveyors of radical Is am.
 In 1991 the Government began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary mon-
 archy and the observance of traditional and Muslim values by reasserting a national
 ideology known as the Malaya Islam Beraja (MIB) or "Malay Muslim monarchy,"
 the genesis of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century. The Government in
 1993 participated in issuing the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, which confirms the
 right of all persons to a wide range of human rights, including freedom of religion.
 Despite this and constitutional provisions providing for the full and unconstrained
 exercise of religious freedom, the Government routinely restricts the practice of non-
 Muslim religions by: Prohibitingproselytizing; occasionally denying entry to foreign
 clergy or particular priests, bishops, or ministers; banning the importation of reli-
 gious teaching materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permission
 to expand, repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines.
 The Ministry of Education has also restricted the teaching of the history of reli-
 gion or other courses in religion in non-Islamic schools while requiring courses on
 Islam or the MIB in all schools. Currently only the Bandar Seri Begawan Inter-
 national School, which citizens or permanent residents generally are not permitted
 to attend, is exempted from these restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts the movement of former political prisoners
 during the first year of their release. Otherwise, it generally does not restrict free-
 dom of movement for most citizens, visitors, and permanent residents. The Govern-
 ment places some contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain expatriate
 employees, but this is limited to the first year of the contract. Brunei has no legal
 provision for granting temporary refuge, first asylum, or refugee status to those
 seeking such refuge or asylum. Under the law, persons arriving without valid entry
 documents and means of support are considered illegal immigrants and are de-
 ported. There were no known cases of individuals seeking temporary refuge in 1996.
 B"nei has agreed in principle, and subject to certain reservations, to the Com-
 prehensive Plan of Action adopted by the 1989 International Conference on Indo-
 chinese Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are unable to change their government through established democratic
 processes. Under the continuing state of emergency, there is no parliament, and po-
 litical authority and control rests in the hands of the ruling monarch. Individual
 citizens may seek to express their views or to influence government decisions and
 policies by petitioning the Sultan or handing him letters when he appears in public.
 A form of popular representation lies in a traditional stem of village chiefs who,
 since 1992, are elected by secret ballot by all adults. Tese leaders communicate
 constituents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic meetings
 chaired by the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by the Sultan.
 In May the Sultan officiated at the first General Assembly of the "mukim" (a group
 of villages) and village consultative council. Over 1,000 village chiefs from 150 vil-
 lages and 35 mukim participated as delegates. The delegates were elected from
 among individual villagers, and the Government described the Assembly as "a grass
 roots level political system." The council's advisers, however, are all appointed by
 the Sultan. The Government insists that ordinary citizens actually use these coun-
 cils to present their grievances and to obtain redress.
 Substantial numbers of women serve at the junior and middle levels of the large
 government bureaucracy. At higher levels of the bureaucracy, a clear pattern of dis-
 crimination exists. Since independence, no woman has been appointed to head a
 ministry, and women continue to be passed over despite the presence of a number
 
 
 596
 of well-qualified candidates for promotion to positions at permanent secretary and
 deputy minister levels. A woman now serves as an intermediate court judge, the
 highest judicial position held by citizens, and a sister of the Sultan has the rank
 of ambassador-at-large and is the second highest ranking official in the Foreign
 Ministry.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations that deal specifically with the
 protection of human rights. Given the tight restrictions on freedom of speech and
 Press and the Government's unwillingness to tolerate criticism, any group or indi-
 dual attempting to investigate and report publicly on human rights issues would
 face severe constraints. There were no known allegations of abuses or requests to
 visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except for religion (see Section 2.c.), the Constitution does not contain specific
 provisions prohibiting iscrimination based on the factors listed above.
 Women.-The extent to which spousal abuse may occur and go unreported is not
 known. However, in response to a growing perception that domestic violence is a se-
 rious problemra,he polie estabishd a   p ii unit to investigate allegations of
 spousal abuse in October 1994. Approximately 16 cases of domestic abuse were re-
 ported to polic in the first half of 1995. The Government has established a shelter
 or aused women, and reportedly there were four residents there in 1995. In gen-
 eral Islamic religious authorities oppose divorce and encourage spouses to return
 even to flagrantly abusive husbands. However, they recognize wife beating as
 grounds for divorce. In 1995 the Government initiated a weII-publiced telephone
 hot line to report abusers.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a
 fine. An assault resuling in serious injury would be punished by caning and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 While the level of violence in society is low, beating of servants--or refusing them
 the right to leave the house on days off, somemes on grounds that they might
 encounter the wrong company-is less socially unacceptable behavior. Since most
 female domestics are foreign workers who are highly dependent on their employers,
 those subject to abuse may be unwilling or unable to bring complaints, either to the
 authorities or to their governments' embassies. When such complaints are brought,
 however, the Government is generally quick to investigate allegations of abuse and
 impose fines and punishment as warranted. In October the Government moved
 qicky to arrest and charge two policemen who viciously raped a 30-year-old wait-
 ress from the Philippines. If convicted they could face up to 30 years' imprisonment
 for aggravated rape involving threat and hurt. The victim of the alleged rape imme-
 diately sought refuge with her embassy, which lodged a police report. She was also
 taken for a medical examination.
 In accordance with Koranic precepts, women are denied equal status with men
 in a number of important areas, such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of chil-
 dren. Under the Brunei Nationality Act, citizenship is transmitted through males
 only. Female citizens who are married to foreigners or bear children by foreign fa-
 thers cannot transmit citizenship to their children, even when such children are
 brn in Brunei. This has resulted in creation of a sizable population of stateless chil-
 dren, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who are entitled to live in Brunei and
 be documented for travel by the Government, but who cannot enjoy the full privi-
 leges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do nothave university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-te-month positions
 continue to receive slightly less annual leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterparts in permanent positions.
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Brnei Muslim women to wear the
 tudong, a traditional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women
 do not, however, and there is no official pressure on non-Muslim women to do so.
 All female students in government-operated schools are required to wear the
 tudong; students in nengovernment schools are encouraged to wear it.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women, and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. Women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in the armed forces, although they may not serve in combat. The
 
 
 597
 number of female university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of
 Brunei University's entering class is female.
 Children.-There are no published statistics regarding the welfare of children.
 The strong commitment to family values within society, the high standard of living,
 and government funding for children's welfare provides most children a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas, nutritional standards are high, and poverty is almost unknown. There
 were 18 reported cases of child abuse in the first half of 1995. In 1996 Brunei be-
 came a signatory to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. In October the
 Brunei High Court convicted a father of 11 of child abuse. The Chief Justice sen-
 tenced him to 20 years in prison and ordered him caned with 20 strokes of the rat-
 tan for causing the death of his 3-year-old daughter and grievous hurt to another
 2 of his children.
 People With Disabilities.-No legislation mandating accessibility or other assist-
 ance for disabled persons has been passed. The Government is attempting to provide
 educational services for children with disabilities, although these efforts are not yet
 adequate to address the situation. Teachers are still being trained to deal with dis-
 abled children and some children have no educational opportunities. A special facil-
 ity with trained educators is needed to accommodate the disabled children who can-
 not be assimilated into normal classrooms.
 Indigenous People.-The 6 percent of the population that is composed of indige-
 nous peoples has long been integrated into society, and enjoys the same rights as
 other citizens.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Some members of non-Malay minorities,
 such as ethnic Chinese, including those born and raised in Brunei, are not automati-
 cally accorded citizenship and must travel abroad as stateless persons. Brunei's colo-
 nial-era naturalization laws are widely viewed as out of date and in need of reform.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. There are three registered trade unions, one passive
 and two generally inactive, all of them in the oil sector, and with a total member-
 ship amounting to less than 5 percent of that industry's work force. All workers,
 including civil servants other than those serving in the military and police, may
 form or join trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government. The Trade
 Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union federations, but forbids af-
 filiation with labor organizations outside Brunei. An individual contract is required
 between an employer and each employee, but legal trade union activities cannot be
 deemed to violate employee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this provision as
 conferring the right to strike, but there have been no strikes. Brunei is not a mem-
 ber of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employment
 or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or nonmembership
 in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions are not con-
 ducive to the development of trade unions. There is little interest on the part of
 workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not very active. The law
 is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few industries. There are
 few industries of the kind in which unions have traditionally developed. Also, cul-
 tural tradition favors consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit packages are
 based on market conditions and tend to begenerous.
 There is a free trade zone in Muara Port, known as the Muara Export Zone
 (MEZ), established in May 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Enactment Laws of
 1954 prohibits employment of children below the age of 16. Parental consent and
 approval by the La or Commission is required for those below the age of 18. Women
 under age 18 may not work at night or on offshore oil platforms. The Depament
 of Labor (DOL), which is a part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, effectively enforces
 laws on the employment of children. There were no reports of violations of the child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens to command good salaries. There is no minimum wage.
 The standard workweek is Monday through Thursday and Saturday, with Friday
 and Sunday off, allowing for two 24-hour rest periods each week. Overtime is paid
 for work in excess of 48 hours a week, and double time is paid for work performed
 
 
 on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety standards are established by gov-
 ernment regulations. The DOL inspects working conditions on a routine basis and
 in response to complaints. The DOL generally enforces labor regulations effectively.
 However, in the unskilled labor sector enforcement is lax, especially for foreign la-
 borers (see also the subsection on Women in Section 5). The DOL is empowered to
 close any workplace where health, safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory,
 and it has done so in the past.
