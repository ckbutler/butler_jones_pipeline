 MAURITIUS
 The small island nation of Mauritius has a tradition of democ-
 racy, fair judicial practice, and high standards of human rights.
 The parliamentary political system is modeled on that of Great
 Britain. Mauritian citizens participate freely in the electoral
 process, selecting the representatives of their choice from among
 the candidates proposed by three major and several minor political
 parties. The economy is essentially a mixed one, with private
 entrepreneurs and parastatal organizations existing side by side.
 The Mauritian standard of living is equal to or slightly higher
 than that of the average middle-income developing nation.
 As a result of the June 1982 parliamentary elections, political
 power was democratically transferred from the Mauritian Labor
 Party, ruling since the acquisition of independence in 1968, to a
 socialist alliance comprised of the Mauritian Militant Movement
 and the Mauritian Socialist Party.
 The new Government has shown its intention of respecting and
 reinforcing the democratic traditions of Mauritius. One of the
 first acts of the Legislative Assembly was to pass a constitu-
 tional amendment strengthening previous legislation providing for
 the holding of national elections every five years. Municipal
 elections, indefinitely postponed by the former Government in
 1980, have now been scheduled for December 1982, and will be
 overseen by the independent and impartial Electoral Supervisory
 Commission. Furthermore, Government leaders have manifested their
 intention of keeping party and governmental structures distinct.
 The human rights record of Mauritius has been good. An independ-
 ent judiciary administers a legal system based on Great Britain's,
 with scrupulous attention for the rights of the accused. Several
 political parties vigorously compete for the allegiance of voters
 without Government interference. Five dailies, one important
 weekly, and several other newspapers operate in a highly partisan
 fashion, subject only to the legal constraints of-libel and
 slander. There have been no serious labor strikes or violent
 demonstrations against the Government in 1981-1982.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Killing
 There have never been any substantiated reports of killings
 for political or other motives by the Government or other polit-
 ical organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of the disappearance of anyone in
 Mauritius for political reasons.
 c. Torture
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited by law. No
 allegations of torture have been made in Mauritius.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 These practices have not occurred in Mauritius.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 
 
 211
 There are no political prisoners in Mauritius. Habeas corpus
 exists in practice, and a subject can be held only up to forty-
 eight hours without being charged. Although arbitrary arrests
 occurred in the early 1970's, when the Government jailed opposi-
 tion political and trade union leaders whom it accused of creat-
 ing chaos and anarchy, there have not been any recent incidents
 of misuse of law enforcement and penal institutions for political
 ends.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of a Supreme Court with appellate powers and a series of
 lower courts. There are no political or military courts. Since
 the early 1970's, the courts' record of assuring fair public
 trials to all offenders has been good. Defendants have the right
 to private or court-appointed legal counsel. The judicial system
 is known for its independence. In the past it has made several
 politically difficult decisions, such as finding a prominent
 minister guilty of corruption.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The search of persons, property, or premises is allowed
 only under certain clearly specified conditions by order of the
 court, or by police decision if any illegal act has been committed.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected both in the Constitution
 and in practice. Seven major privately owned newspapers, repre-
 senting all hues of the political spectrum, freely ventilate their
 partisan and often highly critical views. The 1982 parliamentary
 campaign clearly demonstrated the respect of freedom of speech and
 press in Mauritius. For instance, both Government and opposition
 political parties were allocated free time on the national radio
 and television network to introduce their candidates and expound
 their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Public Order Act requires police permission for demonstrations
 and mass meetings. Such permission is rarely refused. During the
 1982 parliamentary campaign all political parties were allowed to
 hold almost daily rallies, culminating with one held June 6 by the
 socialist alliance, then in opposition, which drew an estimated
 80,000 persons.
 Labor unions are free to organize, bargain collectively, strike,
 and affiliate with the international bodies of their choice. In
 December 1980, there were 304 registered unions in Mauritius with
 a total of 78,417 members (it is believed that 1982 figures are
 similar). The labor strife that characterized Mauritius several
 years ago has not recurred, and the period following the June
 1982 elections continues to be one of relative labor calm. The
 new Government's "policy of dialogue" extends to its relations
 with labor unions, and intensive intersectoral discussions are
 slated to open soon regarding amendment of the Industrial Rela-
 tions Act, reinforcing labor unions' rights and responsibilities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 
 
 212
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Christians,
 Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists openly practice and teach their own
 religion without prejudice. All religious institutions receive
 state subsidies in proportion to their number of adherents.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country, foreign
 travel, emigration, or repatriation.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mauritius is a democracy with a parliamentary system patterned
 after that of Great Britain. The country is governed by a freely
 elected Legislative Assembly, with executive direction coming from
 the prime minister and his cabinet. A Governor-General, represen-
 tative of the Queen of England, remains titular head of state.
 Political participation is open to all adult citizens. Two major
 alliances and other relatively minor political parties presented
 candidates in the June 1982 parliamentary elections. Opposition
 groups exist openly. The parliamentary opposition is headed by an
 officially designated and recognized leader.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all types of politi-
 cal, business, and social activities, and a few hold high posi-
 tions. Nonetheless, the fact remains that conservative religious
 and ethnic attitudes inhibit women. The Government, however, is
 taking action in this area. In October 1980, the Legislative
 Assembly passed a bill abolishing most Napoleonic legal code stip-
 ulations discriminating against women, and in June 1982 a woman
 was named as both Minister of Justice and as Minister of Women's
 Affairs.
 3.   Government Attitudes Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There are no known attempts by outside organizations to investi-
 gate the human rights situation in Mauritius.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Mauritius is a small and densely populated nation, whose mixed
 economy continues to be dominated by the sugar industry, despite
 Government attempts to diversify and expand. Measured in current
 dollars, per capita Gross National Product of $1080 in 1979
 dropped to $1060 in 1980, reflecting the extended effect of wide-
 spread cyclone damage in 1979-1980 and the world wide economic
 recession. Although GNP for 1981 rose to $1340, further econo-
 mic recovery since 1981 has been inhibited by growing difficulties
 in exporting to the increasingly saturated markets of the Western
 industrialized nations, Mauritius' major commercial partners.
 Mauritius enjoys the standard of living (according to Inter-
 national Monetary Fund standards) of a middle-income developing
 country, with nutrition, health care, and education comparable
 to other countries with similar income levels. The adult liter-
 acy (over 80 percent) and life expectancy (65 years) rates,
 however, are higher. Basic human needs are extensively provided
 for through Government programs. Nonetheless, approximately 12
 percent of the population still lives below the absolute poverty
 level.
 Free medical care is generally available to all Mauritians in an
 
 
 213
 expanding network of Government-owned and operated hospitals and
 dispensaries. The Government has actively pursued a pragmatic
 and successful population control policy. The population growth
 rate has varied between 1.3 percent (1979), 2.0 percent (1980),
 and 1.8 percent (1981). The standard of nutrition is generally
 higher than in most African countries (the available calorie
 supply exceeds nutritional requirements), and starvation is
 virtually non-existent. Nevertheless, as can be expected, the
 level of nutrition is generally much lower among the rural poor
 than among city dwellers and the more affluent sectors of Mauri-
 tian society.
 Education in Mauritius up to the pre-university level has been
 free and available to all sectors of the population since 1977,
 although the general public has perceived a drop in the quality
 of education since that time. University education was also free
 until 1980, when tuition fees were reimposed as a result of
 increased Government deficits, primarily due to the deteriorating
 economic situation in Mauritius.
 With free medical care and education, as well as subisidies for
 basic foodstuffs such as rice and flour, granted by the Govern-
 ment, the basic needs of Mauritians are well provided for.
 Nevertheless, a number of problems remain because of an essen-
 tially mono-economy, periodically damaging cyclones, deteriorating
 terms of trade, and a heavy level of social expenditures. Unem-
 ployment is running at 20-24 percent, with the result that higher
 education no longer is seen as a guarantee of upward mobility or
 future employment. The Government has also been limited by finan-
 cial difficulties from providing adequate shelter to those
 made homeless by recurring cyclones. The Government housing
 estates lack adequate water and electricity. The new Government
 faces a difficult task as it seeks to extend social benefits and
 programs, while strivipg to maintain its international economic
 credibility and competitiveness through a strong commitment
 to fiscal responsibility and economic pragmatism.
