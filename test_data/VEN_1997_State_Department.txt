 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a bicameral
 congress, and a popularly elected president. Over three decades of two-party domi-
 nance ended in 1994 when former president Rafael Caldera was sworn in as Presi-
 dent with the support of a coalition of small and medium sized parties. The Con-
 gress comprises seven major political groupings. In July 1995, the Government rein-
 stated most of the constitutional protections for citizens' rights that it had sus-
 pended in June 1994 to combat subversion and to address the country's financial
 crisis. In some border areas where guerrilla activity, drug trafficking, and kidnaping
 were a continuing problem, suspension of freedom from arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion and search without warrant, as well as freedom to travel, remained in effect.
 The judiciary is legally independent, but judges are subject to influence.
 The security apparatus comprises civilian and military elements, both accountable
 to elected authorities. The Justice Ministry controls the Judicial Technical Police
 (PTJ), which conducts most criminal investigations. The Interior Ministry controls
 the State Security Police (DISIP), which is primarily responsible for protecting pub-
 lic officials and investigating cases of subversion and arms trafficking. The General
 Directorate for Military Intelligence (DIM), under the Defense Ministry, is respon-
 sible for collecting intelligence related to national security and sovereignty. The Na-
 tional Guard, a branch of the military, has arrest powers and is largely responsible
 for guarding the exterior of prisons and key government installations, maintaining
 order during times of civil unrest, monitoring frontiers, and providing law enforce-
 ment in remote areas. It also supplies the top leadership for the Metropolitan Police,
 the main civilian police force in and around Caracas, and for various state and mu-
 nicipal police forces. Both police and military personnel were responsible for human
 rights abuses.
 Venezuela has abundant natural resources, but a large proportion of its people are
 poor. Oil accounted for 28 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), 61 percent of
 eovernment revenues, and 77 percent of the country's exports in 1997. Per capita
 DP of $3,500 is unevenly distributed. The public sector dominates the economy,
 employing one out of six workers. Public sector iron, steel, aluminum, and petro-
 
 
 667
 chemical products constitute one third of the country's non-oil exports. The Govern-
 ment privatized telecommunications and most of the steel sector, reprivatized most
 of the financial sector, and opened the oil industry to foreign joint ventures. The
 Government plans to privatize the aluminum industry and other smaller public sec-
 tor enterprises in 1998.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor in certain areas and
 includes extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects by the police and military, torture
 and abuse of detainees, failure to punish police and security officers guilty of abuse,
 arbitrary arrests and excessively lengthy detentions, illegal searches, and corruption
 and severe inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems. Overcrowding
 and violence in the prisons were so severe as to constitute inhuman and degrading
 treatment. Violence against women, abuse of children, discrimination against the
 disabled, and inadequate protection of the rights of indigenous people continue to
 be problems. Vigilante justice is a problem.
 In an effort to address these problems and formulate a national human rights
 agenda, the Government held a high-level symposium with nongovernmental organi-
 zations (NGO's) in July. In addition, the Government announced the creation of a
 National Police Committee and a human rights office in the Defense Ministry to en-
 sure better compliance with human rights norms. In October the Supreme Court
 ruled that the Vagrancy Act, which permitted up to 5 years' detention without trial
 of persons deemed a danger to society, was unconstitutional. In December Congress
 approved a new Code of Criminal Procedure that provides for open public trials with
 oral proceedings and jury participation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings, primarily of criminal suspects, by the se-
 curity forces continued. The Venezuelan Program of Action and Education in
 Human Rights (PROVEA), a highly respected nongovernmental human rights orga-
 nization, documented 151 extrajudicial killings from October 1996 through Septem-
 ber 1997. The killings involved summary executions of criminal suspects, indiscrimi-
 nate or excessive use of force, and death resulting from mistreatment while in cus-
 tody. According to PROVEA, the State Police were responsible for 69 of the killings;
 the Metropolitan Police of the Federal District, 18; the PTJ, 17; the National Guard,
 17; the Municipal Police, 15; the armed forces, 6; the DISIP, 4; and other branches
 of the security apparatus or a combination of branches, 5.
 The perpetrators of extrajudicial killings act with near impunity, as the Govern-
 ment rarely prosecutes such cases. The police often fail to investigate crimes alleg-
 edly committed by their colleagues and characterize incidents of extrajudicial
 killings as "onfrontations," even though eyewitness testimony and evidence strong-
 ly indicate otherwise. In addition, the civilian judicial system remains highly ineffi-
 cient and sometimes corrupt, and military courts are often biased in favor of mem-
 bers of the armed forces accused of abuse. A special pretrial summary phase called
 "nudo hecho," which is used in cases involving public officials and is conducted in
 secret, often shields members of the security forces from prosecution, since cases can
 languish in that phase for several years. In the small number of rosecutions in
 which the courts convict perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and other abuses, the
 sentences issued are frequently light or the convictions are overturned on appeal.
 Unlike common criminals, members of the security forces charged with or convicted
 of crimes rarely spend much time in prison.
 Hundreds of prison inmates died as a result of riots, fires, and other harsh condi-
 tions in prison facilities (see Section 1.c.).
 In January members of the Metropolitan Police arrested and handcuffed two
 young men in Guatire, Miranda state, in front of several witnesses. After the men
 were led away, the witnesses heard gunshots and later found one of the men,
 Freddy Rafael Toro Ramirez, dead from bullet wounds. The case was still under in-
 vestigation at year's end.
 There were no new developments in the June 1996 robbery and shooting in a Ca-
 racas bakery in which a policewoman and a suspect were killed. Members of the
 Metropolitan Police captured uninjured two other suspects, whom they handcuffed
 and took away. A few hours later the police delivered the bodies of the two suspects
 to the morgue, dead from bullet wounds. The authorities charged seven policemen
 with killing the suspects, but a judge later released them on the grounds that the
 case as filed was technically deficient.
 In December 1996, a Sucre Municipal Police officer was released from jail after
 charges against him for shooting U.S. citizen Barton Wilder were reduced from in-
 
 
 668
 tentional to negligent homicide. The officer, off duty and drunk, had fired into a
 group of roller-bladers, killing Wilder and injuring another person. Four members
 of the PTJ have been imprisoned for the 1995 execution-style killing of 21-year-old
 Hector Rojas, but they have not been tried.
 In Augst a judg confirmed the charges of intentional homicide against two Na-
 tional (uard members and one prison guard for starting a fire that killed 25 in-
 mates at La Planta prison in October 1996. However, he dropped charges against
 the officer in command, National Guard Captain Osmer Martinez, because of insuf-
 ficient proof that Martinez had authorized use of the tear gas that caused the fire.
 There were no prosecutions or new information surrounding the 1994 discovery
 of a common grave in the Sierra de Perija region of Zulia state, the 1992 killing
 of at least 63 prisoners at Catia prison, or the 1992 killing of reporters Maria Veron-
 ica Tessari and Virgiio Fernandez by members of the security forces.
 Minimal progress was made towards resolving some 300 alleged extrajudicial
 killings by security forces during and after the civil unrest of February-Marc 1989.
 There has been only one prosecution: A police officer was found guilty in 1991 of
 killing 18-year-old Eleazar Ramon Mavares, shot by security force members some
 20 times at close range. The courts released the officer from prison 1 year later. In
 negotiations held with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)
 in 1995, the Government agreed to initiate a new investigation of the Mavares case,
 punish those responsible, and provide indemnities to the victim's family, later deter-
 mined to be $30,000 (15 million bolivars). The IACHR gave Venezuela until April
 1997 to comply with the agreement, and in October it again called on the Govern-
 ment to investigate this case, provide compensation to the victim's family, and bring
 to justice those responsible for the death. By years end, the Government had par-
 tially complied; it had investigated and made a payment, but it had not punished
 any of those responsible. The Committee of Fly Members of Victims of the Un-
 rest (COFAVIC) referred 44 cases surrounding the 1989 killings to the IACHR, as-
 serting that the Government had not ensured justice.
 In September 1996, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights awarded $722,332
 in damages to two survivors and the families of 14 fishermenkilled in 1988 by mili-
 tary and police officers near the berder town of El Amparo, Apure state. The Gov-
 ernment began to make payments in September but by year's end had not finished
 paying the award. The military originally claimed that the deaths were the result
 of military action taken against Colombian guerrillas, but the Government later ac-
 knowledged culpability and agreed to pay indemnities to the survivors and the vic-
 tims' families. In August 1994, a military tribunal overturned the conviction of 16
 defendants in the case despite strong evidence that they had participated in a
 planned ambush.
 Mob lynching of supposed criminals is a-significant problem. The victims are al-
 most always known criminals who prey on residents of poor neighborhoods. Between
 October 1996 and September 1997, PROVEA recorded 12 lynchings and 22 at-
 tempted lynchings. In addition, vigilante groups known as "brigadas" are increasing
 their activity in various parts of the country such as Lara state.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reliable reports of persons who disappeared
 after being detained by the police or the armed forces.
 There were no developments in connection with the 1995 disappearances of Julio
 Rafael Tovar, Fidel Ernesto Croes Aleman, Luis Martin Sanchez Vargas, Juan Dan-
 iel Monsalve, or Jose Ramos; or the 1994 disappearances of Elsida Ines Alvarez,
 Benjamin Vasquez, and Fidel A. Sanabria. All had reportedly been detained by secu-
 rity force members prior to their disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but credible human rights groups report that the security
 forces continue to abuse detainees physically. This abuse most commonly comprises
 beatings during arrest or interrogation, but there have been incidents when the se-
 curity forces used near suffocation and other forms of torture that leave no telltale
 Sgrs. Most victims come from the poorest and least influential parts of society.
 There were also cases of torture of political activists accused of subversion.
 PROVEA documented 45 cases of torture from October 1996 through September
 1997. A large number of cases were never reported because the victims feared ret-
 ribution. According to PROVEA, the DISIP was responsible for 18 of the reported
 torture incidents; the PTJ, 8; the armed forces, 6; the State Police, 4; the Metropoli-
 tan Police, 3; the National Guard, 3; the DIM, 2; and the municipal police, 1. Some
 of these cases were in border areas where constitutional protections were sus-
 pended.
 Torture, like extrajudicial killings, continues because the Government does not
 ensure the independent investigation of complaints needed to bring those respon-
 sible to justice. In addition to lack of vigor by the judiciary, the fact that the Insti-
 
 
 669
 tute of Forensic Medicine is part of the PTJ also contributes to a climate of impu-
 nity, since its doctors are unlikely to be impartial in their examinations of cases
 that involve torture by members of the PTJ. Very few instances of torture have re-
 suited in convictions.
 Some 50 Baruta Municipal Police officers, in search of the killer of a colleague,
 attacked residents of the poor working class Caracas suburb of Petare in the pre-
 dawn hours of December 25. The police shot their weapons wildly, broke into homes,
 and beat, shot at, and threatened with death residents in their path. The operation
 resulted in 43 persons injured, 8 of whom had gunshot wounds. At year's end, the
 incident was being investigated by a criminal court. The chief of the Baruta Munici-
 pal Police also ordered an internal investigation and promised to punish any officers
 guilty of brutality.
 In January two members of the Metropolitan Police in the Federal District alleg-
 edly demanded $10 (5,000 bolivars) from Sergio Bolivar when he entered a bar.
 When Bolivar refused to pay, they hit him in the forehead and right cheek with a
 gun and arrested him for possession of drugs. Bolivar was detained for 17 days.
 In the Colombian border area where constitutional protections have been sus-
 pended, the National Guard and army act with near impunity. The Support Net-
 work for Justice and Peace has documented many human rights abuses in this re-
 gon by amassing detai ed witness testimony. For example, in January at Fort
 Yaruro, Apure state, brothers Leonardo and Luis Pena Rosales were allegedly tor-
 tured by electric current applied between the toes and near suffocation with a plas-
 tic bag.
 There has been no resolution of the border-area cases from 1995, in which mem-
 bers of the military, in separate incidents in reaction to guerrilla attacks, tortured
 23 rural workers near Cararabo and 19 peasant farmers in La Victoria, both in
 Apure state.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh due to underfunding, poorly
 trained and corrupt prison staff and National Guard members, and overcrowding so
 severe as to constitute inhuman and degrading treatment. As of August, the 32 pris-
 on facilities administered by the Ministry of Justice held 25,658 inmates, of whom
 the courts had sentenced only 8,187.
 The prisons contain more than 10,000 prisoners in excess ofcapacity. In letters
 written to the Justice Minister in December, the Prosecutor General called attention
 to excessive use of force by prison guards, inadequate medical care for prisoners,
 and failure to meet the nutritional needs of inmates with the food provided by pris-
 on kitchens. Inmates often have to payguards as well as each other to obtain neces-
 sities such as space in a cell, a bed, and food. Because of its low quality and insuffi-
 cient quantity, only about 30 percent of inmates consume prison food. Guns, knives,
 and ll.egal drugs are easily smuggled into most prisons, and violence among pris-
 oners is very common.
 In August a battle between rival inmate gangs in El Dorado prison in Bolivar
 state left 29 inmates dead and 13 injured. The gangs, one from Bolivar state and
 one from Zulia state, were competing for control of the 381-inmate prison, which
 had only 14 guards and no telephone service. Following this incident, the Justice
 Minister said that "the jails were in the hands of the inmates." In September
 searches of eight prison facilities in the central region of the country yielded 3 tons
 of weapons. In October the former director of Sabaneta prison in Maracaibo was ar-
 rested for demanding a monthly kickback from a prison food supplier.
 In November a fire caused by an electrical short circuit in Sabaneta prison re-
 sulted in the death of 16 inmates and injuries to 32 more. In October and Novem-
 ber, prison riots resulted in multiple deaths and many injuries in Tocoron prison
 in Aragua state, Los Llanos prison in Portuguesa state, and Tocuyito prison in
 Carabob state. In November during one of many riots at La Planta prison in Cara-
 cas, a grenade blast seriously injured 11 inmates.
 PROVEA documented 283 deaths from violence in the prisons from October 1996
 through September 1997. The majority of deaths were perpetrated by other pris-
 oners, but 59 inmates were killed by the authorities-i by a prison guard under the
 Ministry of Justice, and the other 58 by the National Guard. The Minister of Justice
 told the press on December 15 that about 250 prisoners had been killed in prison
 violence during the year. According to the annual report of a congressional commit-
 tee, there were 266 deaths and 1,001 serious injuries from prison violence during
 the year. Hundreds more died as a consequence of poor sanitary conditions, poor
 diet, and inadeate medical care.
 In January the Government transferred all inmates out of Caracas' notorious
 Catia prison and demolished the facility. While two prisons had been expanded in
 December 1996, none of the three new prisons under construction in the states of
 Bolivar, Lara, and Merida were completed by year's end. They are expected to pro-
 
 
 vide space for 5,730 prisoners when opened in 1998. Although the Government re-
 peatedly acknowledged the poor state of the prisons and stated its intention to im-
 prove the situation, funding for prisons remained extremely low, preventing signifi-
 cant improvement in most penitentiaries.
 There were no prosecutions of public officials for the corruption and neglect that
 contributed to the January 1994 riot at Sabaneta prison, in which inmates killed
 105 fellow prisoners and wounded scores of others.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1995 the Government reinstated the
 constitutionally protected freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention in all but 16
 municipalities along the Colombian border where guerrilla activity, drug trafficking,
 kidnaping, and extortion were a continuing problem. However, the security forces
 arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens.
 Following the August kidnaping by Colombian guerrillas of navy Lieutenant Car-
 los Bastardo in Puerto Chorrosquero, the armed forces detained 227 persons, includ-
 ing some minors, for questioning. According to the Paez municipality's Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights, they held many detainees incommunicado for sev-
 eral days.
 Outside the military theaters of operation, especially during anticrime sweeps in
 impoverished sections of major cities, there continued to be arbitrary detentions by
 the Metropolitan Police, the DISIP, the National Guard, and the PTJ. The authori-
 ties detained persons during the sweeps for up to 2 days while they checked crimi-
 nal records; most were released without charges. PROVEA documented 11,452 per-
 sons detained in sweeps from October 1996 through September 1997. The DISIP
 also occasionally detained political radicals who had committed no crimes.
 The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion; however, the police may hold persons without an arrest warrant for up to 8
 days, and the courts may hold them for up to an additional 8 days in court custody.
 In many cases, the police abused detainees physically and psychologically during the
 initial 8-day period and illegally held them incommunicado. During the second 8-
 day period a judge may, on the basis of the police investigation, order either the
 formal arrest or the release of the suspect. Arbitrary arrests are common, and the
 authorities sometimes exceed the time limits for holding suspects. Prison officials
 often illegally demand payment from prisoners for transportation to judicial pro-
 ceedings at which forms charges are made. Those who are unable to pay are often
 forced to fo  their udicial hearings.
 In November the DISIP arbitrarily detained eight Cuban exiles at gunpoint and
 expelled them from Margarita Island, prior to the arrival of Cuban President Fidel
 Castro to attend an Thero-American summit meeting. Information Minister Fer-
 nando Egana later described this "brutal" raid as a "mistake." The police on Mar-
 garita Island also detained and harassed two other anti-Castro activists (also see
 Sections 2.a. and 2.b.).
 On October 14, the Supreme Court ruled the 1939 Vagrancy Law unconstitu-
 tional. The law had permitted the detention for up to 5 years, without warrant,
 trial, or judicial appeal, of people deemed by the police to be a danger to society
 even though there was no evidence that they committed a crime. This law was used
 chiefly against people with previous criminal records who were detained during po-
 lice sweeps, but also against others, including squatters on public and private land.
 Human rights groups welcomed the Court's decision. NGO's asserted that the law
 was often used subjectively by the security forces and state authorities to settle per-
 sonal scores, and that it was also used to target secific  ups, including the poor,
 prostitutes, and homosexuals. When the Courts rulig too effect in November upon
 formal publication, over 500 prisoners were released throughout the country.
 Forced exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 judges are subject to influence from a number of sources.
 The judicial sector consists of the Supreme Court, which is the court of final ap-
 peal; the prosecutor general, who provides opinions to the courts on prosecution of
 criminal cases and acts as public ombudsman to bring public employee misconduct
 or violations of the constitutional rights of prisoners or accused persons to the atten-
 tion of the proper authorities; the Ministry of Justice, which manages the national
 police force and prisons and files complaints in criminal courts; and the Judicial
 Council, which oversees the lower courts as well as the selection and training of
 judges. The lower court system includes district and municipal courts as well as
 trial and appeal courts that deal with civil and criminal matters.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and considers the accused innocent
 until proven guilty in a court. However, the presumption of innocence is ineffective
 in the justice system, which is overburdened and inefficient, suffers from widespread
 
 
 671
 corruption, and lacks public credibility. Judges are underpaid, poorly disciplined,
 and susceptible to political influence. The judicial process is paper intensive, requir-
 ing the costly and time-consuming production of voluminous reports at every stage
 by judges, attorneys, and witnesses. Case backlogs and lengthy pretrial detention
 averaging 4  years are the norm.
 On December 10, Congress passed a new Code of Criminal Procedure that will
 introduce for the first time open, public trials with oral proceedings and participa-
 tion by juries. The new adversarial system of justice, which eliminates a secret stage
 in the trial known as "secreto sumarial," is expected to give practical effect to the
 presumption of innocence. The code is to take full effect in July 1999.
 The law provides for public defenders for those unable to afford an attorney, but
 there are not enough public defenders to handle the caseload. The Judicial Council
 reported that there are 159 public defense attorneys for the entire country.
 Military courts can try civilians in cases of armed subversion and whenever
 armed forces members are involved. Military courts are subject to a requirement for
 a speedy trial and a statute of limitations similar to that of civilian courts. Persons
 convicted by a military court have the same right of appeal to the Supreme Court
 as do those convicted by the civilian system. Military courts, however, are signifi-
 cantly different from civilian courts in that by law the President must review every
 case after the initial investigation stage and decide if that case will go to trial. In
 addition, the Supreme Court selects military judges from a list of candidates ro-
 vided by the Minister of Defense, a process that links the careers of military judges
 to the high command. The tendency of military judges to be responsive to the views
 of their military leaders, to maintain procedural secrecy, and to act slowly in high-
 profile cases in which the military is implicated make impartial or timely trials for
 defendants unlikely. As a result, military offenders evade punishment for
 extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. However, from June 1994 to July 1995, the Government suspended
 the constitutional protection of freedom from search without a warrant, along with
 other freedoms. This suspension remained in effect in some border areas throughout
 1997. Even after reinstatement of the provision in urban areas, security forces often
 conducted searches of homes without warrants, especially during anticrime sweeps
 in impoverished neighborhoods. In recent years, there have been some complaints,
 especially by human rights monitors, of illegal wiretapping by the security forces.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Individuals criticize the Government publicly; however, there were a few instances
 of reprisal. The DISIP searched the office of newspaper columnist Alfredo Pena, and
 the DIM allegedly harassed television reporter Jose ]omingo Blanco. In August the
 military detained two newspaper reporters covering the Bastado kidnaping (see
 Section 1.d.) and allegedly confiscated their work.
 In November DISI agents confiscated the informational material prepared by
 ei.ht detained Cuban exiles who planned to distribute it at the Tbero-American sum-
 zmt conference. The material was not returned. Interior Minister Jose Guillermo
 Andueza later promised that they would be allowed to express their views, and they
 held a press conference without government interference.
 The charge of criminal defamation was sometimes used against the media to limit
 coverage of sensitive issues. In June after serving 5 months of a 1-year sentence for
 criminal defamation, William Ojeda, the author of the book "How much does a judge
 cost?" (Cuanto vale un juez?), a compilation of accusations of judicial corruption, was
 freed by a presidential pardon. In July a criminal judge issued a restraining order
 against the newspaper Reporte Diario de la Economia to stop the publication of any
 information concerning the bank Banesco and its president. The order was in reac-
 tion to a defamation case brought by the bank president against the newspaper, but
 preceded any hearing on the merits. In July a judge in Guarenas, Miranda state,
 ordered t   he s    a he the hoffte Caracas newspaper El  Mundo, Luis Oscar
 Pont, and of one of its editors, Miguel Arcangel, because a PTJ official had accused
 them of criminal defamation. Pont was not detained, but Arangel spent 6 days in
 prison and was released oaly on condition that he not comment on the case. Neither
 a   en tried by year's end.
 The print and electronic media are independent. However, a 1994 law forbids per-
 sons without journalism degrees to practice the profession and requires journalists
 to be members of the National College of Journalists. Media owners, acting as the
 
 
 672
 Venezuelan Press Bloc, brought a case to the Supreme Court in November 1995
 challenging the law as a violation of the freedom of expression provided for in the
 Constitution and international agreements on human rights that have the force of
 law. The Court had not ruled by year's end.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government generally re-
 spects the constitutional provision for freedom of peaceful assembly. Public meet-
 ings, including those of all political parties, are generally held unimpeded. The Gov-
 ernment requires permits for public marches but does not deny them for political
 reasons.
 As in earlier years, some demonstrations turned violent and were quelled by secu-
 rity forces. In February about 70 hooded youths threw rocks at police after the Fed-
 eral District governor turned down a request by striking university professors to
 march from the campus of the Central University of Venezuela to the Education
 Ministry. The police responded with birdshot, water cannons, and tear gas. The po-
 lice responded in a similar fashion during an authorized march through downtown
 Caracas later in the month when some demonstrators veered off the approved route,
 approached the Capitol, and confronted police. According to PROVEA, 58 people
 were injured during demonstrations and 151 detained from October 1996 through
 September 1997.
 On November 3, armed DISIP agents detained eight Cuban exiles who had
 planned a peaceful protest against Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Ibero-Amer-
 ican summit conference on Margarita Island. The authorities expelled the eight per-
 sons from the island and confiscated their written material. President Caldera and
 other government officials apologized for the actions of the security forces. Interior
 Minister Andueza promised that they would be allowed to express their views, and
 four members of the group returned to the island. The police also detained and har-
 assed two members of another anti-Castro group on Margarita Island.
 The Government respects the constitutional provision for freedom of association.
 Professional and academic associations operate without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, pro-
 vided that a faith does not threaten public order or violate good custom. The au-
 thorities generally respect this right in practice.
 Tn September the Governm       enied legal status to the Unification Church of
 Venezuela because it had sponsored the travel to Venezuela of more than 100 young
 Japanese women who entered the country without proper visas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens and legal residents
 to travel within the country and to go abroad and return. The Government, how-
 ever, can suspend the freedom to travel, as it did from June 1994 to July 1995. The
 Government also restricts foreign travel for persons being investigated for criminal
 activities.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles, and displaced per-
 sons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American countries. The Govern-
 ment cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum and provided it to approximately 20 persons in 1997.
 There     e no reports of frced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections
 eld on the basis of universal suffrage. An antiquated and inefficient system for
 counting votes, however, gives rise to numerous and, in some cases, credible allega-
 tions that the political parties that dominate electoral councils commit fraud.
 In December Congress passed a new election law that contains three major re-
 forms: Removal of politicai party representatives from all electoral organs, mecha-
 nization of the voting process, and prohibition of campaign financing by anonymous
 sources. Most legislators from all levels of government will continue to be elected
 from party lists (which, under the new law, are supposed to have at least 30 percent
 women). The top election officials, although not party members, will continue to be
 selected by negotiation among the political parties in Congress.
 Women and nonwhites participate fully in government and podtics but remain
 underrepresented in senior leadership positions. A bicameral onessional Coin-
 mittee aor Women's Rights focused on promoting poitical office-holding opportuni-
 
 
 673
 ties for women. Women hold 13 seats as Deputies in the 209-member lower house
 of Congress, 4 seats in the 52-person Senate, and 2 of 27 ministerial positions.
 Indigenous people traditionally have not been fully integrated into the political
 system due to their limited knowledge of politics, low voter turnout, geographic iso-
 lation, and lesser economic and educational opportunities. Few indigenous people
 are in the Government, and only one is in Congress as an alternate deputy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups generally operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Both
 international and local human rights organizations were provided ready access to
 the prison system. However, government officials were critical of some human rights
 groups, accusing them of seeking to discredit the State and undermine the country's
 image.
 Amaxonas state deputies and political party leaders criticized the human rights
 office of the Apostolic Vicariate of Puerto Ayacucho, which defends the rights of the
 indigenous communities, for waging a successful court challenge to the state politi-
 cal boundary law. Vandals damaged Vicariate property in what the office believes
 was an intimidation campaign by anti-indigenous elements in the state. When a
 lawyer in the Vicariate's office asked the state police commandant to investigate an
 alleged extrajudicial killing, the local prosecutor fwied a criminal charge of "usurpa-
 tion of functions" against the office and the lawyer. in June, more than 6 months
 after the naing, the Superior Court of Puerto Ayacucho dismissed the usurpation
 eeIn July the Government held its irst formal meeting with NGO's to begin to for-
 mulate a national human rights agenda. The Interior, Justice, and Family Ministers
 took an active part in the discussion of some 40 proposals dealing with preventive
 detention, prison conditions, and other human rights problems. The Interor Min-
 ister announced the creation of a National Police Committee to monitor police con-
 duct, receive complaints, and ensure implementation of disciplinary measures. In
 September the Minister of Defense created a human rights office to promote respect
 for human rights in the armed forces.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin se, mor disability. The
 Government, however, does not adequately safeguard the rights of indigenous peo-
 ple, protect women against societal and domestic violence, and ensure disabled peo-
 ple access to jobs and public services. Very few resources are devoted to children's
 welfare; young delinquents are locked in institutions that are unsafe.
 Women.-Womn     ace substantial institutional and societal prejudice with respect
 to rape and domestic violence. The law makes rape extremely difficult to prove, re-
 quirng at a minimum medical examination within 48 hours of the vItion. A pro-
 vision in the Penal Code provides that anyone guilty of rape will not be ounished
 if, before sentencing, he marries the victim. Few police officers are trained to deal
 responsibly with rape victims. A total of 7,561 sexual assaults, including rape, were
 reported to the authorities in 1996. Women's organizations, however, assert that
 such figures are very low and do not accurately portray the problem of rape and
 sexual assault. They claim that many victims do not report the incident or press
 charges due to societal pressure and their own feelings of guilt.
 Domestic violence against women is very common and has been aggravated by the
 country's economic difficulties According to local monitors, the police are generally
 unwilling to intervene to prevent domestic violence, and the courts rarely prosecute
 those accused of such abuse. In addition, poor women are generally unaware of legal
 remedies and have little access to them.
 Women and men are legally equal in marriage. Women account for roughiy half
 the student body of most universities, have advanced in many professions, including
 medicine and law, and have gradually surmounted many of the barriers to their full
 participation in political and economic life. Nonetheless, women are still underrep-
 resented in the higher ranks of labor unions and private industry.
 The Labor Code specifies that employers must not discriminate against women
 with regard to pay or working conditions, must not fire them during pregnancy and
 for a year afer giving birth, must grant them unpaid leave and beneits or 6 weeks
 before the birth ofc aind 12 weeks after, and must provide them with 10 weeks
 of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3 years of age. According to the
 Ministry of Labor and the major labor federation, these regulations are enforced in
 the formal sector, although social security payments are often delayed.

 The National Women's Council, an agency of the Presidency with representation
 from the Ministries of Justice, Education, Family, Health, and Labor, in 1996 pre-
 pared a manual on violence against women and children, which includes informa-
 tion on where the victims might obtain assistance. There are a number of NGO's
 concerned with domestic violence, sex education, and economic discrimination. The
 recommendations of these groups, however, have not been widely implemented by
 the police and other concerned governmental agencies.
 Children.-The Government scaled back its expenditure on education, health, and
 social services. While the law provides for universal free education, primary and sec-
 ondary education is chronically underfunded. Basic education fell from 20 percent
 of the Ministry of Education budget in 1989 to 7.5 percent in 1994. Fully a third
 of the budget durig that period was dedicated to post-secondary education. In addi-
 tion, a large number of children are not eligible to receive government assistance,
 including public education, because their birth is not properly documented.
 According to a study by two reputable NGO's, one in four children is malnour-
 ished. The incidence of diarrhea-related and respiratory illnesses, caused in part by
 poor sanitation and chronic malnutrition, has increased slightly over the last dec-
 ade. Such preventable diseases are leading causes of infant mortality.
 An increase in poverty has raised the level of stress within families and led to
 a rise in the number of abandoned children and to more child abuse. A survey by
 the National Institute for Minors determined that 206,000 children were involved
 in illicit activities, princi all begging but also petty theft, prostitution, and drug
 trafficking. Some 40,000 children were exploited sexually, according to a 1994 study.
 There were also reports of trafficking in children from other South American coun-
 tries to work in Caracas as street vendors and housemaids.
 The authorities in Caracas and several other jurisdictions tried to cope with the
 phenomenon of street children by imposing curfews for unsupervised minors. Chil-
 dren's rights advocates claim that curfews permit the police to act arbitrarily in de-
 taining persons who have committed no crime. Because reform institutions are filled
 to capacity, hundreds of children accused of infractions are confined in jails where
 they are crowded into small, filthy cells, fed only once a day, and sleep on bare con-
 crete floors.
 Amnesty International reported deficiencies in law and practice with regard to the
 detention of children. In particular, the 1980 Minors' Protection Act requires them
 to be brought before a judge with 8 days of detention, but this may be extended to
 3 months. In addition, security forces and law enforcement authorities often detain
 children together with adults.
 Reports of child abuse are rare due to a fear of entanglement with the authorities
 and ingrained attitudes regarding family privacy. The overburdened judicial system,
 although very slow, generally ensures that in most situations children are removed
 from abusive households once a case has been reported. Public facilities for such
 children, however, are inadequate and have poorly trained staff.
 People With Disabilities.-The physically disabled have minimal access to public
 transportation, and ramps are practically nonexistent, even in government build-
 ings. According to local advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many
 sectors, including education, health care, and employment.
 In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive law to protect the rights
 of the disabled. That law requires that all newly constructed or renovated pullic
 parks and buildings provide access for the disabled. Among other important provi-
 sions the law forbids discrimination in employment practices and in the provision
 of public services. However, the Government did not make a significant effort to im-
 plement the new law, to inform the public of it, or to try to change societal prejudice
 against the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Although the law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or-
 igin, members of the country's indigenous population frequently suffer from inatten-
 tion to and violation of their human rights. Many indigenous people live isolated
 from modern civilization and lack access to basic health and educational facilities.
 High rates of cholera, hepatitis-B, malaria, and other diseases plague their commu-
 nities. There are about 316,000 indigenous people comprising 28 ethnic groups, ac-
 cording to a special 1992 census.
 The Constitution provides for special laws governing "the protection of indigenous
 communities and their progressive incorporation into the life of the nation." None-
 theless, local political authorities seldom take account of the interests of indigenous
 people when making decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and alloca-
 tion of natural resources. As farmers and miners intrude on their habitat, indige-
 nous communities are threatened by deforestation and water pollution. Few indige-
 nous people hold title to their land.
 
 
 In May the President issued a decree permitting expansion of legal mining activi-
 ties in the 3.6 million hectare Imataca Forest Reserve, located in an area plagued
 by illegal mining and land invasion. Environmental and indigenous organizations
 filed suit challenging the decree in the Supreme Court on the grounds that only
 Congress can change the nature of the reserve, that there was an inadequate public
 review process prior to the change, and that expanded mining activities would ad-
 versely affect the health of the Warao, Arawako, Karina, Akawao, and Pemon in-
 digenous communities that inhabit the Imataca watershed area. Supporters of the
 decree contend that regulated mining would provide significant export and tax reve-
 nue while reducing the environmental damage and abuse of indigenous residents
 caused by illegal mining. In November the Supreme Court ordered the Government
 not to issue any new mining concessions in the Imataca reserve until the Court
 ruled on the constitutionality of the presidential decree.
 In July a judge in Puerto Ayacucho ruled that some 80 to 200 nonindigenous fam-
 flies farming in an area traditionally inhabited by the Piaroa and Guajibo indige-
 nous groups in Amazonas state must cease all agricultural activity pending an envi-
 ronmental ipact assessment. According to human rights activists, many farmers
 did not comply with the order.
 The Yanomami, among the most isolated of the indigenous people, have been sub-
 ject to persistent incursions into their territory by illegal gold miners. The miners
 have not only introduced new diseases but social ills as well. In December 1996, a
 number of human rights organizations, acting on behalf of the Yanomami commu-
 nity of Haximu, petitioned the IACHR in connection with the 1993 massacre of 16
 members of the community by Brazilian miners. The petition alleges that the Gov-
 ernment failed in its obligation to protect the Yanomami and to seek appropriate
 punishment of the killers, who were released by the Brazilian authorities after 3
 months' detention. The last major operation to dislodge illegal miners was conducted
 in August and September 1996; about 80 miners were arrested, but several hundred
 more were believed to be still operating.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of unions to organize. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code ex-
 tends to all private sector and public sector employees (except members of the
 armed forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code man-
 dates registration of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but it reduces the Ministry's
 discretion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper documents
 (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the membership list) are sub-
 mitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then only for reasons listed in the
 law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the member-
 ne major union onfederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 and three small ones, as well as a number of independent unions, operate freely.
 About 2.5 percent of the national labor force is unionized. The CTVs top leadership
 includes members of several political parties. The majority are affiliated with the
 country's largest party, Democratic Action (AD). The CTV and the AD exercise re-
 ciprocal influence on each other.
 The law recognizes the right of public and private sector employees to strike.
 However, public servants may exercise it only if it does not cause "irremediable
 damage to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President
 to order public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute
 to arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or
 part of the population." During 1997 most strikes occurred among government em-
 ployees such as university professors, teachers, judicial workers, telephone workers,
 and physicians in public hospitals and clinics, who began their month-long strike
 in December 1996. In addition, there was a nationwide work stoppage by both pub-
 lic and private sector workers on August 6 to protest a gasoline price increase and
 delays in expected private sector salary increases.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 many union organizations are active internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects and
 encourages collective bargaining, which is freely practiced. According to the code,
 employers must negotiate a collective contract with the union that represents the
 majority of their workers. The code also contains a provision stating that wages may
 be ralsed by administrative decree, provided that the Congress approves the decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interferingwith the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Ministry of Labor
 
 
 676
 inspectors hear complaints regarding violations of these regulations, and can impose
 a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first infraction. Under
 the code, union officials enjoy special protection from dismissal. If a judge deter-
 mines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled to back
 pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which var-
 ies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code states that no one
 may "obligate others to work against their will." However, there were credible re-
 Iorts of prison labor being admnistratively imposed on persons detained under the
 vagrancy Law. Apart from the general prohibition of compulsory labor, the law does
 not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are
 not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code and the Tutelary Law for Minors contain provisions to protect children
 from exploitation in the workplace. Apart from the general prohibition of compulsory
 labor, the law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but
 such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 The Ministry of Labor and the National Institute for Minors enforce child labor
 policies effectively in the formal sector of the economy but much less so in the infor-
 mal sector, which accounts for the vast majority of child laborers. A plan formulated
 by the National Institute for Minors in 1996 to reach and better protect children
 working in the informal sector was not implemented because of a lack of funding.
 Primary school education is compulsory, free, and universal. However, 64 percent
 of children leave school before the ninth grade. In a 1996 survey of working cldren
 conducted by the National Institute for Minors, 45 percent of those polled said they
 were not in school. The actual figure is probably much higher considering that those
 who said they attended school also reported that they worked on average 71/2 hours
 a day 4 to 7 days a week.
 The Labor Code allows children between the ages of 12 and 14 years to work only
 if the National Institute for Minors or the Labor Ministry grants special permission.
 It states that children between the ages of 14 and 16 years may not work without
 permission from their legal guardians. Minors may not work in mines or smelters,
 in occupations that risk life or health, that could damage intellectual or moral devel-
 opment, or in public spectacles.
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under the age of 18-years may work only during the hours
 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The estimated 1.2 million children who work in the infor-
 mal sector, mostly as street vendors, generally work more hours than the total per-
 mitted under the law. In the National Institute for Minors 1996 survey of working
 children, half the children worked both morning and afternoon, and 64.5 percent
 worked 6 or 7 days a week.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly minimum wage was $149 (74,640
 bolivars) in the private sector for urban workers and $136 (67,940 bolivars) for rural
 workers effective in May. Total take-home pay in the public sector, the product of
 collective bargaining, was at least equal to that received by private sector minimum
 wage workers. Fringe benefits are added to these minimum figures; they vary with
 the workers' individual circumstances, but in general increase wages by about one-
 third. However, even with these benefits, the minimum wage is not sufficient to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Unions point out that a
 worker's income is often less than the cost of a family's basic food basket, estimated
 by the Government at year's end at $192 (95,938 bolivars). The law excludes only
 domestic workers and concierges from coverage under the minimum wage decrees.
 Under the Labor Code, the rates are set by administrative decree, which Con  ss
 may either suspend or ratify but may not change. The Ministry of Labor enforces
 minimum wage rates effectively in the formal sector of the economy but generally
 does not enforce them in the informal sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours,
 and requires 2 "complete days of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petro-
 leum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less
 than time and a half. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces these standards in
 the formal sector.
 The authorities have yet to promulgate regulations to implement the 1986 Health
 and Safety Law, which is not enforced. The delay is due largely to concern that the
 law provides penal sanctions against management when violations of health and
 safety occur and to ambiguity in the law over what constitutes a violation. The
 
 
 677
 Labor Code states that employers are obligated to pay specified amounts (up to a
 maximum of 25 times the minimum monthly salary) to workers for accidents or oc-
 cupational illnesses, regardless of who is responsible for the injury.
 It also requires that workplaces maintain "sufficient protection for health and life
 against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes fines of from one-quarter to twice
 the minimum monthly salary for first infractions. In practice, however, unsafe job
 sites are seldom closed down by Ministry of Labor inspectors. Under the law, work-
 ers can remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
