 KUWAIT
 Kuwait's amirs, drawn from the Al-Sabah family, have
 traditionally governed in consultation with several
 commercially powerful families and other community leaders.
 The 1962 Constitution contains detailed provisions on the
 powers and relationships of the branches of government and on
 the rights of citizens. Kuwait's National Assembly has
 institutionalized a degree of consultation with the ruling
 family and served as an outlet for popular expression,
 including criticism of the Government. However, in July 1986
 the Amir decreed the National Assembly's dissolution, citing
 the breakdown in cooperation between the executive and
 legislative branches at a time when the nation faced serious
 economic and security problems. The Amir also decreed the
 suspension of constitutional provisions mandating the
 Assembly's restoration within a 2-month period. It remains
 unclear when the Assembly might be reconvened.
 Kuwaitis are a 40 percent minority in their own country,
 outnumbered by expatriate workers and the large resident
 Palestinian community. Kuwaiti citizens are 60-65 percent
 Sunni Muslim; the remainder are Shi'ite Muslim and a tiny
 minority of Christians. Although the members of Kuwait's
 Shi'a minority perceive themselves to be largely excluded from
 leadership positions in the Government, many have achieved
 great wealth, and there is no evidence of discrimination
 against Kuwaiti Shi'as in the administration of the
 Government's impressive social welfare programs. The Iranian
 revolution has made Kuwait's leadership more aware of the
 potential for Shi'a subversion. Meanwhile, the majority Sunni
 community has experienced an upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism
 which frequently conflicts with attitudes of the traditionally
 moderate members of the merchant class. Kuwait has over
 300,000 long-term Palestinian residents, many in their second
 generation. Non-Kuwaitis are given due process under the law
 but have few other civil and political rights.
 With its large oil reserves, Kuwait enjoys a high standard of
 living. Its per capita gross national product was estimated
 by the World Bank to have reached $17,880 in 1983.
 In addition to dissolving the National Assembly, the Amir's
 July decrees imposed a system of prior censorship on the
 Kuwaiti press. The Amir's action added to existing
 restrictions on the political and civil rights of all Kuwaiti
 residents, women and expatriates in particular. However, the
 Government rarely violates the integrity of the individual.
 Kuwait's security apparatus is used primarily to maintain
 internal order. It does not engage in political repression.
 Measures adopted by the Government to combat terrorism and the
 increased political turbulence in the region have resulted in
 increased restrictions. While 1986 witnessed fewer terrorist
 incidents than the previous year, Kuwait's security
 organizations continued to have an expanded role, particularly
 with regard to the noncitizen community. In recent years,
 security measures have been strengthened, as have legal
 restrictions on public gatherings and the dissemination of
 "subversive" literature. Increased attention to law and order
 is also viewed by some Kuwaitis as a means to protect their
 society against the threat they perceive to Kuwaiti moral and
 social values from the large foreign population. Internal
 socioeconomic changes brought on by sudden oil-related wealth,
 coupled in recent years with violent revolution in Iran and
 the Iran-Iraq war, have also led to a growing demand by
 
 
 1206
 KUWAIT
 well-organized groups for stricter controls over public
 morality and political expression. A resurgent Islamic
 fundamentalist movement advocates adoption of a more stringent
 legal code based on Islamic Shari'a law.
 Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt in 1985 against
 the Amir, over 15,000 non-Kuwaitis were deported in that year,
 and approximately 27,000 were deported in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1986, in
 contrast to the previous year when assassination attempts and
 terrorist bombings claimed the lives of 16 persons.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Local security forces, without authorization, occasionally use
 physical violence when interrogating persons suspected of
 committing criminal acts. These incidents do not appear to be
 widespread or condoned. Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to
 receive rough treatment than are Kuwaitis, and the seriousness
 of the suspected crime also appears to play a role. Evidence
 of mistreatment during interrogation is a defense in Kuwait's
 courts and has led to the release of a number of suspects.
 The courts often hold police officers to account for abuses.
 In February, the press reported that a policeman had been fined
 for beating a suspect under interrogation. In its 1986 Report,
 Amnesty International expressed concern about reports of
 torture, in some cases leading to death, of detainees by
 security forces. It also criticized the reported statement by
 a member of the Government defending the practice of "falaqa"
 (beatings on the soles of the feet) for security reasons.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines, with
 facilities for inmates' recreation and vocational training.
 By and large, prison guards treat inmates humanely, and the
 Government provides food and other necessities. Young
 offenders, few of whom are imprisoned, are separated from
 persons charged or convicted of serious crimes. There is no
 policy of discriminatory treatment among prisoners for racial
 or religious reasons.
 Kuwait's legal process is based in part on Islamic law, but
 punishments such as mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 The Government has rejected calls by Muslim fundamentalist
 elements for the full implementation of Islamic law and, by
 extension, its harsh punishments.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. In 1986 there were no reports of persons being
 detained for political reasons. The Penal Code affirms the
 right of accused persons to due process and stipulates that
 
 
 1207
 KUWAIT
 detainees cannot be held for more than 4 days without charge,
 A prosecutor's approval is required for detention periods
 beyond 24 hours. Thereafter, the suspect must either be
 released or charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize
 detention for up to an additional 21 days. Further detention
 pending trial may be authorized by a judge. Warrants are
 required unless a person is apprehended in the act of
 committing an offense. These legal safeguards are generally
 observed, with arrests being made openly and for specific
 violations of law. Reports of incommunicado detention are
 rare. Road blocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings of
 expatriates, especially of South Asians, are used sporadically
 by the police during searches for illegal immigrants and
 contraband liquor. Persons without proper identification may
 be detained by the police under the procedures described above.
 In 1985, when a number of Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis were
 detained following the terrorist attack on the Amir's
 motorcade and the cafe bombings, there were some credible
 reports of arbitrary detention. The Government subsequently
 stated that such abuses would be halted; in 1986 there was
 evidence of one possible abuse. In January a Kuwaiti army
 officer and two expatriate residents were arrested for
 distributing pamphlets critical of the Government. Reliable
 sources indicated that the detainees were held in solitary
 confinement and held incommunicado for a month. The three
 were tried in March; the two expatriates were acquitted, while
 the military officer received a prison sentence.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a noncitizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled if the authorities deem him a troublemaker.
 The number of expatriates deported in 1986 increased to
 approximately 27,000 as part of a sustained security crackdown
 in response to the attack on the Amir in May 1985. As in
 previous years, the vast majority of deportees were expelled
 because they had arrived in Kuwait illegally or because their
 residence permits had expired.
 There is no forced labor in Kuwait.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and, except for the
 State Security Court, provides for public trials and the right
 of appeal. Judges are appointed by the Amir at the
 recommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals
 serving as judges usually receive lifetime appointments, while
 the many non-Kuwaiti judges serve under 1- to 3-year contracts,
 which are renewable. Judges may be removed by the Justice
 Ministry for cause, but such removal is reportedly rare.
 All defendants are represented by attorneys--court-appointed,
 if necessary. The courts give consideration to defendants'
 allegations of police mistreatment in reaching verdicts and
 sentencing. Defendants tried in absentia have the right to
 an additional appeal. There are no reports of government
 interference in judges' issuance of verdicts or of
 discrimination against defense counsel. However, the
 court-appointed attorney of a defendant unable to engage his
 own lawyer is not always given adequate time to prepare a
 defense. Interpretation of court proceedings to ensure their
 understanding by non-Arabic speaking defendants is sometimes
 inadequate.
 
 
 1208
 KUWAIT
 Defendants' rights are not always fully respected in the State
 Security Court, which convenes on an ad hoc basis to handle
 cases deemed of an internal security nature. Composed of
 judges normally serving in other courts, this tribunal conducts
 its proceedings in closed sessions; its judgments are not
 subject to appeal. Defendants are permitted to have an
 attorney.
 In October the Court began hearing the trial of those charged
 in the 1985 attack on the Amir and in November it condemned to
 death the sole defendant in custody charged with responsibility
 for the attack. Of four others tried in their absence, one
 received a life sentence and three were acquitted. The trial
 followed a lengthy investigation. The Amir must approve the
 death sentence.
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the fairness of trials of possible prisoners of
 conscience before the State Security Court. The report cited
 the November 1985 case of Kamil Husayn 'Ali Dashti, who was
 sentenced to 5 years in prison for having written a leaflet
 calling for the overthrow of the Government.
 According to the Constitution, military courts have
 jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the
 armed or security forces, except during periods of martial law
 (which has never been declared in Kuwait). However, it was
 the State Security Court, not a military tribunal, that tried
 the military officer in March for distributing antigovernment
 pamphlets.
 The Amir has the power to pardon or commute sentences passed
 by either civilian or military courts and does so through the
 publication of an annual list of commutations following major
 religious holidays.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in
 practice. Warrants are required to search, unless the police
 are in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime
 or there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or
 illegal narcotics. Search warrants to enter premises are
 issued by a public prosecutor. Expatriates, and particularly
 common laborers and servants who live in accommodations
 provided by their employers, may have their premises searched
 by the police with authorization only of the employer.
 In June 1986, the Government restricted Kuwaiti males' right
 to marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval in
 advance would henceforth be required. The Government's action
 was apparently motivated by concern over how to meet its
 responsibilities toward the children of non-Kuwaiti spouses
 residing outside the country. The Government, and the public
 at large, were also concerned about the growing number of
 Kuwaiti males opting to wed foreigners rather than Kuwaiti
 nationals.
 
 
 1209
 KUWAIT
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees of this freedom are often subject to
 such conditional phrases as "in accordance with conditions and
 manner specified by law." The Kuwaiti or foreign resident
 feels free to offer his opinion in private without fear of
 official retaliation. However, no one may make a written or
 public attack upon the Amir and the ruling family, upon Islam,
 or upon leaders of Arab states. Kuwait has an active
 censorship department, which reviews all books, films,
 videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in
 bulk or for commercial purposes. Items arriving by post for
 individual or institutional use are usually not opened before
 delivery unless the contents are suspected of being
 pornographic. Radio and television are government owned and
 controlled.
 In July the Amir issued decrees that amended the press law to
 impose a system of prior censorship on the Kuwaiti press and
 authorize the Government to suspend for up to 2 years any
 publication found to be serving foreign states or
 organizations, receiving assistance from foreign sources
 without the approval of the Information Ministry, or
 publishing material conflicting with Kuwait's national
 interests. The new censorship regulations also toughened
 existing penalties for violators, prescribing prison sentences
 of up to 3 years and fines up to $17,000, or both, for
 offending publishers, editors, and journalists.
 As before, the press was forbidden from publishing material
 that contained direct criticism of the Amir and the ruling
 family, involved official confidential communications or
 treaties and agreements with other states, might disturb
 relations with Arab and friendly states, or, in a final
 category, "might incite people to commit crimes, create
 hatred, or spread dissension among the people." Prior to the
 July decrees there was selective enforcement of the list of
 proscribed topics; violators were usually only issued
 warnings. Since July, however, government censors have
 reviewed press items before their publication and ensured
 compliance by excising offending material.
 There were no reports in 1986, either before or after the July
 decrees, of newspapermen being arrested or journals being
 confiscated or suspended. During the year, however, several
 foreign journalists residing in Kuwait and associated with
 local newspapers were summarily deported. However, these
 journalists' work, apparently sent from abroad, has continued
 to appear in the local press, at least occasionally. Since
 July, the leftist-oriented weekly Al-Talia'a has failed to
 appear on newstands, reportedly in protest over the new
 censorship regulations. By law, publishers lose their
 license, issued by the Information Ministry, if their
 publication does not appear for 6 months. On occasion, the
 Government has rejected applications for licenses to publish
 new daily papers, claiming that Kuwait's seven existing
 dailies (five in Arabic, two in English) are sufficient to
 present diverse viewpoints. In 1986 the Government used this
 justification to refuse an application by the Sunni Muslim
 fundamentalist organization, The Social Reform Society, to
 publish a daily paper. At present, the organization issues a
 weekly journal, Al-Mujtamah. Also in 1986, the National
 Assembly passed a bill permitting professional societies to
 
 
 1210
 KUWAIT
 publish their own periodicals, regardless of whether they were
 officially sanctioned. The Government refused to ratify the
 law, again claiming that Kuwait's existing publications were
 adequate. Some observers, though, believed that the
 Government's rejection of The Social Reform Society's license
 application and the National Assembly measure stemmed
 primarily from a desire to prevent any new "political"
 journals from appearing.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned. Political activity finds some
 outlet in informal social gatherings known as "diwaniyyas."
 The Constitution protects the right to private assembly,
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings which are
 peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three persons desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately but to issue a public
 statement) must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by ignoring the request. During 1986 there were no mass
 gatherings of a political nature, but there was one confirmed
 case of the authorities preventing an unauthorized public
 meeting. Following the U.S. strike against Libya in April,
 Hassan Al-Farrag, head of the Kuwaiti Trade Union Federation
 at the time, tried to convene a public meeting to protest the
 U.S. action but was prevented from doing so by security
 officials..
 Kuwaiti citizens are free to establish and join trade unions.
 However, only government employees and the petroleum, banking,
 and airline sectors are unionized; the majority of union
 members are civil servants. Unions may draw up their own
 constitutions, formulate their own programs, and join
 international confederations. Many union activities are
 funded by the Government and are subject to official
 approval. The Government's ban of the public meeting called
 by trade union leader Al-Farrag indicates that the authorities
 also monitor labor movement activities. Workers have the
 right to bargain collectively. The right to strike
 is recognized. In 1986 there was one reported strike, by oil
 workers seeking higher wages. Kuwaiti labor law has a
 provision allowing for compulsory dissolution of any union
 that "commits an act considered to be violating the provisions
 of this law and of the laws connected with the preservation of
 public order and morals." Expatriate workers, who comprise
 the majority of the labor force, are permitted to join unions
 after 5 years' residence. Non-Kuwaitis are considered
 "associate members" of unions and are not permitted to vote,
 hold office, or create new unions. Since each union must be
 formed by and have several Kuwaiti members, expatriate
 unskilled workers have no union representation.
 Professional groups, bar associations, scientific bodies, and
 labor unions are permitted to establish international contacts
 without government interference. The Kuwait Federation of
 Trade Unions, grouping government and petroleum workers, is a
 member of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions
 and the World Federation of Trade Unions. Kuwait is an active
 tripartite member of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO).
 
 
 1211
 KUWAIT
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is absolute"
 but must not "conflict with public policy or morals."
 Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Shari'a (Islamic law)
 is, according to the Constitution, "a main source of
 legislation." The ruling family and most prominent Kuwaiti
 families are Sunni Muslims. There is no official policy of
 discrimination against Shi'a Muslims, who constitute about
 one-third of Kuwait's citizenry, but they and members of
 Kuwait's tiny Arab Christian minority are seldom appointed to
 sensitive government positions. There are a number of
 expatriate Christian congregations and churches. In recent
 years the Government has banned Christmas parties and dancing
 in the country's hotels and restaurants. Pressure from
 fundamentalist Islamic groups is the unstated reason for the
 restriction. Expatriate practitioners of Eastern religions,
 e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, are not allowed to
 establish places of worship but may worship privately in their
 homes. Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 In recent years, the National Assembly has barred the future
 granting of citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibited all
 importation of alcoholic beverages, and repeatedly attempted
 to establish Islamic law as the basis for all legal process.
 Assembly members also pressured, with some success, those
 campuses of Kuwait University which were sexually integrated
 to separate the sexes in the classrooms and other facilities,
 such as cafeterias. The Government accommodated the National
 Assembly's demands for the application of some fundamentalist
 principles but blocked attempts in the Assembly to apply
 Islamic law across the board.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military
 service. Those serving in the military must receive
 permission from the Defense Ministry before traveling abroad.
 Although there are no different legal standards regarding the
 internal or foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in
 practice husbands can prevent their wives and minor children
 from leaving the country.
 There are occasional instances in which citizens' passports
 are suspended temporarily. Generally, this has applied to
 criminal suspects but sometimes to outspoken regime critics as
 well. At the end of 1985, upwards of 8,500 Kuwaitis were
 barred from traveling abroad because of debts remaining from
 the collapse of an extra-official stock market 4 years
 earlier. Many of these persons had their travel rights
 restored during 1986. Representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings have to receive prior
 permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto,"
 individuals have been stripped of Kuwaiti citizenship and
 deported. Such actions appear to be rare and in some cases
 have been based on the voluntary acquisition by the individual
 of foreign citizenship. However, in March 1986 the
 
 
 1212
 KUWAIT
 authorities withdrew citizenship from two persons following
 their convictions in the State Security Court. One of the two
 had been found guilty of defaming the Amir and sentenced to
 prison for 2 years. The other had been convicted of belonging
 to a subversive group and sentenced to a 5-year prison term.
 All non-Kuwaitis residing in Kuwait over the age of 21 must
 have the sponsorship of a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not
 extend permanent residence to its expatriate population.
 Employers have the power to restrict job mobility and the
 tinued residence in Kuwait of their expatriate employees.
 Many expatriates (including some government employees, such as
 teachers) must surrender their travel documents to their
 employers, thus preventing them from leaving the country
 without the employer's consent. Those employed by government
 agencies are given residence visas which require an exit
 permit or "no objection" letter in order to leave the
 country. In accordance with law, non-Kuwaitis convicted of
 crimes are routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries. Exceptions have been made for those, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees and have been permitted to remain in
 Kuwait or sent to third countries. Most members of Kuwait's
 large Palestinian population have Lebanese or Jordanian travel
 documents. Since 1984, undocumented Palestinians and those
 with Lebanese documentation have received commitments from the
 Government that they will be allowed to stay even without
 sponsors, although Palestinian youths over 21 years of age who
 travel or study outside Kuwait often have difficulty rejoining
 their families in Kuwait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Al-Sabah, a family of Bedouin origin, have ruled Kuwait
 for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution limited succession
 to descendants of Mubarak the Great, the ruler at the turn of
 this century. In practice, the ruler and senior family
 members choose the Crown Prince from either the Al-Jaber or
 the Al-Salim branch of the Al-Sabah. Under the Constitution
 this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the National
 Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler and, under
 him, in an appointed Council of Ministers, currently numbering
 21, whose chairman by tradition is the Crown Prince.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies, elected by secret ballot, plus
 cabinet members, sitting ex-officio. The electoral law
 provides that candidates for the National Assembly be
 self-nominated, with multiple candidates permitted to compete
 for the 50 seats. A "grandfather clause" effectively limits
 suffrage to adult males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and
 maintained a residence there until 1959, and their adult male
 descendants. In June, the National Assembly approved an
 amendment to the 1966 Nationality Law that delayed for 10
 years, until 1996, the granting of voting rights to Kuwait's
 so-called "second category" citizens. The latter are certain
 long-time Arab and non-Arab residents who do not meet the
 "pre-1920" qualification. Efforts since 1982 to gain suffrage
 for women have been unsuccessful.
 On July 3 the Amir decreed the dissolution of the National
 Assembly for an indefinite period and the suspension of
 
 
 1213
 KUWAIT
 various constitutional provisions, including Article 107 which
 specified that, within 2 months of the Assembly's dissolution,
 either special elections be held for a new Assembly or the
 dissolved one be reinstated. In his announcement of the
 dissolution decree, the Amir mentioned the lack of cooperation
 and dialogue between the Government and the Assembly at a time
 when Kuwait was facing major economic problems, serious
 threats to its security, and other ills. He did not indicate
 when the Assembly might return but gave assurances that Kuwait
 would not abandon its parliamentary process. The Assembly
 previously had been dissolved in 1976 and not reinstated until
 1981. In the Assembly's absence, the Amir will rule via
 decrees having the force of law.
 The Assembly's dissolution represented a setback for citizens'
 political rights. Far from being a rubber stamp, it had
 served over the years as an important forum for the expression
 of diverse political views, some sharply at odds with those of
 the Government. The most recent elections, held in February
 1985, featured generally fair and hard-fought campaigns by
 competing candidates. While the Assembly rarely rejected
 government-proposed legislation, it was capable of exerting
 sufficient pressure on the Government to cause it to modify
 its legislation to satisfy Assembly desires. In its review of
 government policy and programs, the Assembly asserted its
 prerogatives, frequently questioning ministers and criticizing
 their performance. Indicative of the willingness of both the
 Assembly and the judiciary to challenge the Government, in
 June Kuwait's Constitutional Court ruled against the executive
 in a major decision. The Court found that the Assembly had
 the authority to investigate past actions by ministries and to
 examine Central Bank records; the Government had contended
 that the Assembly could only inquire into current ministerial
 activities and was not authorized to examine bank records.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their tribal
 and religious leaders, the heads of the prominent merchant
 clans, and to the ruling family itself through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal discussion groups to which anyone can
 come and freely speak his mind. That custom has endured, as
 has the tradition that the Amir should govern in consultation
 with the other community leaders. High-ranking officials are
 also approachable through "wasta," the use of influential
 family members or acquaintances as intermediaries in obtaining
 favors or a more favorable hearing for one's case.
 While most male Kuwaiti citizens can participate directly or
 indirectly in the political process, noncitizens, who
 outnumber Kuwaitis by three to two, have no role. Kuwait has
 been reluctant to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti
 origin, with the exception of certain stateless Bedouin.
 Naturalization of even Kuwait-born persons is rare. This
 anomaly is particularly striking for the 300,000 Palestinians,
 the second largest segment of the population. Citizenship has
 been extended only to a few Palestinian families who made
 significant contributions to Kuwait before the early 1970's.
 The Government has established a committee to draw up criteria
 for granting citizenship, but the results of its deliberations
 are not expected in the near future. Expatriates seldom
 engage in political activities for fear of exposing themselves
 to possible deportation.
 
 
 1214
 KUWAIT
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known current requests by nongovernmental
 organizations to examine human rights in Kuwait.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in the society,
 though less so than in some other Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Women have the right to litigate against men
 (for example, in child custody suits). In recent years,
 growing numbers of Kuwaiti women have joined the work force,
 and are able to compete for government and corporate
 employment. Some have reached senior government positions, up
 to the level of assistant under secretary. Women are well
 represented in the field of education, including at the
 university level. As yet, there are no female judges, but in
 October the Government named the first woman as a prosecutor.
 The Government, however, has restricted women from being
 assigned abroad in Kuwait's diplomatic service. Some
 prominent, educated persons, both men and women, also are wary
 of current fundamentalist trends, which they fear may lead the
 Government to restrict women's freedoms as a price for
 fundamentalist restraint on other issues, such as the
 "Islamization" of Kuwait's Western-oriented banking and
 financial system.
 There is no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the
 administration of Kuwait's extensive social welfare programs,
 designed to provide housing, family allowances, retirement
 income, medical care, education, and employment. However,
 foreign residents, who constitute about 60 percent of the
 country's total population of 1,710,000, do not share in many
 of the rights and benefits Kuwaiti nationals enjoy. Ownership
 of commercial establishments (above 49 percent),real estate,
 and shares on the local stock market is open only to
 Kuwaitis. Labor laws give priority to Kuwaitis, then Arabs,
 and lastly other foreigners. In the last 2 years, an economic
 recession has threatened the expatriate community by
 encouraging efforts to reduce the number of long-term resident
 foreigners.
 White collar and skilled expatriate workers earn the same base
 pay as Kuwaitis, but receive less in fringe benefits.
 Benefits restricted to Kuwaiti citizens include higher
 government salaries, additional government stipends and social
 allowances, and, in general, retirement pensions. Resident
 expatriates are entitled to medical benefits. Public
 schooling is offered, with some exceptions, only to children
 of expatriates who arrived in Kuwait prior to 1957, although
 the Government subsidizes tuition for students in a number of
 Arabic language elementary and secondary schools. Kuwaitis
 are given preference for admission to the University of
 Kuwait, and, because of limited space for new enrollees,
 non-Kuwaiti university entrants may equal no more than
 
 
 1215
 KUWAIT
 10 percent of the number of Kuwaiti entrants. Unskilled
 expatriate workers earn much less money and usually are not
 permitted to bring their families to Kuwait. Some of these
 workers live in crowded apartments or work camps.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sector, with the oil
 industry treated separately. The law limits the workweek to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days' leave per year,
 establishes a compensation schedule for industrial accidents,
 and establishes a minimum age of 18 years for full-time work
 or 14 years for part-time work. Women are permitted to work
 except in "dangerous industries and trades harmful to the
 health" and are promised "equal remuneration to that of a man
 provided she does the same work." There is no legal minimum
 wage, but this has little impact in practice since Kuwait is
 not a low-wage country.
 Reflecting the importance of the petroleum industry in Kuwait,
 the law governing employment in this sector is more generous
 than the general laws. It provides for a 40-hour workweek,
 overtime pay for shift work, 30 days' annual leave, and a
 generous sick leave policy. By and large, employers appear to
 respect provisions of the labor law and provide suitable
 working conditions, although some abuses occur in the
 treatment of unskilled expatriate workers, particularly
 household maids and servants.
 There are two ministerial orders that supplement the above
 laws. Number 14 (1970) established an interministerial board
 to resolve labor disputes, and number 42 (1979) created a
 permanent commission to coordinate activities in the field of
 public health and occupational safety.
