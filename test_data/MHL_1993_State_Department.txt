 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of 29 small, coral atolls and
 6 islands scattered over a large area of the central Pacific, comprising a total land
 area of about 70 square miles. The population, of Micronesian origin, is approxi-
 mately 50,000 and concentrated primarily on Majur and Kwajalein atolls.
 Poitical legitimacy in the Marshall Islands rests on the popular will expressed
 by majority vote in accordance with a constitution blending British and American
 precepts, including a strong, American-style bill of rights. The leislature consists
 of the Parliament, known as the Nitijela, with 33 members and a Council of Chiefs
 (Ireij), the latter serving a largely consultative function on matters dealing with cus-
 tom and traditional practice.
 The executive branch of the Government consists of the President and his ap-
 pointed Cabinet, all of whom are elected members of the Nitijela. The President is
 elected by majority vote from among the membership of the Nitiela. The Constitu-
 tion calls for an independent judiciary.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security. Consequently the Marshall Islands has no security
 forces of its own, aside from national and local police forces, that are firmly under
 the control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, and the fishing industry gen-
 erate limited revenues.
 Human rights abuses are rare, but there was one incident of attempted press in-
 timidation in 1993.
 RESPECT F'OR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Antegrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 l.J Dsappearance.-No politically motivated disappearances or abductions were re-
 ported.
 
 
 694
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment; the prohibition is observed in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains safeguards
 against arbitrary arrest and detention, and no such incidents were reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is expressly pro-
 vided for in the Constitution and observed in practice. There were no reported deni-
 als of fair public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.
 The privacy of the home is protected by law and respected by the Government.
 There was no known instance of arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private
 life of the individual.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and it has generally been accorded in practice. There are four operating
 radio stations, one government owned and three privately owned, including one
 owned by a prominent member of the opposition. There is one television station, op-
 erated by the National Museum, and a cable television company which shows U.S.
 programming only.
 A U.S. citizen long resident in the Marshall Islands operates the country's sole
 rivately owned newspaper. The editor and two reporters are U.S. citizens as well.
 iMarch the Minister of Justice informed one of the reporters in writing that an
 article he had published about the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in
 the Marshall Islands was "alarming and unbalanced." The Minister wrote that, if
 the reporter continued to write similar articles, he would be asked to leave the coun-
 try.
 The Government publishes a monthly gazette with official news and notices only.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is provided for in the Constitution and observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Free exercise of religion is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion and observed in practice. There is no state religion. Missionaries are free to
 seek converts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad. There are no
 restrictions on emigration or repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by secret ballot in free and open elections every 4
 years. Suffrage is universal for men and women 18 years of age and older. There
 are no restrictions on the formation of political parties, although political activity
 by aliens is prohibited.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights have been formed.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 family status, or descent.
 Women.-Inheritance of property and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with
 women occupying positions of importance within the traditional system. No in-
 stances of unequal pay for equal work or sex-related job discrimination were re-
 ported.
 Public allegations of violence against women are rare and relate mainly to domes-
 tic abuse. No reliable information about the extent of this problem is available. As-
 sault is a criminal offense, but women are reluctant to prosecute their spouses.
 Women's groups have held infrequent meetings to publicize women's issues and to
 create a greater awareness of the rights of women.
 Children.-Much of the Government's expenditures on children's welfare is in
 areas of health and education, which make up the largest percentage of its budget.
 However, this has not been adequate to meet the needs of its sharply increasing
 population. The current birthrate is over 4 per cent. The Nitijela passed the Domes-
 tic Relations Amendment of 1993, which defines child abuse and neglect, and makes
 the two criminal offenses. Earlier legislation requires teachers, care givers, and
 
 
 other persons to report instances of child abuse and exempts them from civil or
 criminal liability. Cultural preferences for large families and the lack of educational
 facilities and teachers pose special challenges for parents.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no legislation specifically prohibiting discrimi-
 nation based on disability. There are no building codes, and, therefore, nolegislation
 requiring access for the disabled. There have been no reported instances of discrimi-
 nation against the disabled.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Attorney General interprets this right as allowing the
 existence of labor unions, although to date there have been no initiatives to form
 any. The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, and thus far the Government
 has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no
 bars to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. There are no
 export processing zones. Wages in the cash economy are determined by market fac-
 tors in accordance with the minimum wage and other laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Marshallese law contains no pro-
 hibition on the employment of children. Children are not typically employed in the
 wage economy, but some assist their families with agriculture, fishing, and other
 small-scale family enterprises. Public Law 1991-125 instituted compulsory edu-
 cation for children aged 6 to 14; however, the lack of classrooms and teachers makes
 enforcement impossible.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in this subsistence economy, where extended families are expected to help less fortu-
 nate family members. The minimum wage for all government and private sector em-
 ployees is $1.50. (The U.S. dollar is the local currency.) The Ministry of Resources
 and Development oversees minimum wage regulations. Foreign employees and
 Marshallese trainees of private employers who have invested in or established a
 business in the country are exempt from minimum wage requirements. Since the
 majority of foreign workers are in white-collar positions, this exemption does not af-
 fect a significant segment of the work force.
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours of work or occupational safety
 and health, although Sunday is widely considered church and family day, and most
 people do not work on Sundays.
 Legislation provided for the establishment of a Labor Board to make recommenda-
 tions to the Nitijela on minimum working conditions, i.e., minimum wage, legal
 working hours and overtime payments, and occupational health and safety stand-
 ards in accordance with International Labor Organization conventions. The Board's
 meetings are public; however, there appears tobe no record of any meeting held in
 recent years. There is no legislation specifically giving workers the right to remove
 themselves from situations which endanger their health or safety without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and no legislation protecting workers who file com-
 plaints about such conditions. There were no reports of industrial accidents in 1993.
