 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Yugoslavia of 1991 bears little resemblance to the one
 established by the 1974 Constitution that set up a Federal State
 comprising six republics (with two autonomous regions in the
 republic of Serbia) and a collective Federal Presidency as the
 supreme state organ. Effective civilian federal authority
 collapsed in 1991 as the republics and various independence
 movements decisively rejected that authority and escalating
 ethnic animosities propelled the country into a vicious armed
 conflict.
 The Federal Government's attempts to introduce multiparty
 elections at the federal level and to advance economic reforms
 were blocked by republic governments. Several republics adopted
 legislation and new constitutions that gave primacy to republic-
 level rather than to federal laws and routinely ignored federal
 legislation. Blocked by Serbia in their attempts to restructure
 Yugoslavia as-a loose confederation, therepublics of Croatia
 and Slovenia on June 25 declared complete independence and
 sought international recognition. In walking out of the
 Federal Assembly (legislature), they effectively denied it a
 quorum. In October Serbia and its allies in the Federal
 Presidency assumed the right to act in the name of the
 Presidency and to take over the Federal Assembly's authority.
 Federal Prime Minister Markovic, a Croat, lost effective power
 and finally resigned in December after Serbian-dominated rump
 federal institutions sought his ouster. In December Stipe
 Mesic, the President of the Federal Presidency and a Croat,
 resigned his office.
 The breakdown of federal authority seriously compromised the
 principle of federal civilian control over the Yugoslav National
 Army (JNA) which, along with elements of other security and
 police forces, technically remained under federal civilian
 jurisdiction in 1991. After its nominal Commander in Chief,
 the collective Federal Presidency, became paralyzed, the JNA
 allied itself squarely with Serbian politicians in the armed
 conflict with Croatia.
 The size and activities of other military, paramilitary, and
 police units increased dramatically in 1991, including those of
 the Croatian army and the irregular units organized by Serbian
 residents of Croatia. The outbreak of fighting between these
 groups and the aggressive role of the JNA in support of these
 Serbs led to many civilian casualties, the displacement of
 hundreds of thousands of persons from the war-torn areas, and
 widespread brutality and disregard of the Geneva Conventions
 and other international norms.
 In the economy, the workers' self-management system, which
 purported to enable workers to run their own enterprises
 through elected workers' councils, is being phased out. The
 Federal Government's economic reform program, aimed at
 converting to a market system and encouraging private
 enterprise, started promisingly in 1990 but collapsed under
 high inflation, plummeting'production, and growing unemployment
 that were aggravated by the fracturing of the economy along
 republic and ethnic lines. The National Bank of Yugoslavia
 resorted to printing money and extending large credits to the
 Federal Government to finance its growing expenditures,
 primarily to support the military.
 Respect for human rights deteriorated drastically in the
 deepening political crisis and the breakdown of civil order.
 Extreme interrepublic and ethnic animosities and the spread of
 
 
 1310
 YUGOSLAVIA
 armed conflict undid 1990's promising advances in human rights
 and brought about serious new human rights violations. The
 armed conflict claimed thousands of lives by year's end,
 including those of many civilian noncombatants. In the areas
 most affected by the fighting, there were widespread and
 credible reports of atrocities, including the massacre of
 villagers, the killing of prisoners, the use of human shields,
 and the taking of hostages. Such behavior was rarely punished.
 Croats and Serbs both fled areas of Croatia that came under the
 control of the other ethnic group.
 In the autonomous province of Kosovo, Serbian authorities
 intensified repressive measures against the majority Albanian
 population, eliminating virtually all Albanian-language
 schooling. They arrested and beat hundreds of Albanians on
 trumped-up charges and suppressed the Albanian community's
 attempt to organize a referendum on Kosovo's future. In March
 Serbian police and army troops in Belgrade used force to repress
 large-scale opposition demonstrations to demand the Serbian
 government's ouster, resulting in two deaths and hundreds of
 injuries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killings occurred with increasing frequency in 1991,
 spurred by violent rivalry between political and ethnic groups
 and the breakdown in civil order. Serbs and Croats regularly
 accused each other of "massacres" and "genocide" against
 innocent civilians (see Section l.g.). While both sides were
 prone to exaggerate for propaganda purposes and hard evidence
 was often scarce, the statements of those fleeing the fighting
 and other evidence make clear that many deaths resulted from
 summary executions on ethnic or political grounds. For example,
 some 80 Croatian residents of the town of Dalj were reportedly
 massacred in August. At least 35 Croats, mostly elderly, in
 the Croatian village of Vocin, were murdered and mutilated in
 December, apparently by Serbian irregular forces. Displaced
 persons alleged that in at least one instance Croatian
 journalists who witnessed the killing of Croatian civilians by
 Serbian irregulars were themselves executed. There were also
 credible reports of Croatian forces killing unarmed Serbian
 villagers in the Sisak area and in Sarvas. In a Croatian
 village near Glina, Serbian irregulars reportedly murdered 21
 Croatian civilians aged between 5 and 65; Serbian authorities
 in the area acknowledged the incident and promised to
 investigate. There is no reliable way to ascertain the number
 of such killings.
 In an armed conflict with constantly shifting battle lines and
 weakening civil authority throughout the country, there were
 numerous reports of killings in areas not related to the
 fighting. For example, two Muslims were shot in Bosnia,
 apparently by Serbs angered by Muslim resistance to
 conscription. A number of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo died at
 the hands of police or the army; nine ethnic Albanians residing
 in a contested area of Croatia were reportedly murdered by
 Serbian irregulars in November. Several Croatian policemen
 were arrested in Pula in connection with the murder of a Serb.
 
 
 1311
 YUGOSLAVIA
 b. Disappearance
 There were many reports of disappearances, particularly in the
 areas of Croatia which experienced the heaviest fighting and
 produced the greatest numbers of displaced persons. The
 Croatian government reported at year's end that 30,000 persons
 were missing in Croatia, a situation exacerbated by the chaotic
 breakdown of communications links within and between republics.
 This figure included not only Croats but also cases such as the
 24 ethnic Serbs abducted by masked men in Gospic in October.
 Two Soviet journalists disappeared in September and were never
 located. In the Sandzak region of Serbia, six Muslim draft
 resisters who were arrested in December are missing. More than
 one hundred Croatian residents of the village of Hum were
 reported "disappeared" after Serbian irregular forces withdrew
 from the area.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Yugoslav law forbids torture, but prisoners in many parts of
 Yugoslavia are beaten and otherwise mistreated during arrest
 and detention. This practice is most widespread in Kosovo,
 where Serbian police engage in frequent and flagrant abuse of
 people arrested on suspicion of participating in unsanctioned
 activity. Hundreds of instances of Serbian police detaining
 and severely beating ethnic Albanians were reported in,1991.
 In the areas affected by armed conflict, there were convincing
 reports that police, military, and irregular armed units engaged
 in severe beatings of persons, sometimes resulting in their
 deaths. There were credible reports that local Serbian forces
 operating in Croatia routinely tortured their detainees,
 including civilian noncombatants, using electric shocks.
 Serbian political and community leaders were reportedly
 regularly detained and sometimes beaten by Croatian police in
 contested areas in order to intimidate the local Serbian
 population. In August the Federal Minister of Agriculture was
 detained and beaten by Croatian security forces while driving
 in Croatia. Croatian President Tudjman condemned the attack,
 but those responsible were not prosecuted.
 In apparently only one instance were offenders prosecuted for
 the excessive use of force. In Macedonia, two policemen were
 arrested and charged with the death by beating of an ethnic
 Albanian.
 In Serbia antiwar activists and opposition figures received
 death threats from known radical Serbian paramilitary groups.
 Most of those detained and abused in the context of the armed
 conflict were held in makeshift places of detainment which
 often did not meet minimum humanitarian standards for life and
 health as specified in the Geneva accords.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Yugoslav criminal law and legal procedures include many
 provisions inconsistent with internationally accepted human
 rights norms. The federal law allows investigatory detention
 for up to 3 months, with a possible 3-month extension. Access
 to prisoners in pretrial detention is sometimes restricted,
 ostensibly to prevent interference with investigations.
 
 
 1312
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Arbitrary arrest continued to occur frequently in Kosovo in
 1991. Ethnic Albanians were routinely and summarily sentenced
 to 30 to 60 days in jail, often on misdemeanor charges of
 "disturbing public order" on the basis of an unsupported
 statement by a single policeman. Although the numbers affected
 appeared to be lower than the thousands reported in 1990,
 arrest and imprisonment in this manner continues to be frequent
 in Kosovo. Under judicial procedures pertaining to
 misdemeanors, a prisoner may appeal a conviction only after
 sentencing, and, because of the time required to file the
 appeal, the sentence is often completed before the appeal can
 be heard. Because of the speed of the trial and sentencing,
 defendants often cannot obtain legal assistance, although they.
 have.the legal right to an attorney.
 Arbitrary detention with little or no attention to procedural
 safeguards occurred with growing frequency in the areas of
 Croatia most affected by armed conflict. In numerous cases
 Croatian authorities detained politically active Serbs, usually
 for several hours or days, occasionally longer. For example,
 Momir Lazic, a Serbian opposition leader in the Croatian city
 of Karlovac, was arrested with three others in April and
 released 1 day later. Lazic claimed he was beaten during
 detention and pressed charges against the Croatian authorities.
 In areas of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina which came under the
 control of Serbian paramilitary and irregular units, virtually
 no safeguards against arbitrary detention existed. These
 units, together with Serbian police, regularly detained persons
 without charge and without the safeguards of due process, such
 as the right to a hearing and legal representation. Three
 American journalists were so detained by the police of the
 so-called Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina in May. After
 the JNA captured the Croatian city of Vukovar in November, it
 took over 2,000 prisoners, including children, medical
 personnel, and clergy, and held them in a variety of
 overcrowded facilities. Although many, including the doctors
 from the Vukovar hospital and the women and children, were
 eventually released, the JNA continued to hold a large number
 of captured adult men. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
 Yugoslav civilians were arbitrarily detained and denied due
 process in these areas in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system comprises local, district, provincial, and
 supreme courts at the republic level, and a Federal Supreme
 Court to which republic supreme court decisions may be appealed.
 There is also a federal military court system. The
 Constitutional Court rules on the constitutionality of laws and
 regulations, but its rulings must be enforced by the republic
 authorities, who in 1991 routinely ignored them. The republics
 are obliged to follow federal criminal procedure, but the
 Federal Government is powerless to compel them to do so.
 Reforms.proposed in 1991 to the federal system to provide for
 due process rights in greater conformity with international
 standards were not adopted because the Federal Assembly was not
 functioning normally.
 Under federal law, defendants have the right to be present at
 their trials and to have an attorney, at public expense if
 needed. The legal system, however, still contains numerous
 inequities unfavorable to the defendant, regardless of whether
 the offense alleged is criminal or political. The defense is
 sometimes restricted in the time allowed to prepare its case.
 
 
 1313
 YUGOSLAVIA
 While the prosecution may call as witnesses whomever it wishes.
 the defendant may only request the court to call witnesses, and
 the court has complete discretion as to whether or not to honor
 the request. Prosecutors are allowed to appeal a verdict of
 not guilty.
 Although the major changes made in federal and republic legal
 systems in 1990 provided greater due process protection, the
 breakdown or nonfunctioning of legitimate authority and of the
 rule of law in many parts of Yugoslavia resulted in widespread
 denials of due process, particularly in those areas of Croatia
 and Bosnia-Herzegovina where ethnic Serbs declared local
 autonomy and rejected republic authority over their regions.
 These denials of due process and persecution for political
 offenses extended to ethnic Serbs in opposition to the Serbian
 group in power as well as to members of other ethnic groups.
 Thousands of noncombatants were imprisoned in the context of
 the armed conflict often but not always for relatively brief
 periods and usually without any form of due process. In
 October it was estimated that some 2,500 such persons, including
 prisoners of war, were being detained at any given time.
 Noncombatants were detained because of the ethnic group to
 which they belonged, because of suspected political activities
 or sympathies, or as hostages.
 The judiciary is not free of political influence nor of ethnic
 bias. In the republic of Serbia, provincial courts in Kosovo
 and Vojvodina were closed, and some of their functions were
 transferred to Belgrade. In Kosovo, ethnic Albanian judges
 were replaced by ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins, who were said
 by ethnic Albanians to be unqualified, inexperienced, and anti-
 Albanian. Ethnic Albanians in the republic of Macedonia also
 charged that courts there are often biased against them. In
 September Nevzat Halili, leader of the largest ethnic Albanian
 party in Macedonia, was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment for
 refusing to cooperate in the federal-census, an accusation and
 trial which occurred months after the census had ended., The
 sentence was later reduced to a fine.
 Offenses by those in the armed forces or offenses by civilians
 deemed to affect national security are tried in the federal
 military court system. In 1991 the Croatian Minister of Defense
 and several other Croatian defendants-were charged with national
 security violations in connection with efforts to arm a Croatian
 force. The Minister of Defense, with the support of the
 Croatian government, evaded arrest. The other defendants,
 tried in military court, alleged that they were not permitted
 to have their lawyers present during interrogation nor to
 inspect prosecution-held documents; they were convicted on some
 charges.
 Changes made in the federal criminal code by the Federal
 Assembly in 1990 narrowed the definitions of statutes regarding
 political crimes. Thanks to these legal revisions, a number of
 long-term political prisoners were released in 1991. Yugoslav
 federal sources claimed that the 15 still imprisoned were guilty.
 of acts of violence. Other sources estimated the number of
 political prisoners in mid-1991 at several hundred, including a
 large number of ethnic Albanians imprisoned on such grounds as
 "endangering the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia."
 
 
 1314
 YUGOSLAVIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government efforts to monitor opposition or dissident activity
 and the widening military conflict brought about increased
 arbitrary interference in private life in 1991. Although
 federal and republic-level constitutions and laws, including
 Serbia's, include restrictions on arbitrary searches, these
 safeguards were often ignored, particularly in Kosovo and in
 areas of Croatia and Bosnia experiencing the most severe civil
 unrest. Authorities eavesdropped on conversations, read private
 mail, and tapped telephones in some cases. For example, ethnic
 Croats in Vojvodina, an autonomous province of Serbia,
 complained that Serbian authorities there were tapping the
 telephones of opposition party leaders and searching Croatian
 households-under the pretext of looking for weapons. Serbian
 residents of some Croatian areas complained that Croatian
 authorities conducted unlawful searches of Serbian households.
 The pattern of frequent, arbitrary police raids on homes and
 people in Kosovo continued in 1991.
 Faced with growing resistance to callups for military service,
 the JNA in 1991 increasingly resorted to extraordinary measures
 to round up recruits, including nighttime sweeps of restaurants
 and homes and, in some cases, impressment of eligible males who
 had not received callup notices. The threat of mobilization
 was used on numerous occasions to intimidate antiwar activists.
 For example, Vojvodina antiwar leader Nedad Canak was arrested
 and then turned over to the JNA for conscription, though he was
 demobilized some weeks later. Draft resisters were'threatened
 with dismissal from their jobs and with sentences to extended
 prison terms for draft evasion, as approved by the Serbian-rump
 Federal Presidency.
 As part of Serbia's plans after the armed conflict, Serbs
 dislocated by the war have been resettled in the homes and farms
 of Croats and ethnic Hungarians who fled when the JNA and
 Serbian insurgents seized and occupied those areas. Serbian
 officials in the occupied areas, asserting that the Croats and
 ethnic Hungarians had abandoned their properties, state that
 the owners will not be allowed to return to their homes.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Massive violations of humanitarian law occurred during the
 armed conflict. The JNA was increasingly aggressive in using
 its superior ground and air power on civilian targets. Its
 disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force, including
 heavy artillery and air strikes during the sieges of Vukovar,
 Osijek, Dubrovnik, and other Croatian population centers
 resulted in thousands of civilian casualties, severe damage or
 destruction to Croatian cities and villages, and the
 displacement of hundreds of thousands of residents. It was
 estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 people died in the
 civil conflict in Croatia by December, many of them civilian
 noncombatants. In Slovenia about 100 persons were killed,
 including some 30 civilians, during fighting between the JNA
 and Slovene irregular forces in July.
 In many inslances, forces involved in the conflict failed to
 observe humanitarian standards, notably in the treatment of
 prisoners. For example, in September Croatian forces near
 Karlovac reportedly killed more than 10 JNA soldiers who were
 attempting to surrender. Both Croatian and Serbian forces
 
 
 1315 ,
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 regularly beat prisoners. There were credible reports of
 Serbian irregular forces using civilian noncombatants as human
 shields. International observers reported widespread looting
 of Croatian villages by Serbian irregulars and JNA reservists
 in the Dalmatian hinterlands. In September the government-
 controlled Belgrade television broadcast interviews with
 Croatian prisoners of war. The families of JNA soldiers
 residing in Croatia were threatened and at times used as
 hostages by Croatian forces. Members of opposing ethnic groups
 were captured and held as hostages for barter in prisoner
 exchanges. These instances of hostage-taking were in violation
 of humanitarian conventions. The Croatian blockade of JNA
 garrisons in Croatia resulted in the denial of essential food
 and supplies to some families and noncombatants.
 Conventions protecting medical personnel and relief supplies
 were not respected. A convoy of medical and food supplies for
 the city of Vukovar, besieged by the JNA, was repeatedly
 stopped in October, despite the agreement of all sides that it
 should proceed. The convoy was fired upon, allegedly by JNA
 forces.   Another convoy, led by the French organization,
 Doctors Without Borders, came under artillery attack while it
 was evacuating patients- In a separate incident, a clearly
 marked vehicle carrying delegates of the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) was attacked by mortar fire. In several
 instances, international cease-fire monitors were attacked. In
 numerous instances, including in Vukovar, Osijek, Vinkovci, and
 Karlovac, clearly identified hospitals were repeatedly and
 apparently intentionally hit by JNA and Serbian irregular
 artillery and air attacks. In October Serbian irregulars fired
 mortar rounds at a clearly marked ambulance near Karlovac and
 killed the doctor inside it.
 During its June effort to reclaim control of border posts in
 Slovenia, the JNA admitted to several incidents in which it
 falsely used Red Cross markings on its vehicles. 'There is
 convincing evidence that Slovenian forces fighting the JNA also
 committed numerous offenses, including firing on JNA medical
 personnel and denying wounded JNA soldiers access to medical
 treatment.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Yugoslav federal and republic laws provide for freedom of speech
 and press. Federal rules, laws, and institutions, however,
 became increasingly irrelevant in 1991. With the outbreak of
 the armed conflict, the governments of some republics enforced
 tighter controls on the press, mainly over coverage of domestic
 politics, the armed conflict, and allegations of human rights
 abuses. Although press freedom varied substantially from
 republic to republic, most areas of Yugoslavia generally had
 less press freedom in 1991 than they did in 1990.
 Serbian and Croatian television increasingly presented only
 their government's interpretation of events. The federally
 supported Yutel news network failed to get acceptable air time
 (it was shown after midnight in Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia)
 before finally being taken off the air completely in four of
 the six republics. In Serbian-controlled areas of Croatia,
 Serbian or JNA forces systematically converted Croatian
 television retransmitters to receive only Serbian television.
 
 
 1316
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Serbia adopted laws that increased its control over Serbian-
 based media, including Belgrade Radio/Television. In August
 numerous senior editors at Belgrade Radio/Television were
 demoted or dismissed and replace i with Serbian ruling party .
 loyalists. However, despite government restrictions,
 independent media in Belgrade, including Studio B television
 and radio, B-92 radio, the major daily, Borba, and the weekly
 newsmagazine, Vreme, offered alternatives to the government-
 controlled media. Both B-92 and Studio B were temporarily shut
 down by Serbian authorities for carrying live coverage of the
 demonstration on March 9 (see Section 2.b.). Growing
 nationalistic fervor gradually drew attention away from the
 issue of press freedom in Serbia. Nationalist politicians and
 government officials regularly accused the independent media of
 being anti-Serbian.
 The minority media in Vojvodina and Kosovo came under strong
 Serbian pressure. In Vojvodina the Serbian government prevented
 the distribution of a new independent Hungarian-language daily.
 In Kosovo the leading Albanian-language daily, Rilindja,
 remained closed because its editors refused to agree to
 censorship by Serbian authorities as a condition for resuming
 publication. The only nongovernment sources of news in Albanian
 were magazines. In October several editors of Albanian-
 language magazines were summarily sentenced to 60 days'
 imprisonment on misdemeanor charges because they printed stories
 citing announcements by the banned "Government of the Republic
 of Kosovo."
 In Croatia the movement towards independence and the siege
 mentality engendered by the armed conflict encouraged self-
 censorship in all media. In October a new decree affording the
 government greater potential powers over the press during
 wartime was introduced. Despite this decree and reports of
 government-imposed guidelines and loyalty oaths, the daily
 newspaper in Split maintained an independent editorial line,
 and major Zagreb dailies, including new newspapers such as
 Globus, did criticize the Croatian government. Croatian
 authorities took control of a newspaper in strife-torn Osijek
 because of its critical editorial line. The independent weekly
 Danas was subjected to apparently officially sanctioned
 financial and editorial pressures.
 In Montenegro the media remained under government control and
 hewed to a progovernment line. The offices of the weekly
 magazine, Monitor, the only significant independent publication,
 were bombed in October; the perpetrator was not found. Titograd
 television fired six journalists who had been contributing
 articles to the magazine. Montenegrin writer Jefrem Brkovic
 was charged in October with "stirring up racial hatred,"
 apparently because of statements critical of the behavior of
 Montenegrin reservists in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 In Macedonia government influence on the media was not heavy-
 handed although the government sponsors Macedonia Radio/
 Television and the Nova Makedonija publishing house, which
 prints the major daily paper and most Macedonian-language
 magazines. A Bulgarian-language newspaper was reportedly denied
 permission to publish in Macedonia. In Slovenia, government
 control of news during the Slovenian-JNA conflict was an
 effective tool in its campaign to get the JNA out of Slovenia.
 As a result, many officials remained reluctant to abandon an
 oversight role, particularly in television. The director of
 Slovenia Television removed 14 journalists in September,
 allegedly for political reasons. At the same time, however, a
 
 
 1317-
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 new, independent Slovenian television station began broadcasting
 in 1991.
 Although the major media in Bosnia-Herzegovina are under
 government sponsorship, the three ethnically based political
 parties continued to vie for control over them, and the Bosnian
 courts acted to restrain them.
 Academic freedom and autonomy are being threatened by
 educational reform efforts that centralize decisionmaking in
 the hands of government. During the summer, the Serbian
 legislature announced a draft university law that appeared to
 challenge the autonomy of universities. Serbian authorities
 effectively denied higher education to most ethnic Albanians in
 Kosovo in 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite federal constitutional provisions for freedom-of
 assembly and similar provisions at the republic level,
 permission for assemblies is often denied to opposition groups.
 On March 9, Serbian police backed by army troops broke up an
 unauthorized opposition demonstration in Belgrade, which
 demanded initially the resignation of the head of Belgrade
 television and later the ouster of the Serbian government.
 Police and the army used tear gas, water cannons, and tanks to
 disperse the crowd of 40,000 to 50,000; one teenager and one
 policeman were killed and hundreds were injured in the violence.
 However, Belgrade authorities subsequently allowed other
 opposition gatherings, even those which had been officially
 "banned."
 In Kosovo practically any gathering of ethnic Albanians is
 likely to be broken up on the pretext that permission, has not
 been obtained from the Serbian government or that the gathering
 has separatist aims. Serbian police routinely used tear gas
 and clubs against entirely peaceful crowds of Albanian
 demonstrators, causing hundreds of injuries and arrests through
 the year. Serbian authorities did not interfere with a peaceful
 opposition gathering of some 100,000 ethnic Albanians in June;
 however, a gathering of some 8,000 ethnic Albanians in September
 protesting-Serbian educational policies at Pristina University
 was broken up by police using firearms and rubber truncheons.
 One demonstrator was killed. Police arrested several dozen
 participants to curb widespread protests against Serbian
 controls of local schools in October. On occasion, peaceful
 demonstrations against the armed conflict, such as that
 organized by ethnic Hungarian and Croatian residents of
 Vojvodina in September, were broken up by police; at other
 times, similar antiwar gatherings were permitted.
 The legal basis for greater freedom of association, begun in
 1990, remained in effect in 1991. In January 1991, there were
 54 registered political parties in Serbia alone. The total for
 all of Yugoslavia numbered over 200.
 There are still, however, serious restrictions on freedom of
 association under existing laws. The law against association
 for the purpose of hostile activities has been used to prosecute
 ethnic Albanians who advocate republic status for Kosovo. No
 organizations that "stir up racial, ethnic, or religious hatred"
 are permitted, and no one who has been convicted of a crime may
 be a founder of a citizens* association. These provisions are
 frequently used by Serbian authorities to restrict the
 
 
 1318
 YUGOSLAVIA
 activities of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The Serbian election
 law denies registration to any party that does not accept the
 territorial integrity of Serbia, a provision that is aimed at
 Albanian political parties, almost all of which have sought
 separate status for Kosovo within Yugoslavia but outside Serbia.
 An ethnic Croatian political party in Vojvodina complained that
 Serbian authorities had banned all public party meetings on
 security grounds. The Serbian government declared illegal
 referendums organized by opposition parties in Kosovo and
 Sandzak. In Kosovo, 68 people were arrested in this connection,
 and in Sandzak charges were filed against 5 political party
 leaders. The Serbian authorities later moved to ban the
 Sandzak-based party.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In many respects, the substantial expansion in religious freedom
 achieved in 1990 was consolidated in 1991. While Eastern
 Orthodox Christianity, Roman Catholicism, and Islam are the
 largest faiths in Yugoslavia, there is also a Jewish community
 of about 6,000 members and a small Protestant community which
 includes various denominations.
 There are few hindrances for religious believers who wish to
 associate with their coreligionists elsewhere. Foreign clergy
 work and proselytize in Yugoslavia, though they sometimes
 experience difficulties in obtaining permits from the
 authorities. Religious institutions are allowed to propagate
 their beliefs and offer religious education. Soldiers are now
 allowed to possess religious materials.
 Religion is identified with ethnicity in Yugoslavia. In the
 context of increasing ethnic animosities and armed conflict,
 the nationalist governments which came to power in 1990 in the
 republics have established close public ties with the dominant
 religious establishments and usually discriminated against
 minority religions. Senior Catholic and Serbian Orthodox
 clerics have taken political stands in support of the Croatian
 and Serbian government positions respectively. The minority
 Serbian.Orthodox Church in Croatia has complained of official
 discrimination in such areas as the issuance of building
 permits. It has protested the lack of police protection
 against the vandalism of its churches in Croatia, including in
 some instances the use of explosives. There has been little
 official effort to identify and punish those responsible.
 Several Serbian priests in Croatia, including Bishop Lukijan of
 Pakrac, were reportedly placed under house arrest or prevented
 from performing their duties freely. In August the Jewish
 community center in Zagreb was badly damaged by a bomb; the
 Government responded promptly with promises to investigate
 fully but by year's end had not identified the culprits.
 The Croatian government reported in December that 223 churches
 and monasteries in Croatia had been damaged or destroyed in the
 war. In addition to instances of vandalism by Serbian irregular
 forces operating in the area, the Croatian authorities accused
 the JNA of intentionally targeting Catholic churches in
 artillery and air attacks. Although the JNA denied this
 allegation and charged Croatian forces with staging attacks from
 churches and other civilian buildings, the testimony of numerous
 reliable international observers suggested that churches had
 been intentionally and repeatedly targeted. In July a Croatian
 Catholic priest in the Serbian-held town of old Tenja in Croatia
 reported he was held hostage by Serbian forces. Four Franciscan
 priests were taken prisoner by the JNA when Vukovar fell.
 
 
 1319
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Catholics in Vojvodina claimed that Serbs who allegedly placed
 a bomb in Subotica's Catholic Cathedral, though known to the
 police, went unpunished.
 The construction of new places of worship requires the consent
 of local government authorities. Although in many cases
 building permits for new religious facilities are now easier to
 obtain, minority religions still face obstacles. The Islamic
 community has had a request pending for years to build a new
 mosque in Belgrade. In Split, a predominantly Catholic area,
 the Serbian Orthodox Church has long had difficulty in getting
 permission to complete its cathedral. For the most part,
 federal and republic authorities have not returned properties
 confiscated by the previous Communist regime, though in
 Macedonia, for example, some properties have been transferred
 to the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within
 Yugoslavia, but the conditions of armed conflict and other
 factors have severely limited this right. Slovenia instituted
 entry controls on the Slovenian-Croatian border in October
 although it promised easy entry to holders of Yugoslav
 documentation. Travel became increasingly difficult as the
 Zagreb and Ljubljana airports were closed, JNA units blockaded
 Adriatic ports, and various military forces shelled or
 threatened roads and train lines in Croatia and Bosnia.
 Yugoslavs generally do not require exit permits, and passports
 are routinely available to most Yugoslavs. Yugoslav authorities
 in 1991, however, stepped up efforts to prevent draft-age males,
 particularly from Serbia, from leaving the country. In November
 federal authorities announced that draft-eligible men would need
 special permits to travel abroad. The Croatian government
 introduced the requirement that all draft-age males obtain
 permission before leaving their area of residence. Ethnic
 Albanians, particularly those who are politically active,
 continued to face restrictions on their ability to travel
 outside Yugoslavia. In August JNA border guards shot to death
 two Yugoslavs who were ethnic Albanians while they were
 attempting to cross the border into Albania. In several other
 cases, Yugoslav border guards killed or wounded persons along
 the Yugoslav-Albanian, border, in one instance shooting an
 Albanian border guard and leaving him to bleed to death.
 Reentry into Yugoslavia by Yugoslav citizens has not usually
 been a problem. Reports in 1991, however, indicate that ethnic
 Croats and Hungarians who had sought temporary refuge in Hungary
 from fighting or ethnic discrimination in Croatia and Vojvodina
 were at times prevented forcibly from returning to their homes.
 Refugees from Croatia interviewed in Hungary asserted that in
 some instances the population of entire villages of ethnic
 Hungarians or Croats had been forced at gunpoint by JNA or
 Serbian forces to board buses to take them out of the country.
 The law on the entry of foreigners into Yugoslavia provides a
 process for granting permanent asylum and for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In practice,
 Yugoslavia almost never grants permanent asylum or provides
 assistance to refugees. In 1991, however, Yugoslav federal and
 republic authorities decided to grant refugee status to about
 2,000 Albanians of Montenegrin and Macedonian ethnic origin.
 In general, it continued to be Yugoslav policy to extend only
 
 
 1320
 YUGOSLAVIA
 temporary asylum to refugees who, with the assistance of the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), seek permanent
 resettlement in third countries. During the first 8 months of
 1991, the UNHCR recognized as gdnuine refugees 770 asylum
 seekers, 716 of whom were from Albania.
 All asylum seekers who are caught entering Yugoslavia without
 passports or visas serve a 1-month jail sentence for "illegal
 border crossing" and are "prescreened" by Yugoslav authorities
 before being presented to the UNHCR. In January 1991 alone,
 the Yugoslav authorities forcibly returned 368 Albanians to
 their country of origin without reference to the UNHCR,
 including several who had been already approved for the U.S.
 refugee program. The UNHCR expressed its concern to the
 Yugoslav Government about these returns, as well as about the
 absence of procedural or legal safeguards during the Yugoslav
 prescreening" process. Also of concern were credible reports
 that refugees were beaten, some of them seriously, by Yugoslav
 police.
 At year's end, nearly 600,000 persons had been displaced by
 ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia. They were predominantly ethnic
 Serbs and Croats from contested areas of Croatia and Bosnia-
 Herzegovina but also included ethnic Hungarians and other
 minorities fleeing towns and villages where another ethnic
 group had secured a dominant position. An estimated 40,000
 Yugoslav citizens, mostly ethnic Croats and Hungarians, were
 estimated to have taken refuge in Hungary. The rest of the
 600,000 displaced persons remained within Yugoslav borders.
 The ICRC and the UNHCR assisted governments of the republics in
 providing for these persons, over two-
 thirds of whom are women and children.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 All six constituent republics were headed by leaders elected in
 republic-level multiparty elections held in 1990. International
 observers found all of these elections, with the exception of
 those in Serbia, to have been consistent generally with
 democratic rules and procedures. In Serbia, Croatia, and
 Montenegro, the republic presidents held extensive executive
 power. In Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia, power-
 sharing among ethnic groups or with the legislature made for a
 more diffused decisionmaking process. Serbs in Croatia and
 Bosnia-Herzegovina declared autonomous enclaves independent of
 the republics.
 Abusing the 1974 constitutional provision giving the autonomous
 provinces an equal voice in the collective Presidency, Serbia
 installed its own choices to represent Kosovo and Vojvodina and
 used these votes, together with the regular support of
 Montenegro, to exercise a decisive blocking role in the
 Presidency. The Serbian-led bloc in the Presidency sought in
 May to deny Croatian representative Stipe Mesic his turn as the
 head of the rotating Presidency. Under intense domestic and
 international pressure, Mesic was finally seated. After the
 opening of the armed conflict, Slovenia and Croatia walked out
 of the Presidency. Mesic declared several months later that
 the JNA was acting in Croatia not at the behest of the
 Presidency but on its own and that a de facto coup had taken
 place. In October the Serbian-led bloc created a rump
 Presidency by altering procedural rules concerning quorums and
 the number of votes required for decisionmaking. The Croatian,
 Slovenian, Bosnia-Herzegovinian, and Macedonian representatives
 
 
 1321
 YUGOSLAVIA
 refused to participate in the rump Presidency and denied its
 legitimacy, as did Federal Prime Minister Markovic and a number
 of foreign governments. In December Mesic resigned as President
 of the Federal Presidency, and in a separate action Markovic
 resigned as Federal Prime Minister.
 Although there is legal equality of the sexes under Yugoslav
 law, informal and customary barriers exist to women's
 participation in politics. There is less female participation
 in the leadership of the governments of the new republics than
 existed under the federal regime.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Over 24 human rights organizations are registered at the
 federal and republic levels. Some are considered political
 parties; many doncentrate on specific ethnic or minority rights
 issues. According to Yugoslav human rights leaders, the
 activities of these groups in 1991 suffered not so much due to
 government repression as to problems related to the breakdown
 of communications between the republics and to personal
 financial hardships as a result of the Yugoslav economic
 collapse. In the latter part of the year, as human rights
 groups in Serbia became increasingly identified with the
 antiwar movement, pressures against them increased. Several
 antiwar and human rights activists were told that military
 mobilization notices had been issued to them, and at least one
 person was actually "selectively" conscripted. There were also
 instances of death threats and vandalism against individuals
 and facilities, which went unpunished by the Serbian police.
 Federal and republic authorities generally accepted and often
 welcomed investigations by international human rights groups.
 A rapporteur mission from the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe arrived in Yugoslavia in December and
 traveled throughout the country, meeting with federal and
 republic-level officials as well as opposition and human rights
 figures. They sought the assistance of the ICRC in dealing
 with displaced persons and cooperated in ICRC prison visits to
 political prisoners. After initial reluctance, the Serbian
 government and the JNA accepted the European Community's
 Observer Missions in Yugoslavia, and the Croatian President
 repeatedly pledged that he would welcome international
 monitoring and implementation of guarantees for Serbs living in
 Croatia.
 Several governments of republics established human rights
 offices; Croatia's parliamentary committee for human rights was
 increasingly active. These governments, sensitive to criticism
 of their human rights records, accused human rights advocates
 of disloyalty for questioning official commitment to human
 rights. Ethnic Albanian human rights activists in Kosovo are
 routinely harassed by police.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Federal Constitution of 1974 provided that each of the six
 "nations" of Yugoslavia--Serbian, Croatian, Slovene, Muslim,
 Macedonian, and Montenegrin--should be the majority nation in
 its republic. It also provided for two autonomous provinces
 within the republic of Serbia--Kosbvo and Vojvodina--in which
 the Albanian, Hungarian, and other minorities would enjoy broad
 
 
 1322-
 YUGOSLAVIA
 individual and group rights. In Kosovo where the Albanians
 totaled more than 90 percent of the population, Albanians
 controlled the Communist party and government. In Vojvodina
 Hungarians and Romanians were anong the minorities with the
 right to have schools in their languages, as well as their
 newspapers, cultural associations, and radio programs.
 Since 1989 the Serbian republic's policy has been to take away
 the powers of the Kosovo government from the Albanians and to
 assert Serbian domination over all aspects of life. This policy
 has led to unrestrained discrimination against Albanians in
 every area, including medical care and social services,
 employment, and education. In 1991 at least 430 professors and
 othen professional staff were dismissed from Pristina University
 on a variety of pretexts, including charges of using the
 Albanian language for official work. Most of Kosovo's
 Albanian-language primary and secondary schools were closed
 because Albanian teachers (who are mostly Muslim) refused to
 implement the Serbian republic's curriculum, which mandates the
 teaching of Serbian and Christian Orthodox cultural themes. At
 least 6,000 Albanian teachers have been fired for this refusal.
 Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and Montenegro also suffered
 discrimination in education and political expression. Albanian
 human rights activists claimed that scores of Albanian youths
 serving in the JNA died under unexplained and suspicious
 circumstances in 1991.
 The rights of ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina came under pressure
 from Serbian authorities who denounced ethnic Hungarian
 publications and political groups as "anti-Serb." The
 publication of the Hungarian-language weekly Magyar Szo was in
 question, and Hungarian-language radio programs on Novi Sad
 radio were canceled. In August Serbia introduced a new language
 law which gave the Serbian government added power to restrict
 the use of minority languages, including Hungarian and Albanian.
 Reports of discrimination against Serbian residents of Croatia
 increased in 1991. Ethnic Serbs working at nongovernmental
 jobs who refused to sign loyalty oaths to Croatia were often
 fired. Vandalism and violence against Serbs and their property
 in Croatia also increased. Although Croatian authorities
 investigated many such incidents and the state insurance company
 paid claims on them, culprits were almost never identified and
 punished. The Croatian government also imposed special, higher
 taxes on property in Croatia owned by residents of Serbia, while
 properties and businesses in Serbia owned by Croats and Slovenes
 were seized and their assets frozen. There were allegation of
 mass dismissals of Serbs in Croatia on ethnic grounds; although
 some dismissals did appear to have occurred on ethnic grounds,
 Croatian authorities claimed that in most cases they were for
 cause or were due to the economic downturn. In December the
 Croatian parliament passed a sweeping law granting increased
 autonomy to communities of ethnic minorities in Croatia;
 implementation of that law, however, was in large part
 impossible due to the war and the loss of Croatian governmental
 control over the affected areas.
 Gypsies have complained that the rights extended to other
 minorities have not been extended to them. Gypsies in
 Yugoslavia do appear to suffer discrimination in employment,
 social services, and education. There is a Gypsy cultural
 organization, and the president of the World Romany Federation
 is a Yugoslav Gypsy. In Macedonia, there is a Gypsy political
 party with one representative in the legislature.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Federal Constitution provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex. However, increasing rates of unemployment
 throughout Yugoslavia and insufficient social welfare programs
 due to the economic crisis affected women disproportionately.
 Increasing public attention is being paid to the problem of
 violence against women. Hotlines operating a few hours a day
 exist for battered women in major Yugoslav cities. Legal
 penalties for spouse abuse are the same as those for assault on
 other persons, but the abused spouse must file a complaint, and
 this is seldom done. There are feminist groups in the larger
 cities of Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia campaigning for
 improvement in women's rights.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers,'except military personnel, are entitled to form or
 join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization.
 National statistics for 1991 on the size of the organized work
 force are not reliable. In the past, the Federal Government
 claimed that the majority of the work force was enrolled in the
 formal trade union system, with dues being automatically
 deducted from workers' salaries. Workers are no longer formally
 obligated to register with and pay dues to the official unions.
 However, many do so because of the advantages of some material
 benefits and the pressure to conform.
 Given the breakdown of the federal system, the national labor
 federation, the Council of Independent Trade Unions of
 Yugoslavia (CITUY), has increasingly become an empty shell as a
 federal body. While it is organized by republic and by industry
 and in theory each republic and autonomous province has two
 seats on the Federal Council of the CITUY, Croatia and Slovenia
 no longer send representatives. Just as the federal structure
 has come increasingly under Serbian domination, the CITUY has
 grown close to the Serbian government and the Socialist Party
 of Serbia.
 New trade unions were formed in 1991 as the centralized national
 federation structure eroded. Workers, both in blue-collar and
 white-collar workplaces, left the progovernment CITUY or its
 successor republic-level organizations and formed independent
 local and republic trade unions, particularly in Slovenia,
 Croatia, and Serbia. In July a group of independent workers
 announced the formation of a trade union central called the
 Independent Branch Trade Unions of Serbia (IBTUS), better known
 as Nezavisnost (Independence), which includes independent
 teamsters, journalists, metalworkers, university workers,
 teachers, and others who left the Council of Independent Trade
 Unions of Serbia. Individual managers and enterprises often
 coerced or fired workers attempting to participate in such
 organizing activities. Nezavisnost President Bronislav Canak,
 a journalist at Belgrade Radio-Television, was threatened with
 suspension from his job, and about 25 other Nezavisnost
 activists were fired from other enterprises for their union
 activities.
 In Kosovo it is difficult to distinguish between discrimination
 against an ethnic group and against a trade union. Although
 the Federal Government formally recognized the Independent
 Trade Unions of Kosovo (ITUK) in May, the new organization
 continued to face huge barriers at the local level in
 representing a work force that suffered from official repression
 
 
 1324
 YUGOSLAVIA
 and repeated mass dismissals on ethnic grounds. Serbian
 "special measures" have generally included suspension of
 workers' councils and elimination, or at least severe
 restriction, of the right of workers to engage in normal trade
 union activities. ITUK officials and activities have frequently
 been subject to harassment by the authorities. For example, in
 September two ITUK officials were sentenced to 60 days in
 prison, in part for trade union activities. It was estimated
 in October that some 50,000 Kosovo Albanian families were
 without a wage earner and that total dismissals of Albanian
 workers exceeded 75,000.
 The right to strike is recognized and was widely exercised
 throughout Yugoslavia. Some 95 percent of strikes in Serbia
 were said to be legally organized, that is, in compliance with
 the Serbian law which requires a 30-day notification and limits
 strike activities to the affected enterprise.
 In June some 45,000 metalworkers in Bosnia-Herzegovina walked
 off their jobs to demand payment of guaranteed wages and tax
 relief for ailing industries. They were later joined in
 solidarity strikes by other metalworkers (130,000) and some
 150,000 in construction, transportation, and woodworking
 industries, as well as by 35,000 teachers. Their protest ended
 following government promises of salary support and economic
 changes.
 The CITUY, which abandoned the Moscow-dominated World Federation
 of Trade Unions decades ago, has observer status in the World
 Confederation of Labor and has applied for membership in the
 European Trade Union Confederation. The new republic
 federations, particularly in Slovenia and Croatia, state they
 no longer wish to have federal organizations represent them
 internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Western-style collective bargaining does not yet exist in
 Yugoslavia. A 1989 law on labor relations introduced the
 concept of "collective agreements" to be negotiated between the
 unions and the semiofficial Chambers of Economy, but unions
 found it difficult to identify the authorities with management
 responsibility for negotiating contracts. Questions persist as
 to the enforcement of such contracts or agreements, property
 ownership, and the independence of management. Wages are set
 generally at the factory or enterprise level by workers'
 councils representing management and labor. Each job is graded
 by "points" and salaries arranged hierarchically. Protection
 for unions is provided by both federal and republic laws,
 which, however, have not caught up with the recent changes.
 Yugoslavia is now in transition from its old system of "official
 unions" to a mixed one in which new independent groups of
 workers exist alongside the old "reformed" organizations.
 Ethnically based dismissals and persecution of union activists
 remain problems.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Federal Constitution prohibits forced labor, and this
 prohibition appears to be respected.
 
 
 1325
 YUGOSLAVIA
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The minimum age for child labor is 16, although in village and
 farm communities, younger children often assist with family
 agricultural obligations. Enforcement is carried out by the
 Federal and republic Secretariats for Labor, Health, and Social
 Policy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are guaranteed by federal law, but there were
 many instances in 1991 in which workers were not paid their
 wages on time or in full and waited several months before
 receiving their salaries. These arrearages occurred frequently
 in both the private and public sectors. The official workweek
 is listed as 42 hours. During the economic slowdown in 1991,
 however, a number of enterprises, actually operated for fewer
 hours. Enterprise work forces are also often divided into "A"
 and "B" lists and "platooned" on a 2-week schedule in order to
 reduce costs. There are generous sick leave and vacation
 benefits.
 Yugoslavia has extensive federal and republic laws and
 regulations on occupational health and safety. Enforcement of
 work safety rules, however, is lax.
