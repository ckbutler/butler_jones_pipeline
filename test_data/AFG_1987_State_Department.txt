 AFGHANISTAN
 In December 1979, Soviet military forces invaded
 Afghanistan--called the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan
 (DRA) until the'end of 1987, and installed Babrak Karmal as
 new state and party leader. The Soviet invasion came in the
 wake of growing popular opposition to the regime, generated by
 its brutal policies.  In May 1986, the Soviets replaced Karmal
 with a new-leader, former secret police thief Najibullah, in
 appare'nt'frustration over Kakmal's failure to subdue'armed
 opposition to his regime, notwithstanding the support of some
 120,DOO Soviet troops-and large amounts of Soviet aid.
 Fighting has increased sinceNajt]3bllah's assumption of power,
 despfte h putative cease-fire declared by the regime. Party
 factionalism has also increased, and civil administration
 remains ineffective. In an attempt to convince the world that
 it was not a Cofuunist regime, the name.of the country was
 chiged to the "Republic of Afghanistan" (RA) in December.
 The war has generated over 5 million refugees, one'third of
 the p6pulation of Afghanistan before the invasion, who now
 live in camps in Pakistan and Iran, and the number is
 increasing. International observers estimate that about 1
 million Afghans have died'as a direct consequence of the
 Soviet invasion and occupation.
 Moscow has pursued a policy of Sovietization of those areas
 under Soviet/DRA control. In addition to placing thousands of
 advisers in the regime structure, the Soviet Union has taken
 thousands of Afghan children--many of them against their
 parents' wishes or without their knowledge--to the Soviet
 Union for political indoctrination in values that are alien to
 the 4fghan people's Islamic heritage.
 During 1987,Soviet and DRA forces, under pressure of attacks
 by an increasingly effective Afghan resistance, abandoned some
 areas and ceased offensive operations in others. Some Afghan
 refugees have begun to repopulate a few of these areas,
 reconstituting farmland under mujahidin protection.
 Afghanistan's economic potential, including much of its
 agriculturdl infrastructure, has been shattered by the war.
 During 1987 in particular, Soviet reprisal raids and
 depopulation campaigns, some of them against the few areas
 which had previously escaped large-scale devastation, led to
 damage that will require a long time to repair.
 In 1987 there was no independent judiciary or any legal code
 according rights to the individual. The most feared and
 consistent violator of human rights within the regime remains
 the secret police, formerly known as KHAD but renamed the
 Ministry of State Security (WAD). More than 25,000 Afghans
 work for the Ministry, supervised by KGB advisers. The
 regime s principal tools of control and manipulation are
 surveillance, imprisonment, interrogation, torture, and
 execution.
 The human rights situation in 1987 deteriorated further under
 the Najibullah regime, punctuated by intensified Soviet/DRA
 military pressure on civilians and increased factional
 fighting. Improvement of the human rights environment in
 Afghanistan depends fundamentally on a total withdrawal of
 Soviet forces. Only when the occupying force is removed can
 Afghanistan's sovereignty be restored and the Afghan people
 permitted to exercise true self-determination.

 AFGHANISTAN
 On November 30, a Loya Jirgah (or Grand Council), controlled
 by the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA),
 adopted and enacted a new Constitution. Articles in it accord
 Afghan citizens basic rights and freedoms, including the
 freedoms of worship, assembly, and expression. The
 Constitution also outlaws torture and "punishment incompatible
 with human dignity." There is no reason to believe that these
 rights and freedoms will be implemented in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HU4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected
 regime opponents continued to be commonplace in 1987  Reports
 from prison inmates released in 1987 and Afghan staff members
 at prison facilities tell of executions in DRA prisons,
 including Pul-i-Charkhi, Shashdarak, and a WAD prison in the
 Darulaman section of Kabul. A mullah from Kandahar was said
 to have been executed on June 8 in Kabul's Shashdarak prison.
 The mullah rebortedly had been posing as a friend of the regime
 but, in fact, was working secretly with the mujahidin in the
 Kandahar area. According to many reports many prisoners died
 as a result of inadequate diet, corporal punishment, and
 torture. Of eight foreign national prisoners released in 1987,
 four were diagnosed as insane by competent medical authorities,
 and one died within days of his release. Their condition was
 attributed to torture and inadequate diet. There have been
 reports that Soviet and DRA forces as well as mujahidin have
 occasionally executed prisoneis in the field. On February 1,
 Soviet troops executed eight mujahidin prisoners in the
 Panjshir Valley. In January DRA troops reportedly executed
 captured mujahidin in Logar province. The mujahidin generally
 interrogate and release captured Kabul regime enlisted men and
 hold some captured Soviet personnel as prisoners; however,
 some killings of captured Soviets have been reported.
 Allegations of mujahidin assassinations of Soviet personnel
 and DRA officials continue. Many of the political killings
 reported in Kabul in 1987 appeared to result from factional
 in-fighting within the ruling PDPA.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances continued to be common in areas under regime
 control throughout 1987. In typical cases, family members
 learn eventually through informal means of the fate of
 relatives who disappear. In 1987 the regime released some
 prisoners and detainees who, in some cases, were able to
 provide information to families on their missing relatives.
 In October several hundred supporters of former president
 Babrak Karmal were arrested in the course of a purge; their
 fate is not known. In some cases, unexplained disappearance
 of young males is due to impressment into military service
 (see Section l.d.). In other cases, Afghans are arrested and
 imprisoned or summarily executed for political offenses or
 because they are relatives of mujahidin. Early in 1987, a
 group of nonpartisan Afghans, with whom the regime had sought
 to develop a dialog, called on it to release political
 prisoners, which the group estimated to number 40,000. Some
 persons disappear as a result of the action of mujahidin, who
 frequently abduct or capture regime military and civilian
 cadre and suspected regime collaborators.

 AFGHANISTAN
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 STreatmen  or Punishment
 Regime authorities frequently employ torture to punish or to
 extract information or confessions. The policy is widespread,
 indicating that it has official sanction. Victims often claim
 that Soviet officials monitor and indirectly control the
 torture sessions. Torture techniques include both physical
 and psychological abuse. Use of electric shock to sensitive
 parts of the body, immersion in water, and beatings are common
 forms of physical abuse reported by victims and witnesses.
 Threats or abuse against family members and prolonged sleep
 deprivation are typical forms of psychological abuse.
 Persistent reports describe cases of mental disturbances
 induced by torture in regime prisons. On July 13-a foreign
 diplomat witnessed the torture of a man at the Kabul residence
 of a major regime military commander. The victim was suspended
 from a tree and beaten for over an hour until he became
 unconscious.
 Political prisoners are usually not segregated from criminal
 or mentally ill prisoners. Medical care is. commonly described
 as minifnal at Pul-i-Charkhi-where prisoners are generally
 required towait at least a month before being allowed access
 to the medical staff.
 In its 1987-Report, Amnesty International (AI) reported that
 it had written. in.September 1986 to the .President of the
 Reyolvtionary-Council.to express its concern about persistent
 allegationp of torture in Afghanistan, allegations which were
 described in detail in an AI special report, "Afghanistan:
 Tortuie of Political Prisoners," published on November 19,
 1986. The report contained testimony from former political
 prisoners who stated that they had been tortured by KHAD
 agents,-and quoted some former.prisoners who said that Soviet
 personnel had been present when they were tortured. AI also
 noted that it had written to DRA regime leaders in 1986,
 urging the authorities to implement recommendations for the
 prevention of torture. The ,RA did not reply. AI said it had
 also written to the President of the Soviet Union in 1986,
 urging the SovietGovernment to investigate the allegations of
 involvement of Soviet personnel in torture in Afghanistan.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There are no legal safeguards to prevent arbitrary arrest or
 detention. -Afghals in areas controlled by the regime face
 unwarranted seizure by security personnel. Often, detainees
 are either not told of the charges against them before trial
 or are simply not brought to trial.- Arrest warrants are not
 issued, nor is the right to judicial determination of the
 legality of detention respected. Detainees typically are held
 incommunicado, sometimes for years. Although bail is sometimes
 granted, it is not a standard feature of the regime's legal
 procedures. Formal charges may come only after months of
 interrogation.
 Instances of arbitrary detention increased markedly in 1987,
 principally as a result of the impressment of civilians into
 military service in Kabul and, to a lesser extent, in other
 regime-controlled cities, notably Mazar-i-Sharif. Kabul
 regime military and secret police cadre continue to impress
 largenumbers of underage boys into the military, taking them
 from the street and sometimes from classrooms and homes.
 Regime authorities do not inform the parents of the young men
 
 
 1098
 AFGHANISTAN
 of their impressment. In 1987 the regime impressed into
 military service some of the few refugees who returned to
 Afghanistan :in response to the regime's so-called national
 reconciliation appeal. Relatives of soldiers who desert are
 often arrested by the 'regime to punish the deserters and to
 deter others from deserting.
 Arrests of regime adversaries, especially those who oppose
 party leader Najibullah, were common in 1987. -Approximately
 200 Karmal supporters were arrested in Kabul in October, many
 of them university students. The regime also imprisoned a
 number of critics of i-ts "ational reconciliation" policy,
 including some PDPA members.
 Mujahidin occasionally kidnaped regime civilian and military
 cadre. There were reliable reports that the mujahidin
 kidnaped coal miners in one incident, requiring them to help
 build tunnel complexes in the mountains. Another report
 claimed that the mujahidin kidnaped a physician in Kunduz and
 later executed him, apparently as a consequence of his refusal
 to treat wounded mujahidin.
 During October the regime ordered 1,800 youths from various
 educational institutions in Kabul to go to Kandahar to
 participate in construction work. The regime media reported
 that 2,100 Kabul youth were required to spend 45 days working
 on construction projects in the Kabul area and at the Kokcha
 irrigation project in the far north. According to parents of
 the youths, the requirement amounted to virtual forced labor
 as they were paid one-tenth of what laborers are normally paid.
 Afghan children continue to be taken to the Soviet Union for
 long-term training and indoctrination, sometimes without their
 parents' consent or even knowledge. Some sources estimate
 that at least 2,000 children a year since 1984 have been taken
 to the Soviet Union under this arrangement.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All courts are controlled by the PDPA. Laws governing their
 organization and jurisdiction cited as a first priority the
 protection of the "revolution." As a consequence, plaintiffs
 may be denied their legal rights because of charges regarding
 their political beliefs. Most persons accused of nonpolitical
 crimes are tried in the civil court system under the norms of
 preinvasion judicial codes. Those political detainees who are
 charged and brought to trial are usually arraigned on
 allegations of treason, espionage, or terrorism, and are tried
 -nd sentenced in secret. As a rule, they must provide their
 own defense without benefit of counsel. Death sentences
 generally are carried out quickly after a perfunctory review
 by the ruling Revolutionary Council, which also is controlled
 by the PDPA. There was no mechanism to appeal a death
 sentence endorsed by the Revolutionary Council. According to
 the Constitution, death sentences are executed after the
 approval of the President. In areas not controlled by the
 regime, civil and criminal cases are tried by Islamic judges
 (gazis) and community elders under Islamic, or "shari'a," law
 and according to Afghan custom.
 No estimate is available on the number of political prisoners
 held by the Kabul regime; in its 1987 Report, AI referred to
 the continued imprisonment of "thousands of political
 prisoners," and said that some of them were imprisoned after
 political trials that did not conform to international
 
 
 1094
 AFGHANISTAN
 standards. . The mujahidin are nob knoiqn to hold political
 prisoners, -although they do detain Soviet and regime personnel
 for extended periods. In 1987 the DRA released some political
 prisoners;...,any were Communists- jailed fn factional disputes;
 few prominent opponents of the regime were released. Most of,
 those released who were of military age were *imediately
 impressed into Kabul's army and sent into battle.
 f.- Arbitrary InterTerence With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Kabul regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right to privacy. Civilian areas are frequently
 cordoned off and subject to search, often by Soviet troops.
 Afghas- complain that regime and Soviet forces routinely
 confiscate ptoperty; ifluding homes. House-to-house'searches
 frequently are carried out in-predawn hburs. Telephones are
 routinely tapped and correspondence mohitored. Citizens are
 warned not-.to listen to foreign broadcasts 6xcept from states
 friendly to the regime....
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 e      -                           ,
 Kabul regime, and Soviet actions in Afghanistanhaveentailed
 violationsiof international humanitarian law:on a broad scale,
 including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary
 interoational law. for the protectibft of civilians which
 proscribe indiscriminate attacks,'murder and execuioh,
 mutilation, and attacks'on'ciilianbi the'1925 Gen6va Prdtocol
 andthe 1972-Biological-and Toxic Weapdns Conizentions; the
 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property
 during- armed!conflict; and prohibitions agains!"torture and
 othertcruel-treatment or puniShment,:including Article 7"of
 the International Covenant on Civil and Plitical Rights.
 In 1987, as in the past, Soviet and-DRA forces-launched
 numerous attacks against civilian targets, resulting in
 massive destruction of homes, entire' i3lages, croplands, and
 infrastructure as well as death and injuries to uncounted
 numbers-of civilians. Throughout the year theie were reprisal
 attacks.'agaidst civilian populations suspected-of sympathizing
 with-.the mujahidin. Many-Afghans were maimed by antipersonnel
 mines, grenades, and devices specifically designed to injure
 but not kill, including explosive devices reportedly disguised
 to look like toys. There were also civilian casualties
 resulting from the deployment of a napalm-like substance
 against the resistance. Care for the injured in understaffed,
 ill-supplied, and unhygienic facilities was inadequate, and
 many of the injured sought medical assistance in Pakistan.
 The number of refugees from the countryside fleeing to Kabul
 appeared tQ increase in 1987 in apparent response to greater
 Soviet aerial and artillery bombardment.
 A number of Afghan sources reported that Soviet and,
 occasionally, DRA forces employed chemical and other
 prohibited weapons in 1987. It was reported that Soviet
 forces used lethal chemical weapons against resistance forces
 lodged in caves in Paktia province in June, and a chemical or
 toxic weapon against mujahidin in the Randza Valley in
 August. Mujahidin casualties during the Paktia fighting in
 June reportedly exhibited severe burns from a napalm-like
 substance.
 Mujahidin actions in 1987 also resulted in loss of life and
 injuries among civilians. The mujahidin were believed
 
 
 1095
 AFGHANISTAN
 responsible for bomb attacks in Jalalabad and Kabul which
 resulted in significant civilian casualties. Mujahidin rocket
 attacks against Kabul and other regime-controlled cities
 inevitably took a toll among civilians.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The regime tolerates no criticism of the Soviet Union in the
 public media, and private criticism can result in detention
 and arrest. There is no academic freedom. All media are
 owned and controlled by the regime and tightly supervised by
 Soviet officials. The press, radio, and television are used
 exclusively to convey regime policy and the Soviet
 interpretation of world events. Soviet publications, films
 and television are widely available in local languages to
 reinforce those views. In the latter half of 1987, in an
 unusual departure, the regime media published divergent views
 and proposals by various Afghans with regard to the draft
 constitution in an attempt to suggest a consensual drafting
 process.   Unlicensed import and sale of non-Soviet video and
 audio tapes, magazines, books, and posters are forbidden
 though this ban is generslly ineffective. Western radio
 broadcasts in local languages are frequently jammed, although
 some programs do get through to Afghan listeners.
 Afghans are guarded in their conversations lest antiregime or
 anti-Soviet comments be reported to the secret police. In
 early September, citizens in Herat city demonstrated at the
 PDPA committee headquarters, shouting antiregime and anti-
 Soviet slogans in protest over the regime killing of the son
 of a prominent Herat resident. Many of the group were
 arrested and taken to Kabul where, according to a relative,
 they underwent WAD interrogation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in
 areas controlled by the regime. A party decree passed by the
 Revolutionary Council in 1987 supposedly provided a framework
 for expression of political views at variance with the views
 of the ruling PDPA, but the party continues to set the bounds
 for acceptable dissent. The regime regularly stages so-called
 "spontaneous* gatherings to convey the impression of popular
 support, including mass demonstrations at diplomatic missions.
 Unauthorized peaceful assemblies are dealt with forcefully.
 Parents demonstrating for the release of their sons impressed
 into the DRA military were dispersed with gunfire in an
 incident in the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul in the
 summer of 1987.
 Workers have been threatened with loss of jobs or imprisonment
 for refusal to join party organizations. In Shebergan in Balkh
 province, factory workers were arrested after they selected
 ousted state and party leader Babrak Karmal as their delegate
 to a national PDPA conference. Parents have been warned that
 their children would be forced out of sohool if they refused
 to join official youth organizations. Large numbers of people
 from the upper and middle classes fled the country because of
 severe restrictions on political and social activity.
 Labor has no right to organize in any meaningful fashion.
 State-sponsored trade associations and unions of workers and
 peasants are closely modeled after those in the Soviet Union.
 
 
 1096
 AFGHANISTAN
 The few remaining prerevolutionary labor and trade
 organizations are under strong pressure to merge with the
 ruling PDPA. The Central Committee of Afghan Trade Unions,
 with a claimed membership of 150,000 workers, is an affiliate
 of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan .is an Islamic nation. Sunnis predominate, though
 there is an important Shi'a minority primarily concentrated in
 the Hazarajat region in central Afghanistan. Small enclaves
 of Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews traditionally have lived peacefully
 alongside their Muslim neighbors.
 Since the 1978 coup, the regime has sought, with marginal
 success, to supervise strictly all religious organizations.
 Regime policy pronouncements are routinely given the sanction
 of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The regime has taken a
 series of steps to try to win support-fromMuslims. In 1987,
 for example, the DRA announced that the State would provide
 assistance to mosque construction, establish an Islamic
 research center, provide monthly stipends to selected -ullahs,
 and sponsor an "international Koranic reading competition."
 Afghans distinguish sharply between traditional mullahs and
 "regime mullahs." Kandahar-residents report that most of the
 city's remaining residents send their children to local
 mosques where they receive education not directed by the
 regime. Costs are met by the parents and the community, with
 no assistance from the regime. Kabul regime and Soviet
 forces, particularly in the course of reprisal raids against
 towns and villages, have caused extensive damage to mosques.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely restricted by the war.
 Soviet and DRA forces attempted to block the movement of
 refugees out of areas of combat during Soviet military
 operations in March in Kunduz and Takhar provinces, and in
 August in northern Kabul province. Travelers are at risk of
 being caught in Soviet-mujahidin clashes. Buses and other
 vehicles are sometimes attacked by Soviet -and DRA helicopter
 gunships. Traffic on the Bamiyan road reportedly moves only
 at night due to the Soviet practice of regarding any daytime
 traffic on the road as mujahidin and attacking it. At
 Khovoshi in Logar province, a Soviet helicopter attacked a
 civilian bus on September 22, killing 16 and wounding 17.
 Civilian travelers also encounter frequent checkpoints or
 roadblocks manned by Soviet troops, regime forces, mujahidin
 or, occasionally, by bandits. Travelers regularly recount
 having to,43ibe Soviet checkpoint personnel with cash or
 drugs. Mujdhidin often exact "taxes" from travelers.
 The regime severely curtails foreign travel by Afghans under
 its control. A passport typically must be purchased with
 bribes s6metimes ranging as high as $1,000. The regime seizes
 the property of anyone who fails to return after 1 year.
 Pilgrims to Mecca and holy places in Iraq are carefully
 screened and issued travel documents valid only for those
 destinations.
 Overland emigration is extremely dangerous because of
 indiscriminate Soviet and regime attacks. In October a column
 of nomads making a traditional seasonal migration from western
 Kabul province to-Nangarhar came under fire from Soviet
 
 
 1097
 AFGHANISTAN
 positions near Paghman. Extensive Soviet and regime mining of
 principal overland routes and passes imposes even greater risks
 to refugees. Despite these hazards, Afghans continue to flee
 to Pakistan and Iran, swelling the refugee populations in those
 two countries to over 5 million. These outflows continued
 throughout 1987 as a result of scorched earth tactics and
 deliberate attacks on populated areas by Soviet and DRA forces.
 The regime estimates that over 100,000 Afghans have returned to
 Afghanistan in response to its appeal to repatriate. No
 international organization regards this figure as credible.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the current regime, citizens have no right to change
 their government. Afghanistan is a totalitarian state under
 the control of the PDPA, which is kept in power by the Soviet
 Union. The ruling PDPA is modeled closely on the Soviet
 Communist Party. Soviet military and civilian advisors sit in
 virtually all regime offices and make or approve all
 significant decisions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime has continued to resist efforts by international
 humanitarian organizations to investigate human rights
 practices in Afghanistan. In apparent reaction to the
 international outcry regarding human rights abuses, the regime
 has sought to manipulate respected institutions and foreign
 journalists. In January the DRA Prime Minister granted the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) permission to
 visit all persons detained in Afghanistan. At the same time,
 the ICRC also launched a major program of medical assistance
 in Kabul. Negotiations on the terms for ICRC registration of,
 and visits to, prisoners at Pul-i-Charkhi prison, however,
 broke down in May, when the ICRC was unable to continue the
 visits according to its traditional criteria. As of late
 1987, the authorities continued to block ICRC access to
 prisoners, while claiming in international forums that they
 were cooperating with international organizations.
 The regime invited the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan
 to visit in August. Although the Special Rapporteur portrayed
 regime authorities as cooperative, critics point out that
 during a 10-day visit he was able to interview only four
 prisoners, leading to charges of manipulation by authorities.
 In addition, he was denied permission to go to Kandahar, an
 area where Soviet reprisal strikes against civilian settlements
 have been particularly numerous. Beginning in late 1986 and
 continuing through 1987, the regime was host to over 100
 foreign journalists. For the most part, the journalists were
 confined to tightly planned itineraries; few, if any, were
 permitted to interview prisoners or view detainees, though
 many pressed for permission.
 Regime and Soviet actions in regard to journalists who sought
 to report independently on developments in Afghanistan
 continued to be severe. In April a West German team narrowly
 escaped injury or death when Soviet forces ambushed them and
 their mujahidin escorts in Logar. Two American journalists
 were killed in an ambush by Soviet/regime forces in early
 
 
 1098
 AFGHANISTAN
 bctober, according to an eyewitness report. At the end of
 1987, at least two West European journalists were being held
 by the regime.
 Mujahidin periodically have permitted the ICRC and journalists
 to visit prisoners under their control, particularly Soviet
 prisoners. Recently, some mujahidin commanders have offered
 to allow the ICRC access to prisoners in their custody in
 return for ICRC access to prisoners held by the regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond the home
 and field is limited by traditional beliefs, customs, and
 religious practices. In areas under resistance control, the
 role of women follows traditional lines. The social position
 of some women, generally those associated with the PDPA, has
 improved somewhat in Kabul and other regime-controlled cities.
 Access of young women to higher education has increased in
 Kabul in the wake of the loss of large numbers of young men to
 conscription into the DRA military, joining up with the
 mujahidin, or refugee flight. For similar reasons, the role
 of women in some nontraditional occupations such as-banking,
 television, and radio, and the civil service has increased.
 Few women, however, hold responsible, decision-making
 positions. The only woman in the ruling PDPA politburo and
 Revolutionary Council was removed in 1987.
 The regime in some cases mirrored and in other instances
 sought to exploit traditional ethnic rivalries for its
 purposes. Several thousand Uzbek troops from northern
 Afghanistan were sent to Kandahar in late summer to garrison
 the largely Pushtun and proresistance city. The troops,
 according to Kandahar residents, have behaved aggressively
 against their traditional ethnic rivals. Ethnic Turkmen and
 Hazaras in Kabul complain that they are not trusted by the
 regime and are subjected to strict surveillance in their
 business dealings, particularly with foreign firms.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Due to the current situation in Afghanistan, information on
 the conditions of-labor is not available.
