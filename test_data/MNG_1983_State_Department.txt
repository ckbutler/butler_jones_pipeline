 MONGOLIA*
 Mongolia, or the Mongolian People's Republic, is a rigidly
 controlled communist state almost totally dominated by the
 Soviet Union. Political life is monopolized by the Mongolian
 People's Revolutionary Party, headed by General Secretary
 Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who has held power since the 1950's.
 Mongolian economic and political life is shaped by the Soviet
 Bloc; ninety-five percent of Mongolia's foreign trade is
 conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Soviet
 Union is involved in the exploitation of Mongolia's mineral
 resources, most of which are exported to the U.S.S.R. The
 Mongolian economy remains heavily agricultural with an emphasis
 on live animals and animal products.
 Little information is available concerning the human rights
 practices of Mongolia. Apart from small Western based groups
 of anti-Soviet Kalmuks (whose attitudes toward the Mongolian
 People's Republic are mixed), there are no known domestic or
 emigre Mongolian opposition groups. Much of the information
 available comes from the Mongolian regime. The United States
 does not recognize nor does it have diplomatic relations with
 Mongolia. The few resident diplomats and occasional visitors
 to Mongolia are mainly limited to the capital city of
 Ulaanbaatar. Travel to other parts of the country is
 restricted. It is known, however, that Mongolian life and
 society are tightly controlled. Few Mongolians travel outside
 the Soviet Bloc countries. No political opposition to the
 ruling Communist Party is permitted. Freedoms theoretically
 guaranteed to the individual under the Mongolian Constitution,
 including speech, demonstration, and assembly, can be exercised
 only to "strengthen the socialist state system." In effect,
 individual civil and political liberties do not exist, and
 there is nothing to indicate that this situation is likely to
 change in the foreseeable future. In view of Mongolia's small
 population, the Soviet Union's dominant position is further
 guaranteed by the presence of at least five Soviet combat
 divisions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is no information available concerning unlawful or
 arbitrary deprivation of life for political motives in Mongolia.
 *The United States does not have diplomatic relations with the
 Mongolian People's Republic, and thus does not have direct
 access to information on the situation in Mongolia. Because of
 the closed nature of the society, there was little new
 information in 1983 on human rights practices in Mongolia.
 Much of this report, therefore, is a repeat of previous human
 rights reports, and is necessarily based on information
 obtained over a period of time, extending well before 1983.
 While limited in scope and detail, the information is generally
 indicative of the human rights situation in Mongolia today.

 b. Disappearance
 Though there is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearance in Mongolia, it is noted that high governmental
 officials occasionally disappear from public view and no
 information is released concerning their subsequent fate.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no information available concerning torture or other
 inhuman treatment in Mongolia.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no information available on arbitrary arrest and
 detention in Mongolia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes, written in 1949, specify the
 right of the accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and
 public trial 'except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings
 are permitted in the case of 'crimes against the state.' As
 the civil code places a heavy emphasis on this category of
 crime, and since the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
 controls all legal systems, those accused of such crimes are
 unlikely to receive fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no specific information available concerning
 interference in the private lives of the people by the
 Mongolian authorities. The right to privacy of person, home,
 and correspondence is provided for by the Constitution, but it
 is doubtful that this is honored in practice when it conflicts
 with the interests of the state.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Mongolian Constitution provides for freedom of speech, but
 specifies that the exercise of individual rights must be to
 .strengthen the socialist state system.' Actions which the
 party deems to fall outside this parameter would likely result
 in arrest. Criticism of the party or government is not
 tolerated. Control is exercised through various
 government-controlled organizations, notably the People's
 Control Organization, extending down to the neighborhood
 committee level. The press is state-owned and strictly
 controlled by the Government and serves primarily as a
 propaganda tool. Non-communist foreign media representatives
 are generally not allowed into the country. Academic and
 artistic life is similarly tightly controlled in accordance
 with Government policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are provided for by the
 Constitution, but in practice only Government-authorized
 organizations are permitted to assemble and the only
 demonstrations allowed are carefully orchestrated by Government
 authorities. A wide variety of organizations, including
 professional and trade unions, exist, but all are controlled by
 the central Government to promote its policies.
 C. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in theory, but the current regime
 strictly controls religious activity. Formal religion no
 longer plays a significant part in the lives of most
 
 
 845
 Mongolians. Lamaist Buddhism, which was a central force in
 Mongolian life prior to the establishment of the Communist
 Government, has been reduced to a few showcase monasteries
 occupied by a handful of monks, who serve primarily for
 propaganda and show purposes with tourists. Persons who
 actively practice their religion in Mongolia are not normally
 recruited into the leadership of the party or Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Until recent years, few Mongolians travelled abroad, even to
 the Soviet Union. Foreign travel usually has been permitted
 only for official purposes, but Government sponsored education
 abroad has become increasingly common. With the notable
 exception of a small graduate student exchange with Great
 Britain, the limited foreign travel allowed is almost
 exclusively to Soviet Bloc countries. No Mongolians are known
 to have requested repatriation to Mongolia and there is no
 known emigration from Mongolia except that of recent forced
 emigration of ethnic Chinese.
 All Mongolians over 16 years of age must have internal
 passports and must obtain permission from the Security Bureau
 to travel within the country. Attempts to change jobs or
 residences must be approved by both the Security Bureau and the
 People's Control Organization.
 The 1978 Constitution guarantees the right "to reside in the
 territory" of the Mongolian People's Republic to foreign
 citizens, provided they have "striven for the defense of the
 interests of the working people, for national liberation, and
 for strengthening peace..." Ethnic Chinese have resided in
 Mongolia since the Yuan Dynasty (thirteenth century AD). As
 they did in the 1930's, Mongolian authorities again in May 1983
 began the systematic expulsion of Chinese nationals residing in
 the Mongolian People's Republic. Many of the approximately
 7,000 Chinese nationals in Mongolia were reportedly offered a
 choice between resettlement in the barren northern part of the
 country or expulsion to China. The Mongolian authorities
 claimed the expellees had no formal occupation and/or did not
 abide by Mongolian law, despite the fact many of them had been
 living and working in Mongolia since the 1950's. By late
 September 1983, over 2,000 Chinese had returned to the People's
 Republic of China. Through most of the summer, the expellees
 were reported to have been stripped of their individual
 property by the Mongolian customs authorities before being
 allowed to cross over into China. Although Ulaanbaatar
 rejected China's diplomatic protests on the expulsions, the
 Mongolian People's Republic is reportedly now permitting
 Chinese to leave on a less onerous basis, without confiscation
 of their possessions. The expulsions are nonetheless
 continuing, and the Mongolian authorities appear determined to
 expel or widely disperse the entire Chinese community, mainly
 concentrated in Ulaanbaatar and its suburbs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party does not tolerate
 political groups outside its control. The party is established
 on the Soviet model with a narrow pyramid of power topped by
 Party General Secretary Tsedenbal. Lower ranking members have
 no real ability to influence the decisions of superiors.
 Elections are held at regular intervals, but only one candidate
 is listed for each office; the choice is to vote for him/her or
 cross his/her name out. Many elections result in a 99.9
 percent voter turnout and winning candidates regularly receive
 99.9 percent of the vote. While there is no policy of
 officially stated minority disenfranchisement, there is no
 evidence of religious persons occupying elite party or
 government positions, and only a few members of minorities do
 
 
 846
 so. Similarly, while universal franchise and equal rights for
 women are official policy, in practice few women occupy
 positions of responsibility in the Government or party
 structures, although this number is slowly increasing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Mongolia acceded to the United Nations Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights in 1976. However, the Mongolian regime has
 consistently followed Soviet human rights policy and practice,
 whether or not it is consistent with the Covenant. There have
 been no known opportunities for outside investigators to
 examine human rights practices. It is highly unlikely that
 Mongolian officials would permit such investigation by any
 outside authority or organization. There is no known
 indigenous organization dedicated to the protection of human
 rights in Mongolia. Freedom House, in its 1983 report,
 classified Mongolia as "Not Free."  Amnesty International's
 1983 report did not discuss Mongolia.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 It is impossible to verify the claims of the current regime
 that the life of the average Mongolian has improved when
 compared to conditions before the communist takeover.
 Mongolian Government figures indicate that there were 20.9
 physicians per 10,000 population in 1978 and that the infant
 mortality rate had declined to 49.40 per 1,000 live births in
 1983. Life expectancy at birth rose to 63.6 years in 1980.
 The limited data available from the Mongolian Government
 indicates similar improvements in education, employment, and
 food production. World Bank estimates tend to confirm the
 claims of some improvement in the standard of living.
 Education has been a high priority of Mongolia since the
 mid-1950's. According to Mongolian Government statistics, the
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio increased to 108
 percent in 1978. There is no information on sexual, racial, or
 religious discrimination in education. The adjusted primary
 school enrollment ratio for males was only six points higher
 than for females in 1978. The Government claims universal
 literacy within Mongolia. The seventh five year plan (1981-5)
 continues to encourage the learning of the Russian language in
 the Mongolian educational system.
 The percentage of calories available for consumption relative
 to nutritional needs reached 104 percent in 1977. Gross
 National Product per capita in 1979 was $780.00. Population
 figures in 1983 show 1,809,000 people in Mongolia. The
 population growth rate has slowed slightly to 2.80 percent in
 1983 despite official programs to encourage population increase.
 Despite the substantial rise in the Mongolian standard of
 living over the last fifty years, the country remains extremely
 backward. A majority of the population remains engaged in
 agriculture, primarily herding. National economic growth is
 severely limited by an inefficient and over-centralized
 bureaucracy and a centrally run economy subordinated to the
 Committee for Mutual Economic Assistance, a Soviet dominated
 organization. These combine with a lack of resources, extreme
 geographic isolation, and a severe climate to keep the quality
 of Mongolian life poor by international standards.
