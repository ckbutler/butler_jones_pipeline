 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy headed by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
 leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Opposition parties include the
 Awami League, the Jatiyo Party the Jamaat-E-Islami, and seveial smaller parties.
 The opposition began to boycott Parliament in March, demanding that the Govern-
 ment establish a caretaker government to conduct national elections in early 1996.
 The Home Affairs Ministry controls the police and paramilitary forces which bear
 prmary responsibility for maintaining internal security. The army and paramiitary
 forces are responsible for security in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), where a trib-
 al force has waged a low-level insurgency for 20 years. There were fewer violent in-
 cidents in the CHT in 1994 than in the past. A cease-fire between government forces
 and insurgents generally held throughout the year. Because the Government strictly
 controls access to the CHT, it is not known whether security forces there committed
 abuses in 1994.
 Bangladesh is a poor country; approximately 40 percent of its 122 million people
 exist on incomes insufficient to meet n mmum dily needs. Sixty percent of the
 work force is involved in farming, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of
 the gross domestic product. Efforts to reform the economy have been stymied by po-
 litical stalemate, public sector enterprises, and other entrenched interests.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny many fundamental rights. The Gov-
 ernment's issuance of a warrant for the arrest of Bangladeshi author Taslima
 Nasreem for insulting religious beliefs, and its failure to prosecute those who made
 death threats aqainst her, drew international attention and raised questions about
 the Government s commitment to freedom of expression. The Government continued
 to use national security laws to detain political opponents and other citizens without
 formal charge, although the Government allowedthe Antiterrorism Act to expire on
 November 5. Police routinely use torture and other abuse in interrogating suspects.
 Some victims died in police custody. The Government rarely convicts and punishes
 those responsible for torture or causing unlawful deaths. Violence against women
 remained a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-According to government figures, 64
 persons died while in custody. In cases where post mortems were performed, there
 was no evidence that any prisoner died from maltreatment. However, continual re-
 ports of police abuse and deaths of prisoners indicate that this claim is deceptive
 and masks serious abuse. For example, on March 4, police arrested a truck driver
 in Nishindara and reportedly beat him to death. Eight police officers were sus-
 pended as a result of this incident; however, there is no indication of further punish-
 ment. On November 27, a 21-year-old man died while in police custody (see Section
 1.c.).
 Violence, often resulting in killings, is a feature of the political process. Dem-
 onstrators from all parties, and even within parties, often clash during rallies and
 demonstrations. Violence among student political groups reportedly resulted in 27
 deaths, 1,500 injuries, and the closure of 45 educational institutions. On July 26,
 4 people were killed and over 100 injured at a rally in Chittagong when forces of
 Jamaat-e-Islami clashed with supporters of the All Party Students Unity.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances resulting from gov-
 ernment actions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and crueI, inhuman, or degrading pun-
 ishment, police systematically employ psychological and physical torture andother
 abuse during arrests and interrogations. Torture may consist of threats, beatings,
 and, occasionally, the use of electric shock. On November 27, the police reportedly
 beat to death a 21-year-old male detainee; but official sources alleged that the man
 died of cardiac arrest. The Government has ordered a second autopsy and an inves-
 tigation is under way. In the past, some police officers have been suspended for
 abusing detainees. Nonetheless, a climate of impunity remains a major obstacle to
 ending torture and abuse.
 Most prisons are overcrowded and lack adequate facilities. There are three classes
 of cells: A, B, and C. Common criminals and low-level political workers are generally
 held in C cells which often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food.
 The use of restraining devices on prisoners in these cells is common. Prisoners in
 the C cells reportedly suffer the worst abuses, including beatings or being forced to
 kneel for long periods. Conditions in B and A cells are markedly better, A cells are
 
 
 1207
 reserved for prominent prisoners (including former President Ershad). A govern-
 ment-appinted committee of private citizens monitors prisons monthly but does not
 release its finding.
 Former President Ershad is serving a 20-year sentence. In 1992 his supporters
 fled a writ of habeas orpus in the Su p reme Court asserting that his living condi-
 tions were inhumane ancl that he has been denied proper medical care. The Court
 has not yet rendered judgment. The Government maintains that Ershad receives
 competent medical care and that his condition has improved and is satisfactory.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued to use na-
 tional security legislation to detain citizens without formal charges, though to a less-
 er extent than the past. The two most widely used statutes are the Special Powers
 Act of 1974 (SPA) and the Suppression of Terrorist Offenses Bill of 1992, often
 called the Antiterrorism Act. The Government allowed the Antiterrorism Act to ex-
 pire in November, claiming that the law had achieved its purpose.
 Under the SPA, the Government may detain anyone deemed "a threat to the secu-
 rity of the country" for 30 days. At the end of that time, it must either charge or
 release the detainee. In practice, detainees are sometimes held for longer periods
 without charge. If the Government files charges, detainees have 15 days to appeal
 the detention order to the Home Ministry, which may grant early release.
 After 6 months, a review panel examines detainees. If the Government adequately
 defends its detention order, the detainee remains imprisoned- if not, the detainee
 is released. Detainees are allowed to consult with lawyers while in detention al-
 though usually not until a charge is filed. Detainees may receive visitors, and in-
 communicado detention is not practiced.
 From January to September, the authorities detained 1,498 persons under the
 SPA. As of October, the courts reviewed 1,100 cases and ordered 789 detainees re-
 leased. The courts upheld the detention orders in the other cases.
 In the first 9 months of 1994, the authorities arrested 856 persons under the
 Antiterrorism Act and filed charges in 289 cases. However, the courts adjudicated
 only 14 cases, 7 of which ended in conviction. Between its inception in 1992 and
 September 15, the authorities arrested 3,358 persons under the Antiterrorism Act,
 and fied 1,394 cases. On November 5, the date on which the Antiterrorism Act ex-
 pired, 489 cases were pending. The Government has introduced legislation to dis-
 pose of those cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system has two levels, the Low Court
 and the Supreme Court. Both hear civil and criminal cases. Trials are public. The
 Low Court consists of magistrates, who are part of the administrative branch of gov-
 erment, and session judges, who belong to the judicial branch. The Supreme Court
 is divided into two sections, the High Court and the Appellate Court. The High
 Court hears original cases and also reviews cases from the Low Court. The Appel-
 late Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals of judgments, decrees, orders, or sen-
 tences of the High Court. Rulings of the Appellate Court are binding on all other
 courts.
 The judiciary displays a high degree of independence, especially at the higher lev-
 els. It often rules against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically con-
 troversial cases. In one politically sensitive case, an appellate court in June upheld
 the April 1993 High Court decision to restore the citizenship of Jamaat-E-filami
 leader Golam Azam. The Government argued that Azam did not qualify for full citi-
 zenship because he allegedly committed or condoned war crimes while fighting on
 the side of Pakistan during the war of independence.
 The law provides the accused with the right to be represented by counsel, to re-
 view accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal verdicts. In practice, the
 largely rural, illiterate population does not always understand these rights, nor do
 the authorities always respect them. There is a system of bail. However, if bail is
 not granted, the law does not specify a time limit on pretrial detention. State-funded
 defense attorneys are provided in only a limited nuIber of cases, and there are few
 legal aid programs to offer financial assistance.
 The largest problem of the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases. As
 of September, over 500,000 cases were pending in criminal and metropolitan courts;
 in Dhaka alone, approximately 25,000 cases were pending trial.
 The Government claims that it holds no plitical prisoners. However, it has ar-
 rested some opponents under the SPA for political reasons.
 f. Arbitra     eree. with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a home. However,
 human rights monitors assert that the police rarely obtain warrants and officers vio-
 lating the procedure are not punished.
 In addition, the SPA permits searches without a warrant. Some opposition mem-
 bers and CHT tribal leaders maintain that the intelligence services illegally monitor
 
 
 1208
 their telephones and mail. Sheikh Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami Iague,
 ch   ed that the Government taps her telephones and has her under surveillance.
 The Government denied tapping her telephone, but admitted that the "surveillance'
 was provided for her protection.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Viwlations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts-The Shanti Bahini, a tribal group, has waged a low-level conflict in the CHT
 since the early 1970's to deter Bengali settlers who seek to exploit the Tracts fertile
 and unpopulated land. Government settlement programs increased the number of
 Bengali inhabitants in the CHT from 3 percent in 1947 to an estimated 45 percent
 in 1994. Although the Government prohibits further settlement of the area, some
 settlers continue to move in.
 All sides-indigenous tribes, settlers, and security forces-have accused each
 other of human rights violations. Itis difficult to verify facts in specific incidents be-
 cause government travel restrictions, tight security, difficult terrain, and unsafe
 conditions created by the insurgency limit access to the area.
 In November 1993, violence erupted in the remote town of Naniarchar when a
 tribal group demonstred for removal of a security. checkpoint. A group of Bengali
 settlers reportedly attacked the demonstrators and other persons  the town and
 looted and burned tribal homes. At least 27 people were killedand 100 injured be-
 fore the ilie and army restored order. At the end of 1994, a government commis-
 sion which investigated the violence had not issued an official finding.
 There were no major violent incidents in the CHT in 1994. The Government con-
 tinued its talks with Shanti Bahini's political wing, the Jana Sanghati Samiti (JSS),
 and the two sides agreed on December 26 to extend their ease-fire until March 31,
 1995, when talks between the two groups are scheduled to resume. The Government
 also extended the amnesty for insurgents until March 31, 1995.
 The Government facilitated the return of Chakma members who had fled the con-
 flict in the CHT and sought shelter in refugee camps in India. More than 2,000 refu-
 gees had returned by midyear.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 expression, and press subject to "reasonable restrictions' in the interest of security,
 friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, or morality, or to pro-
 hibit defamation or incitement to an offense. The Government generally respects
 freedom of speech, with the exception of perceived criticism of Islam (see below).
 There are frequent public rallies and speeches in opposition to government poli-
 cies. Opposition political parties used public rallies as the main venue to express
 their views after they walked out of the Parliament in early 1994.
 Newspaper ownership and content are not subject to government restriction. The
 press, numbering hundreds of daily and weekly publications, is a forum for a wide
 range of views.
 The Government seeks to influence newspapers by the placement of advertising.
 The Information Minister has publicly stated that one criterion for the placement
 of government advertising is the "objectivity" of a newspaper's reporting. Some edi-
 tors complain that the Government's use of its advertising budget to punish critical
 newspapers leads to self-censorship.
 The Government also owns the only newsprint mill in the country, giving it the
 power to shut down a newspaper by deny*  it newsprint. It determines how news-
 print is allocatd, and, until recently, prohibited its import.
 Foreign publications are subject to censorship. An issue of Time magazine was
 banned i January. reportedly for publishing a photo of a model wearing a dress
 with verses from the Koran embroidered on It. On the other hand, the authorities
 permitted entry of foreign newspapers carrying editorials critical of the Govern-
 ment's handling of the Taslima Nasreen case (se below).
 The Government arrested several journalists for 'offending the religious senti-
 ments of the people"--a violation of Section 295(a) of the Penal Code. Thre editors
 of the daily Janakantha were arrested for printing a satirical fable mocking Islamic
 clerics who misinterpret the Koran. One editor was granted bail; the others were
 imprisoned for several weeks. Their case is still pending. The authorities issued
 warrants for the arrest of a reporter and editor of AJke Kagoj and sued the editor
 for publishing an article critical of the Jamaat-i-Islami, an Islamist political party.
 Two editors were threatened with legal action. In one case the editor of Ba~la
 Bazaar Patrika, Motiur Rahman Chowdhury, wrote a story about the alleged in-
 volvement of Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Morshed Khan in a banking
 scandal. Khan brought a case against Chowdhury, who was arrested and releasea
 on bail. The case has not yet come to trial. In the second case the editor of Ajker
 Kagoj, Kazi Shahed Ahmed, wrote stories on the alleged roe of leaders of the
 
 
 1209
 Jamaat-i-Islami Party as collaborators with the Pakistanis during Bangladesh's
 1971 war for independence. Charges brought by Janaat partisans resulted in war-
 rants for Ahmed's arrest. He surrendered to the court and was granted bail. The
 case remains in the court system.
 Several media organizations and bookstores were attacked with stones and Molo-
 tov cocktails by groups of Islamic fundamentalists because they were allegedly
 "against religion! The Information Minister condemned the attacks, but the Gov-
 ernment took no legal action against the instigators.
 Some fundamentalist groups threatened a number of journalists, set fire to news-
 paper offices, intimidated newspaper sellers, and offered rewards for the murder of
 well-known writers and editors. The Government did not fully investigate such inci-
 dent.i and failed to prosecute the perpetrators.
 In May, while visiting India, author Taslima Nasreen became the target of
 Islamists ire after the Indian newspaper, The Statesman, quoted her as saying that
 the Koran should be revised. Nasreen had gained prominence in 1993 when the
 Government banned her book "Labjya" ("Shame"), a fictional account of atrocities
 committed against a Hindu family by Muslim neighbors, for inciting communal mis-
 understanding and violence.
 After The Statesman interview, Nasreen claimed that she had stated only that
 Islamic law should be changed to improve the lot of women, and that the Koran was
 "out of place and out of time"-rather than in need of revision. Nonetheless,
 Nasreen became the object of death threats and protests staged by fundamentalist
 groups. In June the Government issued a warrant for her arrest, citing the section
 of the Penal Code which stipulates punishment of anyone who intentionally insults
 religious beliefs. As a result of the arrest warrant and death threats, Nasreen went
 into hiding.
 International media, human rights groups, and foreign governments criticized the
 Government for failing to take action against those calling-and offering money-
 for Nasreen's death. The Government finally warned the public against making
 death threats. On August 3, Nasreen appeared under heavy guard before the High
 Court which granted her bail and police protection. Following a court order voiding
 her arrest warrant, Nasreen departed Bangladesh on August 9 for Sweden and did
 not return to Bangladesh in 1994. Nasreen's trial continues, although in January
 1995 the High Court ruled that the Government must provide a special sanction for
 the charges because Nasreen's acts allegedly took place in a foreign country. The
 Government has not yet responded to this order. By law, Nasreen may be tried in
 absentia.
 The Government owns and controls all the broadcast media which provide more
 favorable coverage of the Government than of the opposition. This was particularly
 true of government television's very slanted coverage of January mayoral elections
 in Dhaka and three other major cities.
 The availability of Cable News Network (CNN) and the British Broadcasting
 Company's (BBC) international news and features for several hours a day on gov-
 ernment television has considerably increased the public's access to international
 news.
 The Government's film censor board continues to exercise control over films. In
 May it banned a locally produced documentary on Chinese prodemocracy move-
 ments because the film would injure the 'susceptibilities of foreign nations."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of every citizen to form associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of morality or public order. In practice, individuals are free to join
 private groups, but a local magistrate must approve public meetings. Occasionally,
 the Government prohibits rallies for security reasons.
 The Government frequently interferes with opposition rallies and public meetings.
 Police in Dhaka broke up a planned Jatiyo Party rally on August 23 on the grounds
 that the organizers did not have a permit. Government officials also often cite a
 statute which allows public assemblies to be prohibited-to prevent possible vio-
 lence-if two or more parties have scheduled rallies for the same time and place.
 Opposition leaders claim that the ruling party, after learning of planned opposition
 public gatherings, frequently schedules other rallies for the same time and place.
 Government authorities then cancel both events, effectively thwarting the opposi-
 tion's right to free public assembly.
 The Government and the opposition in October entered into a political dialog in
 which one agenda item was agreement on a code of conduct that would address is-
 sues such as public assemblies. The dialog failed when the opposition refused to
 compromise on its demand for a caretaker government to supervise the next na-
 tional elections.
 
 
 1210
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Approximately 90 percent of Bangladesh's 122 million
 people are Muslim. The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion but also
 stipulates the right to practice the religion of one's choice. However, some members
 of the Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minorities believe the establishment of Islam
 has led to hostility toward them and increased religious tension (see Section 5).
 The law permits citizens to proselytize. However, strong social resistance to con-
 version from Islam means that much of the non-Muslim missionary effort is aimed
 at Hindus and tribal groups. The Government allows various religions to establish
 places of worship, train clergy, travel for religious purposes, and maintain links
 with coreligionists abroad. Foreign missionaries may work in Bangladesh, but their
 right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution. Some missionaries have en-
 countered difficulties in obtaining residence permits or reentry visas from the Gov-
 ernment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriatlon.-Except for certain areas within the CHT, citizens are able to move free-
 ly within the country. Travel by foreigners is also restricted in the CHT and some
 other border areas. Bangladeshis are generally free to travel abroad and emigrate.
 In some instances the Government prohibits persons considered to be security risks
 from traveling abroad. The right of repatriation is observed.
 Approximately 250,000 Rohingyas (Muslims from Burma's Arakan province)
 crossed into southeastern Bangladesh in late 1991 and early 1992, fleeing Burmese
 repression. Approximately 120,000 Rohingyas remain in 17 camps in the area of
 Cox's Bazar. Camp security officials subjected refugees in the camps to intimidation
 and physical abuse in attempts to coerce the Rohingyas to return to Burma. The
 Government took substantial steps to curb these abuses in mid-1994 at the urging
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and some foreign
 governments. Efforts to repatriate the refugees gained momentum due to a new
 willingness of the Burma Government during the second half of 1994 to accept the
 refugees. In November alone, almost 20,000 refugees were repatriated and the
 UNHCR indicated it hopes to continue to repatriate about 5,000 refugees per week.
 There are about 238,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis, who remain in
 Bangladesh pending resettlement to Pakistan (see Pakistan report).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bangladesh is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which elections by secret
 ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage. Members of Parliament are elected
 at least every 5 years. The Parliament has 300 elected members, with 30 additional
 seats reserved for women who are chosen by Parliament. Women are free to contest
 any seat in Parliament, and some were elected in their own right in the last na-
 tional election, so there are more than 30 women members. While seats are not spe-
 cifically reserved for them, other minority groups, such as tribal peoples, are rep-
 resented in the legislature. In the current Parliament there are 12 members from
 minority groups out of a total of 330.
 The last national elections were held in 1991 after the fall of the government of
 H.R. Ershad. The BNP won a plurality of seats. It cooperated with the Jamaat-i-
 Islami party to elect enough women legislators to give the BNP a slim majority and
 enable it to form a government. The opposition is led by Sheikh Hasina Wajed and
 her Awami League party. While there are a large number of minor parties, the most
 significant opposition parties are the Awami League, the Jatiyo Party (former Presi-
 dent Ershad's party), and the Jamaat-i-Islami, the major Islamic political party
 which holds 20 seats.
 The Awami League and other opposition groups charged the BNP with intimida-
 tion and vote-riging in a parliamentary by-election in the district of Magura, which
 the BNP won. They began a boycott of Parliament and have tried, thus far unsuc-
 cessfully, to force the Government to resign in favor of a caretaker government,
 which would oversee new elections. The opposition Members of Parliament resigned
 en masse on December 28.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permits human rights groups to conduct their activi-
 ties. In 1994 such groups published reports, held press conferences, and issued ap-
 peals to the'Government in regard to specific cases.
 The Government is sensitive to international opinion regarding human rights is-
 sues. It sought to defend its handling of the Taslima Nasreen case but was open
 to dialog with international organizations and foreign diplomatic missions.
 
 
 1211
 The Government has put pressure on individual human rights advocates. The
 Government did not issue a reentry visa to Father Richard Timm, a Catholic priest
 and human rights advocate who has worked in Bangladesh for over 40 years. Father
 Timm had applied for the visa to travel abroad f6r needed medical care. Govern-
 ment sources indicated that they are still considering Father Timrn's case, but the
 Government has taken no action for over a year. In a similar ca the Government
 took no action on the application for a visa extension by Father Eugene Horrich,
 a long time resident American priest. This appears to be a result of his activities
 in the Madhupur Forest region, Where he works to promote the rights of the Garos,
 a minority group.
 The Government continues to deny registration to the Bangladesh Human Rights
 Commission's Treatment Center for Trauma Victims, making it impossible for the
 center to receive funds from foreign donor organizations. Many representatives of
 local human rights groups were physically attacked by religious extremists who con-
 sidered their activities "un-Islamic.  The Government failed to bring to justice those
 who engaged in such violence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled
 to equal protection by the law." In practice, laws aimed at eliminating discrimina-
 tion are not strongly enforced. In this context, women, children, minority groups,
 and the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages.
 Women.-Although there has been slow improvement over the last few years,
 women remain in a subordinate position in Bangladesh society, and the Government
 has not acted to protect their basic freedoms. Only 20 percent of women are literate,
 compared to 35 to 40 percent of the general population. In rural areas, only 30 per-
 cent of primary school students are female; les than 25 percent at the secondary
 level, and below 15 percent at the college and university level. Women are often un-
 aware of their rights owing to high illiteracy rates and unequal educational opportu-
 nities. Strong social stigmas and lack of economic means to obtain legal assistance
 frequently keep women from seeking redress in the courts.
 According to the 1961 Muslim Family Ordinance, female heirs receive less inherit-
 ance than male heirs, and wives are more restricted in divorce rights. Men are per-
 mitted to have up to four wives.
 While job growth opportunities have been stronger for women than for men in the
 past few years, this is almost entirely due to the growth of the garment industry,
 in which female workers are prevalent. Women still occupy only a small fraction of
 other wage-earning jobs, and hold fewer than 5 percent of government jobs. The
 Government's policy to include more women in government jobs has had limited ef-
 fect.
 Violence against women is difficult to quantify because of unreliable statistics but
 observers say that wife beating is widespread. In 1994 human rights groups and the
 press reported many incidents of violence against women, in only some ofwhich the
 perpetrators were reportedly prosecuted. In villages vigilante groups meted out
 humiliating, painful punishments, including whipping, to women accused of moral
 offenses.
 The Government has enacted laws specifically prnibting certain forms of dis-
 crimination against women, including the Atidowry rhibition Act of 1980 and
 the Cruelty to Women Law of 1983. Enforcement of these laws is weak, especially
 in rural areas. The Government seldom prosecutes vigorously those cases that are
 filed.
 Children.-The Government undertakes program    in the areas of primary edu-
 cation, health, family planning, and nutrition. The Government made universal pri-
 m    education mandatory in 1991, but stated that it ould not fully implement the
 law ecause of a lack of resources. Little progress was made in 1994.
 Human rights monitors continue to report that many children have been aban-
 doned, kidnaped, sold into bondage, and employed as prostitutes. One human rights
 group claims that there are about 29,000 child prostitutes. The law does not allow
 anyone under 18 to engage in prostitution, and stipulates a maximum sentence of
 life imprisonment for persons found guilty of forcing a child into prostitution. How-
 ever, procurers of minors are rarely prosecuted.
 Indigenous People.-Tribal peoples, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, have
 a marginal ability to influence decisions concerning the use of their lands. Until
 1985 the Government regularly parceled out the land in the Chittagong Hills to
 Bengali settlers.
 The Government has moved toward granting the tribal peoples more authority in
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In July 1991, tribal-dominatedlocad government councils
 
 
 1212
 assumed control over primary education, health, family welfare and the agricultural
 extension service. However, government security forces continue to control law and
 order as well as land use (see also Section 1.g.).
 Tribal peoples in other areas have also reported loss of land to Bengali Muslims
 through questionable legal practices and other means. For example, the Garo peo-
 ple, who live in the Madhapur Forest region in north central Bangladesh, have en-
 countered problems in trying to maintain their cultural traditions and livelihoods
 in the face of reforestation projects in. Human rights monitors in the region claim
 that the Garos are being harassed and intimidated into leaving their homes to make
 way for these government-rn, internationally financed projects.
 Religious Minorites.-Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists make up an estimated
 10 percent of the population. Although the Government is secular, religion exerts
 a powerful influence on politics. The Government is sensitive to the Muslim con-
 sciousness of the majority of its citizens and has sought the political support of the
 Jamaat-i-Islami the countrys large Islamic political party.
 Throughout the country, Islamic extremists violently attacked women, religious
 minorities, journalists, writers, and development workers. The Government failed to
 denounce, investigate, and prosecute perpetrators of these attacks.
 Among the most serious attacks were those carried out against nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) accused of conducting anti-Islamic activities. Some of the vio-
 lence against NGO's was prompted when Islamic religious leaders claimed that
 NGO's denigrated Islam and coerced Muslims to convert to Christianity.
 Religious minorities are in practice disadvantaged in such areas as access to gov-
 ernment jobs and political office. Selection boards in the government services are
 often without minority group representation.
 Property ownership particularly among Hindus, has been a contentious issue
 since independence, when many Hindus lost landholdings because of anti-Hindu dis-
 crimination in the application of the law. Reported cases of violence directed against
 religious minority communities has also resulted in the loss of property-most re-
 cently in December 1992 after Hindus in India destroyed the Babri mosque. Such
 intercommunal violence has caused some members of religious minority groups to
 depart the country. However, there were no significant instances of intercommunal
 violence in 1994.
 People With Disabilities.-The laws provide for equal treatment and freedom from
 discrimination for the disabled. The Government has not enacted specific legislation
 or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution guarantees freedom of association,
 the right to join unions, and, with government approval, the right to form a union.
 With the exception of workers in the railway, postal, telegraph, and telephone de-
 partments, the law forbids government civil servants to join unions. This ban also
 applies to security-related government employees such as the military and police.
 Civil servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers, doctors, and nurses, have
 formed associations that perform functions similar to labor unions.
 Approximately 1.6 million members of the country's total work force of about 45
 to 50 million workers belong to unions.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee partici-
 pation is required. Registration of a union may only be canceled by the registrar
 of trade unions with the concurrence of the Labor Court. There are no restrictions
 on affiliation with international labor organizations, and Bangladeshi unions and
 federations maintain a variety of such links.
 Ten to 15 percent of Bangladesh's a pproximately 4,200 labor unions are affiliated
 with 23 officially registered National Trade Union (NTU) centers. There is no legal
 restriction on political activity by labor unions. Unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment. They are highly politicized, and virtually all NTU centers are affiliated
 with political parties.
 The law does not specifically recognize the right to strike, but strikes are common.
 The Government prohibits nationwide general strikes. Participation in such a strike
 is a criminal offense. Nonetheless, the political opposition continues to use general
 strikes to pressure the Government on political demands.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector regarded as "essential." The Government has applied this ban
 to national airline pilots, water supply workers, shipping operations employees, and
 electricity supply workers. The Government renews such bans every 3 months.
 The Government may prohibit a strike before it begins and refer the dispute to
 the Labor Court. The Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969 established mecha-
 nisms for conciliation, arbitration, and labor dispute resolution. Workers have the

 right to strike in the event of a failure to achieve a settlement. Strikers participat-
 ing in a legal strike are protected from retribution under the law. In practice this
 protection has not always proven effective.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is legal
 only for private sector workers, on the.condition that they are represented by unions
 legally regtered as collectve bargaining agents. Collective bargining generally
 does not occur in small private enterprises. The National Pay and Wages Commis-
 sion recommends public sector workers' pay levels and other benefits.
 Under the Induistrial Relations Ordinane, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 _crinination against union members and organizers by employers. The Ordinance
 does not prhibit employers from transferring workers suspectd of union activities.
 Complaints that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination are par-
 ticularly high in the garment industry. ln several cases the Labor Court has ordered
 the reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. However, the Labor Court's
 overall effectiveness is hampered by a serious case backlog and allegations of cor-
 ruption.
 Current law urohibits unions in the two export p rocessing zones (EPZ's). A small
 number of workers in the EPZ's have skirted prohibitions on unions by setting up
 worker associations. The Government has stated that restrictions on the establish-
 ment of unions in the EPZ's will be lifted by 1997. So far, no action toward this
 end has been taken. In the garment industry, there have been complaints of work-
 ers being harassed and fired in some factories for tryig to org'. unions.
 c. Prohibition if Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The-Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Factories Act and Shops and Establishment Act, both
 passed in 1965, established inspection mechanisms to enforce laws against forced
 labor. These laws are not rigorously enforced. There is forced labor to the extent
 that workers are often required to work longer hours than stipulated by law, with
 no special compensation. This is often the case in the garment industry.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Factories Act of 1965 bars
 children under the age of 15 from working in factories. This law stipulates that
 young workers are only allowed to work a maximum 5-hour day and only between
 the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Government does not adequately enforce these
 rules.
 According to U.N. estimates, about one-third of the population under the age of
 18 is employed. Children routinely perform domestic work. Cases of children being
 physically abused and occasionally killed by heads of household where they w
 are reported in the press.
 Employers discharged thousands of underage workers employed in Bangladess
 garment industry in 1993-94. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Export-
 ers Association has pledged to eliminate all child workers from its member factories
 and is cooperating with the Government, the International Labor Organization, and
 NGO's to achieve this goal.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The
 Wages Commission sets wages industry by industry. In most cases, private sector
 employers ignore this wage structure. ln 1993 the Confederation of Labor Unions
 won a minimum wage agreement for public sector factory workers that was slightly
 above the level recommended by the Wages Commission. According to the agree-
 ment, government factory workers receive about $24 (950 taka) a month plus bene-
 fits. Private sector wages tend to fall below the government wage and benefits pack-
 age. The average monthly wage is sufficient to provide bare necessities.
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with 1 rest day each week. A 60-hour
 workweek, inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The law is
 poorly enforced.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive, but many employers ignore it. Workers rarely re-
 sort to legal action to enforce the law. Enforcement by the Labor Ministry's indus-
 trial inspectorate is weak. Because unemployment is high and the Government does
 not adequately enforce health and safety standards, most workers do not excuse
 themselves from performing hazardous tasks for fear of losing their jobs.
