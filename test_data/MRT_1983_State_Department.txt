 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is an authoritarian state governed by the Military
 Committee for National Salvation, established in the wake of
 a coup d'etat on July 10, 1978, which removed President Moktar
 Ould Daddah from power, abolished the parliamentary system
 established at independence in 1960, and subjected the adminis-
 trative apparatus to military control. Lt. Col. Mohamed Khouna
 Ould Baidalla, in his role as president of the Committee, is
 Chief of State. Balf of the two dozen members of the Committee
 still retain ministerial portfolios or occupy other key govern-
 ment posts. This supplies an element of continuity and collegi-
 ality despite frequent reshuffling of offices and the occasional
 resignation (or arrest) of members.
 Regional control is entrusted to military commanders, but most of
 the governors are civilians as are all the subordinate officials
 in the governmental apparatus. Civilian ministers, many of whom
 served under the previous regime, provide technical expertise and
 meet the needs for tribal, ethnic, and regional representation in
 the military government. A putative effort to set the stage for
 a new legislature foundered in early 1981. The judicial system,
 revised to accommodate stricter adherence to Islamic law, has
 regained a measure of independence. State-owned corporate insti-
 tutions occupy an important place in the Mauritanian political
 structure.
 Despite the gradual consolidation of power by Col. Haidalla
 during the last two years, the Committee retains a strong colle-
 gial element. Most decisions are reached by consensus, and are
 ratified at weekly plenary sessions. Revisions are promulgated
 by decree in the name of the Military Committee. Prospects for
 an early return to civilian rule appear remote; the military, as
 Haidalla recently noted, remains the "custodian of the nation's
 sovereignty.'
 Col. Haidalla has brought an element of stability and direction
 to the Committee, which contrasts sharply with a lengthy period
 of uncertainty, coup plots, and sharply shifting political and
 economic strategies prior to 1981. The Committee inherited
 daunting problems stemming from persistent drought, war in the
 Western Sahara, corruption in state-owned institutions, and
 tensions generated by efforts of a traditional and largely nomadic
 society to modernize rapidly. In August 1979, Mauritania removed
 itself from the Western Sahara conflict, a move which ended large
 scale military and budgetary support from Morocco and certain
 other Arab countries, and which left it with a military establish-
 ment much larger than required.
 The fall of the Ould Daddah regime also focused attention on
 Mauritania's racial situation: Moors and the ethnic black popu-
 lation have clashed, sometimes violently, over the issue of
 Arabization in the schools and over the slavery issue. Renewed
 efforts to extirpate slavery (officially abolished in 1980) and
 to introduce the Islamic legal code (Shari'a) in criminal cases
 have been contentious; the former has been resisted by some
 Moors, while blacks see Arabization as prejudicial to their
 interests. By attempting to end vestiges of slavery, the Govern-
 ment hopes to speed the development of the country, eliminate an
 unacceptable practice, and reduce ethnic tensions between blacks
 and Moors. By introducing a strict and simple criminal code,
 relying on corporal punishment to deter crime, the Government
 hopes to reinforce its identification with Islam and reduce

 236
 common crime substantially. Haidalla has cautioned that the
 reforms not be misinterpreted by religious or ideological
 zealots, who would undermine respect for individual rights.
 There is no evidence of mass arrests, brutality, or torture in
 Mauritania, and the Government has generally adhered to legal
 guarantees for the integrity of the individual. The larger
 application of individual rights as articulated in the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights or the Declaration of the Rights of
 Man confronts well-entrenched traditions in a country which was
 lightly touched by the European colonial experience. Limited
 opportunities for females to participate in political life, bar-
 riers to social mobility, and difficulties of access to employ-
 ment imposed by traditional tribal family connections remain
 basic issues. Most serious of all are the remnants of slavery,
 which has survived three attempts at abolition.
 Mauritania's massive economic difficulties place a severe burden
 on most of the population. Although iron ore production has been
 restored to levels attained before the Saharan war began, world
 prices are depressed. Efforts to increase Mauritania's share of
 fisheries production off its coast have fallen far short of ex-
 pectations. Austerity measures have resulted in reduced govern-
 ment expenditures, but persistent drought conditions have raised
 the cost of food imports, decimated livestock herds, and driven
 nomads into makeshift camps around the capital and other cities.
 Increased energy costs also have added substantially to
 Mauritania's international debt.
 Confronted by these problems, the Government has retained the
 controls over political activities imposed in 1978. Assemblies
 devoted to political discussion other than those under government
 sponsorship are forbidden. The media are tightly controlled and
 opposition groups are banned. The Committee is in its second year
 of an experiment to "enlist popular support for and understanding"
 of efforts to combat the drought, develop a national conscious-
 ness, curb persistent corruption, and promote social and economic
 equality. The "Structure for the Education of the Masses" is
 advertised as an indigenous and peaceful revolution free from all
 imported ideological systems. To date, discussion groups and
 self-help committees have been developed in most larger communi-
 ties. Haidalla has encouraged the 'Structure" as a vehicle for
 the articulation of popular grievances, for undertaking civic-
 action projects, and for finding local ways to combat onrushing
 desertification of the country.
 Transcending all other considerations is the recent intensifi-
 cation of the drought, which has persisted for almost 15
 years. Impoverished at the outset, Mauritania now finds its
 agricultural resources seriously reduced and the nomadic culture
 of the Moors and many of the blacks virtually destroyed. The
 gradual disappearance of traditional cultural and religious
 centers has generated a sense of crisis among the Moors, and the
 explosive growth of refugee camps threatens the viability of the
 state. The development of social and legal institutions in
 Mauritania, and indeed the country's hopes for the future, is
 hostage to this ecological and demographic calamity.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 
 
 287
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no reports in 1983 of killings motivated by
 political considerations, or of the death penalty imposed without
 adequate substantive or procedural safeguards.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically inspired disappearances during
 the past year.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there is no evi-
 dence that it was practiced in 1983. There is no record of either
 summary executions or of degrading treatment of prisoners. A
 murderer, convicted by an Islamic court after a public trial, was
 executed publicly by a firing squad in April of 1983.   In 1983
 there were no reports of amputations; however, one woman (punished
 for adultery) and three men (punished for drinking) were publicly
 flogged in the city stadium.
 The Government decree in July 1980 abolishing slavery drew
 international attention to this complex social and economic
 phenomenon. The institution persists largely in southern
 Mauritania, where it originated in conflicts between nomadic
 Moors and settled blacks. French colonial administrators outlawed
 slavery in the early part of this century. It also was proscribed
 in the Constitution promulgated at independence in 1960. The 1980
 Declaration of the Abolition of Slavery was thus the second time
 that a Mauritanian government had declared the institution illegal.
 Slavery in Mauritania is not identifiable with chattel servitude
 of the American historical experience. There is no well
 developed market for slaves. The status of slaves and the large
 class of descendants of slaves and freed slaves is regulated by
 complex social obligations. Many freed slaves still give part of
 their wages to their former masters, many of whom also provide
 food and clothing and sometimes guarantee employment. Slavery
 remains an impediment to government efforts to achieve social
 equality and national unity. Chief of State Haidalla marked the
 third anniversary of the abolition of slavery in 1983 by strongly
 affirming the Government's commitment to the liberty and independ-
 ence of all Mauritanians. He noted that the 1980 decision was
 based on Islamic principles of justice, and that there is no
 longer a place among Mauritanians for those who continue to
 believe that some people are born merely to serve others. Many
 Moors fear that its extirpation will cause economic or personal
 hardship and serve as a catalyst for the overthrow of other
 traditional institutions.
 Although the Government remains firmly opposed to slavery and has
 established a commission to implement abolition decrees, forced
 labor practices still exist. The United Nations Subcommission on
 Human Rights has been invited to visit Mauritania in early 1984.
 The 1980 Declaration of the Abolition of Slavery can be said,
 thus far, to represent a firm statement of intent, but it is not
 possible as yet to measure the extent of its effect on the
 residual slavery that still exists.
 
 
 238
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law guarantees expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and right of appeal. An exception to
 this, based on legislation enacted before the 1978 coup, is the
 prerogative vested in the state to detain, without trial or
 appeal, anyone judged to be a threat to national security.
 Detainees are usually confined to their residence.
 Under terms of this law, Mauritania's military government con-
 tinues to hold approximately 15 former civilian and military
 officials in what is in essence a form of strict surveillance.
 Another 30 officials have been banished from time to time to re-
 mote parts of the country under orders to refrain from political
 activity and remain in their locality. In the fall of 1979
 former President Ould Daddah was permitted to travel to France
 for medical reasons and has not returned. In 1981 and 1982
 several senior military officials were banished to eastern
 Mauritania, and several others released from strict surveillance.
 There were no instances of resort to detention in 1983.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trail
 An inadequate and under-financed judicial system means that
 suspects sometimes are held for long periods before trial.
 The Shari'a Islamic code, as instituted in Mauritania in
 1980, covers three types of crime: adultery, personal theft,
 and murder. A Muslim judge presides over a jury chosen by
 the'Governor of the region. The defendant has a right to
 counsel and can appeal a guilty verdict to the Supreme Islamic
 Court within 15 days. Circumstantial evidence cannot be admitted
 as proof of guilt. In practice, all convicted criminals admit
 their guilt. Admission of guilt is sometimes obtained in the
 context of a promised reduction in punishment similar to *plea
 bargaining" in the United States. An inability to convince the
 sitting magistrate that the Government's charges are in error in
 itself stands as a legal admission of guilt, as does the con-
 vincing testimony of a first-hand witness or co-defendant.
 Extended confinement is sometimes used to encourage self-
 incrimination; physical torture is offensive to Mauritanian
 mores. All sentences must be approved by the President.
 Mauritanian authorities hope that Shari'a law will deter crime,
 and President Haidalla has said that the institution of Shari's
 is 'a first step towards application of the precepts of Islam in
 all areas" of Mauritanian life. Opposition to this has been
 expressed by certain blacks and women, who believe the Shari'a
 code will favor the Moorish way of life and limit the role of
 women.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in private affairs, save in instances
 where treasonous activity is suspected, is extremely limited.
 Reflecting the nomadic penchant for privacy and the sanctity of
 confidences shared by family members, a sheer lack of sophisti-
 cated equipment to undertake surveillance, and the protection to
 privacy afforded by the isolation of various parts of the country
 one from another, the Government limits its surveillance to
 patrols on major highways, occasional night-time inspection of
 vehicular traffic, and inspection of mail suspected to contain
 currency or prohibited items. Indeed, the Government is often
 
 
 239
 ignorant of information required for protection of the public
 welfare, for lines of communication run more readily along family
 lines than through a bureaucracy's chain of command. Association
 with foreigners and the expression of opinion is not discouraged,
 although most Mauritanians are careful not to propagate patently
 seditious opinions. Shortwave broadcasts and Senegalese televi-
 sion are followed openly; videotapes on a wide variety of subjects
 circulate freely in Nouakchott. The Government enforces strictly
 its prohibition against public meetings addressing political
 themes, and the single newspaper is totally controlled by the
 Government, but ideology, apart from a reverence for Islam and
 Arabization, is low-key.
 Section 2 Repect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is suppressed. Mauritania's
 only newspaper, news agency and radio/television station are
 government operated. The Government does not permit criti-
 cism of its policies or authority and editorial content of
 the media is controlled. International news magazines and
 newspapers generally circulate freely in Mauritania, even when
 they contain articles critical of the Government. Public sale of
 certain magazines (such as Jeune Afrique) is prohibited. Despite
 institutional restrictions on criticism of the Government,
 private dissent is lively, and family and clan networks act as
 vehicles for communicating complaints and airing dissent. The
 nomadic tradition also provides for candid expressions of concern
 to the leadership. In practice, the Government appears to concern
 itself only with activities identified as directly related to the
 destabilization or overthrow of the military government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly was suspended in 1978 when the
 military assumed control of the country. Following the
 reorganization of the military committee in April 1979, the
 Government warned that political assembly, whether in public
 or in private dwellings, would not be tolerated. At that time,
 and again after the March 16, 1981 coup attempt, curfews were
 imposed to discourage public gatherings. Both curfews were
 lifted within a few months, but the restriction on political
 assembly remains in effect. There were no curfews imposed in
 1983.
 Labor unions were the only political organizations not
 dissolved after the 1978 military coup. All union activities
 are supervised by the Union of Mauritanian Workers, a governmental
 organization attached to the Ministry of Employment and Training.
 Unions are recognized only when they register with the official
 body and accept an appointed director general. Local union
 officials state there are approximately 26,000 members now.
 Union membership is not universal; workers must pay an annual
 membership fee of $4.00 to belong, but the Government indirectly
 finances most union activities. The right to strike exists in
 principle in Mauritania, although no strikes occurred in 1983.
 An extended strike, if this could be staged, would probably
 be strongly opposed by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 
 
 240
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually all
 citizens are Muslim, and the country's official name is the
 Islamic Republic of Mauritania. Proselytism and the construc-
 tion of churches and other non-Islamic houses of worship are
 prohibited without express government permission, which has
 been granted in several instances to Mauritania's small
 Roman Catholic community. There are no restrictions on
 personal religious expression; several Catholic churches
 operate freely.    In 1982 some members of the Bahai faith
 were threatened with expulsion for alleged proselytizing
 activities. There were no such reports in 1983. There is
 no religious discrimination in employment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 although travelers are frequently subject to routine police
 checks. Mauritanians must obtain an exit visa to travel
 abroad, but there are no barriers to emigration or repatria-
 tion. A few Mauritanian officials have left the country
 because of political opposition to the Government. The Western
 Sahara conflict has led to a small immigration of refugees from
 the war into Nouadhibou and other northern towns, but there are
 no political refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government has been
 abridged since 1978 when the military abolished Mauritania's
 only political party. At the present time, there are no
 elected representatives and opposition groups are not
 tolerated.
 In early December 1980, President Haidalla announced the
 first step in restoring democratic government in Mauritania.
 A civilian Prime Minister was appointed and a draft constitu-
 tion was published providing for a democratic multi-party
 system. On December 26, 1980, a number of arrests were
 carried out following the discovery of an alleged Libyan-
 inspired plot to take over the Government and merge Mauritania
 and Libya into a single state; in March 1981 there was an
 attempted coup. Following these two events progress toward
 democratization ceased. A military Prime Minister replaced
 the civilian incumbent and efforts to restore constitutional
 rule were suspended.
 The tempo of political activism accelerated in 1983 as the
 Structure for Education of the Masses became better established.
 The movement has emphasized decentralization of the Government
 decision-making process and expanded scope for local initiative.
 The "Structure" is also intended to reduce tribal and ethnic
 antagonism and to parry threats posed by foreign ideologies.
 To date the principal focus has been on raising popular awareness
 of the danger posed by the drought, but citizens have used the
 Structure' as a vehicle to criticize government policies in
 general as well as certain officials.
 The black population is represented at all levels of government,
 but in numbers far less than their proportion of the total
 population. Many blacks claim that the Moors are substantially
 
 
 241
 over-represented in the Government and religious institutions,
 since blacks believe they constitute a majority of the
 population. The Government insists, however, that a substan-
 tial majority of Mauritanians are Moors. A sizeable segment of
 the black population is considered, and considers itself, to be
 Moorish.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In early 1981 Amnesty International requested the information
 concerning the disappearance of several former members of the
 Government in early 1981. NO formal response was given, but the
 officials in question were apparently released from detention in
 July 1981. According to its 1983 report, Amnesty's main human
 rights concerns in Mauritania are allegations of detention without
 charge or trial, house arrest, unfair trials, as well as reports
 of torture, judicial amputations, floggings, and imposition of the
 death penalty. Freedom House rates Mauritania "not free."
 In August 1981, the U.N. Human Rights Subcommission's Working
 Group on Slavery heard a report from the London-based Anti-Slavery
 Society on slavery in Mauritania. The report accused the
 Mauritanian government of taking no action to abolish slavery
 beyond the 1980 edict declaring it illegal. A Mauritanian
 observer of the subcommission session criticized the report,
 saying that the information had been badly analyzed, and invited
 the subcnmmission to send an expert of its own to investigate the
 situation firsthand. The Human Rights Subcoamission accepted the
 invitation and is expected to visit Mauritania in early 1984.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritania's econnmy, always marginal, has been subject to
 drought for more than a decade, which has intensified in the
 last two years, decimating livestock and reducing indigenous
 food production to less than 10 percent of the national
 requirements. Mineral exports, which account for 85 percent
 of the country's foreign exchange earnings, have been
 hindered by poor planning, increasing debt, and logistical
 problems. Investment in new iron ore mines undertaken since
 1978 will extend the life of known deposits beyond the year 2000,
 but only more buoyant world prices will reduce the enormous debt
 burden incurred. Exploitation of Mauritania's immense
 fisheries resources is a pressing need. Drought and high
 import prices for food and energy have reduced the national
 finance to a perilous situation. The lack of rain, coupled
 with the war in the Western Sahara, contributed to a rapid
 population shift to urban areas. Nouakchott, a new city
 built to accommodate 30,000 inhabitants, now contains a
 population estimated at 400,000, out of a total national
 population of 1,591,000 (1983). Elemental needs in hygiene,
 education, social services, employment, and economic development
 far exceed what the Government can provide.
 Small business enterprises are an important part of Mauritania's
 economy; small food stands and shops flourish in the towns. The
 Government dominates large scale industry, however, and nearly
 all major services and utilities are run by state owned firms.
 These firms offer entrepreneurial opportunities to Mauritanians
 who possess capital to invest; their role in providing employment
 
 
 242
 opportunities for poor, unskilled Mauritanians is limited. Just
 as Moors tend to predominate in senior government positions, they
 appear to enjoy favored access to senior positions in the state-
 owned sector.
 In the rural sector, a small population scattered over a vast
 landscape is far removed from many governmental services. As
 the drought intensifies, government efforts are concentrated
 on supplying essential foodstuffs received from international
 donors to a population increasingly malnourished; in large
 areas the rural population is almost completely on this food
 assistance. Instances of hoarding, illegal sale of donated
 food supplies, and withholding of vital nourishment from
 slaves and children have been recorded; it takes place despite
 efforts of-the Government to change isolated communities'
 traditional responses to the prospect of famine. The calorie
 supply as percent of requirements (1977 figure) is 93.75 percent.
 Mortality rates among infants (in 1983, 140.40 per thousand) and
 the elderly are expected to rise during the coming year despite
 a multinational emergency food assistance effort now underway.
 Life expectancy at birth is 43.19 years (1980); the population
 growth rate is 2 percent (1983).
 Inequities in income distribution (GNP per capita is $484.10
 1981) are more pronounced in Mauritania than in its West African
 neighbors, in part because Mauritania's iron ore and fisheries
 exports require heavy investment of capital, technological
 expertise, and management skills. The tax system is progressive,
 although few Mauritanians appear to pay their true tax assess-
 ments. Private sector initiatives are protected and encouraged.
 In education, the Government's task is complicated by the very
 sharp divisions between the Arabic speaking Moorish population
 and the blacks, who have traditionally preferred to be educated
 in French and local languages rather than in Arabic. The Govern-
 ment abandoned plans in 1981 for total Arabization of the educa-
 tional system after encountering widespread opposition. The
 primary school enrollment in 1981 is estimated to be 33 percent of
 the eligible age group. Mauritania's literacy rate remains very
 low--17.40 percent (1977)--and those aspiring to advanced train-
 ing look for financial assistance to go abroad. For Mauritanians
 who obtain such an education, employment prospects in Mauritania
 are bleak.
 Traditional cultural and social values limit the role of
 Mauritanian women in government and business. Some women
 have risen to prominent positions in the field of health and
 education, and many women are employed as teachers and middle
 or low-level government bureaucrats. While women are free to
 participate in business and governmental affairs, few women, in
 fact, attempt to combine a career with their family responsibili-
 ties. Statistics indicate that only one half as many women as
 men avail themselves of educational opportunities, a phenomenon
 which may be due to cultural, rather than legal, constraints.
 The Government has recommended the establishment of an office for
 women's affairs.
