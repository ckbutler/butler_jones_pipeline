 MALI
 Mali is a single-party state in which authority is exercised
 by General Moussa Traore, President of the Republic and
 Secretary General of the Democratic Union of the Malian People
 (UDPM), the country's only legal political party and supreme
 political entity. President Traore assumed power through a
 military coup in 1968. The military still maintains a
 privileged position, and some military men occupy key
 positions within the Government, although the Government and
 party are predominantly civilian. Military men hold 3 of the
 7 regional governorships, and 11 of the 46 districts.
 The Gendarmerie (paramilitary police) and local police forces
 have primary responsibility for'maintaining internal
 security. The military is used for internal security in
 extraordinary situations; in 1990 it was called on to deal
 with an insurgency by dissident Tuaregs in the Gao region.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of
 approximately $230, Mali is among the world's poorest
 countries. Mali's economy rests primarily on subsistence
 farming and animal husbandry, making it highly dependent on
 good rainfalls for its economic well-being. Throughout 1990
 the Government continued its efforts to modernize the economy
 through fiscal reform and privatization of state enterprises,
 but Mali remains heavily dependent on external aid.
 Although some human rights restrictions eased in 1990, the
 Government's response to Tuareg dissidence in the north
 resulted in numerous credible reports of human rights
 violations, including summary executions of dissidents by
 military forces. The Government did not allow an independent
 investigation into these and other allegations of brutality.
 The circumstances surrounding the rebellion were unclear, but
 it coincided with the repatriation of several thousand
 Malians, mainly Tuaregs, from Algeria in 1990, and President
 Traore charged Libya with responsibility for the attacks.
 Libyan leader Qadhafi acknowledged that Malian Tuaregs have
 received military training in Libya.
 While favoring continuation of the single party system, in
 1990 the Government permitted a growing public debate, inside
 and outside the party, over constitutional reform, including
 the possibility of a multiparty system. An independent press,
 the new (1989) human rights organization, the National Union
 of Malian Labor (UNTM), and the National Bar Association
 contributed importantly to the debate on political pluralism.
 By year's end, two organizations promoting a multiparty
 system, the National Committee for Democratic Initiative
 (CNID> and the Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), had
 been formed. The CNID held peaceful demonstrations for
 democracy on December 10 and 30 without interference from the
 Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were numerous credible reports that as many as 29 people
 were summarily executed in July and early August in the Gao
 region when the Government acted to restore order following a
 series of attacks by Tuareg dissidents. In particular,
 
 
 224
 MALI
 residents in that region claimed to have witnessed the public
 executions of 13 persons in early August on the outskirts of
 the city of Gao. The Government denied that summary
 executions took place. However, reports were of sufficient
 number and credibility to warrant an independent
 investigation. The Tuareg insurgents have targeted military
 and Government officials in their raids on villages and
 military camps, executing a number of them and some of their
 family members. According to government sources, at least 39
 persons were killed by the insurgents from the end of June
 through the end of August. There have been no further reports
 of such violations in the region. By the end of 1990, the
 situation in the north was generally calm but remained
 unresolved.
 One government official accused of spying for the insurgents
 died in prison 2 days after his arrest; while the government
 radio reported he had been poisoned, no further explanation of
 his death was given.
 b. Disappearance
 No incidents of disappearance, abduction, or hostage-taking
 attributable to the Government were reported. However, the
 Government has given out little information on captured
 Tuaregs so it is impossible to know the fate of many rebels.
 Tuareg insurgents, according to reliable sources, abducted
 soldiers and government officials following raids on military
 and civilian facilities. The current whereabouts of these
 persons are unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Government has issued specific instructions
 prohibiting brutality against persons under police
 investigation, physical abuse of suspected persons sometimes
 occurs during police interrogation or in police handling of
 demonstrations. There were credible reports that, in July and
 August, suspected Tuareg dissidents were tortured while
 undergoing interrogation. Prison conditions in Mali are harsh
 and characterized by inadequate medical facilities and food
 supplies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malian judicial system is based on the French model.
 Detained persons do not have the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of their detention, but by law
 arrests cannot be made without formal charges. By law,
 persons arrested must be charged or released within 48 hours.
 In political cases, the authorities do not always obey the
 law, and incommunicado detention is sometimes utilized.
 Malian law does not provide for release on bail, but detainees
 are sometimes'released on their own recognizance.
 Administrative backlogs often cause delays in bringing people
 to trial. Detainees are usually allowed access to a lawyer of
 their choice. In fact, lawyers are quite active in making
 sure that detainees have representation; many provide pro bono
 service.
 A state of emergency and curfew were implemented in the 6th
 and 7th regions on July 10 in accordance with the
 Constitution. Chefs d'arrondissement (roughly analogous to
 governors) and military authorities were granted wider powers,
 
 
 MALI
 including the power to control the press and communications
 and to intern those deemed a threat for up to 2 months.
 Tuareg dissidents and their suspected supporters were held
 under these emergency provisions in these regions; others were
 brought to Bamako for detention. The Government gave no
 indication during 1990 of the numbers of Tuaregs detained by
 military authorities or of those still in detention at year's
 end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A part of the executive branch, the judiciary is not
 independent. The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and
 supervises both law enforcement and judicial functions.
 Judges complain of government and party pressure. The
 Superior Judicial Council, which supervises judicial activity,
 is headed by the President. The Supreme Court is the highest
 court, with both judicial and administrative.powers. The
 Supreme Court also has the ability to declare laws
 unconstitutional. The National Assembly can convene the High
 Court of Justice to hear cases against state ministers, but
 this Court did not meet during 1990.
 Corruption remains a political issue, and trials against
 corrupt officials continued in 1990, notably in the Special
 Court of State Security, a military court. The Special Court
 heard 46 cases from January until June 199U. All cases
 involved allegations of embezzlement. Of the persons found
 guilty, four were sentenced to life imprisonment and one
 received the death sentence. In the Special Court, defendants
 usually admit guilt in the hope of receiving a more lenient
 sentence and allow their lawyers to argue mitigating
 circumstances. The verdict and sentence are rendered by a
 panel of three judges, including civilian judges and armed
 forces officers. The death penalty is mandatory under the law
 for anyone convicted of embezzling more than $36,000.
 However, in most embezzlement trials, restitution by the
 accused can decrease the severity of the sentence. Once
 convicted, a person may appeal for a presidential pardon or
 request a new trial.' The right to request a presidential
 pardon or a new trial exists in mandatory death penalty
 cases. No death sentences issued by the Special Court were
 carried out in 1990. As far as is known, there were no
 political prisoners or detainees, other than the Tuaregs, at
 the end of 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Inviolability of the home is provided for in the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Police searches are
 infrequent, and warrants are issued and recorded, though
 sometimes after the fact. Local authorities sometimes seize
 and open mail extralegally. Under the law, private letters
 may be opened only if the President declares the country is
 facing political crisis. In such cases, the only organization
 that may legally open personal mail is a special intelligence
 service responsible to the Presidency. The state of emergency
 declared in the north specifically permits inspection of
 mail. In fact, mail not covered by such crises is also
 opened.
 Party membership is a prerequisite for holding a senior
 government position but not for holding most civil service
 jobs. All citizens are encouraged (but not required) to join
 
 
 226
 MALI
 for a nominal fee. Membership has reportedly been falling off
 among young people.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 There were credible allegations of brutal treatment of
 civilians by both the Malian military and Tuareg insurgents in
 the Gao region during the summer of 1990. One group of Tuareg
 villagers at Djebock, near Gao, was reported to have been
 saved from execution by the military when the Bambara governor
 intervened. According to, one fragmentary report, the military
 forced another family group to stand in a ditch and then
 tossed in.a grenade, killing many. At the same time, there
 were reliable reports of torture and mutilation of bodies by
 the Tuareg insurgents. The number of dead in the conflict is
 uncertain, but data published in mid-September by independent
 sources set the figures at several hundred on each side,
 including civilians.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution does not expressly provide for freedom of
 speech and press. Questioning of government authority outside
 party deliberations has been rare in the past, but in 1990
 Malians began publicly criticizing the country's one-party
 system. During party meetings in March commemorating the
 anniversary of Mali's ruling party, most speakers
 participating in a "democracy within the party" debate openly
 criticized the single-party system, advocated a multiparty
 approach, and denied that political pluralism would degenerate
 into tribalism in Mali. According to the independent press,
 this debate grew more heated and divisive during an
 extraordinary meeting of the National Council held in August.
 President Moussa Traore presided as party dignitaries argued
 bitterly over multiparty system and democracy within the party.
 The Government controls Malian radio and television and
 publishes a daily newspaper, all of which reflect official
 positions. While the Constitution is silent, the law (most
 recently that enacted in 1988) permits freedom of the press,
 and the Government has allowed a number of independent
 journals to open since 1989. These include the French
 language Les Echos, La Roue, Aurore, Saniya, and Danbe, the
 journal of the National Committee for Democratic Initiative.
 The independent publications have played an active role in
 opening the debate on a multiparty system, publishing accounts
 of events that differed significantly from those of official
 organs, and providing critical commentary on actions and
 positions taken by the Government. Les Echos published an
 open letter from a group of private citizens to the President
 urging political reform. L'Aurore reprinted a declaration by
 the National Union of Malian Workers calling for a multiparty
 system, the first public statement in support of
 democratization. The independent press also reported on the
 Tuareg insurgency, with one publication criticizing the
 Government for its lack of openness about the situation in
 Gao, but supporting the Government's view that the insurgency
 was sparked by an external attack. These newspapers are
 distributed widely in Bamako as well as in regional centers.
 International publications, including those having articles
 critical of Mali and its Government, are available.
 
 
 MALI
 The Government occasionally cracked down on the press in
 1990. In March the editor of Mali's most critical
 publication, La Roue, was detained for 48 hours and questioned
 by local police but was never formally charged. Independent
 journalists were forcibly removed from the National Council's
 June session, and two were briefly detained by police, but
 representatives of the Government were permitted to remain due
 to their status as employees of the UDPM. Government
 authorities generally seize political tracts printed by
 organizations not formally recognized by the Government, but
 there were no known arrests of pamphleteers. A Malian
 employed by the French Communist newspaper L'Humanite was
 arrested in July for alleged possession of seditious material
 pertaining to the death of Mali's first president, Modibo
 Keita. The charges were dropped and the journalist released
 after 5 days in detention, and no other punitive action was
 taken against the journalist.
 There is no legal restraint on academic freedom, but self-
 censorship is the rule. Lack of materials and timidity on the
 part of civil service teachers fearful of transfer to distant
 villages inhibit free debate in the classroom. In late 1988,
 students who protested government policies were jailed. All
 were subsequently released, in part through the reporting
 efforts of Les Echos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to form
 organizations to protect their professional interests, but in
 reality only selected nonpolitical organizations such as urban
 professional associations qualify. The primary groups that
 assemble freely are the women's, youth, and similar
 associations of Mali's single political party. Demonstrations
 and marches require permission from the central executive
 bureau of the party. In October a small, peaceful
 demonstration in favor of democracy was broken up by police,
 and four persons were briefly detained. The Government also
 used tear gas to control the most violent riots in a decade in
 Bamako on December 3.' The riots erupted following a
 government announcement that unlicensed street vendors would
 be prevented from practicing their trade. There were no
 casualties.
 The Constitution provides for only one party; independent
 political activists avoid portraying themselves as part of an
 opposition party. Mali's independent newspapers and human
 rights organizations have demanded the elimination of article
 five of the Malian Constitution which recognizes the
 Democratic Union of the Malian People (UDPM) as Mali's only
 legal party and effectively outlaws other political parties.
 However, two organizations calling for democracy and a
 multiparty system were established in the fall of 1990. The
 National Committee for Democratic Initiative (CNID) and the
 Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), led by prominent human
 rights and student activists, have been allowed to form and
 operate unimpeded by the Government. An independent journal
 published CNID's political manifesto which called for, among
 other things, a multiparty system and greater respect for
 human rights. CNID also criticized the Government for
 postponing further internal UDPM discussion of political
 pluralism until March 1991. On December 10 and 30, CNID
 sponsored peaceful demonstrations for a multiparty system that
 attracted thousands of people and that proceeded through the
 streets without police interference.
 
 
 228
 MALI
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is a secular state. The Government generally does not
 discriminate on religious grounds. Although 90 percent of
 Malians are Muslim, other religions may practice their faiths
 freely and are permitted to establish houses'of worship as
 well as schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths
 enjoy government cooperation. Proselytizing and conversion
 are permitted, except in the case of the Baha'i. The
 Government prohibits publications in which one religious group
 defames another; the Minister of Territorial Administrations
 determines whether such a publication is defamatory. However,
 this law is rarely used. While administrative orders
 promulgated in 1977 prohibiting Baha'i from meeting in groups
 of more than three people iemain in force, these orders are
 not actively enforced and Baha'i practice their faith without
 interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 police checks occur in which Malians and foreigners alike are
 stopped, particularly at night. These checks are used
 ostensibly to restrict the movement of contraband goods and to
 check vehicle registrations. In practice, some police
 supplement their salaries by assessing ad hoc fines or
 confiscating goods. Foreign travel requires an exit visa, but
 this is easy to obtain. Repatriation is not restricted.
 Due to attacks by Tuareg dissidents, the Government imposed
 some travel restrictions in the Gao and Timbuctu regions in
 July. These restrictions continued throughout the remainder
 of 1990. The Government attempted to isolate potential Tuareg
 dissidents by designating a special security zone in which
 residents were required to relocate near government security
 installations or else be assumed hostile by the military.
 In past drought years, Mali both accepted and generated
 displaced persons. Several thousand Malians, mostly Tuareg,
 were repatriated to Mali from Algeria in 1990 under a
 bilateral accord. There is some evidence that this
 repatriation was poorly coordinated and that receiving areas
 were ill-equipped to deal with the repatriates. This may have
 contributed to Tuareg dissidence. In 1990 Mali permitted
 entry to between 7,000 and 8,000 Peulh refugees from
 Mauritania and several hundred refugees from Liberia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government
 through peaceful means. Important policies and decisions are
 made by the President, in consultation with the 19-member
 Central Executive Bureau of the UDPM and the Council of
 Ministers. The memberships of these groups overlap. The
 military role in governing Mali remains important, but
 civilian participation in the leadership groups has been
 growing. Pressure for structural political change may have
 prompted the President to call an extraordinary session of the
 National Council in August that focused on democracy within
 the one-party State. Mali held local party elections in
 October in preparation for the 1991 UDPM congress. Party
 elections are indirect, with an emphasis placed on arriving at
 consensus rather than political competition. However, in this
 
 
 229
 MALI
 year's elections for party offices, the party allowed direct
 competition among members for party offices that led, in a few
 cases, to violent confrontations between candidates'
 supporters.
 Although multiple candidates often contest party elections at
 the local level, only carefully selected party candidates run
 for seats in the National Assembly. These elections occur
 every 4 years. Party elections held November 4-were marred by
 allegations of administrative irregularities and claims that
 the Government had exaggerated the number of voters. Proposed
 legislation is debated and endorsed in the National Assembly,
 after its acceptance by the Council of Ministers and review by
 the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviews cases to see
 that the law has been correctly applied or that the law is
 constitutional.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government affirms that it adheres to the principles of
 the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It has not,
 however, been receptive to inquiries on human rights. It did
 not reply to Amnesty International's (AI) call in 1988 for an
 investigation into conditions at Taodenit prison (closed since
 1988), and it rejected AI's more recent call for
 investigations of summary executions in the north. Malian
 officials have not allowed an independent investigation into
 these charges. The Government did permit the French Secretary
 of State for Humanitarian Action to travel to the Gao region
 and speak with Tuareg leaders there. The independent Malian
 Association for Human Rights, established in 1989, is engaged
 in individual cases having a human rights component and in
 sponsoring seminars on human rights issues. An example of the
 Association's activities in 1990 was its intervention to
 secure the release of a journalist arrested in July.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language,-or Social Status
 Virtually all of Mali's ethnic groups are represented at the
 highest state and party levels. Nevertheless, some members of
 nomadic groups are not completely integrated into the economic
 and political mainstream. In particular, there is
 longstanding resentment among Tuaregs at being ruled by a
 government composed of a number of other ethnic groups; this
 factor may also have contributed to violent dissidence in
 northeastern Mali in 1990.
 Social and cultural factors place men in the dominant position
 in Mali. There are a number of women in the professions and
 in important posts in government, but economic opportunity for
 educated women is limited. Women live under harsh conditions,
 especially in the rural areas.
 Traditional practice and existing Malian laws place women at a
 disadvantage with regard to family law and property rights. A
 group of female jurists is seeking improved legal protection
 for women and in 1990 addressed the rights of widows.
 Currently, a widow has no right to her husband's property or
 custody of children conceived during the marriage.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is accepted in
 Malian society, though there are no statistics to indicate how
 
 
 230
 MALI
 widespread it may be. The society generally does not tolerate
 spousal abuse that results in physical injury and deals with
 the problem informally at the village level; for example, a
 village chief may intervene to stop the abuse and punish the
 perpetrator. Legal action for redress of injury is not
 normally available, although severe physical injury is a
 ground for divorce. The issue of spousal abuse has not been
 addressed by the Government. The National Union of Malian
 Women (UNFM) focuses primarily on establishing cooperatives,
 improving health programs, and fostering education. Both the
 Union and an independent women's group campaign against female
 circumcision, which is still a widely accepted social practice
 in Mali. While the Government has taken a public position
 against female circumcision, its efforts directed against the
 practice are educative rather than punitive.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution specifically provides for the freedom of
 citizens to form organizations to protect their "professional
 interests." However, workers' right of association is limited
 to the National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM). The UNTM
 comprises 12 unions and is Mali's only recognized workers'
 organization. The UNTM maintains a degree of autonomy from
 the Government, and unlike the women's and youth associations,
 is not officially a part of the party. Although subject to
 considerable government influence and control, the UNTM does
 take positions independent of the Government. In 1990 the
 UNTM became the first major Malian organization to put itself
 on record in support of a multiparty system and to condemn
 publicly the single-party system. The UNTM Secretary General
 is a party member, although not a member of the party Central
 Executive ,Council.
 Strikes are rarely permitted, and those deemed by the
 Government to be taken for political reasons are illegal.
 Given Mali's high level of unemployment, most workers are
 reluctant to strike for long periods of time. By law, any
 union planning to go on strike must notify the UNTM and get
 prior approval. In the case of the student and teacher
 strikes of 1988, no approval was given, but the strikes still
 occurred and many participants suffered reprisals. The
 International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on freedom
 of Association concluded that the 1988 government-directed
 transfers, dismissals, and arrests of teachers constituted an
 infringement on freedom of association. The Malian Supreme
 Court decided in favor of one teacher who the ILO felt had
 been wrongfully dismissed. While welcoming this positive
 court action, the ILO called on the Malian authorities to take
 steps to reinstate other teachers involved in the same strike;
 as far as is known, all the teachers who had been dismissed
 were reinstated.
 The UNTM maintains contacts with international labor
 organizations, both public and private. The UNTM is
 affiliated with two international labor bodies: the
 Organization of West African Workers and the Organization of
 African Trade-Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no legal constraints by the Government or employers
 on workers attempting to organize, but, in practice, Mali's
 
 
 231
 MALI
 unitary party system effectively inhibits the workers' right
 to organize. True collective bargaining does not take place.
 The UNTM has a policy role in the agreements negotiated by the
 individual member unions, and the Government, through the
 Minister of Labor, must approve all wage and related
 agreements. Wages and salaries are set by tripartite
 negotiations between the Ministry of Labor, the labor unions,
 and representatives of the federation of employers of the
 sector for which the wages are being set. These-negotiations
 result in sector-wide collective conventions.
 There are no export processing zones in Kali.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits.forced or compulsory labor, and
 this prohibition is generally observed in practice. Although
 not sanctioned or upheld by law, debt slavery exists in the
 salt mining communities north of Timbuktu. Individuals pay
 off debts to local merchants by working under primitive and
 dangerous conditions in the salt mines, with the debt and
 obligation often passed from one generation to the next.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, but with parents'
 permission children may be apprenticed at age 12. In
 practice, children in rural areas join the family farming work
 force at a much younger age. As workers in the informal
 sector, they are not protected by laws against unjust ,
 compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge. The
 Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor is
 responsible for enforcement of child labor laws. The law is
 reasonably effective in the modern sector, but this has no
 effect on the vast number of children who work in the informal
 sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Mali has a detailed labor code specifying conditions of
 employment, including hours, wages, and social security
 benefits. The normal workweek is 44 hours. The minimum wage
 is approximately $28.00 per month, and is supplemented by a
 required package of benefits, including social security and
 health care benefits. While this could provide a minimum
 standard of living if it went to support only one person, most
 wage earners support extended families. In addition, most
 people work in the informal sector, outside the realm of these
 rules and conventions. Health and safety standards vary
 depending upon the category of work. While in theory the
 Labor Inspection Service oversees these standards, there is
 limited enforcement due to the lack of inspectors. Employers
 are required to pay into a national social security fund.
