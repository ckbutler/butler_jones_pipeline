 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a 1947 Constitution. Sovereignty
 is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. Executive
 power is exercised by a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and ministers of
 state, responsible to the Diet, a two-house parliament. The Diet, elected by univer-
 sal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister, who must be a mem-
 ber of that body. The Government, formed in November, is a loose coalition led by
 the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in which the Social Democratic Party and the
 New Party Sakigake cooperate with the LDP from outside the Cabinet. The judici-
 ary is independent of the Government.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace and is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be credible reports that police committed some human rights
 abuses.
 The industrialized free market economy is highly efficient and competitive in
 world markets and provides residents with a high standard of living.
 A just and efficient legal system generally assures observance of constitutionally
 provided human rights. There continue to be some credible reports that police phys-
 ically and psychologically abused prisoners and detainees. Officials are sometimes
 dismissed for such abuse but are seldom tried, convicted, and imprisoned. The
 Burakumin (a group historically treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indigenous
 people), women, and alien residents experience varying degrees of societal discrimi-
 nation, some of it severe and longstanding. The Ministry of Justice handles com-
 laints of discrimination by issuing instructions recommending that such practices
 e avoided. However, the Ministry's Human Rights Defense Bureau has a small
 staff and limited investigative or enforcement powers. Since the administrative sys-
 tem for combating human rights violations is weak, many cases end up in court.
 However, during the year, the Government passed legislation to promote Ainu cul-
 ture, ameliorate women's working conditions, and promote employment of disabled
 persons. The Government also reversed its longstanding opposition to the employ-
 ment of noncitizen civil servants by localities and municipalities.
 In March a law establishing a Human Rights Commission within the Justice Min-
 istry came into effect. The Commission's 5-year mandate is to develop measures to
 educate citizens with regard to human rights ideals, and to promote measures to
 ameliorate the effects of existing human rights violations. The Commission is also
 tasked with advising the Education Ministry and Management and Coordination
 Agency on how to educate citizens about the importance of respecting human rights.
 The Commission has 2 years to submit recommendations on rights-related education
 and 5 years to submit recommendations on relief measures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There was one reported suicide under suspicious circumstances of a Japanese man
 in police custody, and one reported death of a foreign national while in the custody
 of immigration officials (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, reports by several Japanese bar associa-
 tions, human rights groups, and some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use
 physical violence, including kicking and beating, as well as psychological intimida-
 tion, including threats and name calling, to obtain confessions from suspects in cus-
 tody or to enforce discipline. There were also scattered allegations of beatings of de-
 tainees in immigration detention facilities.
 In Japan confession is regarded as the first step in the rehabilitative process. Al-
 though under the Constitution no criminal suspect can be compelled to make a self-
 incriminating confession, roughly 90 percent of all criminal cases going to trial in-
 clude confessions, reflecting the priority that the system places on admissions of
 guilt. The Government points out that the high percentage of confessions, like the
 high conviction rate, is reflective of a higher standard of evidence needed to bring
 about indictment in the Japanese system. Since a system of arraignment does not
 exist a sus ct, if indicted, is brought to trial even if that person has confessed to
 the crime. This results in a higher conviction rate than would otherwise be the case.
 
 
 Appellate courts have overturned several convictions in recent years on the
 ground that they were obtained as a result of forced confession. In addition, civil
 and criminal suits have been brought against some police and prosecution officials
 alleging abuse during interrogation and detention. In July two police officers were
 dismissed for fabricating a suspect's confession, and three other officers were ac-
 cused of framing an innocent citizen on drug possession charges. Eight additional
 police officials, including a municipal police department superintendent, were rep-
 rimanded for failing to adequately supervise these policemen.
 Prison conditions meet most minimum international standards. However, prisons
 in Japan are not heated and prisoners are given only minimal additional clothing
 to protect themselves against cold weather. There have been cases of frostbite
 among the prison population. For the past 2 years, the quantity of starch in the
 prison diet has been reduced, ostensibly with a commensurate increase in the quan-
 tity of side dishes. However, despite the fact that foreign prisoners receive a higher
 calorie allowance than Japanese prisoners, many foreign inmates complain that the
 quantity of food is insufficient and that they are constantly hungry. Prisoners may
 notpurchase or be given supplementary food. Letters to and from prisoners may be
 read and censored, or confiscated. All visits from family and friends are monitored,
 and prisoners are strongly discouraged from complaining about conditions. Prison
 officials claim the "no complaining" rule is designed to keep family members from
 worrying about their loved ones.
 The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations and human rights groups have criti-
 cized the prison system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to nu-
 merous rules. Prison rules are confidential, guards sometimes selectively enforce
 them and impose punishment, including "minor solitary confinement," which may
 be imposed for at least 1 and not more than 60 days and in which the prisoner is
 made to sit (for foreigners) or kneel (for Japanese) motionless in the middle of an
 empty cell.
 In November a Japanese man died in police custody while being questioned for
 allegedly violating the Firearms and Swords Control Law. According to press re-
 ports, the officers handed the confiscated gun and bullets to the suspect, and then
 left the room. The suspect loaded the gun and shot himself.
 In August an Iranian illegal immigrant awaiting deportation died while being
 held in Tokyo's immigration detention center. According to press reports, the man
 fought with immigration officials after they found a cigarette lighter in his cell.
 Eight immigration officials subdued the man by wrapping him in a blanket and tak-
 ing him to another cell, where they made him sit on the floor. The man reportedly
 fell backwards and hit his head on the floor, dislocating his cervical vertebrae. He
 was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Police are investigating the death.
 In December a Tochigi prefectural police officer was arrested and fired on sus-
 picion of moblesting a woman while she was in police custody. The officer admitted
 to the molestation, and the chief of the Tochigi Prefectural Police Personnel and
 Training Bureau apologized to the woman, who did not press charges.
 Some human rights groups allege that physical restraints, such as leather hand-
 cuffs, have been used as a form ofpunishment and that prisoners have been forced
 to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints. Ministry
 of Justice officials state that restraints are used inside the prison only when pris-
 oners have been violent and pose a threat to themselves and others, or when there
 is concern that a prisoner might attempt to escape.
 The Government restricts access to prisons and detention facilities by human
 rights groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional provisions for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are respected in practice. The law provides
 for judicial determination of the legality of detention. People may not be detained
 without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that-probable cause exists in order to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in olice custody for up to 72 hours with-
 out judicial proceedings. Preindictment custody may be extended by a judge for up
 to 20 additional days.If an indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a crimi-
 nal detention facility. Bail is available in only about 25 percent of cases.
 The bar associations and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." Although the law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 "houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police detention facility may
 be substituted at the order of the court. This provision was originally added to cover
 a shortage of normal detention facilities. According to the most recent Ministry of
 Justice White Paper on Crime, published in 1995, normal detention facilities were
 filled to 53 percent of capacity in 1994. Critics charge that allowing suspects to be
 detained by the same authorities who interrogate them heightens the potential for
 
 
 802
 abuse and coercion. The Government counters that adequate safeguards to prevent
 abuse, including strong judicial oversight, have been built into the system.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 3 months from date of arrest; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in duration and fre-
 quency, although the Government denies that this is the case. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Code grants the prosecution and investigating police officials the power to con-
 trol access to attorneys before indictment when deemed necessary for the sake of
 the investigation. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indict-
 ment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney before indict-
 ment, although local bar associations may provide detainees with a free counseling
 session prior to indictment. Counsel is provided at government expense after indict-
 ment if the arrested person cannot afford one. Counsel may not be present during
 interrogation at any time before or after indictment. With these exceptions, the Gov-
 ernment affirms that the right of the accused to seek legal counsel is fully respected
 and that attorneys are almost always able to see clients without obstruction.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and free from execu-
 tive branch interference. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can
 be renewed until judges have reached the age of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court
 can serve until the age of 70 but face periodic review through popular referendum.
 There are several levels of courts, high courts, district courts, family courts, and
 summary courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority.
 Normally a trial begins at the district court level, and a verdict may be appealed
 to a high court and then to the Supreme Court.
 The Government respects in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to
 a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. There is
 no trial by jury. The defendant is informed of charges upon arrest and assured a
 public trial by an independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right of
 cross-examination. The Constitution provides defendants with the right not to be
 compelled to testify against themselves as well as to free and private access to coun-
 sel. The Government contends that the right to consult with attorneys is not an ab-
 solute one, and can be restricted if such restriction is compatible with the spirit of
 the Constitution. Access is sometimes abridged in practice. For example, the law al-
 lows prosecutors to control access to counsel before indictment, and there are per-
 sistent allegations of coerced confessions. Defendants are protected from the retro-
 active application of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evidence
 after a formal indictment has been made. However, the law does not require full
 disclosure by the prosecutor, and material that the prosecution will not use in court
 may be suppressed. Critics claim that legal representatives of defendants do not al-
 ways have access to all relevant material in the police record, in order to enable
 them to prepare the defense. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of
 a trial court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal to
 a higher court.
 Th~ere are no guideines mandating the acceptable quality of communications be-
 tween judges, lawyers, and non-Japanese speaking defendants. There is no standard
 licensing or qualification system for certifying court interpreters, and a trial may
 proceed even if the accused does not understand what is happening or being sai
 The press reported that in a January murder case, the judge, attempting to save
 time, ordered the interpreter not to translate the verdict to the Thai accused, saying
 that the defense attorney could tell the accused later.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. Settling a
 10-year-old case, in June the intermediate appellate court held that the prefectural
 police had illegally wiretapped the home of a senior member of the Japanese Com-
 munist Party.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.
 Academic freedom is protected, except in the case of school textbooks. The Edu-
 cation Ministry has the authority to censor or order revisions to elementary, middle,
 
 
 803
 and high school textbooks. Settling a 13-year-old lawsuit brought by a textbook au-
 thor, the Supreme Court ruled in August that the Education Ministry had, in this
 particular instance, illegally ordered the deletion or rewriting of a textbook's pas-
 sages containing references to the Imperial Army's conduct during World War II.
 However, the Court also held that state censorship of textbooks did not violate the
 constitutional provisions for freedom of expression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 In November the Tokyo High Court upheld a lower court ruling that Tokyo metro-
 politan police had unlawfully arrested three demonstrators and had assaulted a
 fourth demonstrator in 1989 and ordered the Tokyo municipal government to pay
 damags
 c. redom of Religion.-Freedom of religion and the separation of state and reli-
 gion are provided for in the Constitution and are respected in practice. While Bud-
 dhism and Shintoism are the two major religions, there are many others including
 several Christian denominations. Some temples and shrines receive public support
 as national historic or cultural sites. This situation may change, however, in the
 wake of an April ruling by the Supreme Court that a prefectural government may
 not contribute public money to only one religious organization, if the donations sup-
 ported, encouraged, and promoted a specific religious group.
 The Government does not require that religious groups be licensed. However, to
 receive official recognition as a religious organization, which brings tax benefits and
 other advantages, a gup must register with local or national authorities as a "reli-
 gious corporation." In practice, almost all religious groups register. In response to
 the Aum Shinrikyo terrorist attacks, a 1996 Amendment to the Religious Corpora-
 tion Law gives governmental authorities increased oversight of religious groups and
 requires greater disclosure of financial assets by religious corporations. In December
 the Cultural Agency announced that nearly 5,000 religious groups across the coun-
 try apeared dormant, and some of these may have been used for tax evasion.
 In February the Public Security Commission rejected a Government proposal that
 the Auma Shinrikyo religious cult be outlawed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely both within Japan and abroad,
 to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japa-
 nese nationality may he lost by naturalization in a foreign country, or by failure of
 people born with dual nationality to eldct Japanese nationality at the required age.
 The Government has granted asylum to those claiming fear of persecution if they
 return to their homeland in only a small number of cases. It believes that most peo-
 ple seeking asylum in Japan do so for economic reasons. Between January 1996 and
 August 1997, only 2 of the 345 applicants met the required standard for and were
 granted asylum.
 The Government has shown flexibility in dealing with visa extensions for Chinese
 student dissidents, although it continues to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 The Government's 60-day rule requires applicants to appear at an immigration of-
 fice within 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of learning that they are likely to
 be persecuted in their home country. Individuals who do not present their applica-
 tions within the 60-day time frame due to extenuating circumstances may apply as
 an exception to the rule, even after the 60-day period had passed. An alien who is
 recognized as a refugee has access to educational facilities, public relief and aid, and
 social welfare benefits. An alien who is denied refugee status may appeal the deci-
 sion to the Ministry of Justice. In an effort to make procedures clearer to applicants,
 the Government distributes an English-language pamphlet to those interested in the
 asylum process.
 While the Government sometimes grants first asylum, there are no standard pro-
 cedures established, and the Justice Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Ministry de-
 cide upon such grants jointly on a case-by-case basis. In January an illegal alien
 Chinese prodemocracy activist was denied asylum status. He spent 18 months in a
 detention center before being released on condition that he agree to resettle in Den-
 mark. In exchange for being granted a special permit enabling him to leave Japan
 legally, he had to withdraw an administrative law suit asking the district court to
 order the State to recognize him as a refugee. There were no reports that persons
 .were forcibly returned to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government and are able to ex-
 ercise this right in practice through frequent, free, and fair elections on the basis
 of universal suffrage by secret ballot. Citizens living overseas are not entitled to
 
 
 804
 vote in local and national elections. In November 1996, a group of expatriates filed
 suit against the Government, claiming that the election law deprived them of the
 constitutionally provided right to vote. The case is still pending.
 A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed by the political _party or parties
 able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. From 1955 until
 1993, all prime ministers and almost all cabinet ministers were members of the Lib-
 eral Democratic Party, which enjoyed a majority in the lower house throughout this
 period. Since 1993, except for a brief period of non-LDP coalition government from
 August 1993 to June 1994, the LDP has been part of successive coalition govern-
 ments.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation. Women make up
 7.7 percent of the Diet. Women hold 23 seats in the 500-member lower house of the
 Diet (4.6 percent), and 35 seats in the 252-member upper house (13.8 percent). As
 of November, the 21-member Cabinet had no female members.
 There is one Ainu member of the Diet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local and international human rights organizations function freely,
 without governmental restrictions or impediments, investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative
 and responsive to their views, although the Government restricts access to prisons
 and detention facilities by human rights groups (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, sex, social
 status, or family origin, and, in general, the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-According to the National Police Agency, 450 incidents of spousal abuse
 against women were reported to authorities in 1995. However, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often may go unreported due to social and
 cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endangering the reputation of one's
 spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women often return to the home of their
 parents rather than file reports with authorities. Therefore, National Police Agency
 statistics on violence against women undoubtedly understate the scope of the cur-
 rent situation. Many local governments are responding positively to a need for con-
 fidential assistance by establishing special women's consultation departments in po-
 lice and prefectural offices.
 The number of illegal female workers increased by 5.4 percent in 1996. According
 to the Ministry of Justice, 484 of the 20,325 illegal female workers deported from
 Japan in 1996 were prostitutes (2.4 percent). The Government is working to reduce
 the foreign prostitute problem by enforcing existing antiprostitution laws as well as
 provisions in the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act directed against
 anyone encouraging a person to engage in illegal work. In recent years, police, espe-
 cially in Tokyo, have conducted a number of sweeps against both foreign prostitutes
 and their employers.
 Sexual harassment in the workplace is widespread, as evidenced by a 1996 report
 compled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, RENGO, in which 40 percent
 of working women reported that they had experienced some form of sexual harass-
 ment. Sexual harassment occurs in a range of actions, including sexually charged
 jokes, comments about physical features such as breast size, the display of prno-
 graphic photos, molestation, direct requests for sexual favors, and unwanted odily
 contact. Two percent of the survey respondents said that they were forced to have
 a sexual relationship. A government white paper released in July, using a narrower
 definition, reported that 25.7 percent of women had been sexually harassed at work.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and sexual harassment has in-
 creased, but there is no indication that incidents of discrimination and sexual har-
 assment are decreasing. Women make up 39.2 percent of the Japanese labor force,
 and women age 15 to 64 have a labor force participation rate of 50 percent. How-
 ever, according to a Management and Coordination Agency survey conducted from
 April to June 1996, 92.5 percent of Japanese companies surveyed had not taken any
 preventive measures against sexual harassment. Seventy-five percent of the firms
 said that they felt no need to take such measures. A growing number of government
 entities are establishing hot lines and designating ombudsmen to handle complaints
 of discrimination and sexual harassment.
 The Constitution prohibits sexual discrimination and stipulates individual dignity
 and the essential equality of the sexes in the family. The Labor Standard Law for-
 
 
 805
 bids wage discrimination against women. The Government passed several additional
 pieces of legislation designed to equalize employment and promotion opportunities
 and combat sexual harassment. In May the Government passed a law allowing
 women to work overtime shifts for the first time. Under the previous laws, in effect
 since 1947, women were prohibited from working between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.,
 with only a few exceptions. Also in May, the Government passed a new Equal Em-
 ployment Opportunity (EEO) Law banning employers from discriminating against
 women, his law was designed to strengthen the 1986 EEO Law, which instructed
 employers to make efforts to stop discrimination in recruiting, hiring, assignments,
 and promotion of workers. However, the new law's only penalty is that names of
 companies that practice sexual discrimination can be publicized. The Ministry of
 Labor does not enforce compliance through fines or other punitive penalties. Also
 in May, the Government revised the Labor Standard Law to allow an arbitration
 committee to initiate procedures to help ensure the rights of female workers at the
 worker's request, without first having to obtain approval from both management
 and an employee's union.
 Although as noted the law prohibits discrimination against women in wages, fe-
 male workers on average earned only 62 percent of average male earnings. Much
 of this disparity results from the "two-track" personnel administration system found
 in most larger companies. Under this system, newly hired employees are put into
 one of two categories: Managerial track (those engaged in planning and decision-
 making jobs andwith the potential to become top executives), or clerical track (those
 engaged in general office work). According to a 1995 Ministry of Labor survey, 72
 percent of companies responding said that they hired only male workers for mana-
 gerial track jobs. Female workers have also suffered disproportionately from the
 continued sluggishness of the economy. Because married women are designated as
 spouses on the family income tax return, women who earn more than $8,500 (1.03
 million yen) per year face the loss of income tax benefits and their husbands may
 lose corporate family allowances.
 According to the National Personnel Authority, as of March 1995, women made
 up 16.4 percent of all national government workers, but held only 3.8 percent of top
 (director level and higher) government posts. According to the Home Ministry,
 women constituted 31.4 percent of all local government workers, but held only 3.2
 percent of top local government positions.
 In addition to discrimination, traditional male/female division of labor at home
 place disproportionate burdens on'working women. According to a 1995 Japan Insti-
 tute of Lbor survey, in double income households where the wife works full time,
 the wife performs 64 percent of all household duties. In households where the wife
 works part-time, she performs 85 percent of all household duties.
 In September the Government acknowledged that nearly 16,500 disabled women
 were sterilized without their consent between 1949 and 1992. In its acknowledg-
 ment the Government stated that it did not plan to apologize or pay compensation.
 to these women, or to further investigate the program, despite the demands of Na-
 tional Federation for the Mentally Handicapped and sever other groups represent-
 ing women and the disabled. A Ministry of Health official said that no apology was
 planned because the procedure was legal at the time. The Eugenic Protection Law,
 revoked only in 1996, allowed doctors to sterilize people with mental or physical dis-
 abilities or certain hereditary diseases without their consent, after the approval of
 committees appointed by local governments. Women's and disabled persons advo-
 cacy groups are still pressing for a government investigation into all sterilization
 cases and for a formal apology and compensation.
 In 1993 the Prime Minister publicly acknowledged and apologized for the former
 Imperial Government's involvement in the army's practice of forcing an estimated
 200,000 women (including Koreans, Filipinas, Chinese, Indonesians, Burmese,
 Dutch, and Japanese) to provide sex to soldiers between 1932 and 1945. Five cases
 concerning the "comfort women" problem are pending in the Tokyo District Court.
 In four cases the plaintiffs are seeking monetary compensation; in one case the
 plaintiff is seeking an official apology from the Government.
 The Asian Women's Fund was established in July 1995 as a private, government-
 sponsored fund to compensate former comfort women. The fund supports three types
 of prjects: Providing direct compensation payments to individual victims; providing
 medical and welfare assistance to individual comfort women; and funding projects
 to improve the general status of women and girls in Asia. Projects in the first cat-
 egory are funded by private donations, the second and third types of projects are
 financed by the Government and administered by the fund. As of December, the
 fund had collected donations totaling approximately $4 million (480 million yen),
 and given lump-sum payments of almost $18,600 (2 millionyen) each and a letter
 of apology signed by the Prime Minister to over 50 Filipina, Korean, and Taiwanese
 
 
 former comfort women. These women also received medical and welfare assistance
 from the fund. More than 50 applications were pending as of December.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, and in
 general, the rights of children are adequately protected. Boys and girls have equal
 access to health care and other public facilities. Education is free and compulsory
 through the lower secondary level. Education is free and universally available at the
 upper seondary level through the age of 18.
 Despite heightened media attention and public expressions of disapproval, the
 Government and society in general appear to take a lenient attitude toward teenage
 prostitution and dating for money, which may or may not involve sexual activities.
 Sex with those under 13 years of age is prohibited, but consensual sex with a 13-
 year-old is not prosecutable under the Criminal Code. According to current laws, in
 order to prove rape and forcible sexual contact with. a minor age 13 or over, the
 prosecution must prove that the attacker threatened or used violence against the
 victim. Currently, laws regarding prostitution with minors over 13 years of age are
 covered only by prefectural government ordinances. Under the present Prostitution
 Prevention Law, selling the sexual services of children is illegal, but purchasing
 those services is not. There is no law that directly prohibits the production and sale
 of child pornography. In 1996, 5,378 teenage girls were taken into police custody for
 sexual misconduct, of whom 562 were engaging in prostitution. According to a police
 survey of those girls, 46.8 percent said that they wanted spending money, while 29.6
 percent said that they acted out of curiosity
 The National Police Agency reported in December that 139,867 teenagers were ar-
 rested between January and November on suspicion of committing criminal offenses,
 about 6,000 more than in 1996. In September the Government lifted the 2-year limit
 on detention in juvenile reformatories, and it issued a directive stating that juve-
 niles can be detaned until the age of 23 if they have not been deemed to have re-
 formed and until the age of 26 if they need psychiatric treatment.
 In recent years, the problem of severe bullyn  or "ijime," has received greater
 public attention. At elementary and junior high schools, bullying most often involves
 verbal abuse, with physical abuse occurring more often at the high school level. The
 Ministry of Education reported that in 1996 there were 51,544 reported cases of bul-
 lying in elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, representing a 14.2 per-
 cent drop in incidents from previous year. However, many cases go unreported and
 the actual number of cases is probably higher. Moreover, incidents of violence
 against fellow students, teachers, and school property increased 31.7 percent from
 the previous year, to 10,575 cases. Education experts suggest that pressures at
 home and school to excel academically may be contributing to the increase in stu-
 dent violence and long-term (30 to 150 days) absenteeism, which rose 15.6 percent
 from 1995. According to the Ministry report, there are cases in which students in-
 tentionally attacked teachers, knowing that the teachers were prohibited by law
 from inflicting physical punishment on students. In August 1994, the Ministry of
 Justice establisIed the Office of Ombudsman for Children's Rights to cope with bul-
 lying and other children's issues. In addition to compiling statistics on bullying and
 consulting with various groups concerned with children's welfare, the Office of Om-
 budsman provides counseling services for children 18 years of age and younger who
 have been victims of bullying.
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on social status or fam-
 ily origin, the Civil Code stipulates that the statutory inheritance share for illegit-
 imoate children is half that of legitimate children. The Government does not view
 this statutory distinction as constituting unreasonable discrimination against illegit-
 imate children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings for
 the disabled.. Although not generally subject to overt discrimination in employment,
 education, or in the provision of other state services, the disabled face limited access
 to public transportation, "mainstream" public education, and other facilities. The
 Deliberation Panel on the Employment of the Handicapped operates within the Min-
 istry of Labor. Since 1976 private companies with 300 or more employees have been
 required to hire a fixed proportion of disabled people. The penalty for noncompliance
 is a fine. In September the Government issued a cabinet directive, effective July 1,
 1998, ordering private companies to raise the proportion of physically disabled per-
 sons in their work force from 1.6 to 1.8 percent, and raising the percentage of dis-
 abled persons among civil servants from 2 to 2.1 percent.
 In Apri the Diet amended the Law To Promote the Employment of the Handi-
 capped to include the mentally disabled. The revision takes effect on July 1, 1998.
 The amendment also loosened the licensing requirements for community support
 centers which promote employment for the disabled, and it introduced government
 
 
 807
 subsidies for the employment of mentally disabled persons in part-time jobs. These
 provisions are scheduled to take effect on April 1, 1998.
 In May 1995 the Headquarters for Promoting the Welfare of Disabled Persons,
 set up by the Prime Minister's Office, issued a directive to the nation's municipali-
 ties to draw up formal plana for care of disabled citizens by the end of March 1997.
 In November 1996, the Ministiy of Health and Welfare also instructed local govern-
 ments to set numerical targets for the number of home helpers and care facilities
 allocated to the disabled. However, accordingt newspaper reports, fewer than one-
 fWfth of the nation's municipalities currentlyhave formal care plans for disabled citi-
 zens.
 Indigenous People.-The Ainu are a people descended from the frst inhabitants
 of Japan. The Ainu Association of Hokkaid estimates the total number at 50,000,
 less than 0.05 percent of the countrs 124 million population. Almost all of them
 live on Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Their primary oc-
 cupations are fishing, small-scale farming, and jobs in the tourism industry. Under
 a 1899 law, the Government pursued a policy of forced assimilation, imposing man-
 datory Japanese education and denying the Ainu their right to continue traditional
 practices.The law also lei the Ainu with control of only approximately 0.15 percent
 of their original holdings.
 In May i993, two Ainu fied a suit against the Government, challenging its right
 to expropriate their land, which the Ainu consider sacred, to build a dam.n Marc
 the Snpporo District Court ruled that the Government had illegally expropriated the
 land, but did not order the Government to return the land to the plaintiffs because
 the dam had already been completed. However, the Court ruled that the Ainu were
 a minority aboriginal race.
 Ainu Diet member Shigeru Kayano was instrumental in the Diet's passage of the
 Law To Promote Ainu Culture and Disseminate Knowledge of Ainu Traditions in
 May. The law officially recognized the Ainu as an ethnic minority, and required all
 prefectural governments to develop basic programs for promoting Ainu  tean
 traditions. It canceled a series of previous laws that discriminatedl against the Ainu
 including the 1899 law. With the new law, the Government for the first time ac-
 knowledged the existence of an ethnic minority in Japan. However, the law stepped
 short of recognizing the Ainu as the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and also failed
 to address whether they deserved special rights as a distinct ethnic group. The new
 law did not mandate civil rights protection for the Ainu. A nonbinding accompany-
 ing resolution referred to the Ainu as a legal Japanese minority  arch the frst
 Ainu-lanage newspaper went to press. The Ainu continue to face societal discrimi-
 nation w    en aging in an uphill struggle against complete assimilation.
 NationallRacollAthnic Minorities.--The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a histr of iso-
 lation from other cultures, ha impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 fessions such as butchering and undertaking), although not subject to governmental
 discrimination, are frequently victims of entrenched societal discrimination, includ-
 ing restricted access to housing and employment opportunities. They are estimated
 to number approximately 3 million, but most prefer to hide their identity. Beginning
 in 1969, the Government introduced with some success a number or social, eco-
 nomic, and legal programs designed to improve conditions for the Burakumin and
 hasten their assimilation into mainstream society. In recent years, however, some
 within the Burakumin community have questioned whether assimilation is an ap-
 propriate goal. When the basic legislation to provide funding for Burakumin pro-
 grams expired in March, the Governmnt enacted legislation effective for 5 years
 that retains 15 of the original 45 programs for Buraku communities. One of these
 progras is aimed at completing housing plans already in progress.
 In May the Buraku Liberation League rewrote its manifesto for the inst time in
 13 years, placing less emphasis on class struggle and more emphasis on civil rights,
 social welfare, and the environment. The new platform also replaced the term
 Burakumin (hamlet people) with Buraku Jumin (hamlet residents), to try to debunk
 the false concept that these people are a different race from other Japanese. The
 platform was adopted at a national convention.
 There are more than 650,000 Korean residents, although the number has ben
 steadily decreasing as Korean nationals naturalize or marry Japanese which allows
 their children to gain Japanese citizenship automatically. Despite improvement in
 legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean permanent residents (most of whom
 were born, raised, and educated in Japan) are still subject to various forms of deeply
 entrenched societal discrimination. By law, aliens with 5 years of continuous resi-
 dence are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship
 
 
 rights, including the right to vote. In practice, however, most eligible aliens choose
 not to apply for citizenship, in part due to fears that their cultural identity would
 thereby he lost. De facto obstacles to naturalization include broad discretion avail-
 able to adjudicating officers and great emphasis on Japanese Ianuage ability. Natu-
 ralization procedures also require an extensive background check, including inquir-
 ies into the applicant's economic status and assimilation into Japanese society. A
 Korean may also be required to adopt a Japanese surname. According to press re-
 ports, many applications are routinely turned down. The Government defends its
 naturalization procedures as being- necessary to ensure the smooth assimilation of
 foreigners into Japanese society. Alien permanent residents may live abroad up to
 5 years without losing their right to permanent residence. In February 1995, the
 Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not bar permanent foreign resi-
 dents from voting in local elections. However, the Court also ruled that existing
 laws denying voting rights to foreign residents are not unconstitutional.
 Under the School Education Law, students attending Chinese, Korean, or other
 non-Japanese schools are not eligile to take national university examinations. In
 December Nagano University dec lared that it had mistakenly admitted and subse-
 quently awared degrees to four ethnic Chinese students who had studied at a Chi-
 nese school. Although the University did not invalidate the degrees already award-
 ed, it announced that it would accept no more students from that high school. Also
 in December, the Ministry of Education, claiming that non-Japanese students are
 not treated unfairly, rejected the petition of a Korean residents advocacy group con-
 taining over 1,300 signatures, which asked that national universities be allowed to
 accept non-Japanese school graduates.
 In 1993 the Government halted the fingerprintingof prmanent foreign residents.
 Instead of fingerprinting, the Government has established a family registry system
 that uses the resident's picture and signature and contains information on parents
 and spouses living in Japan, a system similar to that used for Japanese nationals.
 The current law leaves intact the requirement that all foreign residents carry alien
 registration certificates at all times.
 In 1953 the Government decreed that public servants with administrative author-
 ity and the ability to influence public opinion must be Japanese. Noncitizens were
 prohibited from taking examinations for local government positions. Nevertheless,
 some municipal governments began lifting restrictions on noncitizen civil servants.
 In December 1996, the Home     airs Ministry reversed the long-held national policy
 of opposition to localities lifting the nationality clause and instructed local govern-
 ments to decide at their own discretion. However, the Ministry instructed local ov-
 ernments to restrict noncitizens' access to jobs that involved the exercise of public
 authority and formation of public intent. The directive also required local govern-
 ments to clearly state which jobs were closed to noncitizens. Some of the jobs consid-
 ered off limits include tax collection, construction permit issuance, sanitation inspec-
 tion, and fire fighting.
 Several local governments have already changed their rules in response to the
 Government's new position. The cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, and
 Hisai, and Kanagawa and Koichi Prefectures have opened many jobs to noncitizens.
 In May the Osaka municipal government introduced new guidelines allowing non-
 citizens with permanent residency to engage in jobs in 276 fields, including public
 relations, engineering, and social welfare services. Under the new guidelines, non-
 citizens can be promoted to section chief or higher within the specified fields. In
 June, for the first time, noncitizens took the employment exams for these city and
 prefectural governments. In August two Korean resident women passed the Kobe
 city exam, making them the first noncitizens eligible for employment under the new
 rules. According to a joint survey conducted by the All Japan Prefectural and Mu-
 nicipal Workers Union and the Korean Residents Association in Japan, 19.8 percent
 of local governments still forbid the hiring of noncitizens.
 Critics complain that opening some but not all jobs to noncitizens perpetuates in-
 stitutional discrimination and the perception that noncitizen residents cannot be
 trusted to act in the community's best interest. The system also allows each local
 government to develop it own rules without uniformity being imposed by the na-
 tional government.
 The Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry estimated that, as of January 1,
 there were 282,986 foreign nationals residing illegally in Japan, a decrease of 0.6
 ercent from the previous year. Illegal immigrants come primarily from: South
 orea, the Philippines, Thailand, China, Peru, Iran, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
 While many illegally resident foreigners came in search of better paying manufac-
 turing and construction jobs, these opportunities decreased during the economic
 slowown. Thus, more of the foreign workers are unemployed or marginally em-
 ployed. Some illegal alien workers have been exploited (see Section 5).

 Activist gups claim that employers can easily discriminate against foreign work-
 ers who oen have little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal
 rights. The Government attempts to deal with the problem of illega workers within
 the bounds of existing law. It has tried to reduce the inflow of illegal foreign work-
 ers by prosecuting employers. Recent revisions of the Immigration Law provide for
 penalties against employers of undocumented foreign workers. Suspected foreign
 workers may also be denied entry for passport, visa, and entry application irregular-
 ities. The Government continues to study the foreign worker issue, and several citi-
 zens' groups are working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to in-
 formation on worker rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to associate freely in unions. Almost 12.3 million workers, 22.6 percent of all em-
 ployees, belong to labor unions. Unions are free of government control and influence.
 Most unions are involved in political activity as well as labor relations, but they are
 not controlled by political parties. The Japanese Trade Union Confederation
 (RENGO), which represents 7.6 million workers and was formed in 1989 through
 the merger of several confederations, is the largest labor organization. There is no
 requirement for a single trade union structure, and there are no restrictions on who
 may be a union official. Members of the armed forces, police, and firefighters are
 not permitted either to form unions or to strike. These restrictions have led to a
 long-running dispute before the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee
 on the.Application of Conventions and Recommendations over observance of ILO
 Convention 98 concerning the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Com-
 mittee has observed that these public employees have a limited capacity to partici-
 p ate in the process of determining their wages and again in June 1996 asked the
 Government to consider any measures it could take to encourage negotiations with
 public employees.
 The right to strike, implicit in the Constitution, is exercised. During 1995, 77,000
 work days were lost to strikes. The law prohibits retribution against strikers and
 is effectively enforced. Public employees do not have the right to strike, although
 they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are active in international bodies,
 most notably the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and maintain
 extensive international contacts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-The Constitution provides
 unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights are ex-
 erised freely, and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual "Spring
 Wage Offensive," in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their firms, involves nationwide participation. Management
 usually consults closely with its enterprise union. However, trade unions are inde-
 pendent of management and aggrssively pursue the interests of their workers.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law, and adequate mechanisms exist for
 resolving such cases as do occur, including the reinstatement with back wages of
 any workers fired for union activities. However, the collective bargaining rights of
 public employees are limited. The Government determines the pay of government
 employees based on a recommendation by the independent National Personnel Au-
 thority.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be held in bondage of any kind. Involuntary servitude, except as pun
 ishment for crime, is prohibited. This legal prohibition against forced or compu sory
 labor a pplea equally to adults and to children, and there are presently no known
 cases of forced or bonded labor.
 Before and during World War gI the Government conscripted both Chinese and
 Korean  workers who were forced to work in Japanese factories and mines. This
 practice ended in 1948 when the last of these workers was returned home. Survivors
 and families of these workers continue to press claims for damages and compensa-
 tions for their forced labor, both in Japanese civil courts and in complaints to the
 1LO. Tn September the Nippon Steel Corporation reached an out-of-court settlement
 with the fanilies of 11 Koreans who had performed forced labor in the company's
 mine in Kamaishi, the first reported payment by a Japanese firm for using forced
 labor during the war. Another forced labor suit against Nippon Steel filed by two
 South Korean men is pending in Osaka District Court. However, in December dis-
 trict courts in both Nagasaki and Tokyo ruled against such claimants, in cases in-
 volving the Kajima Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, on the basis that
 the 20-year statute of limitations for claims against illegal acts had expired.

 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution bans the exploitation of children. Both societal values and the rigorous en-
 forcement of the Labor Standards Law protect children from exploitation in the
 workplace. The Government prohibits forced or bonded child labor and enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 Child labor is virtually nonexistant. By law, children under the age of 15 may not
 be employed and those under age 18 may not be employed in dangerous or harmful
 jobs. The Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor, which vigorously en-
 forces the Labor Standards Law, reports no violations. Society places an extremely
 high value on education, which is compulsory through the lower secondary (i.e.
 ninth grade) level. Enrollment levels for both boys and gis through the free and
 universally available upper secondary level (age 18) exceed 95 percent.
 Under the revised Labor Standards Law of 1987, minors under 15 years of age
 may not be employed, and those under the age of 18 years may not be employed
 in dangerous or harmful work. The Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of
 Labor rigorously enforces child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set on a regional (prefec-
 tural) and industry basis, with the input of tripartite (workers, employers, public
 interest) advisory councils. Employers covered by a minimum wage must post the
 concerned minimum wages, and compliance with minimum wages is considered
 widespread. Minimum wage rates, effective in fiscal year 1997 (starting April 1),
 ranged from $47 (5,368 yen) per day in Tokyo and Osaka to $40 (4,625 yen) m Oki-
 nawa Prefecture and are considered sufficient to provide workers and their families
 with a decent living. The Labor Standards Law provides for a 40-hour workweek
 for most industries and mandates premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a week,
 or 8 in a day. However, labor unions frequently criticize the Government for failing
 to enforce maximum working hour regulations in smaller firms.
 The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations gov-
 erning occupational health and safety, principal among which is the 1972 Industrial
 Safety and Health Law. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued after
 consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Tripartite
 Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to suspend un-
 safe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice concerns
 over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working conditions
 without jeopardizing their continued employment.
