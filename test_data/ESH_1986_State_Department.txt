THE WESTERN SAHARA
 Portions of the Western Sahara, now divided into four
 provinces, are administered by Morocco. Morocco assumed
 administration of the northern three provinces after the
 withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975, and it asserted control
 over the southernmost portion in 1979 when Mauritania
 renounced its claim to the area and ceased administering the
 region over which its authority had been vested by the Madrid
 Accords of 1975.
 Since 1977, the northern provinces of Al Ayoun, Smara, and
 Boujdour have participated in elections held throughout
 Morocco. Communal elections were held in the southernmost
 province of Oued ed Dahhab in May 1981. The four Saharan
 provinces participated in 1983 elections and in all votes in
 1984, including the referendum on the Moroccan-Libyan Treaty
 of Union and direct and indirect elections to Parliament.
 Participation in both the referendum and the direct elections
 to Parliament tended to run higher in the Western Sahara than
 in almost all other areas of Morocco.
 Moroccan Saharan incumbents fill all 10 parliamentary seats
 from the Western Sahara provinces, and Western Saharan-origin
 politicians also fill seats from other provinces. The
 governors of the Saharan provinces, appointed by the King, are
 all native Saharans. In consultation with elected municipal
 and provincial councils, the four governors administer their
 provinces in the same manner as the provinces and prefectures
 of Morocco proper are administered. Most village and civil
 servants are also locally recruited Saharans. The governors'
 primary responsibilities are to accelerate development and the
 delivery of social services. Investment in the Western Sahara
 remains tax-free, in large part to encourage greater
 investment in the area, which has the effect of raising the
 general standard of living. Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed visited
 the Western Sahara on September 2-9, 1986, for a tour of the
 area where sporadic fighting continues between Moroccan forces
 and the Polisario, an organization which seeks independence
 for the territory.
 Ultimate sovereignty over the Western Saharan region remains a
 subject of international dispute. At the June 1981 summit
 meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Nairobi,
 Morocco proposed that a referendum be held to decide the
 question. At a subsequent OAU meeting, specific measures seen
 as leading to a peaceful settlement of the Saharan problem
 were outlined by the member states. The OAU summit meeting in
 1983 resolved that the referendum be held in December 1983 but
 also called for direct negotiations between Morocco and the
 Polisario, a request Morocco does not accept. The resulting
 stalemate has prevented progress to resolve the Western
 Saharan dispute in the OAU. Morocco walked out of the
 November 1984 OAU summit after the Saharan Democratic Arab
 Republic Delegation was seated. Morocco later called for the
 U.N. to administer the referendum to determine the population's
 wishes on independence or integration into Morocco. In
 October 1985, King Hassan, in a message to the U.N., also
 announced a unilateral cease-fire by Moroccan forces in the
 region. He pledged that Moroccan forces would only defend
 themselves if fired upon. In 1986 U.N. Secretary General
 Perez de Cuellar lent his good offices to an effort involving
 'proximity talks" with Morocco and the Polisario, with a view
 to arranging a referendum under U.N. auspices. Morocco has
 accepted in principle the Secretary General's framework.
 The Polisario and Algeria, which supports the Polisario, have
 also accepted the U.N.'s good offices, but continue to call

 THE WESTERN SAHARA
 for direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario.
 Although the two sides agree on the principle of a referendum,
 they remain far apart on the modalities.
 The civilian population in the portion of the Western Sahara
 under effective Moroccan control is subject to Moroccan
 political institutions and laws. Officially it is subject to
 the same human rights practices as other Moroccans in areas of
 undisputed Moroccan sovereignty. There are, however, reports
 that Saharans often have difficulties obtaining passports,
 that their political views are more closely monitored than
 those of residents of Morocco proper, and that police and
 paramilitary authorities react especially harshly against
 those suspected of supporting the Polisario. Moroccans
 continue to allege Polisario human rights abuses, including
 illegal detention, impressment into military service, and
 general infringement of the civil liberties of the inhabitants
 of the Western Sahara. There have been few opportunities to
 evaluate the human rights practices of the Polisario in areas
 outside the "berm," the Moroccan forces earthwork defense
 line, and these allegations cannot be confirmed or denied.
