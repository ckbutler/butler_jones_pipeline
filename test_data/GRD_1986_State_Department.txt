 GRENADA
 Grenada is governed under the parliamentary system inherited
 from the British, which was suspended in 1979 by the Marxist
 People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) and subsequently
 restored after the October 1983 landing by forces of the
 United States and the Eastern Caribbean nations. The New
 National Party (NNP), which won 14 of 15 parliamentary seats
 in the December 1984 election, continues in power. Defections
 from the NNP in 1986 led to the formation of a new opposition
 party, the Grenada Democratic Labour Congress (GDLC). In
 1985, Parliament restored the 1974 Constitution adopted at
 independence, and legitimized the court system inherited from
 the PRG, which had ruled by decree.
 Political and civil rights are fully guaranteed by the
 Constitution. The spectrum of political parties ranges from
 the moderate NNP, the new GDLC, and the Grenada Democratic
 Labour Party, to the Marxist Maurice Bishop Patriotic
 Movement, organized by pro-Bishop survivors of the October
 1983 coup against Bishop, and the Grenada United Labour Party
 of former Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy.
 Since the 1983 fall of the PRG, there has been a healthy
 increase in economic growth and a decline in inflation. The
 Government continues to follow a policy of providing
 individuals greater freedom to pursue economic goals by
 eliminating or reducing controls on wages, prices, and foreign
 exchange, and encouraging private investment.
 Security in Grenada is maintained by the Royal Grenada Police
 Force, which includes a 100-man paramilitary Special Service
 Unit (SSU) and a 30-man Coast Guard. The United States Army
 and Coast Guard provide periodic training for the SSU and the
 Coast Guard, respectively.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disapppearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reported incidents of torture in 1986, although
 the defendants in the Maurice Bishop murder trial continued to
 allege in court that they were tortured during the early days
 of their detention. Isolated incidents involving the possible
 use of excessive force by the police have occurred. In
 January 1986, a young man died while in police custody, and
 the question of excessive force never was adequately
 explained. Another incident involved the roughing-up in
 public of one of the Maurice Bishop murder trial defendants by
 police after he reportedly spat in the face of a police
 officer. The media reported allegations of police brutality
 during a raid on a waterfront ghetto on the eve of President
 
 
 505
 GRENAD
 Reagan's February 20 visit. Such problems appear not to be
 the result of a deliberate policy or procedure, but rather
 reflect inadequate police training or discipline. There were
 no other reported incidents in 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests. By law, Grenadian
 police have the authority to arrest individuals "on suspicion"
 without a warrant, but arrests must be accompanied by formal
 charges. No one was detained for political reasons.
 Those arrested are brought before an independent judiciary and
 are allowed access to an attorney of their choice. In capital
 cases, the courts appoint counsel when an accused cannot pay
 for his or her defense. There is a functioning system of
 bail, although those charged with capital offenses are not
 eligible.
 Grenadian law provides for a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention within 15 days after arrest on a
 criminal charge. Formal arraignment or release of the
 individual arrested must be determined within 60 days. These
 time limits were respected during 1986. Persons charged with
 offenses can be held on remand only for a specified time while
 awaiting trial. This time limit is not always strictly
 followed, owing to a limited number of judges and other
 judicial officials to process the caseload expeditiously. No
 Grenadian citizen was exiled. There were no reports of forced
 or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Grenadians have the legal right to public trials, and the law
 is respected in practice. The examination of witnesses in the
 Maurice Bishop murder trial began in April 1986, after a
 series of delays caused mainly by the defense exercising its
 right to file motions and appeals. The defendants' dismissal
 of their lawyers soon after the start of the examinations
 complicated the proceedings by permitting the defendants to
 declare themselves unrepresented by counsel. Nevertheless,
 the defendants were given almost unrestricted freedom in the
 content and length of their own defense statements, which
 lasted from July until October. In December 1986, a jury
 convicted 14 of the 18 defendants of murder; they were
 sentenced to death by hanging. Three others were convicted of
 manslaughter and given 45-year prison sentences, and one was
 acquitted. Both the press and the public had free access to
 the proceedings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Neither the Government nor any political organization
 interferes arbitrarily in the private lives of citizens. No
 forced membership in any organization occurs, and there is no
 arbitrary monitoring of communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Grenadians enjoy full freedom of speech and press. There are
 five weekly newspapers, a fortnightly, and a newsletter
 published periodically by a local journalist. Four of the
 
 
 . 506
 GRENADA
 newspapers are affiliated with political parties. Fliers are
 occasionally distributed by remnants of the PRG and the New
 Jewel Movement. Newspapers freely criticize the Government.
 The country's single radio station is government-operated; a
 nascent television broadcasting system organized by a
 U.S.-based private foundation has brought limited television
 service to the nation. The system was developed with the
 cooperation of the Government, but its growth has been
 hampered by technical and financial constraints. The future
 of the television facility remains under discussion between
 the foundation and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any purpose,
 including the public protest of policies or actions of the
 Government. Supporters of political parties, including those
 in power prior to October 1983, meet frequently and hold
 public rallies. There are no controls on private or public
 meetings.
 Workers are free to organize independent labor unions and to
 bargain collectively, and union leaders play a significant
 role in Grenadian political life. Public sector workers are
 permitted to strike legally upon advance notification. In
 1986 all unions were free of government control, and none
 received government support. Individual trade unionists must
 separate their political involvement from their union
 activities. Grenada's Trade Union Congress is a member of the
 Caribbean Congress of Labour, affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism predominate, but there are
 many Presbyterians, Methodists and other Protestants. In
 addition, a small Baha'i community exists in Grenada, and an
 Islamic Center serves the Muslim community. Grenadians enjoy
 complete religious freedom, which extends to non- Christians
 such as Rastafarians, who were harassed under the PRG regime.
 Clergy and missionaries travel and preach freely. Adherence
 to a particular religious denomination appears to confer no
 special advantages or disadvantages in Grenada, although
 Christian prayers and hymns form part of many governmental and
 political meetings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Grenadians may move freely within Grenada and, in principle,
 the right to enter and leave the country is guaranteed to all
 Grenadian citizens. Nevertheless, an "Act to Restrict
 the Freedom of Movement of Certain Persons" became law in
 March 1986. The Act allows the minister responsible for
 national security to restrict the travel out of Grenada of
 "any person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives include the
 overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary system of
 government." The law was enacted after the Grenadian Appeals
 Court sustained a government action witholding the passport of
 a former member of the PRG who sought to leave the country in
 1985. The legislation allows persons affected to appeal after
 3 months to a three-man tribunal. There were no reports of
 this law being applied to restrict travel in 1986. No
 "repatriates" were returned forcibly to Grenada in 1986, nor
 were any cases reported of refugees seeking safehaven in
 
 
 507
 GRENADA
 Grenada. (The Baha'i community includes Iranians who left
 their homeland to escape persecution.) The Government has
 allowed students and others to return from Cuba and other
 Communist bloc countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution guarantees free and fair elections at least
 every 5 years. The majority party in Grenada's current
 Parliament is the NNP led by Prime Minister Herbert Blaize.
 Formed by three parties in 1984, the NNP won overwhelmingly in
 an election in which 85 percent of the voters cast ballots.
 In 1986 the NNP's parliamentary majority was reduced to 12 of
 the 15 seats after 2 members resigned over differences within
 the party. Local government elections promised by the NNP
 during the 1984 campaign remain a topic of public debate but
 have yet to be conducted. Other political parties actively
 assert their views in public and seek support from the
 Grenadian electorate.
 The political system is not dominated by any particular ethnic
 group, nor are there any restrictions which limit
 participation to any part of Grenada's population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has welcomed visits by several human rights
 organizations in the past, although there were no such visits
 in 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination is officially prohibited and there is none in
 health care or education. There have been isolated
 complaints, however, of unofficial job discrimination against
 Guyanese resident in Grenada.
 Women frequently earn less than men performing the same work
 and tend to occupy jobs which pay less. Wage differences are
 less prevalent for more highly paid jobs, but there are fewer
 women in such positions. A notable exception is the Civil
 Service, where women hold a number of positions of
 responsibility.
 CONDITIO14S OF LABOR
 Grenada lacks legislation effectively regulating work hours,
 wages, and occupational safety and health standards. Normal
 work hours, however, rarely exceed 40 hours per week. Minors
 often work in family-run shops and farms, but employment of
 children under 16 in Grenada's relatively small industrial
 sector is prohibited by law.
