 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist state. Under
 the 1976 constitution, the government may restrict
 any right or freedom when exercised in opposition
 to the state. All political, economic, social, and
 cultural activities are under the close control of
 the communist party. No political opposition is
 allowed. The press and other media are owned and
 controlled by the party-state apparatus. Freedom
 of speech is severely circumscribed. Individual
 citizens have a semblance of political participa-
 tion at the grass roots level through a system of
 people's assemblies. National policies and foreign
 policy, however, are still decided by a small elite
 within the communist party's politburo and Secretariat.
 During 1980 the Cuban government, concerned by growing
 popular discontent, introduced new security measures
 and encouraged disaffected elements to leave the
 country. This approach contrasted sharply with the
 human rights improvements of the previous year, during
 which several thousand political prisoners were released,
 Cuba was opened to family visits by Cuban exiles
 for the first time in almost twenty years, and an
 increasing number of Cubans were allowed to travel
 to the United States.
 On November 1, 1979, a new penal code went into effect
 which, inter alia, enumerates a wide range of crimes
 against the security of the state. A month later,
 following the appointment of new Minister of Interior
 Ramiro Valdez, a security crackdown began. The security
 forces instituted a series of identification checks,
 principally in the Havana area. There were widespread
 arrests of improperly documented persons and of various
 categories of socially and politically disaffected
 Cubans. The crackdown was apparently designed to
 discourage the more open displays of frustration -
 --petty crime, vandalism, anti-government slogans,
 etc.--that had increased markedly during preceding
 months.
 In April 1980, the government encouraged a massive
 exodus of its citizens under inherently unsafe and
 disorderly conditions. By September, more than 125,000
 Cubans had fled their homeland. While awaiting permission
 to depart, many persons were harassed by mobs in
 their neighborhoods or forced to endure severe physical
 deprivation at holding camps.
 Economic problems were one of the major causes of
 discontent and emigration pressures. The government
 has indicated that it has few short-term solutions
 to these problems. Its success in reducing wealth
 inequalities stands in stark contrast to its inability
 to increase production. A drastic redistribution
 
 
 398
 of income took place during the first few years of
 the revolution (1959-1963). Education is available
 to all, and illiteracy has been reduced to a very
 low level. Basic medical care is widely available.
 As a result of these measures, the formerly poorest
 sectors of the population have made gains. Nevertheless,
 real per capita consumption has probably declined
 since 1959. Complaints about shortages of food,
 clothing, and most other consumer goods are widespread.
 The Cuban government released 3,900 political prisoners
 during late 1978 and 1979. It has not revealed how many
 political prisoners remain in Cuban jails. The Sixth
 Report on the situation of Political Prisoners in--Cua,
 published by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 (IAHRC) in December 1979, estimated that there were approxi-
 mately 1,000 political prisoners left in Cuba. The Amnesty
 International Report 1980, released in December 1980,
 estimated that there were at least 250 long-term political
 prisoners.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Use of torture by the Cuban Security service was common
 during the 1960's, especially during interrogation.
 The Cuban constitution outlaws this practice and states
 that "the person who has been arrested or the prisoner
 is inviolable in his personal integrity." Recently released
 prisoners have reported a few unconfirmed incidents of
 torture over the past two years, but the practice no
 longer appears to be widespread.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 During the spring and early summer of 1980, Cubans who
 sought to leave the island were frequently subjected
 to inhuman or degrading treatment at the hands of police
 and the political block committees (Committees for Defense
 of the Revolution). Would-be emigrants were verbally
 and physically attacked by mobs incited by government
 rhetoric. Numerous people suffered severe beatings,
 and there were even a few unconfirmed reports of deaths
 resulting from such incidents. After stories and photos
 of this wave of violence had appeared in the international
 press, the block committees were issued instructions
 on how to harass would-be emigrants without resorting
 to physical violence. Many of those seeking to leave
 were virtually held prisoner in their homes for extended
 periods; their utilities were cut off and they were unable
 to communicate with anyone outside or obtain food. Many
 emigrants reported being physically abused by police
 at processing centers while waiting to be put aboard
 boats at the port of Mariel. Some were kept for days
 at camps near Mariel with little or no food.
 
 
 399
 Those who left via Mariel were placed on board small
 boats that were dangerously crowded--conditions that
 may have contributed to the deaths of at least twenty-
 six people from drowning or carbon monoxide asphyxiation.
 Cuban authorities put aboard these boats people who were
 aged and infirm, as well as some suffering from serious
 physical and mental illnesses. Hundreds of hardened
 criminals were given the choice of remaining in prison
 or boarding boats bound for the United States. Other
 Cubans apparently were coerced to leave by being threatened
 with the alternative of imprisonment for alleged offenses,
 such as vagrancy or anti-social conduct. In some cases,
 Cuban authorities contributed to the separation of families
 by granting exit visas to some family members but withholding
 them from others or by separating immediate relatives
 at dockside.
 The emigrants were stripped of all personal belongings
 before leaving. Some persons who held professional degrees
 have claimed that they were obliged to repay the state
 for their education before being allowed to depart.
 These payments allegedly amounted to thousands of dollars
 in some cases. Those who had sought asylum at the Peruvian
 Embassy in Havana (see 3.b., below) had their ration
 cards taken away when they emerged from the diplomatic
 compound. It is not clear whether this practice has
 been followed with regord to others seeking emigration;
 some seem to have been permitted to retain ration cards.
 Virtually all who applied for exit permits lost their
 jobs, thus forcing them to subsist on handouts from relatives
 or friends until they could leave--often an extended
 period of time.
 The Cuban government classifies its prisoners as common
 criminals and counterrevolutionary prisoners. The Cuban
 authorities in 1971 implemented a "progressive plan"
 to replace an earlier policy of political reeducation
 which had included compulsory political education and
 recantation of past opposition to the revolution. Under
 the "progressive plan," prisoners work at prison facilities
 and receive monthly salaries for work satisfactorily
 performed. They are granted various rights and privileges,
 e.g., home visits, visits by family, and possible early
 release, depending on their prison category. In November
 1979, then Minister of Interior Sergio del Valle stated,
 *Under no circumstances are illegal or inhuman practices
 permitted..." The chief objective of the prison system,
 he said, is "to guarantee the reeducation and reincorporation
 of man into society in keeping with the objectives of
 our new social order...-
 Although prison conditions in most facilities have improved
 significantly since 1975, there have continued to be
 reports of abuses, particularly with respect to the treatment
 of several hundred prisoners (who call themselves "plantados")
 who have persistently rejected government education schemes .
 
 
 400
 as well as the "progressive plan." These prisoners refuse
 to take part in any of the plan's duties and activities
 or to wear prison uniforms. Amnesty International, in
 its 1978 report, cited reports that plantado prisoners,
 kept apart from the rest, had been denied family visits,
 correspondence, adequate exercise, and satisfactory medical
 attention.
 Cuban officials, while admitting that certain restrictions
 are imposed on the plantados, insist that all prisoners
 receive minimum rights, including adequate medical attention
 and exercise, and that even prisoners in the severest
 category receive "one visit and one letter every three
 months." However, the December 1979 IAHRC report concluded
 that "the treatment of 'intransigent' prisoners is characterized
 by mistreatment, absence of medical attention, lack of
 proper food, and absence of due process." The same report
 also cited instances of political prisoners being subjected
 to forced labor, in violation of International Labor
 Organization conventions on this subject which have been
 ratified by Cuba.
 In July 1979, 100-120 of the plantados were moved from
 Combinado del Este prison to Boniato prison, where living
 conditions are reputed to be much more rigorous. The
 Amnesty International 1980 report expressed concern over
 the transfer, citing reports that the prisoners were
 transported in small vans inadequate for the 1,000 kilometer
 trip. The conditions of the journey reportedly sparked
 a hunger strike by those prisoners. Since the transfer,
 very little information has been available on their status
 or treatment. Amnesty International stated that guards
 and common criminals reportedly harass political prisoners
 in Boniato. There were also reports that in November
 1980 a number of the plantados were severely beaten by
 prison guards in a melee stemming from the cancellation
 of family visits. Following the incident, a group of
 the plantados again went on a hunger strike.
 Some of the thirty-three American citizen prisoners released
 by Cuba in October 1980 reported that during pre-trial
 interrogation they had been held in solitary confinement
 as a means of coercing confessions to their alleged crimes.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross is not allowed
 access to Cuban prisoners.
 C.   Disappearances
 There is no recent evidence of disappearances in Cuba.
 Arrests generally are made openly, and eventually the
 arrested persons are either released or tried. There
 are numerous reports of arrested persons being held incommu-
 nicado and without their families being informed for
 long periods of time before being brought to trial.
 
 
 401
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In late 1978, President Fidel Castro said there were
 3,000 "counterrevolutionaries" imprisoned for "crimes
 against the security of the state" and 600 persons imprisoned
 for "illegal departure." He said these totals did not
 include about 400 prisoners held for serious crimes committed
 during the Batista era (the so-called "batistianos")
 or prisoners "affiliated with terrorist groups." Castro
 pledged to release all prisoners in the first two categories
 during 1979, but made no promises regarding the batistianos
 or the "terrorists."
 At the end of 1979, after a total of 3,900 political
 prisoners had been freed, the government stated that
 the release program had been completed and that any additional
 releases would be handled on a case-by-case basis. The
 1979 IAHRC report placed the number of political prisoners
 remaining following the completion of the release program
 at approximately 1,000. Amnesty International estimated
 in December 1980 that there were still "at least 250
 long-term political prisoners." Among those who have
 not yet been released are a number of political prisoners,
 such as noted poet Armando Valladares, who are neither
 batistianos nor 'terrorists." Amnesty International's
 1980 report states: 'Dissimilar treatment seems to have
 been accorded to prisoners convicted of identical crimes
 at the same trial; some have been released, others not."
 No information is available on how many Cubans may have
 been jailed during 1980.
 On the question of distinguishing "prisoners of conscience"
 from those detained because of politically motivated
 acts of violence, Amnesty International has noted that
 certain individuals may have been arrested and sentenced
 to long terms of imprisonment more because of their opposition
 to the government than on account of any specific offense.
 The government acknowledges holding prisoners convicted
 of political crimes, but takes the position that there
 are no "prisoners of conscience;" rather, all are said
 to have been guilty of "crimes against the integrity
 and security of the state." The constitution, enumerating
 fundamental rights, duties, and guarantees, includes
 a fail-safe statement that "none of the freedoms which
 are recognized for citizens can be exercised contrary
 to... the existence and the objectives of the socialist
 state, or contrary to the decision of the Cuban people
 to build socialism and communism. Violation of this
 principle can be punished by law." The 1979 IAHRC report
 points out that the practical impact of this clause is
 that individuals may be imprisoned for merely exercising
 their right to express themselves.
 Both Amnesty International and the IAHRC have expressed
 concern that some political prisoners due for release
 have been re-sentenced.
 
 
 402
 Former political prisoners often find it difficult to
 find satisfactory employment and become reintegrated
 into Cuban society. The government encourages their
 emigration, thereby relieving the state of the burden
 of supporting the politically suspect and minimizing
 the risk of their becoming a source of dissent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Cuban constitution specifies that the courts shall
 be "a system of state organs independent of all others."
 All courts, however, are subordinated to the National
 Assembly of People's Power and thus, also, to the Council
 of State. The 1977 Judicial System Law confirmed provisions
 of a 1973 law disbanding the revolutionary tribunals
 which until then had been empowered to deal specifically
 with "counterrevolutionary offenses." Such political
 offenses now fall within the competence of the state
 security chambers of the higher-ranking people's courts.
 The courts appoint lawyers to represent all defendants.
 Defendants may also hire their own counsels through the
 lawyers' guild.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Cuban constitution states: "The home is inviolable.
 No one can enter the home of another against his will,
 except in those cases foreseen by law." In practice,
 courts issue warrants upon request by the Cuban security
 service in cases affecting national security. Therefore,
 the individual has scant legal protection against arbitrary
 search. In a closely controlled society like Cuba, it
 is difficult to estimate the prevalence of invasion of
 the home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Over the past twenty years the Castro government has
 placed great emphasis on providing health care and education
 to all Cubans. It has also made a major effort to redistri-
 bute the existing stock of housing and arable land.
 With the exception of a few items, such as milk and poultry,
 the government has had little or no success in increasing
 the supply of food, clothing, and other consumer goods
 available to the public. Per .capita consumption of some
 items has even declined since the late 1950's. Failures
 in this regard were the major contributing factor to
 the sharp rise in domestic discontent during 1979 and
 1980.
 Cuba's estimated per capita gross national product is
 $1,372 (1978). According to one 1979 study (using rough
 estimates of 1973 income figures), the lowest 40 percent
 of the Cuban population receives 20 percent of the income,
 
 
 403
 while the upper 20 percent of the population receives
 35 percent of the income. By all accounts, Cuba's average
 annual economic growth rate over the past five years has
 fallen well short of the government's target of six percent
 and may in fact have barely kept pace with the annual
 population growth rate of 1.2 percent&
 The Cuban constitution guarantees the right to work.
 The policy of attempting to provide some work for everyone
 until recently resulted in a high level of underemployment
 but very little real unemployment in Cuba. Over the
 past two years, however, unemployment has become a growing
 problem as Cuban schools and training centers produce
 more graduates than the economy can absorb. One means
 of coping with this problem has been to export semi-skilled
 and skilled labor services to Eastern Europe, the Middle
 East, and Africa. Another means has been to encourage
 emigration (see 3.b., below).
 All citizens have free health protection and care (including
 dental care), regular medical examinations, vaccinations
 and hospitalization. Cuba has one doctor for every 626
 persons. Deaths from contagious diseases have been drasti-
 cally reduced since 1959. The government has placed
 particular emphasis on maternal and child care and has
 succeeded in reducing the infant mortality rate to slightly
 under 20 per 1,000. Life expectancy is now almost 73
 years.
 Similarly, free education is guaranteed for all. According
 to the government, 92 percent of children between the
 ages-of 6 and 16 are enrolled in school. The Castro
 government's campaign'to eradicate illiteracy has raised
 Cuba's literacy rate to.over 95 percent.
 Petty corruption (blackmarketing, illegal diversion of
 state property or services, etc.) is widespread and is
 frequently denounced by high government officials. Govern-
 ment measures to limit blackmarketing, which in the past
 were almost exclusively punitive, are now beginning to
 address the root causes of the problem. In April 1980,
 for example, in an effort to get more foodstuffs directly
 to consumers, a limited free market for-agricultural
 products was established under which agricultural entities
 can sell their surplus directly to the public at any
 price agreed to by buyer and seller. To date, however,
 such measures have had little or io impact on the extent
 of blackmarketing. No information is available on other
 forms of corruption that entail using public office for
 personal gain.
 The character of Cuba's economy, like its political structure,
 is Marxist-Leninist. Since the early 1960's, there has
 been state ownership of most of the land, and the country's
 business and industrial sectors have been completely
 nationalized. The economy is a centrally planned, non-
 market system in which nearly all economic activity is
 controlled and executed by state entities. Some small
 
 
 404
 
 family farms have been allowed to remain in private hands.
 Some private subsistence farming and quasi-truck gardening
 takes place on these farms.
 Cuba's strict rationing system has curbed starvation
 and malnutrition, but it also imposes lean dietary standards
 on the population. For example, each adult is allotted
 2.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of chicken, and 4 ounces
 of coffee per month. Many Cubans supplement their rations
 by dining occasionally at restaurants and by purchasing
 food on the black market. Food from these sources is
 significantly more expensiye than at ration stores, however.
 Average caloric intake is about 2,700 per day. Nevertheless,
 the chief complaint of Cuban consumers is the quality
 of their food, its high cost, and the lengthy amounts
 of time needed to acquire it. Recent nationwide food
 shortages, exacerbated by the export of agricultural
 and marine products that earn hard currency, have increased
 these complaints. The recently established limited free
 market for agricultural products (see above) represents
 an attempt to increase the availability of foodstuffs
 and to provide more incentive for increased production
 (as well as to limit blackmarketing).
 There is a shortage of adequate housing, particularly
 in Cuba's urban centers. In 1971 President Castro established
 a goal of constructing 100,000 new housing units a year
 by 1975, but actual construction from 1975 through 1978 -
 averaged under 18,000 units per year. The government
 has made a major effort to train skilled construction
 workers (some of whom are sent to work in Third World
 countries), but its housing industry suffers from shortages
 of construction materials, such as lumber and cement.
 Newly constructed housing is made available on the basis
 of political criteria as well as family needs. Maintenance
 of the existing housing stock continues to be a formidable
 problem.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The freedoms of speech, press, and assembly do not exist
 in Cuba. The 1979 IAHRC Report noted that "the legal
 system in Cuba prevents free expression and any expression
 of disagreement with the socialist system. There are
 individuals who are in prison for the mere fact of having
 expressed their opposition to the system." All print
 and electronic media are government-owned and completely
 controlled. All group activities are controlled and
 monitored by the communist party and/or the political
 bloc committees.
 The Cuban constitution guarantees the right to profess
 and practice any religion. The constitution also states,
 however, that it is illegal to "put one's faith or religious
 
 
 405
 belief in opposition to the constitution...." Communist
 party membership is considered inconsistent with the
 exercise of religious beliefs, thus effectively excluding
 those who practice religion from positions of authority
 in the government or armed forces. There are also reports
 of persons who practice regular religious observance
 being discriminated against in employment, housing, and
 schooling. Members of sects such as the Jehovah's Witnesses
 who disagree with the government on such matters as employment,
 education, and compulsory military sekvice are subject
 to prosecution for their dissent.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation.
 Travel within Cuba is not circumscribed or controlled.
 Unofficial foreign travel is rarely available to the
 vast majority of the Cuban people. Those who wish to
 travel abroad temporarily must get an exit permit from
 the government. The penal code punishes illegal immigration
 and emigration. The 1979 IAHRC report concluded that
 penalties for the latter are too severe. It found that
 hundreds of Cubans are in prison for attempting to emigrate.
 With the exception of some special categories (e.g.,
 dual nationals or ex-political prisoners), there was
 virtually no legal means for Cubans to emigrate between
 1973 (when the government ended the "Freedom Flights*)
 and 1979. Since 1978, an increasing number of persons
 had attempted to leave illegally by various avenues.
 In April 1980, in reaction to the invasion of the Peruvian
 Embassy by over 10,000 asylum-seekers, the Cuban government
 opened the port of Mariel for massive emigration. Cuban-
 Americans were told that they could pick up family members
 and friends, and hundreds of small boats arrived in Mariel
 from Florida. Between April and September, more than
 125,000 Cubans arrived in the United States via this
 illegal sealift. United States authorities had no opportu-
 nity to interview and determine the eligibility of any
 of these arrivees. Many apparently had no strong desire
 to emigrate, but were coerced into leaving. In some
 cases, dangerous criminals were taken directly from prison
 and placed aboard boats for the United States. At the
 end of 1980, Cuba had refused to allow the return of
 convicted felons or of any Cubans who had arrived in
 the United States through Mariel and wanted to return
 home. This contravenes the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination
 of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the International
 Convenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 The Cuban government suspended the Mariel sealift on
 September 25, 1980. It is estimated that from 100,000
 to 500,000 Cubans have applied to emigrate, and many,
 but not all, have received exit visas.
 
 
 406
 Cuba has accepted a number of refugees, mostly those
 fleeing from anti-leftist governments in Latin America,
 such as Chile and Guatemala. By and large, these refugees
 are treated as though they were Cuban citizens. Many
 are members of political organizations supported by Cuba,
 including terrorist groups such as the Uruguayan Tupamaros,
 the Argentine Montoneros, and the Chilean MIR (Leftist
 Rebel Movement).
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cuba is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state. The Communist
 Party is Cuba's only legal political party. After the
 revolution, the Castro government either abolished or
 brought under its control all existing mass organizations.
 It also created a number of new organizations such as
 the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. As
 a result, most sectors of Cuban society--labor, women,
 youth, and artists, for example--are highly organized.
 The government encourages all Cubans, including children,
 to participate in mass organizations. The Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution, for example, claim
 a total membership of 5,350,000, or almost 80 percent
 of the adult population. These mass organizations are
 used more for political and economic mobilization than
 for popular representation. They use both persuasion
 and coercion to channel the energies of the people toward
 goals established by the communist party. Citizens have
 some limited participation in discussion of local issues
 (e.g., public transportation, sanitation, and crime preven-
 tion) within the people's assemblies established in 1976.
 Cuba has constitutionally outlawed discrimination against
 women and minorities. There has been considerable advance-
 ment of women's rights in employment and working conditions.
 The establishment of day care centers and official encour-
 agement of women to work outside the home have gradually
 expanded the female share of the work force from 13 percent
 in 1953 to 32 percent in 1980. At the political level,
 few women are at the top of government. Only nine percent
 of the members of the communist party central committee
 and none of the members of the politburo are women.
 On the other hand, women hold important posts in some
 mass organizations, such as the Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution and the Cuban Federation of Women.
 Blacks and other minorities, who comprise more than one-
 quarter of the Cuban population, have benefitted from
 universal public education and the extension of public
 health services to all Cuban localities. They are under-
 represented, however, in the top levels of government.
 The percentage of blacks and mulattoes in the Central
 Committee is about 10 percent, a ratio only slightly
 above their 9.4 percent representation in the 1945 National
 Congress.
 Nearly all Cuban workers belong to the Confederation
 
 
 407
 of Cuban Workers, which serves primarily as an instrument
 of the state to maintain political and work discipline,
 spur worker effort and productivity, and hold down labor
 costs, rather than to seek wage and benefit improvements
 and defend worker interests. There is no collective
 bargaining or right to strike. Labor-management relations
 are administered by the ministry of labor. Union members
 can vote for the officers of their local sections, but
 not for the municipal, provincial, and national officers
 who represent the union within the ministry that regulates
 their particular industry.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 According to the 1978 Amnesty International report, the
 Cuban government allowed Amnesty International officials
 to visit Cuba "in their private capacities" in late 1977,
 but specified in advance that the visit could not be
 considered an "investigation." The Amnesty International
 team met with prison authorities, judges, and other officials,
 including Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and
 was allowed to visit certain prison facilities. They
 were allowed to meet with some prisoners--but never alone
 --and were denied permission to meet with any plantado
 prisoners. According to the report, Vice President Carlos
 Rafael Rodriguez agreed to further communication between
 the Cuban government and Amnesty International. No agreement
 has been reached for a follow-up visit by Amnesty International.
 Cuba was suspended from participation in the Organization
 of American States in 1962. The Cuban government, therefore,
 has neither signed the American Convention on Human Rights
 nor allowed the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 to visit Cuba.
