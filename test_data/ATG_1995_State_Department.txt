 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a parliamentary democracy and
 a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A prime minister, a cabinet, and a bi-
 cameral legislative assembly compose the Government. A Governor General, ap-
 pointed by the British monarch is the titular Head of State, with largely ceremonial
 duties. In general elections held in March 1994, the Antigua Labour Party (ALP)
 led by Lester B. Bird retained power by capturing 10 of 17 parliamentary seats,
 down from the 15 it held under the administration of V. C. Bird, the current Prime
 Minister's father. The Governor General appoints the 15 senators, 11 with the ad-
 vice of the Prime Minister and 4 with the advice of the opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the small Antigua and Barbuda
 Defence Force. The police are organized, trained, and supervised according to Brit-
 ish law enforcement practices and have a reputation for respecting individual rights
 in the performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. Tourism
 is the most important source of foreign exchange earnings. The country is burdened
 by a large and growing external debt which remains a serious economic problem.
 The country was devastated in September when hurricane Luis caused hundreds of
 millions of dollars in losses.
 Although the Government generally respected constitutional provisions for politi-
 cal and civil rights, oppositionparties complained that they received scant coverage
 from the government-controlled media, and that the Government sometimes denied
 them permits for rallies. Societal discrimination and violence against women also
 continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respected
 these prohibitions.
 Conditions at the lone 18th-century-vintage prison are primitive and crowded, and
 a 1930 law still governs treatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Crimn-
 nal defendants have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their de-
 tention. The police must bring detainees before a court within 48 hours of arrest
 or detention. Opposition leaders claim the Government has developed a pattern of
 arresting suspects on Fridays and holding them until Tuesdays in order to prolong
 the incarceration. Most of these cases involve youths suspected of narcotics viola-
 tions.    -
 There were no reports of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is part of the Eastern Carib-
 bean legal system and reflects historical ties to the United Kingdom. The Privy
 Council in London is designated by the Constitution as the final court of appeal,
 which is invariably employed in the case of death sentences. There are no military
 or political courts. The Constitution provides that criminal defendants receive a fair,
 open, and public trial. In capital cases only, the Government provides legal assist-
 ance at public expense to persons without the means to retain a private attorney.
 Courts can reach verdicts with remarkable speed, with some cases coming to conclu-
 sion in a matter of days.

 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 the press, and other forms of communication. The authorities generally respect
 these provisions in practice. However, the Government dominates the electronic
 media--the only daily source of news-and effectively denies equal coverage to oppo-
 sition parties. The Government owns one of the two radio stations and the single
 television station. One of the Prime Minister's brothers owns the second radio sta-
 tion, and another brother is the principal owner of the sole cable television company.
 The government-controlled media report regularly on the Government's and the rul-
 ing party's activities, but gant only very limited access to the opposition parties.
 The sole daily paper keenly criticizes the Government. Early in the year, protests
 prompted the Government to grant opposition leaders some media access to oppose
 a series of tax measures.
 Political opposition parties and private sector organizations such as the Chamber
 of Commerce publish several weekly newspapers which offer a variety of opinions
 without government interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. The police normally issued the required permits for
 public meetings, but sometimes deny them in order to avert violent confrontations.
 While the authorities placed some restrictions on demonstrations, the opposition
 was able to stage numerous public meetings, rallies, and other events with little in-
 terference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 mpractice.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status. However, government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewpoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The law obligates the Government to hold voter registration during a fixed
 period each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives free of govern-
 ment interference.
 Except for a period in opposition from 1971 to 1976, the ALP has held power con-
 tinuously since 1951. The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding mo-
 nopoly on patronage and its influence over access to economic opportunities make
 it extremely difficult for opposition parties to attract membership and financial sup-
 port. In 1992 public concern over corruption in government spawned the merger of
 three opposition political parties into the United Progressive Party (UPP). The UPP
 succeeded in increasing its representation to seven seats from five during the 1994
 election. Opposition and press regularly charge members of the Government with
 corrupt practices.
 There are no women serving as members of Parliament or as Ministers in the
 Government. Eight of the 14 Ministry Permanent Secretaries (the top civil servant
 position in Ministries) are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 formed to date. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 from individuals or international human rights groups during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and the Government generally observed its provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a recognized social problem. It is treated as
 a matter of public conscience, and there are nongovernmental social welfare groups
 focused on the problem. Women in many cases are reluctant to testify against their
 
 
 313
 abusers. Police generally refrain from intervening in cases of domestic violence, and
 some women have charged credibly that the courts are lenient in such cases.
 While the role of women in society is not legally restricted, economic conditions
 tend to limit women to home and family, particularly in rural areas, although some
 women work as domestics, in agriculture, or in the large tourism sector. The Gov-
 ernment promised in previous years to provide better programs and educational op-
 portunities for both sexes as well as family planning services, but failed to imple-
 ment any new programs during the year. The Directorate of Women's Affairs exists
 to help women advance in government and the professions, but progress was slow.
 Children.-Child abuse remains a hidden problem. While the Government repeat-
 edly expressed its commitment to children's rights, it made no significant efforts to
 protect those rights in practice, and abuse tends to go unpunished.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no specific laws mandating accessibility for
 the disabled, but there are constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination
 against the physically disabled in employment and education. There is no evidence
 of widespread discrimination against physically disabled individuals, although the
 Government does not visibly enforce the constitutional antidiscrimination provi-
 sions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. Al-
 though fewer than 50 percent of workers belong to unions, the important hotel in-
 dustry is heavily unionized. Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the
 Antigua Trades and Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union (AWU).
 The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the larger and more active AWU
 is rather loosely allied with the opposition.
 The Labor Code recognizes the right to strike, but the Court of Industrial Rela-
 tions may limit this right in a given dispute. Once either party to a dispute requests
 the court to mediate, there can be no strike. Because of the delays associated with
 this process, unions often resolve labor disputes before a strike is called.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international labor organizations and do so in
 practice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor organizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and
 there were no reports that it occurred. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation are not required to rehire employees fired for union activities, but must pay
 full severance pay and full wages lost by the employee from the time of firing until
 the determination of employer fault. There are no areas of the country where union
 organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law stipulates a minimum
 working age of 13, which is respected in practice. The Ministry of Labour, which
 is required by law to conduct periodic inspections of workplaces, has responsibility
 for enforcement. There have been no reports of minimum age employment viola-
 tions. The political strength of the two major unions and the powerful influence of
 the Government on the private sector combine to make the Ministry of Labour very
 effective in enforcement in this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law established minimum wages for var-
 ious work categories in 1981. The lowest minimum wage, for domestic workers, is
 $0.46 (EC$1.25) per hour, the highest minimum wage, for skilled labor, is $1.30
 (EC$3.50) per hour. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but in practice the great majority of workers
 earn substantially more than the minimum wage.
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day workweek, but in practice the stand-
 ard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum of 3
 weeks of annual leave and up to 13 weeks of maternity leave.
 There are no occupational health and safety laws or regulations; thus there is no
 provision for a worker to leave a dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
