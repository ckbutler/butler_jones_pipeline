 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands, most-
 ly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square miles of the Central Pacific. Four
 states--Chuuk (formerly Truk), Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap-comprise the federation.
 The population is estimated to exceed 100,000, mostly of Micronesian origin. The
 four states were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by
 the United States from 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United Na-
 tions.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a majority vote in ac-
 cordance with the Constitution, which is based in large part on the U.S. model.
 There are three branches of government: a president as chief executive and head
 of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four constituent states, and a ju-
 dicial system that ap plies criminal and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling
 those of the United States.

 Under the Com pact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security. The FSM has no security forces of its own, aside from
 local police and other law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 Traditional customs sustain a value system which distinguishes between people
 on the basis of social status and sex. Discrimination and violence against women
 are the principal human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no incidence of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures for the most part are
 patterned after U.S. law in its provisions for due process. These provisions are care-
 fully observed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights,
 and trials are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings. The Chief Jus-
 tice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the advice and con-
 sent of the Congress.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These rights are constitutionally assured and
 observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio station broadcasting
 primarily in the local language. Local television programming in some states shows
 videotaped and occasionally live coverage of local sports and political and cultural
 events. Subscription cable television, showing major U.S. programming, is available
 in Chuuk and Pohnpei. Religious groups operate private radio stations. The national
 Government and the states of Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae publish newsletters.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Bill of Rights provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and these rights are honored in prac-
 tice. During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public meet-
 ings. Formal associations are uncommon in Micronesia, but student organizations
 exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The FSM is hospitable to diverse religions, and mission-
 aries of many faiths work within the nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establish-
 ment of a state religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state; the Congress then choos-
 es the President and Vice President from its ranks by majority vote. State gov-
 ernors, state legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by direct popu-
 lar vote. Political campaigning is unrestricted and, as there are no established polit-
 ical parties, political support is generally courted from among family and allied clan
 groupings. In the 1993 national congressional election, all 10 incumbent 2-year sen-
 ators were reelected. There were allegations of voter registration list improprieties
 in one of the districts during the election. As a result of a suit brought by the losing
 congressional candidate in this disputed district, the Supreme Court ruled that bal-
 loting at the one polling place where documented irregularities took place should be
 repeated. The administration asked the Congress to fund the new vote. The Con-
 gress, however, accepted the initial results of the election, citing its constitutional
 authority to be the final judge of the qualifications and credentials of its members.
 The Supreme Court accepted the congressional action, and no reballoting took place.
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of political groups, to date
 there have been no significant efforts to form political parties.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known requests for investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions. While there are no official restrictions, no local groups concern themselves
 with human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimi-
 nation based on race, sex, language, or religion, societal discrimination and violence
 against women remain serious problems. Women are still at the early stages of find-
 ing jobs beyond the entry level in both the public and private sectors. There is one
 female state legislator. Women's roles within the family as wife, mother, home-
 maker, and childrearer remain virtually unchanged from earlier times. Allegations
 of violence against women are usually concerned with domestic conflict between
 husband and wife, and wife beating under certain circumstances still is condoned
 among more traditional elements of the population. While assault by a husband or
 other male relative on women and children within the family is a criminal offense
 under law, most women are reluctant to bring formal charges. When formal charges
 are brought by women against men who assault them, the attitude of the authori-
 ties is that such issues are best left to the extended family unit to resolve.
 In 1992 women began to have organizational representation at the national level
 with the formation of a National Women's Advisory Council, made up of a National
 Women's Interest Officer (NWIO) and representative NWIOs from each state. The
 organizational details of this Council, and its place in the bureaucracy, remained
 uncertain in 1993.
 Children.-Children's rights are respected. Increasing national governmental em-
 phasis was given to the educational needs of children in 1993 with the formation
 of a separate Department of Education. The FSM Congress this year passed a bill
 establishing special education programs.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Non-Micronesians are prohibited from pur-
 chasing land in the FSM. Occasional sentiment against non-Micronesians appears,
 as in proposed legislation to regulate subsistence fishing and farming by non-Micro-
 nesians. But, for the most part, non-Micronesians share fully in the social and cul-
 tural life of the FSM. FSM citizenship for non-Micronesians is granted only by indi-
 vidual acts of the national Congress.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no de jure discrimination against the physically
 disabled. There are neither laws nor regulations mandating accessibility for the dis-
 abled. FSM schools have established special education classes to address problems
 encountered by those who exhibit learning disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Citizens have the right to form or join associations,
 and national government employees by law may form associations to "present their
 views" to the Government. However, as yet, neither such associations nor trade
 unions have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no law dealing spe-
 cifically with trade unions or with the right to collective bargaining. Wages are set
 by individual employers. The Government is not a member of the International
 Labor Organization. Micronesia has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no law establishing a
 minimum age for employment of children. While in practice there is no employment
 of children or wages, they often assist their families in subsistence farming activi-
 ties.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The four state governments have established
 minimum wages for government workers: $1.49 per hour in Kosrae, effective Octo-
 ber 1992; $1.35 in Pohnpei, effective October 1991; $0.80 per hour in Yap, effective
 January 1980; $0.83 in Chuuk, effective November 1985. Pohnpei is the only state
 that applies its minimum wage rate to the rivate sector. In 1993 Chuuk's mini-
 mum wage was raised by legislation, but the raise was vetoed by the governor.
 These minimum wage structures and the wages customarily paid to unskilled work-
 ers are sufficient to provide an acceptable standard of living under local conditions.
 There are no laws regulating hours of work (although a 40-hour workweek is
 standard practice) or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health. A fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of employment. The
 
 
 698
 FSM Department of Health has no enforcement capability; working conditions, in
 practice, vary.
