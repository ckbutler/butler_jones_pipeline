 CUBA
 Cuba is governed by a tightly interwoven hierarchy at the apex
 of which is a single individual, Fidel Castro, who is chief of
 state, head of government, leader of the Communist Party, and
 commander of Cuba's armed forces. Taking power in 1959 from a
 discredited dictatorship, the Castro Government quickly
 transformed itself into a Communist regime and instituted a
 far more systematically repressive order than had previously
 existed. Repression of basic human rights today is so
 pervasive that Cuba holds the dubious distinction of being the
 Western Hemisphere's most serious violator of human rights and
 fundamental freedoms.
 Supported by a few long-time associates, Castro controls all
 aspects of Cuban life through a network of directorates
 ultimately responsible to the Communist Party. As in other
 Communist systems, the party is totally autonomous with
 self-perpetuating membership. Elections are held only to
 endorse party-approved candidates. The party determines the
 political, social, and economic norms and goals of the
 country. It ensures internal security and conformity with
 these goals through the Ministry of Interior, which operates
 border and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations,
 decides on the legality of associations, investigates evidence
 of nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains an
 intricate system of informers and block wardens. Article 61
 of the Constitution states explicitly that civil liberties may
 not be exercised "contrary to the decision of the Cuban people
 to build socialism and communism." Thus, such liberties may
 be exercised only to the degree that the State deems expedient.
 Before Castro took power, Cuba had an expanding economy and a
 substantial middle class. Per capita income was among the
 highest in Latin America although wealth was not evenly
 distributed and poverty existed, especially in rural areas.
 Today, income distribution is more egalitarian, but the
 political and military elite live in relative comfort, while
 the vast majority of Cubans must cope with a severe scarcity
 of housing, food items, and consumer goods. Most necessities
 are still rationed--28 years after the revolution--and
 sometimes wholly unavailable. Many consumer items can be
 acquired, if at all, only at high prices in the "parallel
 market." What "private sector" there is is too small to be
 economically significant. Inefficiency characterizes the state
 sector, where the incentive to produce is conspicuously absent.
 Cuban citizens are allowed to own personal property such as
 homes and autos, but cannot own any means of production in the
 national economy.
 It is difficult to obtain precise information, particularly
 statistics, about human rights violations in Cuba because of
 tight controls by the Cuban Government and its continued
 refusal to allow visits by international human rights
 organizations. Nonetheless, the available evidence clearly
 shows that the Cuban Government continued to commit egregious
 human rights violations, including the arbitrary imprisonment
 of five leading officials of the Cuban Human Rights Committee,
 the sole, fledgling human rights organization in Cuba.
 Reliable information indicates there has been no lessening of
 the tight government controls on most aspects of life in Cuba.
 Political prisoners released in 1986 have reported that the
 Government continues serious basic human rights abuses,
 including the use of torture and the denial of fair public
 trial. Many political prisoners have been forced to remain in
 
 
 460
 CUBA
 jail after the expiration of their original sentences. Arrests
 for political crimes have not abated. Free speech is not
 permitted. The practice of religion has been actively
 discouraged and in some cases is prohibited, in spite of an
 effort by the Government to appear open to a dialogue with the
 Catholic Church. In recent months, the regime has displayed
 some sensitivity to foreign opinion by releasing approximately
 150 long-term political prisoners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Summary execution of opponents has been a frequent practice of
 the regime since it came to power in 1959. Credible reports
 continued in 1986 that secret executions remain an instrument
 of policy, although without the show trials of the earlier
 period. While these executions may be preceded by a "trial,"
 it is a trial in name only and does not meet minimum standards
 of fairness and justice: the verdict is often foreordained.
 In August, Antonio Frias Sosa, a 17-year-old high school
 student and photographer reportedly working with the Cuban
 Committee on Human Rights, died mysteriously while in police
 custody within a few hours of his arrest. Police allege that
 he committed suicide.
 In late 1986, nine persons jailed for religious activities
 reportedly were awaiting execution in Combinado del Este
 prison.
 b. Disappearance
 While there are no substantiated reports of disappearances in
 Cuba, persons detained for political offenses are often held,
 frequently incommunicado, for prolonged periods without being
 charged. Friends and family risk retribution if they inquire
 about their fate.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Long-term prisoners released in 1986 confirmed the inhuman
 conditions in Cuban jails. They also have confirmed previous
 reports of serious, systematic abuses including: torture by
 prison medical staff and others; beatings by prison officials;
 inadequate diet; withholding medical care, fresh air, and
 exercise; denying family visits and mail for years; solitary
 confinement; physical injury caused by electronic noise
 machines; and medical experiments on unsuspecting prisoners.
 A political prisoner has asserted that torture is
 systematically practiced in Cuba's prisons. Cuba's treatment
 of political prisoners has repeatedly been denounced by the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission, as well as by other
 international organizations.
 In late August, the secret police arrested and reportedly
 tortured Dr. Domingo Jorge Delgado and Jose Luis Alvarado,
 members of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights. According to
 some reports, Delgado was arrested after he tried to register
 the Committee under the Law of Associations.
 
 
 461
 CUBA
 Political prisoners who refuse to accept political
 indoctrination or be classified as common criminals are known
 as "plantados" and are subject to particular abuse. Because
 Cuban authorities have required them to wear the uniforms of
 common criminals, which they refuse to do, the "plantados"
 dress only in pajamas or underwear or wear no clothing at
 all. Visits by friends or relatives are limited to 1 or 2 per
 year, or less, and letters to 1 per month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests can be made by state security forces acting secretly
 and without warrants. Those arrested can be and often are
 detained for long periods without judicial hearings. If a
 hearing does take place, the detainee may or may not be
 allowed a lawyer. Under Article 61 of the Constitution, no
 legal protection can be invoked to prevent the State from
 arresting anyone it considers harmful to the "decision of the
 Cuban people to build socialism and communism." Incommunicado
 detention is not unusual. People arrested for vandalism,
 practicing certain religions, or criticizing the regime can be
 charged with sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities.
 Political prisoners are not routinely released at the end of
 their terms; whether they are freed depends on a personal
 decision by Fidel Castro, who frequently has used the release
 of political prisoners to gain favor with influential foreign
 visitors or to put the latter under obligation to "respond" in
 some manner.
 A case in point is that of Pastor Macuran Gonzalez, who was
 released in 1986 after almost 28 years in prison, though he
 had been originally sentenced to only 10 years. On completion
 of his original sentence, he was told he had to serve 15 more
 years. There were no additional charges, nor was there a new
 trial.
 There is no bail for defendants charged with crimes against
 state security or crimes for which the death penalty or the
 maximum prison sentence can be imposed.
 Preventive detention is permitted and routinely practiced in
 cases of "dangerousness", a broad, arbitrary classification
 used for individuals deemed by the regime to have a proclivity
 toward conduct "contrary to Socialist principles." The
 Government commonly detains large numbers of persons before
 public celebrations and political events to ensure that there
 will be no threat to public order.
 When released, former political prisoners are subject to
 constant surveillance and official harassment. They are
 routinely denied ration cards, identification documents, and
 employment. A notorious example of abuse is Ricardo Bofill
 Pages, president of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, who
 was released from his second prison term in 1985. After his
 release he was placed under virtual house arrest, with severe
 restrictions on his movements. Denied the means of earning a
 living, he had to rely on the generosity of others. He was
 detained and questioned on a number of occasions. Bofill, who
 has a wife and son in the United States, has been denied
 permission to emigrate and was refused adequate medical
 treatment. Following the Government's move against Committee
 members in August, Bofill, fearing imprisonment again, sought
 refuge in the French Embassy, where he remained at year's end.
 
 
 462
 CUBA
 Forced labor is a routine part of prison life in Cuba.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Cuban courts are described constitutionally as
 "independent," in practice they are subordinate to the
 Communist Party through the National Assembly of the People's
 Power and the Council of State. All civil courts are presided
 over by a five-person panel of judges. Three are
 professionally qualified; the other two are "workers'
 representatives" who see that the "interests of the
 revolution" are protected. People accused of certain
 counterrevolutionary activities are tried and sentenced
 secretly by military tribunals.
 The principle of habeas corpus, or the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention, does not exist.
 Although defense lawyers are theoretically available to all
 defendants, attorneys have been jailed for defending persons
 charged with political offenses. One of those attorneys,
 Aramis Taboada, died in a prison hospital in November 1985,
 under still unexplained and highly suspicious circumstances.
 At least two other attorneys, Domingo Jorge Delgado and
 Francisco Morua, have been jailed for their efforts on behalf
 of political defendants. Under these conditions, it is very
 difficult for a political defcndant to retain legal counsel.
 Most must rely on public defenders. These government employees
 are generally ill-prepared and unsympathetic to the plight of
 their clients.
 Defendants accused of nonpolitical offenses fare little better
 in Cuban courts. As observed in the recent trials of a number
 of American citizens imprisoned in Cuba, the courts do not
 adhere to rules of evidence or procedures acceptable under
 international norms. In one case, the accused was never
 permitted to speak-to his court-appointed attorney.
 Fidel Castro told foreign journalists in February 1985 that
 "political prisoners ...amount to about 200..." He also said
 the number of individuals "sentenced for counterrevolutionary
 activities" could be as many as 1,000. Americas Watch and
 Amnesty International have published estimates of 250 to 1,000.
 Ramon Conte Hernandez, a Bay of Pigs veteran released in
 October 1986, estimates that 300 long-term political prisoners
 remain in jail after serving 20 years or more, while another
 1,000 political offenders have served lesser terms but are
 still in jail.
 On the other hand, political prisoners released in 1984
 contended that the total number of political prisoners was
 close to 10,000, and a survey in 1985 of various human rights
 organizations produced numbers as high as 15,000. Moreover,
 the Cuban Committee for Human Rights in 1985 estimated that
 there were 12,500 political prisoners in jail, including 3,000
 in military jails comprising, according to the Committee,
 mainly conscientious objectors and those who refused to serve
 with'Cuba's overseas forces. The great discrepancy in
 estimated totals is attributable in part to varying definitions
 of political offenses. There are probably several thousand
 Cubans in prison for attempting to leave the country, a
 political crime in Cuba, who have committed no other act
 against the regime. In fact, few of the political prisoners
 have taken part in any form of violence; the vast majority have
 been imprisoned for attempting to exercise such legitimate
 
 
 463
 CUBA
 human rights as freedom of speech, religion, association, and
 assembly.
 In recent years, the Government has released small groups of
 political prisoners with an eye toward international opinion
 and its own political agenda. In 1986 Cuba released about 125
 long-term political prisoners, some on requests from the United
 States Catholic Conference and from the French oceanographer
 Jacques Cousteau.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Daily life is closely monitored by the Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution (CDR) that exist on virtually every
 block in Cuban municipalities, and in which membership is
 essentially mandatory. CDR members are expected to report
 anything "unusual," including strangers (especially foreigners)
 in the neighborhood, reception of foreign radio and television
 broadcasts, conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings, or
 critical comments about the Government. Cubans overheard by
 neighbors reportedly have been fined for speaking disparagingly
 of Fidel Castro in their homes. As thefts and burglaries
 increased during 1986, the CDR's were exhorted to become
 security guards as well.
 Few aspects of an ordinary Cuban's private life are free from
 state surveillance. Police searches of homes are carried out
 without warrants. Telephones are tapped, and mail is opened.
 Family life is complicated in Cuba by educational practices
 which often separate children from their parents and teach
 that the State's interests have priority over family ties.
 Further disruption is caused by strong pressures to participate
 in "voluntary" Communist party-related activities. Parents
 fear, rightly, that teaching their children religious
 practices, even in their homes, will harm the children's
 careers. There is a mandatory requirement for families to
 send all high school students, even as young as 11 years old,
 on annual 75-day stints of "voluntary work" at remote camps in
 distant rural areas. Conditions there are those of forced
 labor camps: no running water, no toilets, minimal food, long
 hours--as many as 16 a day, 6 days a week, plus a few on
 Sunday--of hard manual labor, prison-like discipline, and
 family visits only on Sunday. The children reportedly are
 subjected to intensive Party indoctrination during these
 periods.
 The arrests of Cuban Committee for Human Rights members Delgado
 and Alvarado were followed by a search of the group's offices
 on August 28. Police confiscated 950 copies of the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights, committee files, and printing
 equipment.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Cuba; all media are
 controlled by the State and are used for indoctrination and
 dissemination of propaganda. They publish or broadcast nothing
 that is not in consonance with the party line. There are
 credible reports that broadcasters have been dismissed or
 punished for casual comments, such as making a sarcastic
 remark about the artistic merit of East European children's
 
 
 464
 CUBA
 programs on Cuban television. Intellectual expression is
 limited to activities that conform to government policy lines.
 Foreign radio and television broadcasts are jammed. A shrill
 hum is transmitted to interfere with broadcasts of the Voice of
 America's Cuba Service, Radio Marti. Some Miami radio stations
 are also jammed. Non-communist foreign periodicals are rarely
 permitted to circulate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is not guaranteed and in
 practice is actively discouraged. Any group meeting is almost
 certain to be monitored by the CDR or representatives of state
 security. All associations are controlled and most are
 sponsored by the party or Government. A few private
 associations exist at the sufferance of the Government and at
 the risk of the members.
 There is no recognized right of labor to organize, bargain
 collectively, or strike. A well-established and active labor
 movement existing in 1958 was taken over by Communist cadres
 who took office even when defeated in democratic elections.
 Most leaders of these unions, including many previously allied
 with Castro, were jailed. Cuban workers are required to belong
 to the officially sponsored Confederation of Cuban Workers
 (CTC). The CTC sends worker delegates to meetings of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The CTC is affiliated
 with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 It is not an independent trade union but rather a mass
 organization under party control. It uniformly supports all
 government political initiatives.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Church-State relations are administered by the Religious
 Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist
 party. Established in 1985, the Office is headed by a person
 who has long handled such questions for the party. In February
 1986, the Government allowed the Cuban Catholic Church to hold
 a national conference for the first time in 20 years. Church
 representatives from the Vatican and other countries also
 attended. Although the Church believed it had government
 permission to circulate several thousand copies of the final
 conference report within Cuba, this has not yet been done.
 Also in 1986, Castro gave permission to Mother Teresa of
 Calcutta to found a small branch of her order in Havana. The
 Government has, in turn, attempted to obtain the Church's
 endorsement of its views on such issues as the foreign debt of
 Latin American countries.
 Despite these few modest signs of greater official tolerance,
 and notwithstanding a constitutional guarantee, Cubans who
 practice their religion face serious discrimination. Religious
 groups must register with the Government. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses Church was refused permission to register, and its
 buildings were confiscated. Religious materials generally may
 not be distributed freely in Cuba. Though the Third Party
 Congress in February 1986 softened party criticism of
 religions, openly religious Cubans are still excluded from all
 important positions in the Government and denied advancement
 in many fields.
 The Government makes no provision to respect the beliefs of
 Seventh-Day Adventists who object to compulsory work and
 
 
 CUBA
 school attendance on Saturday. No exception to military
 service is made for conscientious objectors. Those who refuse
 to serve for religious reasons are jailed. There are reports
 that they have been incarcerated for much longer periods than
 others who fail to fulfill their military obligations.
 Castro has admitted that the regime discriminates against
 adherents of religious faiths. Long-term government policies
 to discourage religious observance have had a demonstrable
 effect. The majority of worshipers are over 50 years of age.
 CDR's monitor attendance at the few neighborhood churches still
 open, so that many churchgoers prefer to attend large downtown
 churches where they hope to remain anonymous. While four
 Protestant and two Catholic seminaries are allowed to operate,
 religious elementary and secondary schools, as well as
 universities, are prohibited.
 Clergy and lay officials of Protestant as well as Catholic
 churches are usually allowed to travel abroad on church
 matters. However, international contacts of all Cuban
 churches are carefully monitored by the state security
 apparatus.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel is unrestricted by law, and Cubans are
 permitted to change their jobs and residences. In contrast,
 permission is required both to leave and to reenter the
 country. Until recently, nonofficial foreign travel was
 generally limited to rare cases of special humanitarian
 concern, such as illness in a family; "other exceptions were
 clergy or lay officials on church business, women over 60, and
 men over 65. Even travel by these last two groups has been
 severely curtailed.
 Emigration is strictly controlled, and those who apply to
 leave may lose their jobs, houses, and ration books.
 Moreover, their children may be refused further schooling. In
 some cases, the intending emigrants are physically and verbally
 abused. Draft-age males and professionals have reported that
 the Government will allow them to emigrate only if they pay
 tens of thousands of dollars, ostensibly to reimburse the
 Government for the cost of their education. The few people
 permitted to emigrate must leave behind almost all their
 personal and household possessions and are forced to pay
 discriminatory air fares. They must also pay exorbitant fees
 for travel documents. These fees must be paid in hard
 currency, which by law is not available to Cuban citizens; it
 must be obtained from relatives or friends abroad.
 On December 16, the Government announced a last-minute decision
 which showed particular disregard for the human rights of 20
 former political prisoners, their families, and relatives in
 the United States. The former prisoners and their families,
 numbering 48 in all, were expected to arrive in Miami on a
 December 17 early morning charter flight from Havana. However,
 in the afternoon of December 16, the Cuban Government informed
 the U.S. Interests Section in Havana that exit permits for
 former political prisoners were not being granted at that time.
 In addition to the bitter disappointment at not being reunited
 with relatives in the United States for the Christmas holidays,
 most of the refugees had no place to go, having turned their
 houses over to the Government, as required, in advance of
 their December 17 departure date. In one case, the 71-year-old
 
 
 466
 CUBA
 wife of a former prisoner surrendered her house in a distant
 province and went directly to Havana airport. Only upon
 arrival late in the evening, did she learn that she could not
 be reunited with her husband. In addition to this group of
 48, over 150 other former political prisoners and relatives
 were still awaiting exit visas from the Cuban Government in
 order to travel to the United States.
 On December 14, 1984, Cuba and the United States signed an
 agreement under which Cuba, as required by international law,
 would allow the reentry of 2,746 Cuban citizens found to be
 excludable from the United States, and the United States would
 reinstitute processing of Cuban applications to immigrate to
 the United States. In May 1985, Cuba unilaterally suspended
 the agreement, thus preventing the reunification of thousands
 of families. The Government also has sharply restricted the
 travel to Cuba of residents of the United States who wish to
 visit relatives.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuba is firmly controlled by the Communist Party, which in turn
 is dominated by Fidel Castro. Members of the Central Committee
 and the Politburo are selected by a narrow circle of party
 rulers. Elections simply ratify choices already made. The
 National Assembly of People's Power meets briefly twice a year,
 solely to endorse decisions already made by the party. No
 political opposition is permitted in Cuba; dissidents are in
 jail, outside the country, or forced to remain silent. There
 is no legal way for citizens to change their government; as a
 result, hundreds of thousands of Cubans have fled their
 country, and many others would do so if they could.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cuban Government routinely denies that there are violations
 of human rights in the country but refuses permission for
 outside organizations to investigate its claims. The ILO
 Committee on Freedom of Association considered a complaint
 alleging the imprisonment of striking Cuban workers, as well as
 the sentencing to death of workers who tried to organize an
 independent trade union on the model of Solidarity in Poland.
 Lawyer Aramis Taboada, who participated in the defense of the
 workers, was subsequently arrested. The ILO dropped the matter
 in 1984 when it became clear that the Cuban Government would
 not allow access to information necessary for further
 investigation.
 In October 1985, a delegation sponsored by the Center for
 Development Policy visited Cuba. Though not a human rights
 organization, the delegation included representatives of
 nongovernmental human rights organizations and discussed human
 rights in meetings with Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials.
 Members of the group reported that no progress was made on
 human rights issues. A promise to provide a list of political
 prisoners to the group was not honored.
 Although the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 helped Cuba arrange the repatriation of Cuban nationals from
 Grenada in November 1983, the ICRC has not been accorded access
 to Cuban jails or permission to visit political prisoners.
 Americas Watch and Amnesty International have also been refused
 
 
 467
 CUBA
 such access. A representative of the Committee on Hemispheric
 Affairs was to visit in November 1986, but his visa was
 abruptly withdrawn when the Cuban Government learned the reason
 for the visit was to discuss human rights--rather than Central
 America. The American Civil Liberties Union fared no better in
 its attempts to obtain visas. The few human rights activists
 in Cuba who are not in jail are forced to carry out their
 activities clandestinely.
 The Government also severely limits the ability of foreign
 journalists to report on human rights violations. Fidel Castro
 has boasted about how carefully foreign journalists are watched
 in Cuba. In 1983, two French journalists were detained for 10
 days and then expelled from Cuba because they had met with
 Cuban human rights activist Ricardo Bofill Pages, who was
 himself imprisoned for meeting with them. In 1985, the Agence
 France Press (AFP) correspondent in Cuba was expelled for
 writing an article on a Cuban law firm--an agency of the
 Government--that extracted large payments for exit permits for
 Cubans married to foreigners. In September 1986, the
 correspondents for both AFP and Reuters were summarily expelled
 for filing a report on the Cuban Committee for Human Rights
 and the arrest of its members. Earlier, two American newspaper
 reporters preparing a story on Cubans who had returned from the
 United States under the short-lived 1984 migration agreement
 had their trip cut short when they conducted interviews not
 previously authorized and arranged by the Cuban Government.
 Other foreign journalists were forced to leave Cuba for having
 taken pictures of one of the houses occupied by fugitive
 American financier Robert Vesco, who was residing in Cuba.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although discrimination against women and minorities is
 outlawed, few women hold high positions in government or the
 party. However, there were some small gains in this regard in
 1986. Women now make up 18 per cent of the full and alternate
 members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Raul
 Castro's wife, a veteran Communist, was selected as a full
 member of the party Politburo.
 Blacks and other minorites are underrepresented in the top
 levels of government. The Government claims that Blacks and
 persons of mixed race now account for 28 percent of the
 membership of the party Central Committee, some improvement
 over previous levels. Only one black is a full member of the
 Politburo; another is an alternate.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The standard Cuban workweek is 44 hours, which includes 8 hours
 every other Saturday. Provisions for worker safety and control
 of industrial pollution are substantially below standards of
 industrialized Western countries. The mininum wage is about
 US$107 per month. Workers receive 1 month of annual vacation.
 Cubans do not normally begin working before the age of 17,
 although under some circumstances they may begin at 14.
 Minors under age 17 are not permitted to work under hazardous
 conditions or for more than 7 hours a day or 40 hours a week.
 However, students as young as 11 are required to spend from
 6 to 10 weeks a year performing agricultural work, such as
 harvesting crops, for which they receive no wages. As
 previously mentioned, the conditions under which this work is
 
 
 468
 CUBA
 performed and its mandatory nature resemble that of forced
 labor.
 Throughout 1986 Fidel Castro and other senior officials
 bitterly criticized both management and labor in Cuba for lack
 of enthusiasm and discipline, resulting, in their view, in
 poor economic performance. Criticism of work standards and
 threats of severe punishment accompanied these denuniciations
 which were termed the "Rectification Campaign." Such pressures
 on workers and managers alike to work harder or face
 disciplinary actions increased the unrest and fear which
 normally characterizes Cuban society.
