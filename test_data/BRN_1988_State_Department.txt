 BRUNEI
 Brunei is a small, wealthy, Islamic monarchy located on the
 north coast of Borneo. Although there are substantial Chinese
 and other minorities, it is predominantly Malay in population.
 Brunei is a hereditary and traditional Sultanate that has been
 ruled by the same family for over 500 years. A British
 protectorate until January 1, 1984, it has been internally
 self-governing since 1959.
 The Constitution promulgated in 1959 provided for the first
 sharing of political power by the Sultan, who since limited
 independence has been advised by a Council of Ministers. The
 Constitution, however, permits the Sultan to override the
 decisions of legislative and executive bodies in most
 instances. In elections for a legislative council in 1962, a
 party opposed to policies of the Sultan won a large majority;
 tensions over policy differences led to an armed uprising in
 December 1962 that was put down by British troops. The Sultan
 then invoked an article in the Constitution that allowed him
 to assume emergency powers for 2 years. This state of
 emergency has been renewed every 2 years and is still in
 force. Several persons detained under emergency powers
 following the 1962 uprising remain in custody without trial.
 Although the'Constitution is not suspended, the state of
 emergency allows the Sultan great latitude in ruling by
 orders. These orders have in effect suspended certain
 articles of the Constitution.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitation in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the general
 sense of well-being. Brunei has only about 230,000 people,
 but produces about 155,000 barrels of oil per day and slightly
 over 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year.
 It has one of the highest per capita gross national products
 in the world. Brunei has no debts, and one leading weekly
 economic newspaper estimated the nation's reserves at $20
 billion in mid-1986. The oil and LNG revenues allow the
 Government to provide free medical care, schools, and
 university training to its citizens. A large proportion of
 the Malay population is employed by the Government at generous
 salaries which permit a higher standard of living than in
 surrounding countries. Government employees are eligible for
 low-interest or no-interest loans to purchase homes,
 automobiles, and appliances. The nation's second largest
 employer, Brunei Shell, provides similiar benefits to its
 employees. Brunei has no income tax. There are several
 substantial, low-cost housing plans designed to provide homes
 for the landless.
 There were no major human rights developments during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In July the Sultan announced that whipping would be made
 mandatory as punishment for certain crimes. Regulations to
 implement this decision went into effect September 28, and
 sentences of whipping have begun to be handed down. It is not
 known whether any sentences actually were carried out.
 Previously, the penal code allowed for whipping, but in
 practice this punishment was rarely administered. Brunei's
 Criminal Procedures Code provides for whipping as a punishment
 for a number of offenses including: rape, assault, extortion,
 robbery, theft, vandalism, and drug-related crimes. There was
 no other evidence of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution has no provision for habeas corpus. The
 right exists, however, as the Application of Laws Act states
 that the Law of England (1951) applies except where Brunei has
 passed its own law. Under normal circumstances, a magistrate
 must "endorse" a warrant. On rare occasions, warrants are
 issued without this endorsement.
 The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods.
 Since the abortive rebellion in 1962, the Government has
 occasionally used the ISA to detain persons suspected of
 antigovernment activity. In February the Government dissolved
 the Brunei National Democratic Party and detained two of its
 leaders. A spokesman for the Brunei Peoples Party (BPP),
 banned for its role in the 1962 uprising, said at that time
 that 32 BPP members who left the country in 1962 and returned
 recently had also been detained. In July the Government
 released 34 ISA detainees. The only released detainee
 identified by name was a former BPP leader. According to the
 Government, six people remain in detention under the ISA.
 Some are believed to have been held since 1962. In its 1988
 report (covering 1987), Amnesty International (AI) reported
 that among BPP members being detained were 5 who have been
 held for 25 years without having been convicted of a crime.
 The report said it believed BPP members were being held not
 for any role in the 1962 rebellion but as a general deterrent
 to political activity. AI noted that it had submitted
 information about detentions without trial to the United
 Nations Human Rights Commision.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is derived from the British system.
 Those suspected of common crimes are detained, tried, and
 punished according to the law. Lacking a senior judiciary of
 its own, the Brunei High Court has for its Chief Justice a
 judge seconded from Hong Kong. There were no known instances
 of interference with the judiciary by the Government in 1988.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government is empowered by law to intrude into
 the privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, in
 practice it has not been known to do so.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press, though not restricted by law,
 are not generally exercised. There is no political opposition,
 and hence there have been no challenges which might have
 tested the degree of government tolerance toward political
 criticism.
 Brunei's only television station is government owned (two
 Malaysian stations can also be received). It usually avoids
 controversial issues, as-do newscasts on the radio stations.
 The single weekly newspaper generally avoids controversial
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom to assemble for political purposes has not been
 seriously tested in recent years. In 1985 the Government
 allowed establishment of the Brunei National Democratic Party
 (BNDP), the first political party since party activity was
 prohibited iii 1967. Just before its first public meeting, the
 Government announced that government employees could not
 attend party meetings, become members of political parties, or
 otherwise engage in organized political debate. In February
 the Government dissolved the BNDP and detained two of its
 leaders, charging that the party's contacts with the
 International Democratic Union were in violation of the
 Societies Act.
 In 1986 the Government approved the establishment of a second
 political party, the Brunei National United Party (BNUP);
 however, the organizers never announced its formation, and
 nothing further has been heard of it. The Government permits
 the formation of associations for many kinds of private
 economic, recreational, or other purposes without interference,
 but it requires their registration. There are private clubs,
 chambers of commerce, churches, and a variety of social and
 cultural organizations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion, but the Constitution
 provides for freedom of worship for other religions. There
 are several Christian churches in the country. There are also
 missionary schools in Brunei, including one attended by
 members of the Royal Family.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the
 country for its citizens, permanent residents, and
 expatriates. Some restrictions on travel abroad are placed
 oncertain expatriates as part of contract obligations to the
 Government of Brunei. Travel to Communist nations is
 restricted, and travel to China by Brunei's ethnic Chinese
 citizens and ethnic Chinese residents is tightly controlled.
 Brunei has not been willing to accept refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no way in which citizens can change their government
 through established democratic processes. Under the
 continuing state of emergency, there are no representative
 bodies at the national or local level and, since the
 dissolution of the BNDP in February, no known functioning
 political parties. However, citizens may seek to influence
 government by working through appointed village headmen and
 district officers, who meet regularly with their
 constituents. They may also attempt to effect change by
 petitioning the Sultan directly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei
 which deal specifically with the protection of human rights.
 AI reports it has on several occasions appealed to the Sultan
 for the release of a number of political prisoners, some held
 for many years without trial, but has received no reply.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women are denied equal status with men in a number of
 important respects. In areas such as divorce, inheritance,
 and custody of children, Brunei Muslims are governed by
 Koranic law, and women do not enjoy equal status. In the same
 areas non-Muslim Bruneians are subject to 1951 British civil
 law. While there are no separate pay scales for women and
 men, women employed in the Government and private sectors
 generally are concentrated in lower paying clerical and
 secretarial jobs. Some hold senior level professional
 positions, and the number of female university graduates is
 increasing. For reasons of Muslim traditions and practices,
 women are not as likely to find fast track positions in the
 civil service. While women are not legally obliged to observe
 strict Muslim standards of dress, many Muslim women do so.
 Non-Muslim women generally dress conservatively.
 The majority of the substantial Chinese minority in Brunei are
 not citizens (those having no claims to other nationalities
 were "British-protected persons" prior to independence and are
 now either stateless permanent or temporary residents).
 Permanent residents cannot own land but usually resolve this
 problem through 7-year leases, the maximum amount of time for
 lease agreements in Brunei. The process of obtaining
 citizenship in Brunei is long and difficult. In general, the
 Chinese community has prospered in Brunei, and much of the
 country's commercial activity is in Chinese hands. While the
 Chinese have done well economically, many are now reevaluating
 their position in Brunei, especially the prospects of their
 children in a society where Malay citizens are favored in such
 areas as government employment. Some are emigrating to other
 nations, especially Australia and Canada.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are legal in Brunei, but must be registered with
 the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for
 
 
 739
 BRUNEI
 registration. There are four registered trade unions, with a
 total-membership amounting to less than 5 percent of the work
 force. The Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of
 trade union federations in Brunei, but forbids affiliation of
 Brunei trade unions with labor organizations outside Brunei.
 It is illegal to discriminate against any employed person by
 reason of his being or not being a member of a trade union.
 An individual contract is required between an employer and
 each employee, but trade union activities "in restraint of
 trade" are not illegal and cannot be deemed to violate
 employee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this
 provision as conferring the right to strike, however, there
 have been no strikes in recent memory.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no government interference with lawful union
 activity. Conditions in Brunei are not conducive to the
 development of trade unions, and collective bargaining is
 limited to only a few industries. Wage and benefit packages
 far exceed those of neighboring nations; there is a lack of
 those kinds of industries in which unions have traditionally
 developed; and there is a long cultural tradition of trying to
 achieve consensus rather than cause confrontation. Labor law
 and practice are uniform throughout Brunei.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited in Brunei and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children below the age of 16 is prohibited, and
 below the age of 18 requires parental consent and approval by
 the Labor Commission. Women under 18 may not work at night or
 on offshore oil platforms. Laws on employment of children are
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Brunei has a system of minimum wages for different job
 categories. Labor is in short supply, and market forces allow
 most citizens of Brunei to command high wages. Overtime work
 in excess of 48 hours must be paid for, and double time must
 be paid for work performed on legal holidays. Working
 conditions are subject to inspection by the Labor Commission
 on a routine basis and in response to complaints. Brunei's
 labor regulations are effectively enforced by the Labor
 Department, which is empowered to close any place of
 employment in which health, safety, or working conditions are
 unsatisfactory.
