 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a government
 composed of three separate and equal branches, the executive,
 the legislative, and the judicial. During 1988 increased
 social tension placed great demands on the country's still
 developing democratic institutions. Political parties
 conducted nationwide internal party and primary elections.
 Despite deeply rooted partisanship and the approach
 of the 1989 general election, there was remarkably little
 violence generated by political competition. The historically
 dominant military institution demonstrated continued support
 for civilian rule.
 Internal defense is the responsibility of the Armed Forces,
 which includes the public security forces. The Armed Forces
 is under the direct command of the Chief of the Armed Forces
 and is responsible to the President of the Republic and
 operates under full civilian control.
 Honduras is a poor and underdeveloped country: unemployment
 is about 10 percent, and underemployment is considerably
 higher; about half of the adult population is illiterate; and
 annual per capita income is slightly less than $800. Honduras
 achieved an increase in real per capita income in 1987 for the
 first time in almost a decade. The officially announced rate
 of inflation in 1987 was 2.5 percent, but is expected to be
 higher in 1988. Honduras continues to face serious fiscal and
 balance of payments deficits that threaten the stability of
 the economy.
 In 1988 there were increased levels of criminal violence,
 exacerbated in part by a growth in urban slum areas. Members
 of the security forces in several cases appear to have been
 linked to extrajudicial killings and violence. There was also
 an upsurge in violence attributable to leftwing subversive or
 guerrilla organizations, including a number of attempted
 bombings, three assassinations, and an attack on U.S. military
 personnel. The Peace Corps headquarters in Tegucigalpa was
 bombed in December, fortunately causing no injuries. Although
 there was concern over a new private anti-Communist
 organization formed in early 1988, the goal of which appeared
 to be the public identification of persons it labeled
 Communist, that organization has thus far not been associated
 with violence against any of the persons so labeled.
 Most of the human rights abuses committed by the public
 security forces (FUSEP) involved the use of excess force
 against prisoners and detainees. The security forces were
 criticized for their reluctance to publicize proceedings
 against members charged with abuses. Although the police
 dishonorably discharged a number of agents in 1988 for abuses
 of authority, the failure to provide details on the types of
 abuses involved or the action taken in particularly
 controversial cases detracted from the overall effort by the
 security forces to demonstrate concern for human rights.
 A number of constitutional rights were partially suspended for
 15 days following a violent attack on the U.S. Embassy on
 April 7 and related disorders elsewhere in Tegucigalpa and San
 Pedro Sula. The suspension affected freedom from incommunicado
 detention, freedom of association and assembly, freedom of
 movement, freedom from arrest or detention without judicial
 order, and the right to bail. Also, on April 8, all private
 radio and television broadcasts were suspended for
 
 
 611
 HONDURAS
 approximately 36 hours, reflecting the authorities' concern
 that public disorders were being incited by the media. The
 latter measure was particularly controversial and criticized
 as both unnecessary and unjust. The print media were not
 affected by the suspension.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Despite charges by some groups of government involvement in
 killings alleged to be politically motivated, no evidence that
 supports these assertions was provided. One assassination in
 January 1988, apparently carried out by elements of the
 radical left, involved a senior inspector of the National
 Department of Investigation (DNI), Jose Isaias Vilorio
 Barahona, who was shot at a Tegucigalpa bus stop on January
 5. Vilorio's body was draped with the banner of the Popular
 Liberation Movement (Cinchoneros), and a communique
 subsequently received by the media stated that this group was
 responsible'for the attack. Leftist organizations, however,
 charged the Armed Forces with responsibility on the theory
 that Vilorio, scheduled to appear at the Inter-American Court
 of Human Rights (IACHR) in a case against Honduras, was a
 threat to the Honduran military. Vilorio was a 20-year
 military veteran whose testimony had been expressly authorized
 by the Armed Forces and who had publicly voiced satisfaction
 at the opportunity to defend his institution and country. His
 testimony was expected to exonerate Honduras. The murder of
 Vilorio, who had been accused of involvement in the
 disappearances of radical leftists and guerrillas in the early
 19801s, resembled that of another victim of guerrilla
 assassination several years earlier who had been the subject
 of similar accusations.
 A double assassination on January 14 claimed the lives of
 Miguel Angel Pavon, the head of a regional branch of the
 nongovernmental Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in
 Honduras (CODEH) and a friend, Moises Landaverde. Pavon had
 testified against Honduras in the IACHR in 1987. The two were
 shot and killed by one or two unidentified men while sitting
 in a parked car. The investigation remains open, and there
 have been no announced leads to the identity of those
 responsible. Some human rights activists claim Pavon was a
 target of government vengeance for his testimony; other
 observers assert that private motivations, including intra-
 CODEH rivalry, were involved. In October Hector Vasquez, an
 associate of Pavon and former legal advisor to CODEH, publicly
 accused CODEH president Ramon Custodio of complicity in Pavon's
 death. (Vasquez was ousted in June 1988 after denouncing
 Custodio for misuse of CODEH funds.)
 A political motive may have been a factor in other killings.
 One instance involved Marco Tulio Perdomo, who in May 1988 was
 shot and killed in his home in La Entrada, Department of Copan.
 According to press reports, the family had been falsely accused
 by personal enemies of involvement in subversive activities.
 The result was a raid on the home by elements of the Armed
 Forces during which Perdomo was killed. Although admitting
 that they had opened fire when the residence was attacked, the
 family claims that Perdomo was deliberately murdered after
 being handcuffed.
 
 
 612
 HONDURAS
 During 1988 the press reported a number of cases in which
 members of the security forces apparently were responsible for
 the deaths of persons either in violent quarrels or for
 personal motives. In many instances, the accused parties were
 arrested and bound over for trial. As the military typically
 does not comment on such matters, it is unknown what further
 action, if any, has been taken in those cases. One highly
 publicized case of personally motivated killing remains
 unresolved. The case involved Jorge Andres Sanchez Sanchez,
 who reportedly murdered a relative of a member of the Armed
 Forces in a brawl and was immediately detained by the police.
 His body, with various stab wounds, was later discovered
 outside of Tegucigalpa. No known action has been taken
 against those involved in the arrest.
 In 1988 there were two known cases of probable serious abuse
 that resulted in death. Soldier Jose Lito Aguilera Cordova,
 an alleged deserter from the Special Forces, reportedly was
 arrested and held for interrogation, possibly on suspicion of
 subversion. The family and press agree that he died as a
 result of trabma induced by severe beating. An investigation
 was ordered by the Armed Forces, and a case opened in the
 military tribunal, but no findings have been published.
 In another case, Juan Angel Bautista was arrested and jailed
 on February 18. He was reported the following morning to have
 committed suicide in his cell by having submerged his head in
 a toilet. However, his family charged that his body showed
 signs of beating and strangulation.
 In most instances in which members of the Armed Forces have
 been involved in questionable killings, the military has
 refused to comment on its disciplinary procedures.
 There was an apparent increase in 1988 in the number of
 victims (often unidentified) of violent killings by unknown
 persons. As of late December, 174 such cases had been
 reported in the press. Of the 174, 60 cadavers were never
 identified, and 17 were identified in the press as known
 repeat criminal offenders. In eight cases, the press reported
 that the victims had been detained shortly before their deaths
 by members of the police force, charges denied by the police.
 The police have been openly and sharply critical of the
 frequency with which the judicial system has released those
 widely acknowledged to be criminals. According to police
 statistics, of 9,695 "known" criminal offenders turned over to
 the courts between January and September, 5,565 were released.
 The general public has also expressed concern over violent
 crime in periodic calls for the security forces to take "more
 stringent" anticrime measures.
 In response to concerns over possible involvement of the
 authorities in killings of criminals, the National Congress on
 September 13 passed a resolution calling for an
 investigation. FUSEP Commander Colonel Riera Lunatti followed
 with his own order for an investigation into the killings. He
 did not rule out the possibility that individual agents had
 exceeded their authority and promised to take punitive
 measures against any agents found to have been involved. No
 results of this investigation had been announced by year's end.
 Similarly, no results were announced of the judicial inquiry
 into the cases of Juan Angel Caballero and Roberto Ortiz,
 
 
 613
 HONDURAS
 whose deaths at the hands of the police in September 1987
 generated considerable controversy.
 One factor which in 1988 complicated efforts to determine the
 incidence of serious abuses by the security forces was the use
 by common criminals of military/police uniforms and
 identification in the commission of crimes. Towards the end
 of the year, the number of such crimes increased noticeably,
 including major robberies and the seizure of weapons from
 private guards. A number of arrests of such criminals were
 made during the year. In some instances, those involved in
 such activities turned out to be ex-members of the military or
 security forces, many dishonorably discharged for abuses
 committed while in service.
 b. Disappearance
 There was one allegation in 1988 of a politically motivated
 disappearance charged to the authorities. Roger Samuel
 Gonzalez, suspected of involvement in the attack on the U.S.
 Embassy annex on April 7, disappeared from downtown
 Tegucigalpa nearly 2 weeks after the incident. According to
 witnesses, Gonzalez was forced into a car by two men and a
 woman, all dressed in civilian clothing, after which he never
 reappeared. Friends and family charged that Gonzalez was
 abducted by members of the security forces. Shortly after
 Gonzalez' disapppearance, an Armed Forces spokesman stated
 publicly that the youth had been detained by the National
 Department of Investigations (DNI). The spokesman later
 retracted the statement, explaining that he had assumed that
 Gonzalez was one of 14 youths arrested for their part in the
 April 7 riot. (All 14 youths were released in June.) The
 Armed Forces subsequently denied that Gonzalez was taken into
 custody. The Court accepted six writs of habeas corpus on
 Gonzalez' behalf, and detention facilities were opened to
 inspection to no avail. The Armed Forces suggested that
 Gonzalez fled the country clandestinely; critics insist that
 Gonzalez was detained and killed. The case has yet to be
 resolved.
 The security forces' illegal practice of incommunicado
 detention led to a number of inaccurate charges of
 disappearance. One such case involved convicted thief German
 Hernaldo Castellanos, who was detained by security forces in
 late 1987. In January 1988, CODEH charged that Castellanos
 had been captured and murdered by the authorities. The
 security forces claimed that Castellanos had escaped from
 detention, and began a search which eventually located him in
 Catacamas, Olancho, where he had taken up with a band of
 cattle-rustlers.
 Several disappearances and kidnapings have been charged to
 members of Nicaragua's Sandinista Popular Army (EPS) operating
 in Honduran territory, including that of a Honduran farmer,
 Pablo Landero Cerrato, in February and two Honduran farmers,
 aged 46 and 17, in August. Their whereabouts are unknown. In
 June two Honduran soldiers, Alberto Moncada Miranda and
 Gustavo Adolfo Calix Romero Miranda, were seized by an EPS
 element and imprisoned in Nicaragua. Despite efforts by the
 Honduran authorities to obtain their release, the Sandinista
 regime agreed to free only one, claiming the other was a
 Nicaraguan. The offer was refused by the Honduran
 authorities, and the two remain prisoners in Nicaragua.
 
 
 614
 HONDURAS
 The IACHR in a July 29 decision, ruled that government agents
 were responsible for the disappearance of Manfredo Velasquez
 Rodriguez in September 1981. The Government denies complicity
 but has accepted the Court's decision and agreed to pay
 compensation. (See Section 4.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The use of torture is prohibited by the Constitution. In June
 1988, FUSEP officially adopted a United Nations-approved code
 of conduct for law enforcement agencies which prohibits
 torture and commits the police fbrce to actively oppose
 violations by individual agents. Despite this policy and the
 expressed will to eliminate the practice and punish offenders,
 abuse of prisoners and detainees continues to be common. By
 far the most routine form of abuse is physical beating,
 occasionally severe. In several 1988 cases, detainees charged
 that they were subjected to electric shock; others claimed to
 have had a hood placed on their heads during questioning. In
 one case the son of a policeman was reportedly tortured by
 having lighted cigarettes applied to his back, the results of
 which were clearly visible in press photographs.
 In a few cases of physical abuse, those responsible are known
 to have been dishonorably discharged or arrested and charged.
 The actual number of security agents punished for such abuse,
 however, is unknown because information on most cases is not
 made available by either the Armed Forces or FUSEP.
 In an effort to address the problem, FUSEP in 1989 will
 initiate a human rights training program that will begin with
 theoretical training provided to key officers at the
 Inter-American Institute for Human Rights in San Jose, Costa
 Rica. Using these officers as a core training cadre, a very
 basic program in human rights will be developed, with U.S.
 assistance, for incorporation into police basic training.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 Under Honduran law, a person may be arrested only with
 specific court authorization in the form of an order of arrest
 and must be informed clearly of the grounds of arrest. The
 suspect may be held no longer than 24 hours by security forces
 before being turned over to the court, where evidence
 supporting legal processing is reviewed. Within 6 days, the
 court is obligated to order either the release of the detainee
 or his remission to a penal center pending trial. Bail is
 both available and widely used.
 Despite these legal provisions, the police and other elements
 of the security forces reportedly carried out a number of
 detentions without judicial order in 1988, although reliable
 statistics are not available. The police appear frequently to
 violate the 24-hour rule, often holding detainees for
 questioning for as long as 3 days, in some cases considerably
 longer. The police publicly admit violations of the 24-hour
 rule, but attempt to justify the practice on the grounds that
 the limit is insufficient to allow the compilation of evidence
 necessary to ensure a proper trial of the suspects. The
 rationale is not accepted by the judiciary, but absent changes
 in the law enforcement system--especially the upgrading of
 investigative services--the pattern of violations is likely to
 continue.
 
 
 615
 HONDURAS
 In several cases, detainees arrested for alleged common crimes
 complained that they were questioned regarding possible
 subversive affiliations or acts. In one highly publicized
 case, an Argentine accused of murdering a police officer and
 extorting Honduran physicians was held over a month and
 allegedly beaten before being turned over to the court.
 In a case in mid-October, seven men from near the southern
 town of Choluteca were improperly detained during what the
 Armed Forces originally stated'was a recruitment drive and
 were held incommunicado for several weeks. After allegations
 of disappearances were made by family members and human rights
 groups unaware of their whereabouts, the Armed Forces in
 November acknowledged their detention on charges of
 involvement in military espionage. The Government said that
 the men will be tried for treason, specifically for spying on
 behalf of Nicaragua.
 The prevailing pattern seems to be compliance with the writs
 of habeas corpus. However, a-common charge is that compliance
 with writs of habeas corpus is avoided by moving detainees
 from one facility to another.
 There have been no cases of forced exile. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All trials in Honduras are public; there are neither secret
 tribunals nor political prisoners. The law provides for the
 equal application of justice and the fair trial of accused
 persons. Persons accused of a crime have the right to an
 initial hearing by a judge to assess the merits of the
 charges, to bail, and to an attorney--provided by the State if
 necessary. The defendant also has the right to an appeal and
 is considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Despite the comprehensiveness of the law in the matter of fair
 trial, in practice these rights are often infringed. One
 serious inequity of the judiciary is the absence of a public
 defender system to handle the cases of the many indigent
 persons accused of violations of the law, most of whom
 consequently fail to receive a timely hearing and sentence.
 The Government failed to provide the funding to implement its
 official order in late 1987 that the courts provide
 state-hired attorneys for the poor. Instead, private
 organizations tried to meet the demand by volunteering their
 own legal services for the indigent. The National Autonomous
 University of Honduras (UNAH) already had a program in place
 in Tegucigalpa, and at the start of 1988 the Private
 University of San Pedro Sula inaugurated its own program in
 the country, second-largest city. The Catholic Church in
 1988 announced a program to provide to the poor the 'services
 of three attorneys in each diocese.
 In July the Government announced that 15 percent of those held
 in the nation's penal centers had been sentenced (only a
 slight improvement over the 12 percent figure cited in July
 1987), 10 percent are in process, and 75 percent are awaiting
 trial. Part of the problem lies with the courts, which
 continue to face a backlog because of personnel shortages.
 The lack of a judicial investigative system to assist in and
 expedite decisions has also contributed to the backlog,
 according to judges.
 
 
 616
 HONDURAS
 Detentions pending trial are often long-term; in one
 publicized case, a man accused of petty theft was still in
 prison in mid-1988, 8 years after being turned over for
 processing. The Ministry of Government has announced that it
 will contract a number of attorneys at the start of 1989 to
 assist judges in moving long-delayed cases through the system.
 Despite the constitutional provision for a judiciary equal to,
 and independent of, the other branches of government and the
 Supreme Court's efforts to appoint lower court judges
 impartially, politics plays a large role in the functioning of
 the judiciary. Political influence, as well as corruption, is
 generally acknowledged to be prevalent in the lower courts,
 where judges have no tenure. Various charges of improper
 influence on decisions surfaced during 1988. In one
 controversial matter, a judge in the Tela (north coast)
 criminal court was removed by the Supreme Court on grounds
 that he was violating jurisdiction by trying virtually all of
 the country's drug-trafficking cases in his court, with the
 support of the Armed Forces. The judge defended his position
 by noting that no other court was handing down convictions
 against the accused.
 Efforts are under way to address the weaknesses of the
 judiciary. In 1988 a career judicial system was initiated
 under which 10 percent of new justices of the peace will be
 selected on a competitive merit basis. Unlike their
 colleagues, those selected in this program are to enjoy
 unlimited tenure, being subject to removal only with due
 cause. A judicial board will be established to review
 dismissals for merit and assess charges of judicial
 misconduct. A "judicial college" is being established to
 train judges. The judiciary is considering the limited
 adoption, in criminal cases, of the jury-trial system, as well
 as the establishment of a judicial police as an investigative
 arm of the courts, gathering evidence for cases before the
 court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the constitutionally protected rights
 to personal and family privacy and the inviolability of the
 home and private communications. Telephonic and written
 correspondence is generally free from monitoring although, as
 provided for by law, official review of such communications
 may be authorized by judicial order for specific purposes,
 such as criminal investigations or national security.
 Similarly, private homes may be searched only on the basis of
 a judicial order, with the exception of "urgent cases" in
 order to "impede the commission of crimes or avoid grave harm
 to persons or property." There were no known violations of
 these rights during 1988.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press,
 rights that are vigorously exercised in Honduras. Political
 opinions ranging from far left to far right are freely
 expressed in print media reporting, editorials, and letters
 from the public, and in television and radio broadcasting.
 All of the electronic communications media (there are over 100
 radio and 4 television stations) are privately owned, as are
 
 
 617
 HONDURAS
 the print media. Criticism, frequently harsh, of the
 Government and the Armed Forces is routine. Despite
 occasional sharp exchanges between the media and government
 officials, there were no known efforts by the authorities to
 take reprisals against the media for the expression of opinion.
 Following the April 7 rioting, the Government announced a
 15-day state of emergency and suspended radio and television
 broadcasting for approximately 36 hours. The Government cited
 as justification an assertion that the media had incited the
 listening audience to public disorder, a charge heatedly
 denied by owners of the broadcast systems. The suspension was
 harshly criticized as unnecessary, unjust, and an abuse of
 power.
 The Government and the Armed Forces respect academic freedom.
 Academic and political organizations abound in the University
 and secondary schools. Many are well to the left of center
 politically or affiliated with radical left groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly for political, religious, or
 other purposes is clearly spelled out in the Constitution. No
 prior authorization or permit is necessary for such assembly,
 although large outdoor gatherings in public places may require
 a permit for "the sole purpose of guaranteeing public order."
 Peaceful assembly was prohibited during the 15-day state of
 emergency following the April 7 riot, and only in the two
 major cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula where the major
 disorders had occurred. Following the lifting of the
 prohibitions, antigovernment and other demonstrations were
 carried out on a relatively routine basis without impediment.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Predominantly Roman Catholic, Honduras has no state religion.
 All forms of religious expression are constitutionally
 protected, and foreign missionaries operate in many parts of
 the country. The Constitution contains an express provision
 that no minister of any religion may hold public office or
 engage in political propaganda based on religious motives or
 beliefs.
 There is no attempt to control or impede the free expression
 and proselytization of religious beliefs in Honduras, but the
 clergy is not immune from deportation, detention, or
 prosecution for secular offenses. In 1988 two U.S. citizen
 priests were deported because of suspected involvement with
 subversive or guerrilla organizations, while a third, deported
 in 1980, was allowed to return to Honduras.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Hondurans are normally unimpeded in entry to or exit from
 Honduras and also travel freely within the national borders.
 In locations near the border with El Salvador, security
 concerns related to the movements of Salvadoran guerrillas
 have led to the imposition of a 9 p.m. curfew. There are no
 permanent travel restrictions for Hondurans or resident
 
 
 618
 HONDURAS
 foreigners, although national security concerns have led to
 increased police checks for personal identification.
 Exit visas are required to leave Honduras and constitute a
 form of control over international travel. They are nearly
 always granted without dispute unless the applicant is wanted
 in connection with a crime.
 Hondurans returning from Communist or Arab nations may be
 questioned at length about their travels, and any Honduran
 found to be involved with terrorist groups abroad is subject
 to prosecution. Citizens of all Communist and most Arab
 nations need special permission to enter Honduras.
 Honduras has been generous in offering asylum to refugees.
 During 1988 there were relatively few additions to the
 officially documented refugee population newly arrived from
 neighboring countries. Additions to the refugee camps under
 the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) continued to come from persons who had .
 entered Honduras in previous years. Approximately 3,000
 Miskito Indians moved from their homes along the Nicaraguan
 border into UNHCR settlements; approximately 2,300 Ladino
 Nicaraguans moved from southern Honduras into the UNHCR camp
 at Las Vegas.
 By the end of the year, an undetermined but significant number
 of refugees from Nicaragua had entered Honduras, including
 relatives of Nicaraguan resistance combatants. Other
 Nicaraguan civilians living in the areas of resistance
 operations also fled as Sandinista security-forces intensified
 punitive measures against those considered sympathetic, to. the
 antiregime forces.
 There are now 13,300 Salvadorans, 430 Guatemalans, 13,500
 Nicaraguan Ladinos, and 9,600 Nicaraguan Indians in refugee
 camps managed by the UNHCR. Local press reports place the
 total number of unregistered Nicaraguans as high as 200,000,
 but refugee experts estimated-the number at 70,000 prior to
 the most recent influx.
 There was continued voluntary repatriation in 1988. Nearly
 8,000 Nicaraguan Indians repatriated, as did 250 Nicaraguan
 Ladinos. In addition to the mass repatriations to El Salvador
 of 1,200 Salvadoran refugees on August 14 and 750 more on
 November 5, 450 other Salvadorans took advantage of individual
 voluntary repatriation from the three Salvadoran refugee camps.
 Serious protection problems continued in the Salvadoran
 refugee camps. Credible sources report that refugee
 coordinators (themselves Salvadoran) linked to the Salvadoran
 antigovernment insurgents continue to engage in forced
 recruitment and kidnaping of youths for the Faribundo Marti
 National Liberation Front (FMLN). They are reported to use
 their control over the distribution of food and clothing to
 discourage voluntary repatriation. In May two repatriating
 refugees were forcibly held for several weeks by the
 coordinators in San Antonio, during which time they were
 reportedly beaten, drugged, and forced to recant their desire
 to repatriate. One man escaped and the other was subsequently
 released; both men eventually repatriated to El Salvador. In
 July a mob organized by refugee leaders attempted to lynch a
 refugee accused of being "antisocial." One refugee
 coordinator was knifed and bled to death. The crowd then
 attacked the family of the intended victim. The timely
 
 
 619
 HONDURAS
 intervention.of UNHCR officials and doctors from Medicin Sans
 Frontieres (MSF) prevented further fatalities, although three
 of the family members were hospitalized for several weeks.
 The President of MSF announced November 15 that the group,
 which had maintained a 20-man mission in the camps for 8
 years, had decided to withdraw by the end of 1988 owing to the
 repressive influence of the coordinators. An Agence France
 Presse report on December 1 compared the camps to
 "concentration camps" for the same reason.
 There have been two instances in which Salvadoran refugees
 were killed by the Honduran military patroling the perimeter
 of the camps. In both cases the men were reportedly outside
 the camps at the time they were shot and in both cases the
 Honduran military charged they were engaged in subversive
 activity. A third Salvadoran was shot while working in the
 corn fields of Mesa Grande by a Honduran soldier outside the
 camp.
 There has been one report of rape and several reports of
 harassment by Honduran military personnel who patrol the
 environs of the Nicaraguan Ladino camp at Jacaleapa. Honduran
 immigration authorities have summarily deported or expelled
 four refugees from the Jacaleapa camp. Unconfirmed, but
 credible reports indicate that expulsion and deportation of
 Nicaraguans is a common practice in the department of
 Choluteca, where a large number of undocumented Nicaraguans
 reside. Some deported Nicaraguans were alleged to have been
 long-term residents.
 There was a report that 22 Nicaraguan Miskitos living in the
 border village of Sauvin were detained by the Honduran Army in
 April. According to the report, the detainees were held
 incommunicado, interrogated, and physically abused. After 7
 days, 17 of those detained were released. The whereabouts of
 the other 5 remained unknown at year's end.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a republican
 system of government composed of three equal and separate
 branches, the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary.
 National and municipal governments are chosen by free, secret,
 direct, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. A president
 may serve only one term; any vice president (there are three)
 who serves, even on an interim basis, as acting president is
 prohibited from running for the office of president. All
 Honduran-born citizens have the right to hold office (if they
 meet minimum age requirements), except for members of the
 clergy and the Armed Forces.
 Women enjoy full rights to participate in politics and
 government, but few hold senior legislative or executive
 positions.
 Electoral reforms in 1986 provided for mandatory elections of
 internal party officers and primary elections for the selection
 of candidates for public office. By the end of 1988, three of
 the four parties had complied with the internal elections
 requirement. The two major parties also participated in the
 country's first national primary election on December 4 in
 which candidates for the presidency, the vice presidency, the
 Congress, and municipal government office were selected.
 
 
 620
 HONDURAS
 The National and Liberal parties between them received 94
 percent of the vote in the last election. The two other
 parties, both left of center in orientation, are the National
 Innovation and Unity-Social Democratic Party and the Christian
 Democratic Party. In order for a new party to obtain legal
 status, its organizers must present a petition of 10,000
 signatures of members. If a party fails to gain that same
 minimum number of votes in any election in which it
 participates, it loses legal status.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with local and international human
 rights organizations, and the President frequently meets with
 delegations of human rights activists from abroad. The
 governmental Inter-Institutional Commission on Human Rights
 handles both domestic and international inquiries concerning
 human-rights. It also receives visitors interested in the
 human rights situation in Honduras. The Commission has
 expressed an interest in expanding its operations to include
 at least one regional office and several investigators.
 The Government agreed to participate as defendant at the IACHR
 in San Jose, Costa Rica, in that organization's first trial of
 a state for alleged disappearances. The disappearances
 involved in the case took place in 1981-84. Despite
 widespread popular resentment of the process, considered to be
 an unfair singling out of Honduras, the Government presented
 its defense and accepted the verdict handed down in July 1988
 in one of three cases before the Court. The Government is
 currently considering the most appropriate form of
 indemnification to the family, as ordered by the Court.
 The communications media affords ample opportunity to critics
 of Honduras* human rights record to express their opinions and
 air charges. The most well-known of the nongovernmental
 organizations is the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 in Honduras (CODEH) and its Central American-wide affiliate,
 CODEHUCA. Despite a number of genuine efforts on behalf of
 human rights, CODEH's charges frequently have been exaggerated
 and ill-documented, and in some cases false. Many observers
 in Honduras consider the group to be highly politicized and
 affiliated with leftist groups and causes. CODEH's reputation
 for impartiality and veracity was further questioned in 1988
 when it charged that Honduran security forces in 1987 had
 carried out 107 "extrajudicial executions." A U.S. Embassy
 review of the accusations, based on the sources of information
 cited by CODEH, concluded that among the cases labeled as
 extrajudicial executions were traffic accidents, murders by
 foreigners and civilians, and various killings committed by
 individual members of the Armed Forces for personal motives or
 in self-defense. Of the 100 cases reviewed, 11 did appear to
 be extrajudicial killings. CODEH has charged that Honduran
 security forces carried out 133 extrajudicial
 executions--apart from questionable deaths of repeat violent
 criminal offenders--in the first 9 months of 1988, but it has
 failed to provide substantiating information.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution expressly prohibits discrimination on the
 basis of sex, race, class, or any other basis. Education is
 
 
 621
 HONDURAS
 equally available to both males and females, but in practice
 because of strongly-held cultural values and attitudes, women
 are limited in some careers, and average earnings for females
 are significantly lower than for males. There is, however, no
 overt official discrimination. Ethnic minorities, while
 enjoying full equality under the law, continue to be the
 object of some social discrimination.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize themselves into labor unions, and
 many large enterprises have a unionized labor force. In
 addition, associations of employers and other interest groups
 are common. Retribution for trade union activity is uncommon.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic .
 labor rights, is provided for by the Constitution and honored
 in practice. Some strikes have been declared illegal because
 of failure to observe an obligatory three-part mediation
 procedure before striking or because of impact on the
 provision of vital services. In the case of workers involved
 in the latter category, Ministry of Labor-supervised
 negotiations provide some protection to workers' interests.
 Under Honduran practice (but not law), if a strike is legal,
 lost wages are often paid by management; if illegal, wages are
 not paid.
 The two democratic labor organizations have historically
 avoided partisan political affiliations and focused their
 influence more on economic than political issues. However,
 individual democratic labor leaders were included on the
 candidate lists for the 1989 elections, and were expected to
 campaign while retaining their union positions. Since
 politicians actively seek support from the rank and file of
 the democratic federations, the latter have demonstrated
 effective political influence, especially on labor-related
 issues. The Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH) is
 actively involved in partisan political activities and pursues
 an agenda closely paralleling that of other Marxist unions in
 the region.
 Honduras' trade union movement maintains close ties with
 international trade union organizations. The largest union
 group, with 160,000 members, is the Confederation of Honduran
 Workers (CTH); it is an affiliate of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The second
 largest, the General Workers Central (CGT), claims 135,000
 members; it is affiliated with the World Confederation of
 Labor. FUTH is affiliated with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions (WFTU). The three labor organizations claim to
 represent about 20 percent of all Honduran workers, including
 a substantial number of peasants and rural laborers.
 Honduras has cooperated with the International Labor
 Organization in several pending cases. It has also responded
 to inquiries made by the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain collectively is protected
 by law and observed in practice. The prevalence of unionized
 labor in the workplace and its political influence acts as a
 
 
 622
 HONDURAS
 further guarantee against antiunion discrimination or
 pressures.
 Chapter V of the Honduran Constitution spells out in detail
 the rights of workers, further delineated in legislation.
 Those rights and guarantees are jealously guarded by the
 powerful union movement which is not hesitant to make use of
 the legal system to enforce observance.
 The free trade zones are governed by the same labor
 regulations as the rest of private industry. Employment
 conditions in the export processing zones are considered
 superior to the national average.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Honduras; such
 practices are prohibited by law and by the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution and the labor code prohibit the employment of
 children under the age of 16. The Government has inspectors
 to ensure that childen are not employed by industry at night
 or under hazardous conditions. Violations of the labor code
 may occur in rural areas or in small companies. Rampant
 unemployment and underemployment has resulted in many children
 supplementing the family income by working in small family
 farm plots or as street vendors. The Government does not
 enforce child labor laws in these situations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution and the labor code require that all labor be
 fairly paid; minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and
 occupational safety are all regulated by law. The daily
 minimum wage varies by occupation, ranging from $2.30 to $3.55
 per day. This minimum wage does not provide a decent standard
 of living, and many households must pool family members'
 salaries to survive. A commission has been formed to assess
 the minimum wage, which has remained the same since 1980.
 The standard work day is 8 hours; a standard week is 44
 hours. Although the labor code provides for a paid vacation
 of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after 4 years, the
 regulations are frequently ignored in practice as a result of
 the high level of underemployment.
