 BULGARIA
 Human rights in Bulgaria are decisively and
 profoundly influenced by the country's communist
 political system, with its claims of far-reaching or
 even total control in the social, economic, and
 cultural, as well as political, fields. There is
 little or no known organized dissidence in Bulgaria,
 nor does there appear to be any pattern of overt,
 widespread government brutality or physical
 oppression.
 The lack of dissident movements permits the Bulgarian
 government to maintain control and helps make
 Bulgaria one of Eastern Europe's most stable states.
 In turn, this stability, along with the government's
 relative success in meeting the population's
 economic, social, and cultural needs, and its
 readiness, demonstrated convincingly in the past, to
 crush opposition by whatever means necessary,
 discourage the development of organized and vocal
 dissidence.
 In the past year, there have been no changes of
 significance in the Bulgarian human rights profile.
 The trend towards somewhat greater cultural freedom
 has continued, and the government has made special
 efforts to meet growing consumer demands in order to
 show a more liberal face to its population and to the
 West, during this year's celebrations of the 1300th
 anniversary of the Bulgarian state.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom froma
 a. Torture
 Article 15 of the Bulgarian penal procedures codes
 states, "No coercive measures may be taken against
 citizens participating in penal procedures, other
 than in cases and according to procedures stipulated
 in this code.* One report was recorded in the past
 year concerning torture and mistreatment in a
 Bulgarian prison but the allegations could not be
 confirmed. A number of ex-prisoners have indicated
 that while conditions are often primitive, there is
 no pattern of deliberate mistreatment or torture (see
 b. below). Amnesty International has expressed
 concern about reports it has received regarding the
 treatment of prisoners in Sofia. According to these
 reports, prisoners have been subjected to long and
 repeated interrogations, deprived of sleep, and
 severely beaten with fists and rubber truncheons.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been reports of severe prison conditions
 in Bulgaria, particularly for those persons sentenced
 to hard labor. Prisons are said to be crowded and
 are drafty and shabby. Amnesty International
 continues to report allegations that prisoners were
 confined in a psychiatric clinic and forcibly given
 drugs. Visits by family and friends are allowed on a
 monthly basis for all but political prisoners, e.g.,
 those sentenced for espionage or anti-government
 activity. Legal counsel is permitted, although such
 counsel is chosen and most probably influenced by the
 government. It is not known whether international
 organizations interested in prisoner welfare have
 received access to detainees, although several are
 reported to have made inquiries regarding such
 access. There are no indications of summary
 executions or of differential treatment by social
 class, race or sex.
 c. Disappearances
 In the past, there have been occasional reports that
 persons have been held clandestinely for limited
 periods. There are no current reports of disappeared
 persons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Amnesty International has investigated the cases of
 23 Bulgarians regarded by Amnesty as possible
 political prisoners. Its 1981 report quotes former
 prisoners as estimating the number of political
 prisoners at about 250 in the Stara Zagora prison, of
 which 15 percent were serving sentences for attempted
 illegal emigration. No independent information has
 been received to confirm or deny these figures.
 Additionally, six protestant activists were arrested
 in March 1979 on charges of illegal currency
 transactions, although accusations published abroad
 charge religious persecution. At least one of these
 activists has been released, and the foreign ministry
 has indicated that the others should soon be
 released. Independent estimates of the number of
 political prisoners are not available. The Bulgarian
 government does not recognize the existence of
 political prisoners in the Bulgarian penal system.
 The principle of habeas corpus exists under the
 Bulgarian criminal code and is followed in practice
 in all but a few cases the government considers
 politically sensitive. The law provides for
 .preliminary detention* in cases where evidence
 indicates some justification for a later indictment,
 although the law states that there will be a ten-day
 limit on such detentions. In all cases, the accused
 must be informed of the charges pending against him.
 In practice, while the letter of the law is usually
 but not always followed, the "spirit behind these
 legal safeguards is often ignored, calling into
 question their effectiveness in protecting the
 
 
 730
 individual. For example, while defendants in
 criminal cases have impressive theoretical legal
 protection, many appear at their trials in rough
 prison garb and with shaven head.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public
 trial in criminal cases. Detendants are entitled to
 counsel, but only after a preliminary investigation
 -- which can last many weeks -- has been completed
 and an indictment has been prepared. In the
 meantime, the accused may be detained without access
 to counsel. There are special court procedures for
 cases involving state security. A trial may be held
 in camera to preserve a State secret or to protect
 .socialist morality"; a recent trial involving
 Turkish airline hijackers was apparently held in
 camera for no apparent legally justifiable reason.
 Amnesty International has reported that in political
 cases witnesses have been intimidated by the police
 into testifying against the accused and that the
 defendant's family and friends have been barred from
 the courtroom during the trial. Generally, the
 Bulgarian penal system follows the letter of the
 law. However, while the laws themselves are
 publicized, there also exist administrative laws,
 regulations and implementing procedures, roughly
 analogous to the U.S. code of federal regulations,
 legislative history and court precedents. These
 implementing procedures play a central role in the
 judicial system but are not available to the general
 public.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 By law, the sanctity of the home is Safeguarded.
 Police authorities may search property legally only
 with prior permission from a responsible court or
 prosecutor. Such searches may, however, be legally
 undertaken in urgent cases prior to approval by
 judicial authorities. How effective these legal
 safeguards may be is an open question. There are
 reports of illegal entries, and diplomatic missions
 and residences are commonly assumed to be subject to
 "bugging" or unauthorized entry. There is no hard
 evidence of specific instances in which homes have
 been illegally demolished or sealed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including3
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Bulgarian constitution of 1971 guarantees certain
 basic rights, including rights of citizenship, work,
 rest, access to health care and free education,
 speech, press, association and demonstration, freedom
 
 
 731
 of worship, and the right of privacy of
 correspondence and communication except in cases of
 national emergency. Women are guaranteed equal
 rights with men, and all citizens are declared to be
 equal before the law, regardless of national origin,
 creed, social status, education or sex. In practice,
 these freedoms are circumscribed to varying degrees,
 and they are not permitted to be exercised in any way
 that might weaken communist party control.
 Consequently, genuine political freedom does not
 exist. The state controls the press, decides which
 political organizations may exist, and determines
 which political demonstrations may take place. Laws
 severely punish anyone accused of "founding an
 illegal anti-state organization" and criticizing the
 state One article proscribes the dissemination of
 "untruthful remarks which might increase mistrust of
 state power or cause confusion in society". Domestic
 opposition to the state or party is not tolerated; if
 found, it is dealt with promptly and severely with
 prison sentences. The public is permitted to send
 criticism, suggestions, and complaints by letter to
 newspapers and to national assembly representatives
 on a broad range of topics, such as inadequate
 service from public agencies and housing shortages.
 Nonetheless, none of the letters we have seen
 published go beyond criticism of specific economic or
 services shortfalls or failures of individuals in
 government administrationi none which have been
 publicized deal with fundamental questions of how
 society, the economy or the nation's political life
 are structured. Thus, the state allows open, albeit
 limited, criticism to take place and evidently seeks
 to investigate complaints and respond to them. It
 also appears to manipulate this criticism, for
 example publicizing more of it before major events,
 such as the party congress, to justify shifts in
 government personnel and to present a liberal,
 responsive image.
 Bulgaria jams the Bulgarian-language radio broadcasts
 of Radio Free Europe and the Bulgarian Service of
 West Germany's Deutsche Wells. It does not jam the
 Voice of America or the BBC Bulgarian services. It
 does not permit the open sale of Western periodicals,
 except for occasional, very small numbers of
 newspapers sold in hotels frequented primarily by
 foreigners. Mail from Western countries is
 periodically screened, and items found offensive to
 the state, or pornographic, are confiscated.
 Although censorship does not exist officially, the
 media must operate within well-understood party and
 state guidelines and practices (e.g. international
 news is usually limited to that provided by the
 government news agency or official Soviet sources).
 Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press include
 unauthorized criticism of party and state leaders, of
 socialist ideology and of the USSR and other
 socialist countries., All media are
 government-controlled. Opposition views have not
 
 
 732
 been aired since 1947, when the last independent
 newspapers were taken over by the State. Literature
 and art are censored.
 Religion may be practiced within limits by believers
 in denominations recognized by the government,
 especially the Bulgarian Orthodox church. However,
 being a church member or being active in religious
 affairs has a decidedly negative effect on admission
 to higher government and party positions. Amnesty
 International and Freedom House have reported that
 Moslem believers in Bulgaria, both members of the
 Turkish minority and ethnic Bulgarians (Pomaks), have
 been persecuted and imprisoned because of religious
 activities or their ethnic background. In the 1970's
 the government sponsored a campaign aimed at
 pressuring Pomaks to drop their traditional Moslem
 first names and take Bulgarian names. There have
 also been reports that members of pentecostal sects
 have been punished by the government for religious
 activities. In addition, the government is quite
 sensitive to unauthorized evangelical missionary
 activities here, particularly those undertaken, or
 supported, by foreign religious organizations.
 Although theoretically there is separation of church
 and state, the government and the party exert very
 strong influences over the Orthodox church. The
 state uses the predominant Orthodox church to support
 its policies in areas where the objectives of the
 church coincide with those of the state, e.g.,
 propaganda for peace and (Western) disarmament. In
 general the government supports the
 "historical/cultural" role of the Orthodox Church,
 while discouraging indirectly the practice and.
 propagation of the faith.
 The government closely monitors and circumscribes
 organized religion in Bulgaria through numerous
 control mechanisms, e.g. on the importation of
 bibles, and on the distribution of religious
 publications other than those of the Bulgarian
 Orthodox church. The inadequate supply of bibles and
 the prohibition on their importation have been
 sources of conflict between the government and
 believers who have attempted to bring or send bibles
 to Bulgaria. According to church officials, anew
 Bulgarian Orthodox bible, long planned and supposedly
 "suitable" for other denominations, including
 Judaism, will soon be published. The state allows
 the Bulgarian Orthodox church certain privileges in
 addition to that of publishing the authorized bible.
 These include the operation of a seminary and the
 sale of authorized publications and religious
 artifacts. The government has also taken some
 measures to preserve and protect the practice of
 Judaism. Jewish cultural, social, and religious
 institutions receive financial support from the
 state.  There are no rabbis, and religious schools
 (apart from the Orthodox seminaries) are not
 
 
 733
 permitted. The government allows all recognized
 religions to hold church services and to take up
 collections at these services. Roman Catholic,
 Uniate, Congregational, Methodist, Baptist,
 Pentecostal Seventh Day Adventist, Armenian. and
 Islamic religious organizations are also active in
 Bulgaria.
 In practice, assembly is a right granted only to
 legally constituted organizations, and only for
 approved purposes. Public assemblies are
 esssentially never spontaneous affairs, but rather
 party- or government-organized to achieve a
 particular purpose. A recent, seemingly spontaneous
 demonstration of grief on the death of the now
 disgraced former party strongman Chervenkov
 apparently came as a shock to the Government, which
 reacted brusquely to a peaceful and, at least
 initially, authorized gathering. There are no
 independent trade unions in Bulgaria, and workers are
 not free to negotiate or strike for better pay or
 work conditions.
 b. Freedom of Movement wiithin the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, in Bulgaria and abroad, is
 neither guaranteed under law nor respected in
 practice. Within the country, Bulgarians may
 normally visit.freely all areas except certain
 designated border zones. Bulgarians must carry
 internal passports, however, and inform police of
 their destination. In the past year, new laws and
 administrative procedures have been put into practice
 to streamline and perfect the internal passport
 domestic registration systems. The government
 strictly controls the right to change residence
 within the country.
 Travel by Bulgarian citizens to other East European
 countries is somewhat limited, and travel to the West
 is severely restricted, in good part due to economic
 reasons (i.e. currency control). A citizen's
 application for an exit document may be refused for
 several reasons, but most often because travel is
 deemed "not in the interests of the state".
 Applications to visit the West are processed
 arbitrarily, especially when the applicant wishes to
 visit a relative who left Bulgaria without the
 permission of the government. Citizens do not have
 the theoretical rights, granted in at least some
 Eastern European countries, to travel to the West
 once in a given number of years, or to exchange a
 certain amount of domestic currency for Western
 currency to sustain such travel.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but rarely
 permitted. A few intending emigrants are subjected
 to overt government persecution. Most are not,
 however, unless they have engaged in "anti-State"
 
 
 734
 actions. Improvements in everyday life, on the other
 hand, such as promotions, new jobs, and educational
 op ortunities, usually are not given to intending
 emigrants, even if the state approves their
 departure, and in at least one case an applicant for
 emigration lost her job. Those effigrating soon after
 completion of higher education are often required to
 pay the Government for part of the cost of
 education. Many times, Bulgarian citizens desiring
 to visit the United States or to travel there to join
 relatives, have not received Bulgarian government
 approval of their applications. While approvals of
 such requests by the Bulgarian government have
 noticeably increased in recent years, Bulgaria still
 lags behind many Eastern European states in this
 regard.
 The Bulgarian constitution grants the right of asylum
 to foreigners persecuted for actions, such as
 "defending the interests of the working class", which
 have a strong marxist flavor. The Bulgarian policy
 on voluntary repatriation is not known. Bulgaria
 has, however, cooperated in the past 35 years in the
 migration from Bulgaria of various national
 minorities, particularly Turks and Jews.
 Approximately 150 refugees from Bulgaria annually
 request admission to the United States, and the total
 number of Bulgarians fleeing to Western Europe
 annually is considerably higher than this number.
 Bulgaria insists on forced repatriation of citizens
 caught in other communist countries attempting to
 flee to the West. Earlier this year, the Bulgarian
 national assembly passed a new law granting an
 amnesty to all those who had.fled the country and who
 return before the end of 1983, but there is no
 indication that any have yet accepted offer.
 Bulgarian policy on emigration, travel and refugee
 questions does not involve discrimination on the
 basis of sex.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Bulgarian government and society are organized along
 standard communist lines. Political pluralism and
 free participation in the political process are
 essentially non-existent. The relative economic
 success of the communist government within the
 framework of a stable, peaceful society, and the lack
 of crude, overt, large-scale government repression
 have helped the regime limit dissent and maintain its
 paramount position. Certain by-products of this
 absolutist political control probably concern
 ordinary Bulgarians more than the lack of democracy.
 Citizens are denied recourse to a free or even
 partially free press, an independent judicial system,
 or any form of litigation not specifically permitted
 by the state. They are confronted with arbitrary,
 unjust, or illegal actions by the State and have no
 sure means of redress. To be sure, competent and
 
 
 dedicated officials, informal networks, and
 government campaigns against corruption and
 inefficiency all exist to help the oppressed citizen.
 particularly when his or her complaints are of a
 minor administrative or economic nature. However.
 these mechanisms are uncertain at best, and almost
 useless when the citizen's difficulties are of a more
 serious, political nature, involving questions of
 judicial, political or police authority.
 The Bulgarian constitution and various implementing
 laws embody the Government's drive for absolute
 political control, while maintaining at least the
 appearance of pluralism. Bulgaria describes its
 political system as a two-party system composed of
 the Bulgarian Communist Party and the co-opted rump
 of the Bulgarian Agrarian Union. These two parties,
 together with labor, youth, and other organizations,
 comprise the Fatherland Front, an umbrella
 organization of communist and non-communist
 "progressive" elements established in 1942. In
 practice, however, the Fatherland Front and its
 various organizations are all ultimately controlled
 by the Communist Party, to which the constitution
 gives clear primacy. The Agrarian Party runs
 separate candidates and has about one-fourth of the
 seats in the National Assembly, but candidacies are
 worked out jointly with the Communist Party in
 advance. Candidates of the two parties do not run
 against one another; nor do they face any other
 opposition. Real opposition parties have remained
 effectively outlawed since the 1940's.
 To varying but always limited degrees, organizations
 such as labor unions, professional associations,
 elements of the Fatherland Front, and the Communist
 Party itself serve as mechanisms for the transmission
 of citizens' views upwards and as fora for dialogue.
 However, with total power over these organizations,
 and control of the news media, the party and
 government have no difficulty controlling the
 dialogue and using these exchanges to maintain the
 system and improve its everyday administration.
 Women officially have equal rights with man and their
 status has steadily improved in recent years. A
 national women's committee produces a monthly
 publication and otherwise takes an active role in
 promoting women's interests. Women continue to be
 over-represented in manual occupations in areas such
 as farming and light industry, as well as in some
 more prestigious professions, such as medicine.
 Women are under represented in the highest
 decision-making bodies of the government and party
 (only one of the 11 full politburo members since the
 death of Mrs. Zhivkova and none of the three
 candidate members are women). Traditional
 stereotypes of women's roles in society and the
 workplace remain strong in Bulgaria. This fact, and
 the relative lack of homemaker time-saving appliances
 
 
 736
 and streamlined shopping in Bulgaria, call into
 question the real advantages to women of their
 massive entry into the workforce after World War II.
 Many women, rather than exchanging roles, have simply
 added one.
 An active trade union movement exists, but totally
 within the party/state framework. Unions do not have
 the right to strike, to bargain collectively, to
 lobby or to assemble freely. Their functions are to
 look after the social welfare of their members and to
 work to increase the quantity and quality of
 production. Recently, "workers assemblies" have been
 used in the government's propaganda campaign against
 the Polish Solidarity union.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Bulgaria has not appointed any independent group to
 investigate questions of human rights violations. It
 maintains that the question of human rights is
 strictly an internal matter for each government to
 resolve, and has supported the Soviet position
 concerning human rights at the Madrid CSCE follow-up
 conference. It has apparently ignored such
 communications as Amnesty International's letter of
 April 1981 to the head of state appealing for an
 amnesty for all prisoners of conscience to mark the
 1300th anniversary of the founding of the Bulgarian
 state. There are no independent organizations in
 Bulgaria which observe, report, or act on human
 rights violations.
 IV. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Bulgaria endeavors to provide for the material needs
 of its citizens within the framework of a socialist
 economy, with the emphasis on state planning and
 control of all significant means of production.
 While new and somewhat more liberal approaches to the
 management of the economy are still being
 experimented with, such tendencies have not gone as
 far as in Yugoslavia, Hungary or Poland. The
 Bulgarian government claims an (unconfirmed) growth
 rate of 5.7 percent for national income in 1980. All
 citizens are guaranteed a job and officially there is
 no unemployment, although in practice underemployment
 is widespread. The per capita GNP in 1980 was
 $2,625, and the average monthly salary of about 150
 leva ($160 at the official exchange rate) allows
 Bulgarians an adequate, if frugal, existence,
 particularly in light of low rents, very inexpensive
 public transportation, and low-priced basic food
 products.
 Bulgaria has poor people, but there are no great
 disparities between poverty and wealth, although
 
 
 737
 success in the government or party results in
 numerous privileges, if not great personal wealth.
 Most individual taxes are included in the price of
 goods. Most necessities (basic food items,
 transportation, and housing) are state subsidized,
 and there are limits on private property ownership.
 Bulgaria's leaders are concerned about the country's
 low population growth rate of 0.6 percent (1970-79).
 with a total fertility rate of 2.2 in 1979, and have
 established financial incentives for families to have
 children. Life expectancy at birth is 73 years, and
 the infant mortality rate per 1000 live births is 22
 (1978). Medical care is free, and 1978 government
 statistics show one doctor for every 432 citizens,
 and 88 hospital beds per 10,000 citizens. The
 percent of calorie supply available for consumption
 as a percentage of total domestic nutritional
 requirements is 144 percent (1977).
 Extensive construction of new public apartment
 buildings in the past decade has improved the overall
 housing situation. Shortages continued. however, and
 Bulgarians still wait years for a new apartment.
 Education is free through the university levels a
 general system of merit selections provides certain
 priorities and privileges to the children of the
 influential. Literacy is high, and the adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio (1978) is malet 96,
 females 95, totals 96.
 Bulgarian educational and professional opportunities
 are not discriminatory against women. One half of
 the openings for university students available each
 year are reserved by law for women.
