 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Burkina Faso Government,
 assisted by members of his party, the Organization for Popular Democracy/Labor
 Movement (ODP/MT), and to guide the process of establishing new institutions in
 accordance with the 1991 Constitution. After the highly controversial presidential
 (1991) and legislative (1992) elections, the President and the ODP/MT benefited by
 a period of relative political calm, highlighted by much of the political oppositions
 accepting, albeit reluctantly, the legitimacy of the new Government, known as the
 Fourth Republic. The ODP/MT Government includes representatives from the coun-
 trys three major opposition parties, and it controls the National Assembly (78 out
 of 107 seats) in which other opposition parties are represented. The National Assem-
 bly approved the Governments propsals for defining the constitutionally mandated
 Second Chamber of the National A ssembly (which will play a purely consultative
 role), and setting in motion a decentralization program involving the election of local
 governing councils by the end of 1995.
 Burkina Faso's security apparatus consists of the armed forces and the para-
 military gendarmerie (controlled by the Ministry of Defense) and the police (con-
 trolled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration). There were recurrent in-
 stances in which police and security forces used excessive force.
 Over 85 percent of the 9.5-million population is engaged in subsistence agriculture
 which is highly vulnerable to rainfall variations. Frequent drought, a limited com-
 munications and transportation infrastructure, and a low literacy rate are long-
 standing problems. Per capita income is only about $300 per year. In 1993 the Gov-
 ernment obtained approval from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an en-
 hanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF) to reinforce reforms implemented over
 the past 3 years. The ESAF program seeks to limit government spending, especially
 on salaries and transfers, open the economy to free market forces, promote the pri-
 vate sector, and encourage foreign investment.

 Despite the constitutional changes since 1991, human rights violations continued
 to occur. The Government did not hesitate to employ its powers to control the politi-
 cal evolution, notably in 1993 by using the 1990 Information Code and the court sys-
 tem to intimidate the increasingly vocal independent press. There were also new in-
 stances of the security forces' committing extrajudicial killings, abusing detainees,
 and resorting to excessive force in controlling demonstrations (generally committed
 with impunity). At the same time, the Government held no political detainees or
 prisoners at the end of 1993 and abolished during the year the unfair Popular Revo-
 lutionary Tribunals system. On December 30, the National Assembly also amended
 the Information Code in favor of greater press freedom. Despite governmental ef-
 forts to counter the practice, violence against women continued to be a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There continued to be reports of
 extrajudicial killings by security forces of suspected criminals. During disturbances
 at the University of Ouagadougou in February, police arrested a passer-by, who sub-
 sequently died in police custody. Credible reports indicated that he had been tor-
 tured by the security services. The Government made no apparent effort to inves-
 tigate the incident or the violence at the University or the violence that occurred
 at a local high school in the capital the next day, despite calls by the Burkinabe
 human rights movement to do so (see Section 2.b.).
 There were also reports that at least one detainee, who was seeking refugee sta-
 tus, died as a result of mistreatment while in the custtody of the gendarmerie.
 Despite pressures from international and local human rights groups, the Govern-
 ment again failed to complete the official investigation into the 1991 assassination
 of Clement Ouedraogo, a prominent opposition leader, or to account for the 1989 and
 1990 "disappearances" of Professor Guillaume Sessouma, detained for allegedly par-
 ticipating in a coup plot, and medical student Dabo Boukary, detained following stu-
 dent demonstrations in May 1990. Credible reports indicated that elements of the
 security forces tortured and killed both men.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported new disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees, often to extract con-
 fessions, have been documented for a number of years in Burkina Faso. No known
 disciplinary action has been taken against those responsible. In 1993, for example,
 police detained a Burkinabe youth, Doin Yedan, on a civil matter, near Bobo-
 Dioulasso. The next day he was found by the roadside in a coma and later died
 without regaining consciousness.
 Prison conditions are harsh and characterized by overcrowding. For instance, the
 institution in Bobo-Dioulasso, built in 1947, housed in 1993 about 1,000 prisoners,
 although it was designed to hold less than half that number. Given the poor prison
 diet and the prevalence of malaria and other diseases, prison conditions can be life
 threatening. Inmates must often rely on supplemental food from relatives.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Since the June 1991 adoption of the Con-
 stitution, which provides for the right to expeditious arraignment and access to legal
 counsel, there have been no known cases of prolonged arbitrary arrest or detention.
 The law permits detention for investigative purposes without charge for a maximum
 of 72 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour period. In practice, these provisions are
 rarely observed, particularly in sensitive cases. The Military Code takes precedence
 over the Civil Code in national security cases.
 Prior to adoption of the Constitution, the earlier Popular Front government held
 a large number of its opponents in custody, but there were no known political de-
 tainees or prisoners in Burkina Faso at the end of 1993.
 Although some intellectuals, military officers, and former government officials re-
 mained in self-imposed exile abroad, a number repatriated themselves since 1991.
 Amnng those returning in 1993 was Antoine Dakoure, a former minister and promi-
 nent leader of an overseas Burkinabe opposition group.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides the right to public trial,
 access to counsel, and appeal. While these rights are generally respected, the ability
 of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains conditionedby weaknesses in the judicial
 system, including a serious shortage of trained magistrates to process a growing
 caseload. The 1991 Constitution reestablished the Supreme Court at the apex of the
 formal judicial system.
 Under the Constitution, the judiciary is independent of the executive, but the
 President has extensive appointment and other powers over judicial officials, and
 the executive branch has strong influence on the judiciary.
 
 
 The military court system is even more susceptible to executive manipulation.
 Military courts exercise jurisdiction in security cases and are convened on an ad hoc
 basis. The have no set form, rarely have appeal procedures, and instead use flexi-
 ble procedue  rendering them susceptible to executive influence. However, such
 courts were apparently not active in 1993.
 The Government finally abolished in 1993 the parallel court system of Popular
 Revolutionary Tribunals (TPRS), which lacked many constitutional safeguards. The
 politicized tribunals had been created by the ruling National Revolutionary Council
 in 1983 to try former government officials on corruption and other charges. In mid-
 1993, Burkina's courts began hearing appeals of verdicts handed down by the tribu-
 nals and set aside most convictions on procedural grounds.
 In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or traditional courts, presided over
 by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood and village-level problems, such as di-
 vorce and inheritance disputes. These court decisions are generally respected by the
 population, but citizens may also take the case to a formal court.
 f.Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-overn-
 ment authorities generally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens,
 but monitoring of private correspondence or telephones does occur in suspected na-
 tional security cases. By law, homes may be searched only under the authority of
 a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice. In national security cases, however, a
 special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and cor-
 respondence without a warrant.
 Some obsrers expressed concern that local committees, proposed by President
 Compaore's ODPMT, would ultimately replicate the functions of the old Popular
 Front's revolutionary committees in intimidating villagers. While authorized by the
 party's April Congress, the ODP/MT committees did not form in 1993 due to ter-
 party differences regarding their viability.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 in the 1990 Information Code but are still limited in practice. The President and
 his Government are highly sensitive to criticism. The C ode established the right of
 private publication, but it also gave the Government strong legal powers to intimi-
 date the press through a broad interpretation of defamation: .. . any allegation,
 or imputation of a fact, which injures the reputation or the consideration of the per-
 son or body to which the fact is imputed."
 The Government used this power in 1993. Most notably it targeted a regional
 paper in Bobo-Dioulasso that alleged corruption in the Ministry of Justice and the
 prosecutor's office in Bobo-Dioulasso. The overnment immediately prosecuted the
 newspaper's publisher and editor on defamation charges in June, and the court sen-
 tenced both to 6 months' imprisonment. These sentences were suspended by an Au-
 gust 4 (Revolution Day) amnesty, and both journalists have since resumed their p-
 sitions at the newspaper. However, the verdicts, the first time journalists had been
 sentenced for Code offenses (under the previous government, treason was the usual
 charge) served as a warning and all newspapers practiced some degree of self-cen-
 sorship.
 The Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights and Peoples (MBDHP) led public
 criticism of the Information Code during the year, especially a section which pre-
 vented journalists from providingevidence in court. In response, the the ODP/MT-
 led National Assembly on December 30 finally passed amendments o the Code, al-
 lowing journalists to introduce evidence to defend themselves in a court of law when
 charged with slander by a government official and also stipulating that "offenses in
 words (threats) or action against journalists in the exercise of their profession are
 punishable under the law.c
 Notwithstanding the controversy over the Code, the independent press continued
 to expand rapidly in 1993. In addition to two dailies, Burkina boasted nearly a
 dozen weekly newspapers, and a weekly newsmagazine by year's end. Although offi-
 cial media outlets, including the daily newspaper Sidwnya and National Radio, dis-
 played a lingering progovernment bias, the presence of independent competition led
 the official media to give more coverage to the political opposition.
 Academic freedom is recogunized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The Government lifted a 2-year-old ban on po-
 litical marches, imposed following violent demonstrations in 1991. Since early 1990,
 political parties have been permitted to organize and hold meetings and rallies with-
 out seeking governmentpermission. While some parties organized press conferences
 and congresses, most of Burkina Faso's 60 political parties were inactive.
 
 
 The authorities used excessive force at Ouagadougou University in mid-February
 when police attempted to break up a student sit-in demonstration protesting cuts
 in student scholarships. In the ensuing melee, the police wounded several students.
 While the Government initially insisted that gendarmes and police had only fired
 in the air to break up the demonstration, it ultimately admitted that several stu-
 dents had in fact been fired upon. The Government promised a commission of in-
 quiry, but none was formed.
 There are nonpolitical associations for business, religious, cultural, and other pur-
 poses. They experience no difficulty in obtaining permission to meet or associate
 with international associations in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Burkina Faso is a secular State. Islam, Christianity, and
 traditional religions operate freely without government interference. Neither social
 mobility nor access to modern sector jobs are linked to, or restricted by, religious
 affiliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped for identity and
 customs checks at police and military checkpoints. There is no restriction on foreign
 travel for business or tourism. Exit permits are no longer required. Refugees are ac-
 cepted freely in Burkina Faso, and the Government attempts to provide for their
 care in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There
 are over 6,000 refugees and displaced persons, mostly Tuareg refugees from Mali,
 in Burkina Faso.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the greater political freedoms allowed by the Fourth Republic, the first
 multiparty elections in 1992 left in doubt whether Burkinab citizens have the right
 and ability to transfer power peacefull to a democratically elected op  sition, if
 they so desired. Power remained in the hands of President Compaore and his politi-
 cal party, the ODP/MT, most of whose members also played prominent roles in the
 ruling National Revolutionary Council (1983-87) and Popular Front (1987-91). The
 Government's framework was new, however, and included a strong Presidency, a
 Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the President, a two-cham-
 ber National Assembly, and an independent judiciary. The Compaore Government
 does not face new elections until 1997 (for the legislature) and 1998 (for the Presi-
 dency).
 The President has the support of the military. He continues to give priority to the
 the military budget, despite structural adjustment requirements to emphasize
 health and education requirements.
 The transition period from military regime to civilian government was marked by
 controversy in both the presidential elections in 1991 and the legislative elections
 in 1992. The op position chose to boycott the presidential balloting, following Presi-
 dent Compaore's refusal to convene a sovereign national conference, but later 27
 parties, including all of the country's major opposition parties, elected to participate
 in the legislative balloting after receiving assurances that the elections would be
 free and fair.
 In the legislative vote, President Compaore's ODP/MT held an advantage because
 of its financial resources, opposition disunity, and control of the Burkinabe adminis-
 tration. It took 78 of 107 seats in the National Assembly. Opposition parties pro-
 tested numerous election irregularities but ultimately decided to participate in the
 National Assembly and in the first government of the Fourth Republic, preferring
 to work for change within the system rather than outside it. Independent observers
 agreed that numerous violations occurred in the 1992 elections but that they did
 not seriously affect the outcome.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 norities in the political process. However, there are few women in positions of re-
 sponsibility; 3 of the 25 ministers and 6 of the 107 National Assembly deputies are
 women. Women are also represented in subcabinet level positions of responsibility.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's reaction to local human rights groups has been mixed. It con-
 tinued to tolerate the activities of the Burkinabe Movement for the Rights of Man
 and Peoples (MB1)HP), an independent group composed mostly of professionals and
 led by a ranking Burkinabe magistrate. The MBDRP advocated the release of oppo-
 sition supporters detained following election-related violence in 1991. The Govern-
 ment released those persons, but it ignored continuing MBDHP demands that it ac-
 count for the disappearances of Boukary Dabo and Guillaume Sessouma.
 
 
 23
 The Government is rarely responsive to investigations by international non-
 governmental organizations. At year's end, there were no known outstanding inves-
 tigations by outside organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic origin is illegal under the
 1991 Constitution. Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government as are the majority Mossi, and government deci-
 sions do not favor one group over another.
 Women.-In the absence of constitutional and other legal protections, women face
 extensive discrimination. In general, women continue to occupy a subordinate posi-
 tion and face discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, property, and family
 rights. In the modern sector, however, women make up one-fourth of the govern-
 ment work force, although usually in lower paying positions. Women still do much
 of the subsistence farming work in rural areas.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs frequently. Cases of wife
 beating are usually handled through customary law and practice. Such cases are
 sometimes mediated by a 'popular conciliation tribunal" composed of community
 representatives. The Government is attempting to educate people on the subject
 through the media.
 Children.-Children's rights are enshrined in the Constitution. The Government
 announced its commitment to improving the condition of children by adopting a na-
 tional policy to revitalize primary health care and improve access to primary edu-
 cation. In March it issued a report on the Convention of the Rights of the Child.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary, secondary, and higher educational systems. Schools in rural areas have
 disproportionately fewer female students than schools in urban areas.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM, circumcision) has been condemned by health ex-
 perts as damaging to physical and psychological health. While the Government has
 made a strong commitment to eradicating FGM through educational efforts, FGM
 is still widely practiced in Burkina Faso, especially in many rural areas, and is usu-
 ally performed at an early age. According to an independent expert in the field, the
 percentage of Burkinabe females who have undergone this procedure may be as
 high as 70 percent. Another form of mutilation, scarification of the faces of both
 boys and girls of certain ethnic groups, is gradually disappearing.
 People with Disabilities.-While there is a modest progam of government sub-
 sidies for workshops for the disabled and for bicycles and wheelchairs, there is no
 government mandate or legislation concerning accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers, including civil servants, traditionally have
 enjoyed a legal right to association which is recognized in the Fourth Republic's
 Constitution. There are a large number of trade unions and five trade union federa-
 tions. Although unions are independent of the Government, in the past the Govern-
 ment has limited their freedom of action to ensure compliance with government
 labor policy. Essential workers-police, fire, and health workers-are prohibited
 from joining unions.
 Once the most powerful political force in the country, organized labor-approxi-
 mately 60,000 nonagricultural workers-lost much of its influence under the earlier
 Sankara and Compaore military regimes. The labor movement participated in the
 drafting of the 1991 Constitution, and the return to constitutional government led
 to full restoration of labor union rights that had been severely curtailed during the
 Sankara eriod. An accurate percentage figure of the unionized work force of
 Burkina Faso is not known since few unions have fully paid up membership records.
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution, and workers have used
 strike actions to achieve labor goals. Labor unrest increased after the Government
 embarked on an economic structural adjustment program with the World Bank and
 IMF in 1991. The program resulted in a number of significant austerity measures,
 leading several unions to stage warning and other strikes in 1993, including ones
 by customs agents and secondary school and university teachers.
 Labor unions freely affiliate with international trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 
 
 labor or management also may refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals.
 Appeals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties.
 Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern wage sector, which encompasses
 only a small percentage of the population.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. Complaints about such dis-
 crimination are handled by Labor Ministry Inspectors and may be appealed to a
 labor tribunal in the Ministry. If the worker's complaint is upheld, he or she must
 be reinstated. Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code, which was ap-
 proved by the National Assembly in March, sets the minimum age for employment
 at 14, the average age for completion of basic secondary school. However, the Min-
 istry of Employment, Labor and Social Security, which oversees labor standards,
 lacks the means to enforce this provision adequately, even in the small wage sector.
 Most children actually begin work at an earlier age on small, family subsistence
 farms and in the traditional apprenticeship system and informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period, and
 establishes safety and health provisions. The current minimum wage in the formal
 sector is $85 (25,000 CFA); it does not apply to the large subsistence agriculture sec-
 tor, which employs more than 85 percent of the population. The minimum wage was
 last set by the Government in 1983 and is not adequate for an urban worker to sup-
 port a family. Wage earners usually supplement their income through reliance on
 the extended family and subsistence agriculture.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Labor and labor tribu-
 nals ensures that health and safety standards are applied in the small industrial
 and commercial sectors, but they are not applicable in the subsistence agricultural
 sector. If a workplace has been declared unsafe, for any given reason, by the govern-
 ment labor inspection office, workers have the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
