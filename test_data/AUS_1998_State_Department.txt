 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. The judiciary is independent
 Federal, state, and local police are under the firm control of the civilian authori-
 ties and carry out their functions in accordance with the law. There were occasional
 reports that police committed abuses.
 A highly developed economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture,
 and services, provides most citizens with a high per capita income. A wide range
 of government programs offers assistance for disadvantaged citizens.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 There were occasional reports that police beat or otherwise abused persons. The
 Government administers many programs to improve the socioeconomic conditions of
 Aborigines and Torres Straits Islanders, who together form about 2 percent of the
 population, and to address longstanding discrimination against them. Societal dis-
 crimination and violence against women are problems that are being addressed ac-
 tively.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials. However, more than 100 persons died in prisons,
 police custody, or during police attempts to detain them (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits all such practices. However, police on occasion mistreat suspects
 in custody. Indigenous groups charge that police harassment of indigenous people
 is pervasive and that racial discrimination among police and prison custodians per-
 sists. Amnesty International reported several incidents that involved such abuses.
 State and territorial police forces have internal affairs units that investigate allega-
 tions of abuse and report to a civilian ombudsman.
 In 1997 103 persons died in prisons, police custody, or during police attempts to
 apprehend suspects, the highest total recorded since 1980. Of that total, 75 died
 while in prison and 28 died while being apprehended. Thirty-two persons died from
 hanging; 29 from natural causes; 18 from injuries; 11 from gunshot wounds; 10 from
 substance abuse; and 3 from unknown causes. Of the 11 who died of gunshot
 wounds, 5 had self-inflicted wounds and 6 were shot by police. Six deaths were the
 result of unlawful homicides by fellow inmates.
 Aboriginal adults represent 1.6 percent of the adult population, but constitute ap-
 proximately 17 percent of the total prison population. Aborigines accounted for 14
 (13.6 percent) of custodial deaths in 1997. Six of the 14 died in police custody or
 while being taken into police custody: 3 of injuries, 1 from hanging, 1 from natural
 causes, and 1 from alcohol. Eight of the 14 Aboriginals died in prison: 4 from hang-
 ing, 3 from natural causes, and 1 from a drug overdose. Both the number and pro-
 portion of Aboriginal deaths in custody decreased in 1997.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the executive and legislative branches respect its provisions.
 There is a well-developed system of federal and state courts, with the High Court
 at its apex. Almost all criminal trials are conducted by courts established under
 (801)
 
 
 802
 state and territorial legislation. The Federal Court and the High Court have very
 limited roles to play.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary vigor-
 ously enforces this right.
 When trials are conducted in local courts, the magistrates sit alone. In higher
 courts, namely the state district or county courts and the state or territorial su-
 preme courts, trials are usually conducted before a judge and jury. The jury decides
 on the facts and verdict after a trial conducted by a judge.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although there is no bill of rights, in two deci-
 sions the High Court has indicated that freedom of political discourse is implied in
 the Constitution. The Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although these rights are not
 codified in law, citizens exercise them without government restriction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice. A provision of the Constitution precludes
 the adoption of a state religion. Minority religions are given equal rights to land,
 status, and building of places of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides tor these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government encourages migration by skilled migrants, family members, and
 refugees.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There is no provi-
 sion for first asylum. However, during the political crisis in Indonesia the Govern-
 ment allowed ethnic Chinese Indonesians to extend their temporary visas in Aus-
 tralia, and granted them, in effect, temporary protdcted status. In the case of un-
 documented migrants and asylum seekers, the Government either grants a protec-
 tion visa, with full residence and employment rights, or refuses it, with no inter-
 mediate measures. The Government has continued to repatriate forcibly individuals
 who it has determined do not have a valid claim to refugee status in accordance
 with relevant United Nations convention definitions. Human rights and refugee ad-
 vocacy groups maintain that the Government's refugee and asylum adjudication
 process is applied inconsistently.
 Under the Migration Reform Act of 1994, asylum-seekers, who arrive at the bor-
 der without prior authorization to enter the country, are automatically detained, but
 may be released from detention if they meet certain criteria-including age, ill-
 health, and experiences of torture or other trauma. The majority of asylum seekers
 are detained for the duration of the often-prolonged asylum process. The detention
 policy has led to extensive litigation initiated by human rights and refugee advocacy
 groups, which charge that the sometimes lengthy detentions violate the human
 rights of the asylum seekers. The United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) stated in April 1997 that Australia had violated the rights of a boat per-
 son by detaining him for more than 4 years while his applications to remain in the
 country were being considered. The UNHRC stated that his detention was arbitrary,
 and in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In an
 April report to Parliament, the federally funded but independent Australian Human
 Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also condemned the Government's treat-
 ment of asylum seekers as breaching international treaty obligations.
 In 1997-98, Australia accepted 67,100 migrants, with 12,020 admitted under the
 humanitarian program, which accepts refugees and those in refugee-like situations
 in urgent need of resettlement. This figure included 1,553 persons already in the
 country who were granted refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and mandatory voting. In October
 voters elected the Liberal-National Party coalition to a second 3-year term of office.
 
 
 803
 No legal impediments exist to prevent women and indigenous people from holding
 public office. However, historical patterns of bias against women have contributed
 to their underrepresentation in government and politics. Approximately 25 percent
 of federal parliamentarians are women, an increase from the 22 percent in the last
 Parliament. The Government and the opposition have both declared their intent to
 increase the numbers of women elected to public office.
 The deleterious effects of poor educational achievement and a generally inferior
 socioeconomic status have contributed significantly to the underrepresentation of
 Aboriginals among political leaders. One Aboriginal was elected to the Federal Sen-
 ate in the October elections; there were no Aboriginals in the previous Parliament
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction
 (and in some instances with government funding), investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials cooperate and respond
 to their views. Overall complaints of discrimination dropped from 2,249 in 1996-97
 to 1,522 in 1997-98, a 32 percent reduction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on these factors, and the Government and
 an independent judiciary vigorously enforce the prohibition.
 Women.-Social analysts and commentators estimate that domestic violence may
 affect as many as one family in three or four. Wife beating is particularly prevalent
 in certain Aboriginal communities. The Government recognizes that domestic vio-
 lence and economic discrimination are serious problems and the statutorily inde-
 pendent Sex Discrimination Commissioner actively addresses these and other areas
 of discrimination. Government statisticians state that, because of underreporting
 and the lack of an agreed method for collecting statistics, it is impossible to provide
 an accurate national profile of the number of women who are victims of domestic
 violence.
 Women have equal status under the law, and the law provides for pay equity.
 There are highly organized and effective private and public women's rights organ-
 zations at the federal, state, and local levels. There is a federal-level Office of the
 Status of Women that monitors women's rights. The federal Sex Discrimination
 Commissioner receives complaints and attempts to resolve those that are deemed
 valid. According to government statistics, sex discrimination complaints fell by 37
 percent from the previous year. A 1994 U.N. report estimated that women receive
 approximately 90 percent of wages paid to men for substantially similar work.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education, day care,
 and medical care. The Government recently decided to remove subsidies to children
 under the age of 18.
 The federal Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission receives com-
 plaints and attempts to resolve those it finds valid. Similarly, the six states and two
 territories investigate complaints of neglect or child abuse and institute practical
 measures aimed at protecting the child when such complaints prove founded. The
 Government has enacted strict legislation aimed at restricting the trade in, and pos-
 session of, child pornography, and which further allows suspected pedophiles to be
 tried in Australia regardless of where the crime was committed. There is no societal
 pattern of abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or other state services. The Disability Discrimi-
 nation Commissioner promotes compliance with federal laws prohibiting discrimina-
 tion against disabled persons. The Commissioner also promotes energetic implemen-
 tation and enforcement of state laws that require equal access and otherwise protect
 the rights of disabled persons.
 There is no federal legislation mandating the uniform provision of accessibility for
 the disabled. It is lawful to deny employment or services to those with disabilities
 if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the disabled person would be un-
 able to carry out the work or would require the employer or service provider to fur-
 nish services or facilities that could not reasonably be provided.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Ministry
 for Aboriginal Affairs, in conjunction with the Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander
 Commission (ATSIC), has the main responsibility for initiating, coordinating, and
 monitoring all governmental efforts to improve the quality of life of indigenous peo-
 
 
 804
 ple. A wide variety of government initiatives and programs seek to improve all as-
 pects of Aboriginal and Torres Straits Islander life. In 1997 the Federal Government
 spent approximately $1.13 billion on health, welfare, education, and regional devel-
 opment programs targeted at assisting Aboriginal people.
 In practice, however, indigenous Australians continue to experience significantly
 higher rates of imprisonment, inferior access to medical and educational institu-
 tions, greatly reduced life expectncy rates, elevated levels of unemployment, and
 general discrimination, which contbute to an overwhelming feeling of powerless-
 ness.
 Nationally, indigenous people are imprisoned at 21 times the rate of nonindige-
 nous people. Over 45 percent of Aboriginal men between the ages of 20 and 30 years
 have been arrested at some time in their lives. The prison incarceration rate for in-
 digenous juvenile offenders is 21 times that of nonindigenous juveniles. Indigenous
 goups claim that the Governmnent's lack of response to a series of recommendations
 bythe 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody contributes to
 these disturbing statistics. Human rights observers claim that socioeconomic condi-
 tions give rise to the common precursors of indigenous crime, e.g. unemployment,
 homelessness, and boredom.
 Indigenous groups charge that police harassment of indigenous people including
 juveniles is pervasive and that racial discrimination among police and prison
 custodians persists. A human rights delegtation hat visited in 1996 alleged a pat-
 tern of mistreatment and arbitrary arrests occurring against a backdrop of system-
 atic discrimination. Most of the juveniles interviewed complained about violence oc-
 curring after apprehension and during questioning about alleged offenses. In No-
 vember the Queensland Government launched an inquiry after it was discovered
 that an 11-year-old Aboriginal boy had been held for 3 days in an adult detention
 center because no youth facility was available in that remote part of the state. Gov-
 ernment statistics confirm the common perception among indigenous people that po-
 lice systematically mistreat them. Government reports have suggested that the pur-
 suit of economic self-determination for indigenous people woud reatly assist in
 solving the crime problems in indigenous communities and the differences in rates
 of imprisonment.
 The average life expectancy of an indigenous person is 20 years less than that
 of a nonindigenous person. The infant mortality rate for indigenous children is 3
 times that of nonindigenous children. The maternal mortality rate for indigenous
 women is 5 times that of nonindigenous women. The incidence of illnesses such as
 tuberculosis, leprosy, hepatitis, and of sexually transmitted diseases is 10 times
 greater among indigenous people than nonindigenous people. Data indicate that
 22.5 percent of indigenous children complete secondary education compared with
 76.2 percent of nonindigenous children. Government statistics for 1995 show that
 the participation rate in university education for Aboriginals is 2.4 percent (up from
 1.8 percent in 1991) compared with 2.7 percent for non-Aboriginals.
 Government programs, including a $750 million indigenous land fund and a tFed-
 eral Social Justice Package," aim at ameliorating the real challenges faced by indig-
 enous Australians. In July after a compromise with its opponents, the Government
 was able topass amendments to the 1993 Native Title Act. The ATSIC stated that
 the amended act contains gains for Aboriginal people but still contains "substantial
 pain" for native title claimants. Aboriginal leaders were pleased by the removal of
 the time limit for lodging native title claims but expressed deep concern about the
 weakening of Aboriginal rights to negotiate with non-Aboriginal leaseholders over
 the development of rural property. Aboriginal groups continue to express concern
 that the amended act limits the future ability of Aboriginal people to fully protect
 their property rights. At present, 15 percent of Australian land is owned or con-
 trolled by Aboriginal people.
 The Government continues to oppose an official apology to the "Stolen Generation"
 of Aboriginal children, who were taken from their parents by the Government from
 1910 to the early 1970's and raised by foster parents and orphanages. Prime Min-
 ister John Howard continues to say that the present generation has no responsibil-
 ity to apologize for the wrongs of a previous generation. In response Aboriginal and
 human rights groups organized a national "Sorry Day" in May when non-
 Aboriginals, especially youths, were encouraged to express their sorrow and offer
 apologies for the pain caused to Aboriginal people by the policies of the previous
 generation.
 As of October, the federal Government had allocated an additional $7 million over
 4 years to the Link Up Program, which was created to reunite members of the Sto-
 len Generation with their families. The ASTIC spent over $630,000 during the fi-
 nancial year ending June 30 on location, reunion, and counseling support for mem-
 bers of the Stolen Generation. Across the nation, Link Up counselors are assisting
 
 
 805
 over 2,500 Aboriginal clients. The ASTIC reports that during the financial year end-
 ing June 30, it assisted the reunion of slightly more than 100 clients with their fam-
 ilies.
 Following the October reelection of the Government, Prime Minister Howard gave
 Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Minister Philip Ruddock additional duties
 with regard to Aboriginal Australians. In his victory speech following reelection,
 Howard said he would make reconciliation with Aboriginals one of his second term
 priorities.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Although Asians make up less than 5 per-
 cent of the population, they account for 40 percent of recent immigrants. Public
 opinion surveys indicate growing criticism of immigration. In a survey published in
 1996 by the Chinese-language newspaper Sing Tao, more than half the respondents
 said that they had been abused verbally or physically in the previous 2 months.
 Leaders in the ethnic and immigrant communities expressed concern throughout the
 year that the nativist One Nation Party had contributed to the increasing sense of
 isolation and atmosphere of vilification of immigrants and minorities. However, ac-
 cording to the federally funded but independent Human Rights and Equal Oppor-
 tunity Commission, during the financial year ending June 30, the number of racial
 discrimination complaints fell 37 percent from the previous year.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law and practice provide workers, including
 public servants, freedom of-association domestically and internationally. Approxi-
 mately 32 percent of the work force is unionized.
 Unions carry out their functions free from government or political control, but
 most local affiliates belong to state branches of the Australian Labor Party (ALP).
 Union members must make up at least 50 percent of the delegates to ALP con-
 gresses, but unions do not participate or vote as a bloc.
 The Workplace Relations Act, which went into effect in 1997, restricts the right
 to strike to the period when a new wages and working conditions contract is being
 negotiated. Legislation that went into force in 1994 for the first time legalized what
 had always been a de facto right to strike.
 Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers and labor leaders, and
 they are effectively enforced. In practice employers tend to avoid legal remedies,
 e.g., secondary boycott injunctions, available to them in order to preserve a long-
 term relationship with their unions.
 A major industrial confrontation shut down approximately 13 percent of the coun-
 try's stevedoring capacity when Patrick Stevedores locked out its entire 1,400 person
 staff at midnight April 7. Following a series of court cases, the company was forced
 to reemploy most of its work force.
 Unions freely may form and join federations or confederations, and they actively
 participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law and practice provide
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects
 them from antiunion discrimination.
 The Workplace Relations Act contains curbs on union power, restrictions on
 strikes, and a new unfair-dismissal system. Several unions are considering challeng-
 ing the 1997 law on the grounds that it violates the right to assembly provided for
 in several International Labor Organization conventions that Australia has signed.
 The primary curb on union power is the abolition of closed shops and union demar-
 cations. Although unions are weakened, this provision could create many small and
 competing unions at individual worksites. The restrictions on strikes include heavy
 fines for labor unrest during the life of an agreement and tougher secondary-boycott
 provisions. The new unfair-dismissal system further limits redress and compensa-
 tion claims.
 The negotiation of contracts covering wages and working conditions is gradually
 shifting from the centralized system of the past. Previously legislation provided for
 the negotiation of simpler "enterprise agreements," which were negotiated by indi-
 vidual companies with their workers or with the relevant union(s). The federal and
 state governments administered centralized minimum-wage awards and provided
 quasi-judicial arbitration, supplemented by industrywide or ,company-by-company
 collective bargaining. The Worplace Relations Act also provides for the negotiation
 of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWA's) between employers and individual
 workers. These agreements are subject to far fewer government regulations than the
 awards. At present the AWA's are required to be roughly equivalent to basic work-
 ing conditions in the award that would apply to the sector to which the firm be-
 longs.
 
 
 There are no export processing zones. The Darwin Trade Development Zone,
 Northern Territory, attempts to increase exports via a geographically defined free
 trade zone. In practice the Darwin initiative is focused almost exclusively on its
 Asian neighbors to the north and west.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws pro-
 hibiting it, forced labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, is not prac-
 ticed.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 does not prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not
 known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 There is no federally mandated minimum age of employment, but state-imposed
 compulsory educational requirements, monitored and enforced by state educational
 authorities, effectively prevent most children from joining the work force until they
 are 15 or 16 years of age. Federal and state governments monitor and enforce a net-
 work of laws, which vary from state to state, governing minimum school-leaving
 age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum age to engage in
 specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although a formal minimum wage exists, it
 has not been relevant in wage agreements since the 1960's. Instead, 80 percent of
 workers are covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades and pro-
 fessions, all of which are sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family.
 Most workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them, a complex
 body of government regulations, as well as decisions of applicable federal or state
 industrial relations commissions, prescribe a 40-hour or shorter workweek, paid va-
 cations, sick leave, and other benefits, including at least one 24-hour rest period per
 week.
 Federal or state safety laws apply to every workplace.
 The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991
 provides federal employees with the legal right to cease work if they believe that
 particular work activities pose an immediate threat to individual health or safety.
 Most states and territories have laws that grant similar rights to their employees.
 At a minimum, private sector employees have recourse to state health and safety
 commissions, which will investigate complaints and demand remedial action.
