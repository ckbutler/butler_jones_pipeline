 MEXICO
 The Mexican Constitution provides separation of powers
 for the three branches of the Federal government, as well
 as between the Federal government and the state governments.
 In practice, it is a centralized system in which ultimate
 authori.ty rests with the president who cannot be re-elected
 after a 6 year term. The Mexican political process has
 been dominated by one governing party, the Institutional
 Revolutionary Party, (PRIr.
 The PRI permits and sometimes encourages opposition parties,
 but there have been no opposition victories in gubernatorial
 or presidential elections. Victories by opposition parties
 at the local level are increasing, but in some cases,
 through a variety of maneuvers tolerated by Federal authori-
 ties, the victor is prevented from taking office. An
 electoral reform initiated by President Lopez Portillo
 was implemented at the Federal level in 1979 and by almost
 all State Governments. It guarantees minority parties
 representation based upon the number of votes they receive,
 including a minimum of 25 percent of the seats in the
 federal Chamber of Deputies.
 Over the past 40 years, Mexico has changed from a largely
 agricultural society into an urbanized industrial state.
 Recently-discovered petroleum resources place it in the
 first rank of oil countries and present unique possibilities
 and challentes for Mexico's future. Income is increasing
 but its distribution remains badly skewed. Population
 expanded greatly over the past decade and continues to
 grow at almost three percent per annum. The present adminis-
 tration has formulated ambitious programs to distribute
 an increased portion of the nation's resources to a greater
 number of people, to increase agricultural and industrial
 productivity and to provide basic government and social
 services. Whether the government can satisfy the rising
 expectations of the people is the basic question for Mexico's
 social, economic, and political stability. Mexico's consti-
 tution, laws and traditions provide for social justice
 and equality, and organizations concerned with human rights
 violations are allowed to publicize their grievances.
 Mexico has traditionally provided asylum for dissidents
 from throughout Latin America. It also participates active-
 ly in multilateral human rights activities.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Article 22 of the Constitution prohibits torture; however,
 credible allegations of mistreatment during the arrest
 and interrogation stage are comon. According to the
 allegations, beatings, electric shocks, submersion in
 water and forcing carbonated water up the nostrils are
 among the methods of mistreatment. Those suspected of
 terrorism or drug-trafficking are most likely to be physical-
 ly mistreated.
 Five Mexicans who claim to have been released in December,
 1979 from Military Camp No.1 insist they were tortured.
 The government has prosecuted some police officers who
 
 
 480
 obtained evidence or confessions through torture or other
 unconstitutional means.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The government continues to upgrade, remodel and replace
 penal institutions. In many prisons overcrowding, inade-
 quate sanitary facilities and unsatisfactory diet still
 exist. Prisoners are provided medical care and those
 who have the means may purchase food and other items which
 may be brought to them. Conjugal visits are allowed.
 There are credible reports of physical mistreatment of
 prisoners and of verbal threats by the police to detainees
 or family members. There were 81 cases of confirmed or
 alleged mistreatment of American citizens from July 1,
 1979 to June 30, 1980 - a slight decline from the previous
 year. Confirmed cases are less than 10 percent of the
 allegations. Reports indicate mistreatment is more likely
 to occur in some states of Mexico than in others. In
 Baja California allegations of abuse are conmon, while
 in Jalisco reports of abuse are rare. American prisoners
 are sometimes reluctant to report mistreatment for fear
 of reprisal and are frequently reluctant to request that
 consular officers lodge official protests with Mexican
 officials.
 There is no indication that the length of sentence or
 the severity of treatment varies due to race, sex or reli-
 gion.
 c. Disappearances
 Human rights groups, opposition political parties, and
 the press report disappearances of persons. The National
 Front Against Repression (NFAR) and the Defense Committee
 for Political Prisoners, the Persecuted, Disappeared and
 Political Exiles (DCPPPDPE), a member of NFAR, claim that
 481 individuals disappeared in the past decade while in
 the hands of security forces.
 These groups claim that the Mexican Government has clandes-
 tinely arrested and imprisoned political dissidents -includ-
 ing those the government believes to be terrorists and
 guerrillas. The groups claim that whatever the allega-
 tions, the persons are held without formal charges or
 public trial.
 There have been few terrorist incidents in Mexico in the
 last few years and there is presently no guerrilla activity
 in the country. The vast majority of the persons who
 disappeared would allegedly have been in custody for some
 time. There have been few additions to the total of alleged
 disappearances since the groups first published the lists
 in December, 1978.
 The government does not acknowledge the existence of disap-
 peared persons. It claims that they were either killed
 in encounters with security forces, changed their names,
 went underground or sought voluntary exile. The Governor
 of Guerrero on several occasions has stated that the disappeared
 are all dead, but government officials have not provided
 proof of death, such as death certificates or grave sites.
 
 
 481
 The five Mexicans who claim to have been released from
 Military Camp Number 1 in December, 1979, identified several
 other alledgedly disappeared persons as fellow prisoners.
 In January, 1980, the magazine PROCESO published photoco-
 pies of documents alleging the existence at Military Camp
 No. 1 of the "White Brigade," a clandestine military-civi-
 lian security task force whose existence has been repeatedly
 denied by the government. Subsequently, there have been
 unsubstantiated press reports that the brigade has been
 disbanded.
 The November 1980 issue of PROCESO, however, claims that
 in a press conference on October 8, the Mexican Secretary
 of Defense acknowledged that the "White Brigade" had existed
 and that it had disbanded on the orders of goverment authori-
 ties. In hie reported statement, the Secretary did not
 say whether the unit was responsible for any of the alleged
 disappearances or whether the brigade had maintained a
 detention center. There was no other press coverage of
 this purported statement, nor, it would appear, did the
 reporter's question trigger other inquiries at the press
 conference or afterwards. The Government continues to
 deny the existence of clandestine detention centers.
 Human rights groups also state that two persons who the
 DCPPPDPE claims were in the custody of security forces
 as of April 23, 1980, were reported by the Government
 to have been killed more than a month later in a gun battle
 with security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government claims it arrests persons only for crimes,
 such as robbery, kidnapping and assassination - although
 it acknowledges some crimes may have been committed for
 political purposes. In the past several years, there
 have been no trials for the crimes of rebellion, sedition,
 mutiny, terrorism, sabotage or treason. The NFAR, however,
 claims there are more than 400 persons in prison for politi-
 cally-related crimes, and a leader of the DCPPPDPE has
 insisted that there are some 40 alleged guerrillas and
 terrorists being held.
 Thirty-one persons were granted amnesty in 1980. To date,
 a total of 1,560 people have benefitted-from a 1978 amnesty
 program designed to bring dissidents into the Mexican
 political system and to help create social peace. The
 laws, both federal and state, grant pardons to prisoners,
 fugitives and exiles who have been convicted or accused
 of political crimes or crimes committed for political
 reasons. Many who have received amnesty were persons
 who were arrested for land seizures. Some opposition
 political parties and human rights groups continue to
 call for a general amnesty.
 The constitution provides for the writ of amparo which
 is similar but not identical to a writ of habeas corpus.
 The constitution prohibits the detention of an ingividual
 for more than three days without formal charges. American
 citizens have been held longer than three days without
 charges. There have also been instances of arbitrary
 arrest for the purpose of extortion. According to state-
 ments from public officials, particularly in the Mexico
 City area, several thousand offending police and security
 
 
 482
 officers have been dismissed on grounds of corruption
 or extortion. Mexican law also permits the detention
 of those the authorities have reason to suspect of planning
 crimes, a form of preventive detention. There is no credi-
 ble evidence that it is being used for political reasons.
 A non-governmental Mexican Institute for the Study of
 ppro was established in 1980 to make recommendations
 for improving procedures as well as to point out corrupt
 practices.
 Since the Mexican Revolution there have been many cases
 of illegal occupation of unused land in both urban and
 rural areas. Those who carry out the seizures do so in
 the hope that the government will transfer the land to
 them. In recent years the government has taken firm action
 against such trespassers.
 There have been several cases in the past year of detention
 of groups of peasants involved in illegal land takeovers.
 The length of time they were held, with or without charges,
 varied. There is no accurate estimate of the number detained
 for this activity.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The accused in Mexico is generally accorded a fair public
 trial. Trial procedutes based upon Roman Civil Law involve
 a paper exchange from the defense and prosecution to the
 court, including written witnesses' statements and expert
 opinion. The law allows for oral testimony but it is
 not a common practice. Jury trials are rare. Signed
 confessions are sometimes exacted through torture, mistreat-
 ment and coercion. Evidence obtained illegally is not
 normally admissible in the courts unless substantiated
 by corroborating testimony.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, either a private
 or a public defender. The few public defenders have large
 case loads and counsel is not always able to give full
 attention to a client's case. Adequate legal counsel
 is available to those who can afford it.
 By law the Mexican Judiciary is independent, but there
 have been occasional reports that the Executive Branch
 influenced judicial determinations. There are no known
 instances of civilians being tried by military courts.
 The constitution requires that trial and sentencing be
 done within 12 months of arrest for crimes that carry
 a penalty of more than two years imprisonment. This require-
 ment is frequently not met, sometimes because of delays
 occasioned by due process requirements, which take precedence.
 As of October 1, 1980, there were 18 Americans in Mexican
 jails who had been held more than twelve months but who
 had not received final sentencing. In most instances
 the cause is delaying tactics by co-defendants, inefficient
 court procedures and insufficient judges and lawyers.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits entry of a home without warrant.
 Warrants may be issued by Federal or State judges depending
 on the type of case. These safeguards are generally observed,
 except in cases of hot pursuit. There are reports of
 
 
 483
 entry by police officials for the purpose of extortion.
 The government on occasion razes unauthorized squatte
 housing or has a squatter's personal property removed
 from a housing unit which is then boarded up or torn down.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care# Employ-
 ment and Education.
 Mexico's major economic and social problems are popula-
 tion growth, -inflation, unemployment, poverty and uneven
 distribution of income. 1980 census listed the population
 at 67.4 million. Growth is estimated at an average of
 2 million annually during this decade. Government statistics
 indicate the annual bi-rth rate declined from 3.5 percent
 in 1970 to 2.9 percent in 1979 with a goal is 2.5 percent
 by 1982. Mexico's population is young: 43 percent are
 under the age of 14 and 65 percent are under 24 years
 old. The population has also -been urbanized: approximately
 60 percent live in cities (a total of 25 percent in the
 Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey urban areas alone).
 Current per capita income is estimated by the Bank of
 Mexico at U.S. $2436, compared to $1852 and $1465 in
 the two previous years. Economic growth will be about
 7-7.5 percent this year, down slightly from 1979. However,
 income distribution, is badly skewed and according to
 Mexican.figures, becoming more so.
 Inflation, a major problem, rose to 29.8 percent in 1980
 according to the Bank of Mexico. The government has simpli-
 fied-an exceedingly complex minimum wage system and thereby
 substantially reduced the differences in minimum wages
 from one area to another. The Government acknowledges
 that many - including public employees - do not yet receive
 full minimum wage.
 Unemployment ranges from 9.to 15 percent and underemployment
 increased, this-figure to approximately 50 percent of the
 work force.
 Primary education is obligatory and free under the constitu-
 tion and has been extended to 10 years of education.
 Government figures indicate that some 700,000 children
 could not attend school during 1979 for lack of classrooms.
 Nearly 300,000 Mexicans of school age speak dialects but
 cannot speak Spanish. The government has built 395 bilingual
 residential schools for them, but an estimated 525 more
 are needed.
 The Government claims that 42 million persons are covered
 by social security programs including medical assistance;
 many, however, are only partially covered. A government
 agency provides staple foods at subsidized-prices to over
 14 million people to alleviate the malnutrition that afflicts
 an estimated 40 percent of the population. Supplying
 potable water, electricity and communications facilities
 to rural areas is a priority of the current administration.
 The rights of property owners are reasonably protected.
 Disputes over property have resulted in numerous land
 seizures in rural areas in the past year, a number of
 them apparently provoked by opposition political parties.
 Government land redistribution programs begun during-the
 1910 Revolution continue, but there is little land available
 
 
 484
 for redistribution. The demand for land by poor rural
 dwellers and the need to upgrade Mexico's agricultural
 system continue.
 The constitution provides for the right of employment,
 but underdevelopment contributes to the continuing inability
 of the economy to provide everyone with work. Job training,
 for the most part, is available only to those who can
 afford it, or who are fortunate enough to find work with
 employers who provide it. The government recently began
 to enforce employee health and safety standards, but acknow-
 ledges that it will be able to correct only the most dangerous
 and unhealthful conditions for some time to come. The
 improvement of workplace health and safety standards often
 conflicts with the need to create jobs.
 There appears to be no pattern of hiring or wage discri-
 mination against women in the unskilled, semi-skilled
 or professional government fields, but there is open resis-
 tance to women in some industries. Managerial and executive
 positions are dominated by men.
 The administration is implementing an anti-corruption
 campaign. According to information released by the Federal
 Attorney General's office in October, 1980, over 2500
 public employees have been prosecuted during the current
 administration and more than 130 million dollars recovered.
 Corruption remains a problem for Mexican society. Despite
 official efforts to reduce corruption within police ranks,
 many Mexicans still distrust them.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly.
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are guaranteed
 by law. The press openly criticizes cabinet secretaries
 and the PRI leadership, but the President is traditionally
 immune from direct press criticism - at least during his
 incumbency. Political and social commentary is common.
 The Federal Government retains indirect control over the
 print media through its monopoly of newsprint and its
 ability to direct government advertising. Political parties
 are required by law to publish journals and this effort
 is, in part, subsidized by the government. Direct criticism
 of local government varies from state to state depending
 on the pressures exerted by the state governor and the
 inclinations of the owners of the principal state publications.
 In February 1980, the Governor of Oaxaca reportedly ordered
 the seizure of an edition of the newspaper "El Universal"
 because of critism of him the paper had published in a
 previous edition.
 Radio, television, publications and movies are censored
 on moral grounds. There are subscription cable transmis-
 
 
 485
 sions of U.S.-originated television programs, including
 network and local Texas newscasts. English radio programs
 are not restricted.
 In September, 1980, the Government attempted to limit
 demonstrations to a specific downtown area of Mekico city.
 Political parties and interest groups have so far ignored
 this government directive and their demonstrations have
 been tolerated. Municipal and Federal authorities advocated
 the curbs in order to alleviate traffic congestion caused.
 by the numerous demonstrations.
 Freedom of worship is protected by the constitution and
 observed. The constitution, however, denies the clergy
 participation in politics and prohibits them from criticizing
 basic laws, public authorities or the government in general.
 Members of the-clergy may not be elected to federal office.
 Religious organizations may not own real estate and the
 number of clergy residing in a state may be regulated
 by the state legislature. The constitution limits clerical
 practice to persons who are Mexican by birth, and prohibits
 religious organizations from operating pre-university
 schools. Neither of the latter two prohibitions is strictly
 enforced. There is no evidence of governmental interference
 with academic inquiry in the natural or social sciences.
 Organized labor. both influences and is influenced by the
 -government. ERI-affiliated unions include approximately
 95 percent of organized labor; this affiliation is voluntary.
 The Government's only role in union elections is to certify
 the results. On occasion, the government recognizes PRI-
 affiliated unions over non-PRI in jurisdictional disputes.
 The right to strike is rarely impeded, but the govern-
 ment has a role in the resolution of major strikes. The
 government doesnot seem to favor labor or management
 in settling strikes.. The government did not use force
 to resolve labor disputes during 1980. PRI-affiliated
 unions regularly use the closed shop system to prevent
 dissident leaders from challenging their predominance.
 Expulsion of members and dissident leaders is seldom decided
 -by. democratic majority vote procedure. The government
 refused to permit the registration of a Communist-led
 national union of university workers (incorporating academics,
 researchers, administrative and manual workers) and passed
 a new law restricting university unions to a single university.
 It establishes collective bargaining and the right to
 strike for the university workers.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation.
 The Constitution guarantees the right of Mexican citizens
 to travel anywhere and to emigrate freely. There is no
 significant violation of that right.
 Mexico has a long historical tradition of providing asylum
 to political refugees. Numerous refugees have been admitted -
 and there is a sizeable exile colony of Spanish, Chileans,
 Cubans, Uruguayans and Venezuelans. Many have become
 residents. According to President Lopez Portillo's 1980
 State of the Union Address, 112 Latin American refugees
 were admitted in the previous year including the ex-president
 of Argentina, Hector Campora. An annex to the report
 shows there were 2495 cases of asylum during the past
 decade from Central or South America. A Cabinet-level
 
 
 486
 committee on refugee matters was established during the
 past year. Mexican embassies abroad offer safehaven to
 political refugees.
 In July, 1980, two opposition political parties charged
 that there were 40 Mexicans in exile, supposedly benefi-
 ciaries of the 1978 Amnesty Law, who have not been permitted
 to return because Mexican embassies have not issued them
 passports. There is no indication of forceful repatriation
 of political dissidents.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mexico's political system permits, and to a degree encourages,
 the formation of opposition political parties. However,
 the political life of the country and its institutions
 is dominated by the PRI, which has governed since 1928.
 Within the PRI and the government there are many ideologies.
 Internal debate about policy is permitted and public opinion
 is considered when decisions are made. Three parties
 -which received the necessary number of votes were permanently
 registered after the July, 1979, elections. Several politi-
 cal parties have not sought formal registration because
 they have not been able to comply with registration require-
 ments. Two political associations, which are distinct
 from parties, were registered in the past year. There
 are now seven registered political parties and six registered
 political associations. Five Federal Deputy elections
 in July, 1979, were nullified by the Electoral College,
 but subsequently were ratified by the Federal Chamber
 of Deputtes as victories for the PRI's candidates. Protests
 have been made in a number of state and local elections
 in the past year, some of which are currently under consider-
 ation.
 Political participation is encouraged, but the high level
 of abstentions is a growing problem. Electoral rolls
 are being made more accurate and the government has announced
 plans to issue a voter registration documeqt.
 Men and women are equal before the law and all citizens
 above the age of 18, with the exception of the clergy,
 are entitled to participate in the political process.
 A growing percentage of women engage in politics and work
 in government. Currently there are 29 women Federal deputies,
 3 Senators, one Governor, and one Cabinet member. A few
 women bold important positions at the sub-cabinet level
 and at senior levels of the bureaucracy. Although cultural
 traditions continue to impede the access of women to senior
 positions in private industry, women who are skilled,
 experienced and well-educated have a fair chance in the
 job market. Women account for more than 20 percent of
 the labor force.
 4.   government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Right.
 The Government generally has been cooperative with interna-
 tional human rights organizations. The current government
 ratified the American Convention on Human Rights and a
 number of other international human rights covenantp in
 Decemer, 1980. In January, 1980, the Government received
 a mission from Amnesty International. According to, Amnesty's
 
 
 487
 1980 report, the mission confirmed AI concerns about the
 human rights situation in Mexico, including irregular
 detention procedures, prolonged periods of detention incommu-
 nicado, torture, convictions reportedly based solely on
 the basis of a confession extracted under duress without
 other supporting evidence, unrecognized arrests or "disappear-
 ances", and the authorities' failure to investigate complaints
 against the "White Brigade'.
 The government does not suppress domestic human rights
 groups. In addition, minority parties and other groups
 are active in championing particular human rights causes.
 Leaders of these groups meet periodically with the President
 and senior government officials to present their positions;
 nevertheless, they do not seem to have successfully enlisted
 widespread public support and there appears to be no widely
 recognized organization to defend unpopular causes.
