 BELIZE
 Belize is a functioning democracy which celebrated the first
 anniversary of its independence from Great Britain on September 21,
 1982. The Constitution provides for a Westminster-model parlia-
 mentary democracy and in fact that is the system that exists.
 It makes specific provision for the protection of fundamental
 rights and freedoms of the individual regardless of race, creed,
 sex, or ownership of property. In this regard, it further
 codifies the system of English common law and former colonial
 laws of Belize, which remain largely in effect.
 The developing economy of Belize is based primarily on
 agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing. After a strong growth
 performance in the 1970s, the economy turned sharply downward
 in 1981 and 1982, due in part to poor agricultural performance,
 stagnation in manufacturing, and the international recession.
 Belize's first year of independence has not been marked by
 civil disturbances or infractions of the human rights
 guarantees written into its Constitution. The constitutional
 commitments for the protection of fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual have been scrupulously observed.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no killings for political motives in Belize
 during the last year.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearances during the last
 year in Belize. People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or
 held in clandestine detention.
 c. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in the Constitution and is not
 practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment and punishment are prohibited by the Constitution.
 Infrequent charges have been made of police brutality during the
 initial arrest and interrogation process, particularly involving
 illegal aliens and people suspected of committing serious crimes.
 Sentences -- either fine or imprisonment -- for criminal offenses
 are lenient. Although the prisons are old and overcrowded,
 efforts are made to lodge adults and juveniles separately. There
 is no discrimination on the basis of social class, race, or
 religion. There is no physical punishment, and discipline is
 administered by trained officers. A basic but adequate diet is
 provided.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and
 guarantees the right of habeas corpus. A person is entitled to be
 informed within 48 hours of the reasons for his arrest or deten-
 tion and to be brought to a court within 72 hours. Release on
 bail is allowed for all but the most serious, violent criminal
 offenses. By and large, these statutes are strictly observed.

 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. A criminal
 defendant is not compelled to give evidence in his or her own
 trial. Access to legal counsel is permitted, and a legal aid
 society provides legal counsel to indigent defendants. Court-
 appointed interpreters are provided when necessary at no charge.
 Public trials are required unless agreed to otherwise by all
 parties, and this process is respected. The judiciary is
 independent of both the executive and the military. Military
 courts have jurisdiction only over service-related offenses of
 personnel of the Belize Defense Force.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary search and entry are prohibited by the Constitution.
 Search warrants are required and used. There have been no reports
 of violations.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees these freedoms, and they
 are respected in practice. The Government has issued licenses to
 receive TV signals from satellites. Several license holders have
 started transmitting these signals to the public; the Government
 has not yet placed any restrictions on this activity. There is
 only one radio station in Belize, which is government-controlled.
 There has been a dialogue between the Government and the opposi-
 tion United Democratic Party which has led to the Government's
 commitment to broadcast political debates and cover opposition
 events. The radio does provide coverage of debates in the
 assembly and of press conferences called by the leader of the
 opposition. However, the opposition has only limited access to
 radio coverage. There are several weekly newspapers, divided
 between Government and opposition viewpoints. There is no
 censorship, and criticism of the Government is tolerated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly. A permit is
 required to hold a public meeting, but no problems have been
 reported in obtaining these permits. Rights of assembly may be
 curtailed during times of national emergency declared by the
 Governor General or the National Assembly in order to preserve
 public order. Brief states of emergency have been declared only
 twice in Belizean history -- in the aftermath of Hurricane Hattie
 in 1961 and due to civil disturbances in March-April 1981.
 Labor unions are free to organize, negotiate, and strike, and to
 play an important role in the society and economy. Approximately
 12 percent of the labor force is unionized. There are several
 labor unions, divided politically between the Government and the
 opposition. Belize is a member of the International Labor
 Organization and a member of the Caribbean Confederation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Belize, and a variety'of Christian
 and non-Christian denominations operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 
 
 409
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize or on foreign
 travel or emigration. Emigration is motivated by economic reasons
 and not by political or human rights concerns. Forced repatri-
 ation is unknown. Voluntary repatriation by Belizean nationals is
 unrestricted. Belize has been a traditional haven for refugees
 from neighboring countries as evidenced by the admission of more
 than 2,000 Salvadoran refugees in the last three years. A
 proposal to settle some 2,000 Haitian migrants is currently under
 consideration. Implementation could be as early as 1983.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens age 18 and over are eligible to register and vote,
 and no group is denied the right to participate in political
 activity. Approximately 90 percent of the electorate voted in the
 last general election. Belize has been ruled by the People's
 United Party since independence, and indeed for many years during
 the period of internal self-rule prior to independence. Two oppo-
 sition parties, the United Democratic Party and the small Toledo
 Progressive Party, contest elections. The last election held was
 in December 1981 for municipal councils in the seven out-districts
 (excluding Belize City); the People's United Party won control of
 four of these municipal councils, and the United Democratic Party
 the remaining three councils.
 Although women are not proportionally represented in the govern-
 ment, the Governor General is a distinguished woman educator.
 Women hold one deputy cabinet-level position and two seats in the
 26-member legislature.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights:
 The Government has indicated its intention to accede to all
 applicable human rights and refugee conventions. No international
 entities have asked to investigate the human rights situation in
 Belize. A Human Rights Council exists in Belize, but has made no
 public charges of human rights violations. A branch of Amnesty
 International was recently formed in Belize, but to date has dealt
 with violations in other countries.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Government has stated its commitment to an active role in
 ensuring and promoting the economic and social wellbeing of its
 people. Great emphasis is placed in the Government's program and
 budget on the educational and health systems. Education is
 universal and compulsory to age 16 and may be received in either
 state or church schools. The literacy rate in 1980 was 86.6 per-
 cent and is now claimed to be over 90 percent. These figures do
 not vary significantly in rural and urban areas, nor on the basis
 of sex, race, or socio-economic circumstances.
 Health care is provided by the Government and also by private
 physicians. Although nominal in cost, government medical
 facilities outside Belize City are widely dispersed and are
 sometimes unable to provide for more than routine care. An
 estimated 80 percent of the population had access to safe water in
 1970. Government health teams spray throughout the country to
 control malaria, dengue, and yellow fever vectors, once primary
 causes of death in Belize. Health and nutritional awareness are
 also strongly emphasized in campaigns to encourage breast feeding,
 to select and prepare appropriate meals from local produce, and to
 create a rural cadre of primary health care practitioners. Life
 expectancy at birth is 60 years (1980); the infant mortality rate
 is 51.2 per 1,000 live births (1970). The ration of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements is 1.25 (125 percent) as of 1977. These figures are
 again consistent for both rural and urban areas on
 nondiscriminatory basis.

 The 1980 GNP per capita was $1,000. The variance between rich and
 poor is not considerable, and few are below the absolute poverty
 level. Wage increases in both the private and public sectors have
 approximated the pace of inflation -- 15 to 18 percent in recent
 years -- but have not adequately compensated for the even greater
 increases in the costs of imported goods. Price controls are
 maintained on basic foodstuffs. Economic growth has been about
 two percent annually since 1977, insufficient to provide enough
 job opportunities for the growing population. Although data for
 the total fertility rate is unavailable, the gross population
 growth rate has been about four percent annually in recent years.
 The net population growth rate is reduced to one percent by
 emigration in search of greater economic opportunities. Overall
 unemployment is eight percent or more, and unemployment and
 underemployment are considerably higher in Belize City, which
 contains one-third of the country's 145,000 people.
 A new social security system for employees was introduced in June
 1981. Economic opportunities exist primarily in the agricultural
 sector, given Belize's limited industrial base and manufacturing
 sector. Consequently, opportunities for skilled professionals,
 such as technicians, engineers, and accountants, are limited. The
 Government's development plan, 1980-1983, calls for large-scale
 investment to develop and expand the agricultural sector. Private
 ownership of the largely undeveloped interior for small farming
 operations is also encouraged.
 To upgrade the status of women, the Government of Belize
 established a women's bureau within the Ministry of Labor in April
 1981. At present the bureau is partially financed by the United
 Nations, but next year it is to be fully funded by the Government.
