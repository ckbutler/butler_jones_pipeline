 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment. Representatives in the multiparty political system are elected by universal
 suffrage at local, provincial, and federal levels. The Constitution defines government
 responsibilities and is subject to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal provincial, and municipal police forces
 which are responsible for national and local law enforcement, and the armed forces
 which have no role in domestic law enforcement except in strictly defined national
 emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system which encourages private ownership, in-
 vestment, and entrepreneurship. Workers benefit from laws regulating acceptable
 working conditions and, except for uniformed members of the armed forces, are
 guaranteed freedom of association.
 Canadians enjoy, in law and in practice, a wide range of freedoms and individual
 rights as enumerated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was appended
 to Canada's revised Constitution in 1982. Principal complaints of human rights
 abuses arise in the areas of discrimination against nonwhite minorities, Aboriginals,
 and women. The Constitution and laws provide avenues for legal redress of such
 abuses, and the Government and private organizations seek to ensure that human
 rights are respected in practice at all levels of society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no politically motivated
 or other extrajudicial killings. See the report on Somalia for allegations of abuse by
 Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia.
 b. Disappearance.-Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically motivated
 disappearance did not occur.
 c.orture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and ill-treatment are prohibited by law, and are generally not practiced. Re-
 ports of the use of excessive force by police declined in 1993. Past incidents, which
 often (but not always) involved nonwhite minorities, continued to strain relations
 between minority communities and the police. In Montreal, a multiracial and inde-
 pendent police ethics committee (composed of one officer and two civilians) contin-
 ued its investigation of a 1991 shooting, in which a previous inquiry determined
 that "a totally unacceptable level of racism" existed in the Montreal Urban Commu-
 nity Police (MUC). The committee had not reported its conclusions by year's end.
 During 1993 several police departments took steps to redress the problem of vio-
 lence against minorities. The MUC began mandatory cultural awareness seminars
 for its officers, Toronto police implemented a policy requiring a written use of force
 report for each time an officer draws a weapon in public, and the Halifax and Mon-
 treal police instituted affirmative action programs to increase minority representa-
 tion on the force.
 Native groups complained of cultural insensitivity and harassment by police offi-
 cers. The Canadian Government instituted training programs for officers with a
 view to preventing future incidents. The British Columbia provincial government's
 Commission on Native Issues continued to study specific allegations ofrlaw enforce-
 ment abuses against natives of the Chilcotin Band.
 
 
 Prisons are open to independent monitoring by human rights groups and the
 media.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment, and this prohibition is respected in practice. Arrest warrants are is-
 sued by judicial authorities, and suspects are charged before a justice of the peace
 (for minor offenses) or a judge within 72 hours of their arrest.
 A 1988 law authorizes the Government to take special measures, including the
 suspension of civil liberties, to ensure safety and security during national emer-
 gencies. The 1939 Official Secrets Act prohibits the private possession, distribution
 and publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests of the State and
 provides that persons under suspicion may be arrested without a warrant. There
 were no such arrests in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is based on English common
 law at the federal level and in most provinces. In the Province of Quebec, the judi-
 cial system is based on the Napoleonic Code. Judges in Canada are appointed. In
 criminal trials, the law provides for a presumption of the defendant's innocence and
 the right to a public trial, counsel (free for indigents), and appeal. In 1993 judges
 made infrequent use of their power to close courtrooms to the media in order to pro-
 tect victims (particularly children) and to guarantee fair and impartial hearings.
 One such effort, however, raised the issue of freedom of the press versus the right
 to a fair trial and caused considerable controversy (see Section 2.a.). The overwhelm-
 ing majority of trials, including military courts-martial, remained open to the public
 and the media.
 The Official Secrets Act provides that trials involving classified government infor-
 mation be held in secret, with certain presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecu-
 tions under this statute are extremely rare, and convictions are hard to sustain on
 appeal.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Canadi-
 ans are afforded strong legal protection from arbitrary interference under the Con-
 stitution, and federal and provincial governments generally do not interfere with an
 individual's basic rights without due process. Intrusive searches may be carried out
 only when there is a reasonable basis for presuming that the person is involved in
 criminal activity. Police officials face judicial penalties if they abuse a person's pri-
 vacy without first obtaining a judicial search warrant. No such penalties were im-
 posed in 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for by
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. A ruling by an Ontario judge
 banning news reports about a trial concerning a particularly grisly murder case
 frompted considerable debate about how to balance the right of a defendant to a
 air trial with freedom of the press. The judge imposed the ban in an effort to en-
 sure jury impartiality. Severa Canadian organizations filed suit to overturn the
 ban, while other media have defended the ban.
 Restrictive decisions by provincial film censorship boards and laws prohibiting
 certain forms of hate literature and pornography are exceptions to these freedoms.
 Canadian customs authorities have been known to confiscate sexually explicit mate-
 rial and items deemed to be hate propaganda. Some civil libertarians have criticized
 such actions on freedom of information grounds. Some feminist groups regard sexu-
 ally explicit material as degrading to women and stimulating violence against
 women. The Canadian Human Rights Act makes it illegal to make repeated commu-
 nications by telephone which expose a person or people to hatred or contempt. Mi-
 nority language and cultural rights are protected by the Constitution.
 Laws in the Province of Quebec restricting the public display of any non-French-
 language signs were amended in 1993. Bilingual commercial signs are now per-
 mitted, as long as the French version is "clearly predominant." The provincial gov-
 ernment issued regulations on specific aspects of the sign laws in December.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Fredom of assembly and free-
 dom of association are guaranteed by the Constitution. Permits are not required for
 meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no restrictions on movement within or outside Canada, in-
 cluding the rights of emigration and repatriation. Canada continues to be a haven
 for many refugees and displaced persons. In 1992 Canada tightened its generous
 refugee law in an attempt to limit entry to the asylum system to legitimate appli-
 cants and to simplify dealings with persons whose claims have been determinedto
 
 
 827
 be unfounded. Concerns expressed by minority advocacy groups that the new proc-
 ess would systematically discriminate against nonwhite refugees proved unfounded,
 according to some prominent human rights groups.
 Canada was praised by several women's gups after it granted refugee status to
 a woman on the grounds that she would face persecution in her own country be-
 cause of her gender. The Immigration Review Board subsequently released new
 guidelines for such cases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Canada is governed by federal and prvincia governments which are freely elect-
 ed by secret ballot through universal suffrage. The Governor General is the Queen
 of Canada's representative as Head of State. In practice, power is exercised by the
 Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who usually are elected members of the 295-seat
 House of Commons. Legislative elections at the federal and provincial levels must
 be held at least every 5 years, and these often result in a transfer of power to oppo-
 sition parties. Voter participation rates are high.
 The most recent federal election, held on October 25, was contested by three na-
 tional and several regional parties. Led by Jean Chretien, the opposition Liberal
 Party emerged victorious with a substantial parliamentary majority.
 Debate on such fundamental matters as constitutional change and provincial se-
 cession from Canada qre open and routine.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Canada has a wide variety of private human rights organizations which operate
 freely. The Canadian Human Rights Commission and its provincial counterparts in-
 vestigate and seek to resolve complaints of discrimination and abuses of civil rights
 in public and private cases.
 Canada has a good record of cooperation with outside investigations of alleged
 human rights abuses. In 1990 the Government allowed international monitoring of
 a standoff between police and natives near Montreal.
 In 1993 the United Nations Human Rights Committee declared that Quebec's
 French-only sign law violated freedom of expression. The Government of Quebec al-
 tered the law to allow for the use of English on commercial signs (in conjunction
 with French).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Food, shelter health care, and education are available to all inhabitants regard-
 less of race, refigion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Article 15 of the
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal benefits and protection of the law
 regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, or mental or
 physical disability. These rights are generally respected in practice, but Canada's
 multicultural society continues to experience some problems of discrimination.
 Non-French speakers in Quebec continued to face difficulties in 1993. With few
 exceptions, Quebec law still requires immigrants to educate their children in
 French. Law 86, which amended the Province's language law in 1993, did not sig-
 nificantly broaden access to English-language schooling. The Province argues that
 the education and sign laws protect French language and culture, but those who
 prefer English resent these restrictions. Because of the atmosphere engendered by
 the language laws and a perceived lack of economic opportunity in Quebec for those
 whose mother tongue is not French, many young English-speakers born there have
 left the Province.
 Women.-Federal and provincial governments, the private sector, and women's
 groups have been effective in keeping the issue of family violence, and in particular,
 violence against women in the forefront of Canada's social agenda. On July 29 the
 Canadian Panel on Viojence Against Women published an extensive study on the
 issue and a list of 494 recommendations, which were under review by the Govern-
 ment at year's end. The report's survey figures, which are the subject of dispute
 among social scientists, indicated that over 50 percent of women surveyed had expe-
 rienced a rape or attempted rape.
 Federal and provincial governments and nongovernmental organizations have at-
 tempted to address the problem of family violence by funding various educational
 and preventive programs. The press has given wide coverage to studies of spousal
 violence against women. Television advertisements and publicity campaigns have
 targeted the abuse of women and children within families. Police forces have taken
 a greater interest in the handling of incidents of conjugal violence.
 
 
 828
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions. Despite recent gains, government reports show that women generally earn
 less on average than men in the same occupational group. Ontario law now requires
 all employers (public and private) with more than 10 workers to provide equal pay
 to men and women for work requiring comparable skill. In the fall of 1993, the On-
 tario Government advertised a government job as being open only to members of
 designated disadvantaged groups. Public outrage forced the government to withdraw
 the advertisement. A December 1993 Gallup poll indicated that 74 percent of Cana-
 dians oppose such overt government employment equity programs, but the govern-
 ment of Ontario has reiterated its belief in the principles of employment equity. The
 municipality of Toronto recently provided significant compensation to government
 employees working in occupations traditionally staffed by women, acknowledging
 that such positions have in the past paid less than "traditionally male" occupations.
 Women enjoy marriage and property rights equal to men.
 Children.-Federal and provincial regulations seek to protect children from abuse,
 overwork, and discrimination. Parents receive tax credits for their children.
 Indigenous people.-Canada's treatment of its native peoples is probably the most
 important human rights issue facing the country. Old disputes between the Cana-
 dian and provincial governments on the one hand and Aboriginals on the other once
 again led to civil disobedience and confrontation. Although there were no major inci-
 dents in 1993, unresolved land claims resulted in violence and credible allegations
 of human rights abuses in the past. Disputes over treaty rights, taxation, duty-free
 imports, fishing rights, and alleged harassment by police added to tension on many
 reserves.
 In 1993 Canada made some progress on resolving land-claim issues in sparsely
 populated regions. The most notable step taken was parliamenta  aproval for the
 Nunavut Land-Claims Agreement. This act settled a dispute with the Inuit of the
 Eastern Arctic and created a new territory (scheduled to be established by 1999) in
 which a majority of the population is to consist of Aboriginals.
 Aboriginals remained underrepresented in the work force. Statistics Canada re-
 ported that 25 percent of all Abriginals were unemployed, nearly 15 percentage
 points higher than the national average. Aboriginals also earned less on average
 than their non-Indian counterparts. Almost 42 percent of all Aboriginals living on
 reserves were dependent upon welfare.
 In 1992 Canadians (including a majority of Aboriginals) rejected a constitutional
 reform package which, among other provisions, addressed outstanding native con-
 cerns and recognized an inherent Aboriginal right to self-government within Can-
 ada. Although the referendum debate increased awareness of native issues, there
 was little progress towards addressing native problems after the defeat of the con-
 stitutional re orms.
 Canadians were shocked by film footage of substance abuse by native children in
 the town of Davis Inlet. Public reaction to this focused attention on the problems
 of Aboriginal children.
 The Royal Aboriginal Commission, established in 1991, continued hearings to ex-
 amine Aboriginal concerns, including self-government, land claims, and native jus-
 tice. The Commission is expected to issue a report in 1994.
 National Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Racial discrimination is prohibited by fed-
 eral law and offenders are prosecuted. Nevertheless, isolated incidents of racist-in-
 spired discrimination and violence persisted.
 People with Disabilities.-The Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Human
 Rights Act explicitly prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. Recent
 attempts to provide better employment opportunities to the disabled have not been
 entirely successful; disabled persons remain underrepresented in the work force.
 In the 1993 elections Canada made notable improvements in its services and fa-
 cilities for voters with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Canada
 Labour Code, which covers all employees under federal jurisdiction, protects these
 rights at the federal level, while provincial labor legislation protects all other orga-
 nized workers. Trade unions are independent of the Government and may affiliate
 freely with international organizations. About 38 percent of Canada's non-
 agricultural work force is organized into trade unions. All worker rights protected
 in law are respected in practice. The Canadian Labor Congress (CLC), the largest
 of the country's labor federations, is a member of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions. Slightly more than one-third of CLC member unions are also
 
 
 829
 affiliates of American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
 unions.
 Workers have the right to strike, with the exception of certain groups of essential
 public sector employees. In response to complaints by these workers, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) asked the Government in 1992 to establish a pro-
 cedure to resolve labor disputes when negotiations resulted in a deadlock. The Gov-
 ernment reported developments in some of these cases to the ILO in 1993.
 Laws and regulations prohibiting retribution against strikers and union leaders
 are effectively enforced.
 In response to complaints from a group of professional employees of the Govern-
 ment, the ILO requested that the Government exercise care in defining employees
 as "managerial." The employees believed that they were being denied fair access to
 collective representation. At year's end, the Government was preparing a response
 on the issue.
 In the first 11 months of 1993, there were 21 major work stoppages (involving 500
 or more employees), only 2 of which were illegal work stoppages. As of November,
 there were four unresolved labor disputes; the remainder were settled through di-
 rect bargaining, mediation, or (in the case of British Columbia railway workers) by
 a government back-to-work order.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 (with some exceptions for police) and private sectors have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is protected by law and freely practiced,
 though some essential public sector employees have limited collective bargaining
 rights which vary from province to province. Antiunion discrimination is banned by
 law, and there are effective mechanisms for resolving complaints and seeking re-
 dress. Employers found to have practiced antiunion discrimination are required to
 reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 Canada has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal and not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor legislation varies from
 province to province. The Government generally prohibits youth under 17 years of
 age from working for the Government while school is in session. In most cases, prov-
 inces prohibit those under age 15 or 16 from working without parental consent,
 working in any hazardous employment, or working at night. These prohibitions are
 effectively enforced through inspections conducted by the federal and provincial
 labor ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are established in both fed-
 eral and provincial jurisdictions. The federal minimum wage, which has remained
 at $3.04 (Canadian $4.00) since 1986, applies to employees in industries under fed-
 eral jurisdiction (i.e., about 8 percent of the entire work force). All provinces and
 territories have minimum wage rates which are higher than those at the federal
 level. At the federal level, minimum wage rates are established by ministerial order
 and enforced by the Department of Labor. Provincially, the rates are enforced by
 the labor wage boards or other labor boards. Three provinces (Ontario, Alberta, and
 British Columbia) and the Northwest Territories have lower minimum wage rates
 for youths and students, while Nova Scotia sets a lower wage for "inexperienced
 workers." In all other provinces and territories, youth and students are entitled to
 the same minimum wage as adults. Less than 1 percent of workers covered by the
 federal minimum wage are paid at the minimum rate, while approximately 5 per-
 cent of workers governed by provincial minimum wages receive the minimum rate.
 A family with only one member employed and working at minimum wages would
 be below the poverty level.
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all limit the standard work-
 week to 40 or 48 hours. The Employment Standards legislation provides at least 1
 full day of rest per week.
 The Government establishes health and safety standards for the approximately 8
 percent of workers covered by federal labor legislation. Provincial and territorial leg-
 islation provides for health and safety standards for other workers. Federal, provin-
 cial, and territorial labor departments enforce these standards through inspections.
 Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reason-
 able cause" to refuse dangerous work and to file complaints about such conditions.
