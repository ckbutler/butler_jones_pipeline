 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention of 1974, following
 a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since 1974 the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. The northern
 part is ruled by a Turkish Cpriot administration. In 1983 that administration pro-
 claimed itself the 'Turkish %public of Northern Cyprus" ('rRNC"), which is recog-
 nized only by Turkey. Substantial numbers of Turkish troops remain on the island.
 In both the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community
 there is a generally strong regard for democratic principles. Glafcos Clerides was
 elected President of the Republic of Cyprus in 1993; in April Turkish Cypriots re-
 elected Rauf Denktah as their leader.
 Police in the government-controlled areas and in the Turkish Cypriot community
 are responsible for law enforcement. Police forces operating in the government-con-
 trolled areas are under civilian control, while Turkish Cypriot police forces are di-
 rected by military authorities. In general, the police forces of both sides respect the
 rule of law, but there were occasional instances of abuses by the Republic of Cyprus
 police.
 Both Cypriot economies operate on the basis of free market principles, although
 in both communities there are significant administrative controls. The government-
 controlled part of the island has a robust, service-oriented economy, with declining
 agriculture and manufacturing sectors. Growth in the government-controlled econ-
 omy is expected to be 4.0 percent. Tourism generates 22 percent of the gross domes-
 tic product (GDP) and employs 26 percent of the labor force. In 1994 per capita in-
 come on the Greek Cypriot side was $11,350, inflation less than 5 percent, and un-
 employment 2.7 percent. The Turkish Cypriot economy, which reli.a3 heavily on sub-
 sidies from Turkey, is burdened by an overly large public sector. It is basically serv-
 ice oriented, as in the south, but has a relatively smaller tourism base and a larger
 agricultural sector. Per capita income in the north was less than $3,000 in 1994,
 a 20 percent decline over 1993 as GDP fell by over 4 percent. Inflation reached 212
 percent in 1994 as a result of the drastic devaluation of the Turkish lira. Inflation
 is forecast to drop to about 80 percent in 1995, and real growth is expected to be
 positive, at about 2 percent. Significant problems in the Turkish Cypriot economy
 also included widespread power outages which began in mid-1994 and continued
 until late April.
 The Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities generally respect
 human rights norms and practices. However, police brutality and discrimination and
 violence against women continue to be problems.
 Although the Turkish Cypriot authorities took positive steps to improve the condi-
 tions of Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the territory under their control,
 the treatment of these groups still falls short of Turkish Cypriot obligations under
 the Vienna III agreement of 1975. The Turkish Cypriot authorities continued to im-
 pose significant restrictions on meetings between members of the two communities.
 Greek Cypriot women are denied the right to pass citizenship to their children if
 they are married to foreign spouses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-While political disappearances do not occur in Cyprus, the
 Turkish Cypriot military authorities failed to notify United Nations Forces in Cy-
 prus officials on three occasions that they were holding Greek Cypriots who had
 crossed the buffer zone. In one instance, these authorities denied holding a Greek
 Cypriot national guardsman for 5 days in November after they had seized him.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Both the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and the basic law governing the
 Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture. The law in both commu-
 nities provides for freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 
 
 833
 ment. Respect is generally accorded to these pribitions throughout the island.
 However, in November it was revealed that police in Limassol had, until 1992, used
 "torture chambers" to force confessions from detainees. According to a team compris-
 ing a former Supreme Court justice and prominent attorneys, police hung at least
 11 victims by their feet and applied electric shocks to their genitals. On November
 5, the Government announced it would pay compensation to eight of the victims. On
 November 11, the Council of Ministers announced its intention to fire 12 police offi-
 cers, including the Limassol police chief. The officers involved have maintained their
 innocence and taken legal action to prevent their firing.
 Republic of Cyprus police were also accused of torturing suspected Turkish Cyp-
 riot drug smuggler Er an Egez. Egmez was arrested October 7 along with eight
 Greek Cypriots. Charges were dropped against the eight. Egmez appears to have
 been seriously beaten in the period during and after his arrest and eventualy re-
 quired 10 days of hospitalization. According to some eyewitnesses, hooded police offi-
 cials continued beating Egmez even as he was being admitted into the hospital. On
 December 1, the Attorney General ordered Egmez2release after anhouncing there
 was insufficient evidence to try the case. The Attorey General has announced that
 the alleged mistreatment by the police will be investigated by the Republic's om-
 budsman.
 A Greek Cypriot mistakenly arrested in 1994 for bank robbery and allegedly beat-
 en by police settled his case pending before the European Court of Justice. The Gov-
 ernment agreed to compensate the individual.
 Parliament failed to pass a proposed bill addressing police brutality; the bill was
 reintroduced in the fall.
 There were no public allegations or media reports of police brutality in the Turk-
 ish Cypriot community, although credible reports indicate that some detainees re-
 ceived harsh treatment at the hands of polie during pretrial detention.
 Prison conditions are generally adate in both communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Thrughout Cyprus, laws providing for
 freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention are respected by the police. Judicially
 issued arrest warrants are required. No one may be detained for more than 1 day
 without referral of the case to the courts for extension of the period of detention.
 Most periods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal
 charges are filed. Attorneys have free access to detainees, and bal is permitted.
 In July Turkish Cypriot police took a prominent religious figure, sheikh Nazim
 Kibrisi, ito custody from a Kyrema mosque after the sheikh criticized the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities for their handling of a large forest fire in late June. The sheikh
 was later released and no charges were filed against him. Turkish Cypriot leader
 Denktash later expressed regret at the incident.
 Exile is specifically prohibited by the Constitution and by the basic law governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community.                                        -
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trias.-Under the Republic's Constitution and the basic
 law governing the Turkish Cypriots, the judiciary is independent of executive or
 military influence Cyprus inherited many elements of its legal system from the Brit-
 ishlegal tradition, including the presumption of innocence, the right to due process,
 and the right of appeal. Throughout Cyprus, fair public trial is provided for - law
 and accorded in practice. Defendants have the right to be present at their trials,
 to be representedhy counsel (at government expense for those who cannot afford
 one), to confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own defense. There are
 no special courts to try security or political offenses.
 On the Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated military zones are
 subject to trial in a military court. These courts consist of one military and two civil-
 ian judges and a civilian prosecutor. Defendants in military courts have all the due
 process rights available in civilian courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondenc.-Both
 the Cyprus Constittion andd the basic law governing the Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity iclaue prvis  bins protalnmg  the idvidual againsti artrary interfrence by
 the authorities. A judicial warrant is required for a police official to enter a private
 residence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 by law and are freely practiced throughout the island. The prliferation of party and
 indepenent newspapers and periodicals in both communities enables ideas and ar-
 guments to circulate freely, and opposition papers frequently criticize the authori-
 ties. Several private television and radio stations in the Greek Cypriot community
 compete effectively with the government-contrlled stations. Turkish Cypriot an-
 
 
 thorities retain a monopoly over local radio and television, which tend not to criti-
 cize them. Two small university-run radio stations in Nicosia and Famagusta are
 continuing their operations under a temporary permit. International broadcasts are
 available without interference throughout the island, including telecasts from Tur-
 key and Greece.
 Academic freedom is accorded wide respect throughout the island.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The freedom to associate, orga-
 nize, and hold meetings is protected by law and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. Although mis-
 sionaries have the legal right to proselytize in both communities, missionary activi-
 ties are closely monitored by the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church and by both Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities.
 Both Turkish Cypriots residing in the southern part of the island and non-Mus-
 lims in the north are allowed to practice their religion. However, Greek Cypriots
 resident in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area face significant restrictions on their
 right to visit an important pilgrimage site in the Karpass, the Apostolos Andreas
 monastery, and a shortage of priests, despite guarantees in both these regards
 under the 1975 Vienna Il agreement. There was some easing of access to Apostolos
 Andreas in 1995: in August a group of expatriate Greek Cypriots and American con-
 gressmen visited the monastery. A group of 70 Greek Cypriots resident in the gov-
 ernment-controlled area visited Apostolos Andreas in November. Also in November,
 the Turkish Cypriot authorities announced that Greek Cypriots resident in the
 north would be allowed to visit the monastery on religious holidays.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pat-iation.-Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy freedom of movement with-
 in their respective areas. Despite some liberalization in 1995, Turkish Cypriot au-
 thorities continue regularly to deny permission for travel by Turkish Cypriots into
 the government-controlled areas. Turkish Cypriots who apply for permission to visit
 the south are required to justify their applications with formal invitations to events
 arranged by individuals or organizations resident in the Greek Cypriot community.
 Many of these applications are denied, often without an official reason, although the
 basis for most denials is clearly political and related to the state of intercommunal
 relations.
 Turkish Cypriot authorities usually grant the applications of Greek Cypriot resi-
 dents in the north to visit the government-controlled area. The right to visit the
 south was expanded in July to allow monthly visits of 5 days per visit. In November
 this right was further extended to 15 days per month (previous rules allowed only
 quarterly visits of 7 days per visit). Turkish Cypriot authorities began as well to
 allow monthly visits of a day for close relatives of Greek Cypriots living in the
 Karpass. However, implementation of the new regulations has been inconsistent.
 The applicants must return within the designated period or risk losing their right
 to return and their property, although this rule is rarely enforced in practice. Also
 under the new regulations, Turkish Criot authorities allow monthly visits by close
 relatives of Greek Cypriots resident in the north and, as in the past, permit school
 holiday visits by children under the ages of 16 (male) and 18 (female) residing in
 the government-controlled area. Turkish Cypriot authorities apply generally similar
 but slightly looser restrictions to visits by Maronite residents of the north to the
 government-controlled area and visits by Maronites living in the south to Maronite
 villages in the north.
 Previously, persons of Greek Cypriot or Armenian origin, or even persons having
 Greek or Armenian names, faced considerable difficulties entering the north. In the
 summer, the Turkish Cypriots instituted a new policy under which third country na-
 tionals of Greek Cypriot origin would be permitted to visit the Turkish Cypriot-con-
 trolled areas. Under the new regulation, several groups of Americans of Greek Cyp-
 riot origin visited the north during the summer and fall. During the same period,
 however, implementation of the new procedures was inconsistent, and several per-
 sons entitled to cross under the new guidelines were denied permission without ap-
 parent cause.
 The Turkish Cypriot authorities also stated that Greek Cypriots living in the
 areas under their control would no longer require police permits for travel to
 Famagusta or Nicosia. According to the new policy, the areas where travel without
 prior authorization would be permitted will gradually expand. However, members
 of the Maronite community living in the north continued to need permits even to
 visit neighboring villages and are generally denied permission to visit areas in the
 north other than Morphou and Nicosia.
 The Republic of Cyprus authorities permit only day travel by tourists to the
 northern part of the island. They have declared that it is illegal to enter Cyprus
 except at authorized entry points in the south, effectively barring entry into the gov-
 
 
 835
 ernment-controlled area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus from the north. Fol-
 lowing the March 1994 assassination of the director of a Greek Cypriot association
 supporting Kurds in Turkey, the authorities placed significantly tighter controls on
 the movement of Turkish Cypriots to the areas under their control. Institutions and
 individuals spnsoring visits of Turkish Cypriots to the government-controlled areas
 must notify the police in advance and provide them with an exact itinerary.
 In Ma   the European Court of Human Rights ruled that certain reservations
 made by Turkey when it acceded to the European human rights convention were
 invalid. Thus, beginning in September, the Court was scheduled to hear the case
 of a Greek Cypriot woman who alleged that Turkey is responsible for depriving her
 of the use of her lands in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled areas.
 The authorities respect the right to travel abroad and to emigrate. Turkish Cyp-
 riots have difficulty traveling to most countries because travel documents issued by
 the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" are recognized only by Turkey. Most
 Turkish Cypriots resort to utilizing Turkish travel documents instea.
 The Government of Cypru s     not accept third-country refugees for resettlement
 in Cyprus on the grounds that it already has enough responsibilities in caring for
 those displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. All refugee and asylum claim-
 ants are referred to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for consid-
 eration. The Government has been cooperative in extending residency permission to
 those with pending applications and does not generally repatriate claimants to their
 home country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Multiparty political systems exist throughout Cyprus. Under the Republic's Con-
 stittion, political parties compte for popular support actively and without restric-
 tion. Suffrage in universal, and elections are held by secret ballot. Elections for the
 office of President are held every 5 years and for members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives every 5 years or less. The small Maronite, Armenian, and Latin com-
 munities elect non-votig representatives from their respective communities, in ad-
 dition to votin in elections for voting members. However, under the terms of the
 1960 Constitution Turkish yriots may only vote for the position of the Vice Presi-
 dent and for Turkish Cypriot Members of Parliament. As a result, Turkish Cypriots
 living in the government-controlled area may not vote.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body every 5 years or
 less. In April the-Turkish Cypriot voters elected Rauf Denktash in elections deemed
 by observers to be free and fair. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north
 are barred by law from participating in Turkish Cypriot elections. They are eligible
 to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must travel to the south to exercise that right.
 They may also choose their own village officials but those elected are not recogmzed
 by the Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, women face no legal obstacles to participating in the politi-
 cal process. While clearly underrepresented in government, they hold some cabinet-
 level and other senior positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rghts
 There are organizations in both parts of the island that consider themselves
 human rights groups, but they are generally concerned with alleged violations
 against the rights ththeir community's members by the other community. Groups
 with a broad human rights mandate include organizations promoting awareness of
 domestic violence and others concerned with alleged police brutality.
 There are no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups. Rep-
 resentatives of international human rights organizations have access throughout the
 island.
 The United Nations is engaged in resolving the missing persons dilemma which
 remained from the 1974 conflict. Both sides have completed submission of their
 cases to the U.N. Committee on Missing Persons. On October 6, President Clerides
 announced that his side would not be submitting some of the cases included among
 the 1,619 persons claimed to be missing, innce it was clear that some of them were
 in fact dead. Both aides have offered to cooperate with a U.S. effort to determine
 the fates of five American citizens of Greek Cypriot origin who disappeared in the
 1974 conflict.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 LeUilation in both communities provides for protection against discrimination
 based on sex, national, racial or ethnic status, or religion. Whle such laws are gen-
 
 
 erally respected by each community, significant problems remain with the treatment
 of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and, to a lesser extent, with
 the treatment of Turkish Cypriots living in the government-controlled area. Homo-
 sexuality is illegal in Cyprus, and a bill presented to decriminalize such activities
 failed to pass in 1995.
 Women.-There are reports of spousal abuse in the Greek Cypriot community, and
 the problem is believed to be significant. There is little public discussion of domestic
 violence in the Turkish Cypriot community although a women's shelter opened in
 1994. Domestic violence cases are rare in the Turkish Cypriot legal system. In the
 Greek Cypriot community, a law aimed at making spousal abuse easier to report
 and prosecute that was enacted in July 1994 has had little impact because key pro-
 visions remain unfunded and therefore unimplemented. Many suspected cases of do-
 mestic violence do not reach the courts, largely because of family pressure and the
 wife's economic dependence on her husband. An organization formed to address the
 domestic abuse pro lem reports an increasing number of daily calls over its hot line,
 although hard statistics on the number of incidents are not available. Very few
 cases tried in the courts result in convictions.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status as men. While
 legal provisions in both communities requiring equal pay or men and women per-
 forming the same job are effectively enforced, women disproportionately fill lower
 paing jobs.
 In the Greek Cypriot community, women face discrimination that denies them the
 ability to pass on citizenship to their children if they marry foreign spouses. Under
 existing Cypriot law, only a Greek Cypriot male may transmit citizenship to his
 children automatically or obtain expeditious naturalization for his foreign spouse.
 In the Turkish Cypriot community, women face discrimination in divorce proceed-
 ings with regard to propert acuired during the marriage.
 Republic of Cyprus law forbis forced prostitution. However, there continue to be
 allegations of forced prostitution in the Greek Cypriot community, generally from
 East Asian or Eastern European night club performers. To date there have been few
 arrests since the women, fearing retaliation by their employers, generally do not
 bring charges. There are also continuing allegations that Cyprus is a transit point
 for trafficking in women. Both government and non-governmental authorities be-
 lieve, however, that this problem abated considerably in 1994 and 1995.
 Reports on mistreatment of maids are frequent in the Greek Cypriot press. These
 reports usually involve allegations that maids, usually from East or South Asia,
 have been forced to work under inhuman circumstances. While these women gen-
 erally receive fair treatment when their cases come before the courts, many women
 do not file charges due to fear of retribution from their employers.
 Children.-Both the Government and the Turkish Cypriot authorities dem-
 onstrate a strong commitment to children's welfare. There is no societal abuse of
 children nor any difference in the health care and educational opportunities
 avialable to boys and girls.
 People With Disabilities.-In the Greek Cypriot community, disabled persons ap-
 plying for a public sector position are entitled to preference if they ave deemed able
 to perform the required duties and their qualifications equal those of other appli-
 cants. In the Turkish Cypriot community, regulations require businesses to employ
 one disabled person for every 25 positions they fill, although enforcement is ineffec-
 tive. Disabled persons do not a ppear to be discriminated against in education and
 the provision of state services. Lislation also mandates that new public buildings
 and tourist facilities provide access for the disabled. The Turkish Cypriot commu-
 nity has not yet enacted legislation to provide for such access.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot administration have constitutional or legal bars against discrimina-
 tion. Nevertheless, Greek Cypriots living in the north are, despite recent improve-
 ments, unable to move about freely (see Section 2.d.) and to change their housing
 at will. Maronites living in the north face a pervasive system of petty restrictions
 on their right of movement and generally lack public services available in most
 other Turkish Cypriot areas. Some Turkish Cypriots living in the government-con-
 trolled area face difficulties in obtaining identification cards and other government
 documents. There are persistent reports of harassment and surveillance by the
 Greek Cypriot police.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except for members of the police and
 military forces, have the legal right to form and join trade unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization. In the government-controlled area, police offi-
 cers also have the right to join associations which have the right to bargain collec-
 
 
 tively, although not to strike. More than 82 percent of the Greek Cypriot work force
 belongs to independent trade unions. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of Turkish
 Cyprot private sector workers and all public sector workers belong to labor unions.
 i he Turkish Cypriot community, union officials have alleged that various firms
 have been successful in establishing "company" organizations and then applying
 pressure on workers to join these unions. Officials of-independent labor unions have
 also accused the Turkish Cypriot authorities of creating rival public sector unions
 to weaken the independent unions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has
 not yet acted on these complaints. There are no complaints outstanding against the
 Government of Cyprus.
 In both communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on public pol-
 icy issues affecting workers and maintain their independence from the authorities.
 Two of the major trade unions, one in each community, are closely affiliated with
 political parties. Both of the remaining major unions are independent.
 All workers have the right to strike, and several strikes, usuallpy of short duration,
 occurred. In the northern part of the island, however, a court ruling from 1978 gives
 employers an unrestricted right to hire replacement workers in the event of a strike,
 effectively limiting the effectiveness of the right to strike. Authorities of both the
 Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities have the power to curtail strikes
 in what they deem to be "essential services," although this right is rarely used.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus are able to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions and confed-
 erations by law are tree to organize and bargain collectively throughout Cyprus.
 This is observed in practice in the government-controlled areas, and most wages and
 benefits are set by freely negotiated collective agreements. However, Greek Cypriot
 collective bargaining agreements are not enforceable under the law. In the rare in-
 stances when such agreements are believed to have been infringed, the Ministry of
 Labor is called in to investigate the claim. If the Ministry is unable to resolve the
 dispute the union may call a strike to support its demands. In practice, however,
 such alleged violations are extremely rare, and there were no reported instances in
 1995. In the Turkish Cypriot community, where inflation exceeded 80 percent over
 the year, wage levels are reviewed twice a year for the private sector and six times
 a year for public sector workers, and a corresponding cost-of-living raise is estab-
 lished. A special commission composed of five representatives each from organized
 labor, employers, and the authorities conducts the review. Union leaders contend
 that private sector employers are able to discourage union activity because enforce-
 ment of labor and occupational safety regulations is sporadic and penalties for
 antiunion practices are minimal. As in the Greek Cypriot community, parties to a
 dispute may request mediation by the authorities.
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca Port and Famagusta, but the laws
 governing working conditions and actual practice are the same as those outside the
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and no instances of it were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In both the Greek Cypriot and
 Turkish Cypriot communities, the minimum age for employment of children in an
 "industrial undertaking" is 16 years. Turkish Cypriots may be employed in appren-
 tice positions at age 15. However, in family-run shops it is common to see younger
 children working. Official labor inspectors effectively enforce the law in both com-
 munities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legislated minimum wage in the Greek
 Cypriot community, which is reviewed every year, is currently about $432 per
 month (216 Cyprus pounds) for shop assistants, practical nurses clerks, hair-
 dressers, and nursery assistants. This amount is insufficient to provide an adequate
 living for a worker and family. All other occupations are covered under collective
 bargaining agreements between trade unions and employers within the same eco-
 nomic sector, and the minimum wages set in these agreements are significantly
 higher than the legislated minimum wage.
 The legislated minimum wage in the Turkish Cypriot area, while subject to fre-
 quent review because of high inflation, is approximately $180 per month (9 million
 Turkish lira) as of mid-1995. This amount is not adequate to support a worker and
 family, although most workers earn more than the minimum wage.
 A significant percentage of the labor force in the north consists of illegal workers,
 mostly from Turkey. According to some estimates, illegal workers constitute as
 much as 25 percent of the total work force in the area under Turkish Cypriot con-
 trol. There are frequent allegations that such workers are subject to mistreatment,
 including nonpayment of wages and threats of deportation.
 
 
 In the Greek Cypriot community, the standard workweek is an average of 392
 hours in the private sector. In the public sector, it is 37 Y2 hours during the winter
 and 35 hours in the summer. In 1992, however, Greek Cypriot unions won conces-
 sions that will reduce the workweek for most blue collar workers by one-half hour
 per year until 1997 when a 38-hour workweek will be in place for most sectors of
 the economy. In the Turkish Cjpriot community, the standard workweek is 38 hours
 in winter and 36 hours in summer. Government labor inspectors effectively enforce
 these laws.
 Greek Cypriot labor union leaders have complained that occupational and safety
 standards lack important safeguards. Factories are typically licensed by municipali-
 ties rather than by the Government, resulting in an uneven application of environ-
 mental and work safeguards. While a proposed bill to harmonize health and safety
 standards with those of the European Union failed to win approval in 1995, it con-
 tinues to receive widespread support and is expected to pass in 1996.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are administered at best sporadically
 in the Turkish Cypriot area. In both areas, a factory inspector processes complaints
 and inspects business in order to ensure that occupational safety laws are observed.
 Turkish Cypriot workers who file complaints do not receive satisfactory legal protec-
 tion and may face dismissal.
