 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a multiethnic,
 federal state comprising six republics, one of which has two
 autonomous provinces. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 (Communist Party) is the only legal political party and is
 described in the Yugoslav Constitution as the country's
 "leading organized ideological and political force." However,
 the recent founding of two political "associations" in the
 Republic of Slovenia indicates a growing trend toward greater
 political pluralism.
 The ideology and practice of Yugoslav communism and workers,
 self-management differ substantially from the centralized
 Soviet model of Communist rule. In the highly decentralized
 system set up by the late President Tito, the locus of power
 resides with Republic and Provincial government and party
 authorities. This system was intended to preserve stability
 among Yugoslavia's contentious ethnic groups, but it has also
 impeded effective leadership at the national level.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic secretaries for internal affairs. The
 armed forces are under Federal jurisdiction.
 In the economic system, workers' self-management theoretically
 provides that the workers run their own enterprises through a
 system of elected workers' councils. However, Republic,
 Provincial, and local political officials exercise
 considerable, and frequently decisive, influence over the
 management of enterprises in areas under their jurisdiction.
 More than 70 percent of housing and nearly 85 percent of
 agricultural land is privately owned, and there is a growing
 number of private enterprises in services and small-scale
 manufacturing, particularly in the Republics of Croatia and
 Slovenia. Amendments to the Federal Constitution adopted in
 late November establish and expand existing ideological
 precedents for increasing reliance on market mechanisms,
 promoting private enterprise and foreign investment, and
 liberalizing private agricultural holdings.
 Political decentralization has led to considerable differences
 among the republics and provinces in their respect for civil
 and political rights. The Republic of Slovenia, for example,
 is decidedly more tolerant than other regions in allowing
 unofficial political groups. In Slovenia, there have been no
 arrests on charges of so-called verbal crimes, such as "hostile
 propaganda," for more than a decade. In other regions of the
 country a more authoritarian climate prevails, and political
 and civil liberties continue to be restricted to varying
 degrees. These include restrictions on freedom of speech,
 press, and assembly, the right to a fair trial, and the right
 of citizens to change their government. Arrests for "hostile
 propaganda" and on similar charges continued at a high rate,
 particularly in Kosovo province, where ethnic Albanians accused
 of "nationalism and separatism" were the primary victims.
 On the other hand, more political issues were openly discussed,
 more public demonstrations were held without interference, and
 public criticism contributed to the resignation or removal
 from office of a number of political leaders. The media have
 also become more active. Particularly noteworthy has been
 their aggressive approacr in exposing corruption among
 political leaders. Well-known dissident Milovan Djilas was
 
 
 1254
 YUGOSLAVIA
 able to speak in public and publish, and debate on the role of
 the League of Communists in Yugoslav political life was
 extensive. A Yugoslav Helsinki Watch group, founded in 1987,
 continued to operate. A human rights committee was established
 in Slovenia as was a human rights forum at the Federal level,
 both under the auspices of the Socialist Alliance of Working
 People of Yugoslavia, the official mass political organization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of prolonged or permanent disappearance were
 reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although both the Yugoslav Constitution and law forbid torture,
 various sources, including former prisoners and Amnesty
 International (AI), report that people are sometimes beaten,
 mistreated, or threatened during pretrial detention, while
 serving sentences, or while being questioned as possible
 witnesses. Reports of such abuses, including occasional deaths
 that result, emerge in the press, as do reports of steps taken
 by authorities to deal with unwarranted use of force. Croatian
 dissident Dobroslav Paraga is still under a conditionally
 suspended sentence imposed in 1987. At that time, he was tried
 because of articles he wrote about abuse he had experienced in
 prison. In December Paraga was denied a passport to attend
 the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights.
 Authorities finally granted his request, but only after Paraga
 staged a 17-day hunger strike.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Yugoslav criminal procedures derive from Napoleonic Law and
 are generally followed in all, including political, cases.
 Arrests are conducted pursuant to warrants, and defendants are
 usually brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest. A
 functioning system of bail generally is not applied in
 political cases. Persons arrested for political reasons are
 usually charged under specific sections of the criminal code,
 and defendants in civilian courts have the right to independent
 counsel. Yugoslav law provides for pretrial detention up to 3
 months, with a possible 3-month extension, which is commonly
 employed, especially in political cases. Access to prisoners
 in pretrial detention by family or legal counsel is sometimes
 restricted, ostensibly to prevent interference with active
 investigations. Persons charged for misdemeanors may be
 summarily tried and sentenced by administrative courts to up
 to 6 months in prison.
 The Federal Criminal Code defines a number of criminal acts
 generally referred to in Yugoslavia as political criminal
 acts. These include such activities as armed rebellion,
 terrorism, and espionage, but also some broad, imprecise
 categories such as: "hostile propaganda"; arousing national,
 
 
 1255
 YUGOSLAVIA
 racial, and religious hatred, dissension, or intolerance; and
 damaging the reputation of Yugoslavia. In addition, the
 different Republican and Provincial criminal codes cover a
 variety of misdemeanors considered political crimes, including
 spreading of false rumors and defaming the peoples and
 nationalities of Yugoslavia.
 Authorities frequently bring charges against those who make
 derogatory or inflammatory ethnic statements or other
 statements considered politically unacceptable. There is a
 wide variation in local practice. Popular rock singer Bora
 Djordjevic won acquittal in Belgrade on a misdemeanor charge
 brought because of a song implicitly critical of Tito, yet was
 charged again when he performed the same song in Montenegro.
 Several months later, the second misdemeanor charge was
 dropped. Oral statements and other forms of personal
 expression, e.g., painting slogans or singing "nationalist"
 songs, may be grounds for criminal prosecution; charges of
 disturbing the peace are sometimes brought in such cases.
 For a number of years, public discussion has been widespread
 about the desirability of eliminating Federal legal provisions
 against so-called verbal crimes, specifically "hostile
 propaganda" (Article 133 of the Federal Criminal Code).
 Article 133 makes it illegal to advocate the overthrow of the
 Socialist self-management system, to promote disunity among
 Yugoslavia's various nationalities or to make malicious or
 untrue statements about sociopolitical conditions in the
 country. In late December, Yugoslav. authorities pardoned 25
 prisoners and paroled two others convicted under one provision
 of Article 133. As A result, they claim that there is no
 longer anyone imprisoned in Yugoslavia solely on the basis of
 that sectiop of Article 133. The Federal Assembly is
 considering proposals to narrow the scope of Article 133, but
 other legal provisions restricting freedom of expression would
 still be on the books.
 Yugoslav law permits the arrest and imprisonment of Yugoslav
 citizens for acts considered criminal offenses under Yugoslav
 law, even when they are committed abroad and are not crimes in
 the country in which they take place. Such cases are often
 based on the expression of views "hostile" to the Yugoslav
 regime or association with anti-Yugoslav emigre groups. Two
 such cases were those of Smajl Halitaj and Syle Krasniqi.
 According to press reports, they were convicted in Kosovo in
 February on "hostile propaganda" charges--Halitaj for
 participating in "hostile" demonstrations in Switzerland, and
 Krasniqi for contact in Switzerland with persons of "hostile
 views." Halitaj was released under a government amnesty
 announced at the end of the year.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Each Republic and Province has its own criminal code and court
 system. Decisions by the highest Republic and Provincial
 courts, their supreme courts, may be appealed to the Federal
 Supreme Court, which to some extent ensures the uniform
 application of law by all courts. The Constitutional Court
 rules on the constitutionality of all laws and regulations.
 Offenses by those in the armed forces or by civilians
 affecting the armed forces are tried in the military court
 system.
 
 
 1256
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public, some political trials are not. Defendants have
 the right to be present at their trials and to have an
 attorney, at public expense if needed. The majority of trials,
 including in political cases, are conducted in accordance with
 Yugoslav legal norms without overt interference by outside
 authorities. There is no question, however, that government or
 party officials can and do influence some political or other
 trials. Some human rights organizations believe that in
 political cases the outcome is predetermined. Other observers,
 including critics of the Government, believe the courts have a
 measure of independence, particularly in determining the
 length and type of sentence, if not innocence or guilt.
 During debate in 1988 over a proposed constitutional amendment
 to remove the "moral-political" suitability test imposed for
 the election of judges of regular courts, considerable
 criticism emerged of this and other conditions (low pay, short
 terms of office, election by the government assembly of the
 community involved) which combine to make judges susceptible
 to political or personal influence.
 While many persons accused of political offenses are able to
 find capable, energetic counsel, government authorities
 sometimes attempt to intimidate or chastise attorneys who take
 political cases.
 In May Yugoslav military authorities arrested three journalists
 of the Slovene youth magazine Mladina (David Tasic, Franci
 Zavrl, and Ivan Jansa) and an Army Warrant Officer (Ivan
 Borstner) on charges of possessing secret military documents.
 Private citizens and leading government officials in Slovenia
 criticized the arrests and subsequent trial. There is
 widespread suspicion that the charges against the four were
 trumped up because they had criticized the Yugoslav military
 and the then Defense Minister in their articles. The Yugoslav
 Constitution allows trial of civilians in military courts in
 criminal cases relating to the defense and national security
 of the country. On that basis, the three civilians, as well
 as the Warrant Officer, were tried by a military court. Tasic
 was sentenced to 5 months in prison, Zavrl and Jansa to 18
 months, and Borstner to 4 years. All were released pending
 appeal, and in October the Military Supreme Court confirmed
 the convictions, increasing Tasic's sentence to 10 months.
 While this trial apparently satisfied Yugoslav legal norms,
 there was widespread criticism within Slovenia and abroad that
 it violated internationally accepted human rights in that
 civilians were tried by a military court, the trial was held
 in secret (ostensibly because classified military documents
 were in question), and the defendants were denied counsel of
 their own choosing (rather, they were adsigned military
 attorneys).
 The precise number of political prisoners in Yugoslavia is
 difficult to determine. Unofficial estimates place the figure
 between 500 and 1,000. Such estimates and official statistics
 often refer only to criminal sentences under Federal law,
 excluding the many sentenced under Republic or Provincial
 laws. In addition, a substantial percentage of those
 classified as political prisoners may be persons who committed
 or advocated acts of violence themselves or were involved in
 organizations which committed or advocated violence aimed at
 destroying the present regime. AI has stated that at least
 200 "prisoners of conscience" were being held in 1987.
 
 
 1257
 YUGOSLAVIA
 According to official statistics, during the first 9 months of
 1988 there were 184 criminal charges brought involving
 "hostile" acts, compared to 283 in 1987. In its 1988 Report
 (covering 1987), AI cited official statistics indicating that
 1,500 ethnic Albanians were charged with political crimes
 between 1981 and October 1987, and a further 6,650 were
 summarily sentenced to up to 6 months in prison for political
 "misdemeanors." Yugoslav authorities state that such
 repressive measures are intended to repel a threat to
 political stability which they believe is posed by Albanian
 "nationalism and separatism."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary interference in private life occurs most often in
 connection with government efforts to monitor opposition or
 dissident activity. Although the judicial system provides
 elaborate procedures to guard against arbitrary searches, these
 safeguards are sometimes ignored. Authorities eavesdrop on
 conversations, read private mail, and tap telephones in some
 cases. Yugoslav citizens are generally free to receive and
 read foreign publications. However, the publications of
 certain Yugoslav emigre groups, particularly those advocating
 the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation or the redrawing of
 its internal political boundaries, are considered hostile in
 themselves, and their importation, possession, or sale is
 illegal.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Yugoslav Constitution and law affirm the freedom
 of speech and press, both law and practice impose significant
 restrictions.
 Arrests and convictions for what are called "verbal crimes"
 (most often on charges involving "nationalism" or "hostile
 propaganda") continued in Kosovo Province and in Macedonia at
 a significant level. For example, in Kosovo, Lema Bitiqi was
 sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment. In September 42 men and
 women from 10 Kosovo towns were arrested on charges of
 "hostile propaganda" and "spreading nationalist hatred";
 charges of associating for "hostile purposes" apparently were
 also brought in some of the cases. Elsewhere, in separate
 trials, a military court in Sarajevo sentenced soldiers Tomo
 Bogataj and Kosta Jolic to prison terms of I year and 8 months,
 respectively (the latter sentence subsequently was increased
 to 1 year), on "hostile propaganda" charges. Both were
 released under a government amnesty announced at the end of
 the year. In Vojvodina province, ethnic Hungarian writer
 Korolj Vicai was sentenced to 2 1/2 years' imprisonment. The
 Vojvodina Supreme Court annulled that sentence and returned
 the case to a lower court for retrial. Slovenia, with no such
 arrests in more than a decade, was the exception.
 Despite continuing arrests, press autonomy has increased
 markedly in recent years in some parts of Yugoslavia, and the
 media now discuss freely a wide range of political and social
 topics. Criticism by the media and in academic and quasi-
 official public forums concerning domestic political and
 economic issues is frequent and sharp, and there is extensive
 direct criticism of the Federal Cabinet and of the Communist
 party at all levels. The media in a given Republic or Province
 
 
 1258
 YUGOSLAVIA
 will often criticize the politicians or policies of another
 but less often their own. The latitude for commentary is
 broad, as long as it does not challenge the fundamentals of
 the Socialist self-management system (for example, by
 advocating elimination of the Communist party). Tito's
 leadership and historical role is only beginning to be
 discussed in some parts of the country in other than the
 approved version of his activities. In most parts of
 Yugoslavia, it is still impossible openly to advocate republic
 status for the Autonomous Province of Kosovo. During 1988
 there was lively debate openly challenging the current
 decentralized constitutional arrangements among the republics
 and provinces endorsed by Tito.
 Normally, neither the print nor broadcast media are censored
 prior to dissemination. Government oversight of the media is
 carried out through publication boards, which include ranking
 party officials, and through editorial staffs' use of
 self-censorship. This type of control is incomplete and
 varies from republic to republic. There are also important
 informal channels for official supervision of the press.
 Editors are sometimes told by party officials how to report a
 certain story; if a story displeases a senior official, he may
 well complain to the editors, although not always with the
 immediate results desired. Moreover, editors are named
 through Socialist Alliance channels, so if their work
 displeases the hierarchy, they may have difficulty in their
 choice of future employment. At times, press criticism sparks
 government or party charges of irresponsibility and may result
 in the transfer of editors and journalists from one
 publication to another, in temporizing editorial policies, or,
 infrequently, in party discipline. About 80 percent of
 Yugoslav journalists are Communist party members.
 Public prosecutors have the power to ban the publication and
 sale of books or periodicals if judicial authorities hold that
 the content is, for example, "false" or could "disturb" the
 public. Banning publications is often a local option, and
 standards of what is acceptable vary throughout Yugoslavia.
 In book publishing, the authorities generally provide only
 loose political oversight. Police and prosecutors rarely
 intervene. The works of Soviet and other Eastern European
 dissidents are published in large press runs and sold widely.
 Although works by some authors, such as Milovan Djilas, have
 long been banned, in the spring of 1988 a short story by Djilas
 was carried by Knjizevne Novine, the publication of the Serbian
 Writers' Association, the first time any work by Djilas had
 appeared in the Yugoslav media since his fall from grace in
 1954. Later, his book "Njegos," a biography of the last Prince
 of Montenegro, was published. Some controversial authors are
 using a growing number of private publishing firms to print
 their works.
 In 1988, as the limits of official tolerance were again put to
 the test, certain publications were banned, including a
 Belgrade supplement to an edition of Katedra (student
 newspaper of the University of Maribor, Slovenia), because of
 writing and pictures critical of Serbia and the Serbian
 leadership; an issue of the Zagreb University paper Studenski
 List; an issue of a Split, Croatia, newspaper, because of an
 article critical of local politicians; and two books
 (collections of articles) by dissident Vojislav Seselj.
 During the summer, an issue of Knjizevne Novine was banned
 because it linked Tito to abuses at the former Goli Otok
 
 
 1259
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Prison Island, where Yugoslav Cominformists and other
 political opponents were incarcerated from 1949 to the 1980's.
 Infrequently, the importation and distribution of a particular
 issue of a foreign publication are banned, usually because of
 information about the regime which authorities consider false
 or hostile. There were two such known cases in 1988.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are permitted only by official
 organizations and generally only in support of government
 policies. Others may be suppressed. Public gatherings and
 meetings of private organizations are permitted but must be
 registered beforehand with the authorities. In 1988 there
 were countless instances of officially encouraged protest
 rallies and mass demonstrations throughout Serbia and in
 Montenegro, related to events in ethnically troubled Kosovo
 Province and Serbia's campaign for greater influence in both
 Autonomous Provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. Most passed
 without incident. However, during an October 6 demonstration
 in the Vojvodina capital Novi Sad, which led to the resignation
 of the provincial party leadership, many people were reportedly
 injured, including several policemen. Several injuries also
 resulted in October when police used force to break up a
 demonstration by workers in Montenegro, when the demonstrators
 began chanting slogans challenging the Yugoslav constitutional
 system. A peaceful march by workers attempting to join the
 protestors was broken up by police using cattle prods and tear
 gas.
 Large-scale rallies also were held peacefully in Slovenia, in
 support of the four Slovenes being tried by a military court.
 Demonstrations by ethnic Albanians in support of provincial
 party leaders in Kosovo in November also passed without
 incident. In contrast, a protest by ethnic Albanian high
 school students in Kumanovo, Macedonia, ended in violence when
 police ordered the demonstrators to disperse. Some 33
 demonstrators were sentenced for up to 60 days, imprisonment
 for disrupting public order. Following a similar demonstration
 in Gostivar, Macedonia, eight ethnic Albanians were sentenced
 to prison terms ranging from 4 to 11 years. Notwithstanding
 these incidents of violence and differing interpretations by
 authorities at various levels of what constitutes a threat to
 the public and constitutional order, the recent public
 gatherings reflect a growing popular desire among Yugoslavia's
 various ethnic groups for greater participation in the
 political process.
 A new grass roots political organization, the League of
 Peasants of Slovenia, was formed in May, opting to operate
 within the framework of the Slovene Socialist Alliance. The
 Socialist Youth Alliance of Slovenia and the Slovene Youth
 Press continue actively to promote public debate on issues
 such as nuclear energy, civilian alternatives to military
 service, and political reform. In September the Slovene Youth
 Alliance hosted an international Conscientious Objectors,
 Conference.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religious practice is provided for in the Yugoslav
 Constitution. The Constitution also, however, proscribes -
 
 
 1260
 YUGOSLAVIA
 "abuse" of religion and religious activities for political
 purposes, and the Yugoslav regime officially encourages
 atheism. In practice, restrictions on religious freedoms vary
 greatly from republic to republic, depending in part on the
 political and historical role of the various religions. The
 largest faiths in Yugoslavia are Serbian Orthodox, Roman
 Catholic, and Islamic. Since World War II, the Jewish
 community has numbered fewer than 10,000, but it is active and
 well organized. There is a small Protestant community which
 includes fundamentalist denominations.
 Religious believers are not subject to overt persecution, but
 open practice of one's faith is normally a disqualification
 for high positiQns in government and business. A party member
 who takes part publicly in the sacraments of his or her church
 risks disciplinary action or expulsion from the party.
 Constraints on occasiona.l attendance at services and the
 religious instruction of children vary from region to region.
 Prisoners and active duty military personnel are not allowed
 to be visited by clergy or to attend religious services,
 except in Slovenia, where regulations were issued in 1988
 providing for visits of priests and other religious counselors
 to prisoners. Yugoslav law does not provide for conscientious
 objection to military service for any reason. Religious
 conscientious objectors sometimes have been required to serve
 more than one prison term for refusal to do their compulsory
 military duty.
 Conflicts between the State and religious communities may
 develop if the latter engage in what authorities consider
 "nationalist" or political activities. In the past,
 authorities frequently criticized the Catholic Church in
 Croatia for alleged support of Croatian nationalism, and the
 Serbian Orthodox Church similarly for Serbian nationalism.
 For some time now, however, Croatia and Slovenia have been
 relatively tolerant of the practice of the Catholic faith.
 During 1988 relations between the Serbian Orthodox Church and
 the Serbian party improved dramatically, due to a coincidence
 of religious and political interest in promoting Serbian
 cultural and historical self-awareness. Authorities in
 Macedonia charged that some members of the Islamic community
 encourage "Albanian nationalism and separatism." These
 charges were denied by Islamic leaders. Religious
 proselytizing is forbidden.
 The religious communities have vigorous publishing programs,
 although they do not have their own printing facilities.
 Their publications are normally sold only through subscription
 or at places of worship. During 1988 religious newspapers
 became more politically oriented, and government officials
 began to indulge in polemics with them. For example, the
 Serbian Orthodox Church newspaper advocated instruction on
 religious themes in public schools, which engendered public
 debate. The official press published more on religious
 themes, such as the apparitions at Medjugorje and the
 construction of the St. Sava Church in Belgrade, as well as on
 church-state issues. Bibles and Korans are readily available.
 Contacts with coreligionists abroad are extensive and
 generally unhindered. However, Yugoslav authorities regard
 ties between Yugoslav Muslims and Islamic fundamentalist
 groups abroad with suspicion.
 The construction of new places of worship requires the consent
 of local government authorities which sometimes present
 
 
 1261
 YUGOSLAVIA
 bureaucratic obstacles. Some religions also receive
 preferential treatment in areas where they are dominant. For
 example, construction is continuing on the monumental Serbian
 Orthodox church, St. Sava, in Belgrade. Local authorities
 have facilitated publicity and fund-raising efforts, and are
 to landscape the area surrounding the church. A new Roman
 Catholic cathedral was consecrated in Belgrade in 1988, after
 permission was granted in 1982. The Islamic community in
 Belgrade, however, has had an application pending to build a
 new mosque for many years. In the Banat region of Vojvodina
 Province, authorities reportedly have denied permission for
 the construction of any religious edifice since World War II.
 Primary education outside the state system is not permitted in
 Yugoslavia. There are some opportunities for religious
 education at the secondary and university level for all major
 faiths. The Catholic Church, for example, maintains eight
 secondary schools (about 100 pupils eachl, two theological
 faculties, and five seminaries in Croatia and Slovenia. The
 Serbian Orthodox Church has four high schools and a single
 theological faculty. The Yugoslav Islamic association runs
 three high schools in the Muslim areas of the country and one
 Islamic theological faculty in Sarajevo. The degrees offered
 by these institutions are not officially recognized by the
 Yugoslav authorities. Yugoslav religious communities also
 make vigorous efforts to provide religious instruction outside
 of school for children and young people.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is provided for by the
 Constitution and permitted in practice. Pasaports for foreign
 travel are routinely available, and half of the country's
 population possesses them. NO exit permits are required to
 visit the more than 135 countries with which Yugoslavia has
 diplomatic or consular relations. A very small number of
 Yugoslavs are denied passports either temporarily or
 permanently on national security, political, or criminal
 grounds. Well-known dissident Milovan Djilas was issued a
 passport in 1987 for the first time since 1970 and has
 traveled outside of the country numerous times. Approximately
 600,000 Yugoslav workers, some with family members, are
 employed as "guest workers" in Western Europe.
 The law on the entry of foreigners into Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. Yugoslavia extends
 temporary asylum to refugees who, with the assistance of the
 Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), seek permanent resettlement in third
 countries. As of October 1988, there were about 810 such
 refugees in Yugoslavia. Since 1984 there have been no known
 cases in which a refugee under UNHCR protection was forcibly
 repatriated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Yugoslav citizens do not have the right to change the system
 of government. The 2-million-member League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia maintains a monopoly on political power, although
 the development of numerous autonomous "associations" in
 Slovenia reflect a trend toward greater political pluralism.
 The party's authority at the Federal level is greatly
 
 
 1262
 YUGOSLAVIA
 dispersed and diluted because of the decentralization of
 decisionmaking power to the parties in the six republics and
 two provinces. As Yugoslav politicians and the press regularly
 note, the country's eight regional party organizations hold
 widely differing views on key political and economic issues,
 and this has made it difficult for the Federal Government to
 take decisive action. With few exceptions, no major
 initiatives, including constitutional amendments, may be
 adopted by the Federal Government without the unanimous
 consent of the republics and provinces. Extensive press and
 television coverage is often given to high-level party
 meetings, including the broadcast of lengthy portions of
 debate and the act of voting.
 Governmental bodies are responsible for administering and
 drawing up specific policies, especially economic policies.
 At the top of the government structure are the collective
 State Presidency (Chief of State), the Federal Executive
 Council (Cabinet), and the Federal Assembly (Parliament). The
 Presidency is responsible for overall policy direction. The
 Federal Executive Council, headed by the Prime Minister, is
 responsible for running the governmental machinery and
 proposing specific legislation. For government offices, there
 are terms of 1 to 5 years, with the possibility of extension
 for one additional term in many cases.
 The Federal Assembly is responsible for enacting legislation.
 It operates sometimes by majority vote and sometimes by
 consensus among delegations representing the country's eight
 federal units. According to research reported in February, of
 the 1,248 delegates elected to the Federal Assembly in the
 1974-1986 period, all but 0.48 percent were members of the
 League of Communists. Nevertheless, the Assembly has been
 active and contentious in recent years and has several times
 rejected or drastically altered proposals endorsed by the
 Presidency and Cabinet. It is often the scene of sharp
 debates, which generally are fully reported in the media.
 On May 15, for the first time in postwar Yugoslavia, the
 Federal Assembly took up a vote of confidence in the
 Government. The move was defeated by comfortable margins in
 both Assembly chambers. On December 30, however, the Prime
 Minister and his entire cabinet resigned, also a postwar
 first. The resignation came in the wake of mounting criticism
 from many of parts of the country over the inability- of the
 Government to ease the country's deteriorating economic
 situation.
 Federal laws must also be adopted separately by Republic and
 Provincial assemblies before they can-be implemented, so these
 regional assemblies wield considerable power, frequently
 amounting to an actual veto of Federal authority. In certain
 cases, delegates to the Federal Assembly must have authorizing
 instructions from their Republic or Provincial assemblies
 before engaging in negotiation or compromise on Federal
 legislative measures. Members of Communist party bodies are
 selected by the party bodies themselves in ways ranging from
 secret ballot and majority vote to prearranged appointment.
 Members of government bodies are chosen by a delegate system.
 Recently adopted amendments to the Constitution provide for a
 majority of delegates to local, Republic, and Federal
 assemblies to be chosen directly by their constituents through
 secret, multicandidate elections. However, the mass umbrella
 organization, the Socialist Alliance of the Working People,
 will continue to nominate candidates in the various
 
 
 1263
 YUGOSLAVIA
 sociopolitical organizations. This includes the League of
 Communists, the trade unions, the League of Socialist Youth,
 and the Union of Veterans. At the local level, ordinary
 workers can and do play an active role in the selection
 process.
 In 1988 elements of a Western-style election campaign emerged
 in the race for Slovene Republic President, with seven
 candidates in the field at the outset. In other government
 and party elections in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-
 Hercegovina, multiple candidates were nominated for most
 posts. Yugoslavia's ethnic groups generally have equal access
 to political positions, especially through their respective
 Republics and Provinces. Many senior executive government and
 party positions rotate periodically from one nationality to
 another according to a predetermined ethnic "key."
 Political pressure, in the form of mass demonstrations
 supported by the Serbian party leadership, was responsible for
 the collective resignation of the Vojvodina province party
 leadership in October and contributed to government and party
 changes in Montenegro and Kosovo later in the fall.
 From 1982-1986,the Federal Prime Minister was a woman. Two
 members of the Cabinet from 1986 to 1988 were women. Women
 make up about 12 percent of the membership of the Central
 Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. While
 full and unimpeded opportunities for women are mandated by
 law, they are underrepresented at higher levels, reflecting
 longstanding social attitudes and customs. There are still
 allegations that women cannot participate fully in government
 and political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government has critized Western charges of
 human rights violations within Yugoslavia as impermissible
 interference in Yugoslav internal affairs and as efforts to
 bring pressure on Yugoslavia to alter its social, economic, or
 political system. In recent years, the Government has been
 somewhat more willing to discuss human rights problems with
 outside organizations. In 1988 Belgrade accorded unusually
 prominent attention to Human Rights Day and the 40th
 anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The
 Socialist Alliance has established a Human Rights Forum
 intended in part to defend Yugoslavia's human rights record
 but also to monitor domestic human rights trends and foster
 understanding of Yugoslavia's international commitments to
 human rights. In Slovenia, a Committee for the Defense of
 Human Rights was formed within the Slovene Socialist Alliance
 in response to the controversial military trial of four
 Slovenes, and it was active in mobilizing support for the
 defendants in Slovenia.
 A Helsinki Watch Group was formed in 1987 by private Yugoslav
 human rights activists. In the spring of 1988, it hosted a
 meeting in Belgrade of the International Helsinki Watch
 executive board, an event which received limited press
 attention. A chapter of AI was reportedly formed in December
 in the Slovene town of Kranj, the first of its kind in
 Yugoslavia. The loosely organized Committee for the Defense
 of Freedom of Thought and Expression continues to operate, but
 any coverage it may receive in the media generally tends to be
 
 
 1264
 YUGOSLAVIA
 critical. Its members visibly participated in the debate on
 constitutional reform, and the Committee sparked considerable
 controversy and sharp party criticism at midyear as a result
 of its proposal to reevaluate President Tito's influence on
 Yugoslavia's development.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Government is officially opposed to
 racial discrimination. Despite government efforts, however,
 some social prejudice continues to exist, particularly with
 regard to ethnic Albanians, who constitute 8 percent of
 Yugoslavia's current population, and Gypsies. On the other
 hand, the Serbian minority in the Autonomous Province of
 Kosovo has complained sharply of physical mistreatment and
 discriminatory practices on the part of the Albanian majority
 there (about 90 percent of Kosovo's population). These
 complaints helped spark a series of mass rallies in Serbia and
 Montenegro during the summer and fall aimed at gaining
 increased Serbian control over both Kosovo and Vojvodina
 provinces. The Serbian party leadership pressed for
 amendments to the Serbian constitution that would increase
 Serbian police and judicial powers in the two provinces. A
 final rally in Belgrade on November 19 attracted up to a
 million people.
 Ethnic Albanians, for their part, are concerned about
 anti-Albanian sentiment in the country as a whole. They
 particularly fear the possible loss of their political and
 cultural autonomy in Kosovo as well as increasing
 discrimination in Macedonia.
 The Government has taken steps to protect the status of
 women. Maternity leave for employed women is very liberal and
 is routinely granted for periods between 9 and 12 months.
 Depending on the republic, working mothers are given day-care
 allowances based on their salaries and the number of children
 to be cared for. Also, a working mother may take sick leave
 when her child is ill (up until 2 years after its birth), and
 the father may do so when the mother is ill. The role of
 women in Yugoslavia's work force has slowly improved as a
 result of increased education and urbanization. According to
 statistics for 1986, 38.3 percent of the work force in the
 socially owned sector was composed of women, as opposed to
 34.5 percent in 1974. However, women still hold
 proportionately more low-level, poorly paid positions. The
 Constitution charges government authorities at all levels with
 protection of the cultural rights of all the peoples of
 Yugoslavia.
 The use of the major local language is required in official
 communications between Belgrade and the various republics, and
 local languages are used in the schools, courts, and local
 media. In 1988 ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, whose numbers
 are rapidly growing as a proportion of the total population,
 demanded greater educational opportunities in their mother
 tongue. Macedonian officials, meanwhile, placed restrictions
 on child support payments and child health care for families
 with more than three children. Although not legally
 discriminatory, these restrictions were clearly intended to
 discourage population growth among ethnic Albanians, who tend
 to have large families. Macedonian authorities manipulated
 building code regulations governing the height of walls to
 
 
 1265
 YUGOSLAVIA
 justify the bulldozing of the walls that traditionally
 surround Albanian homes in the Republic.
 Section 6   Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are organized geographically by republic and
 province and by trade within these boundaries. Workers do not
 have the right to form their own trade unions. They are not
 required to join the government-established unions, although
 most do. They elect their own representatives, directly at
 the local level and indirectly at higher levels. At the
 Federal level, the Confederation of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia
 (SSJ) has traditionally supported government policies, while
 pleading that any negative effects on workers be minimized.
 In practice, responding to Yugoslavia's persistent economic
 difficulties, union leaders are becoming more active in
 advocating worker interests on such matters as the impact of
 wage policies and inflation on the standard of living. At the
 republic level, the trade union organization of Slovenia took
 the lead in early 1988 in establishing Yugoslavia's first
 strike code, which instructs local unions to organize strikes
 when workers have no other option for pursuing just demands.
 The same organization in September threatened Yugoslavia's
 first republicwide general strike in seeking changes to wage
 policies that had reduced gross real personal incomes by 21.5
 percent from the previous year.
 In November, through an amendment to the Yugoslav Constitution,
 Yugoslav workers acquired the right to strike, the first time
 this right has been granted constitutionally in a Communist
 state. Instances of police action against strikers are almost
 nonexistent. Disciplinary action by firms against strike
 organizers is rare and in some cases has been successfully
 contested in court by the trade unions. During 1988 the
 Yugoslav trade unions recorded 1,720 strikes (up 2 percent
 over 1987) involving 388,000 workers (up 34 percent over
 1987). A growing number of strikes have involved peaceful
 protest rallies in front of government buildings, including
 the Federal Assembly in Belgrade, at which workers have
 presented their demands directly to politicians.
 Yugoslavia participates in the international labor environment
 through its individual workers abroad and the activities of
 the SSJ. Roughly 1 million Yugoslav workers and dependents
 live in Western Europe, including 700,000 in countries of the
 European Community. The SSJ concentrates its international
 exchanges on neighboring central and Western European
 countries. Its most developed bilateral contacts are with
 trade unions (of all ideological stripes) in Austria, Italy,
 and West Germany. Most of the SSJ's bilateral exchanges are
 at the craft union level.
 The SSJ represents Yugoslav workers at the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). Among international trade union
 organizations, it has good cooperation with the World
 Confederation of Labor and the European Trade Union
 Confederation. The SSJ participates in the Trade Unions
 Advisory Council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
 and Development. The SSJ expects its ties with Western unions
 to grow parallel with the gradual market orientation of the
 Yugoslav economy and the integration in 1992 of the Western
 European market (a process in which Yugoslavia hopes to
 participate at some point). The SSJ, although not a member,
 
 
 1266
 YUGOSLAVIA
 has also begun cooperation with the Soviet-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions at the craft union level.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining in a western sense is not entirely
 applicanle to Yugoslavia, where all lage firms are socially
 rather than privately owned. Under Yugoslavia's law on
 associated labor, workers elect a workers' council (a body
 separate from the trade unions) which has a voice in selecting
 management and must approve by majority vote major (and
 sometimes minor) business decisions, including wage levels, by
 the enterprise. A series of Federal laws in recent years,
 most recently in May 1988, strictly limiting firms' (and hence
 workers') ability to increase wages through these normal
 channels has fueled the increase in strike activity.
 Enterprise managers are increasingly bound by law to more
 Western-style standards of business discipline. During the
 reporting period, Yugoslavia had no economic incentive zones
 or special industries where labor standards differed from
 those elsewhere in the country. This situation may change
 with the introduction of new laws on enterprises and foreign
 investment.
 There are no export processing zones, and labor legislation
 and practice are similar throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There were no reports of the use of forced labor, which is
 prohibited by the Yugoslav Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16 years. Of
 those unemployed in Yugoslavia, 78 percent are under the age
 of 30, and, in practice, young people often must wait a long
 time for their first job.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Yugoslavia has an official 42-hour workweek with generous
 vacation time and sick leave benefits. The republics set
 minimum wage levels, which vary widely in keeping with varied
 levels of economic development and prices. Given Yugoslavia's
 high inflation rate, minimum nominal wage levels are raised
 frequently. The trade unions point out that minimum wages lag
 behind inflation, leaving workers who earn only the minimum at
 or below "the poverty line." The minimum net wage in the
 Republic of Slovenia as of September 1988 was $152 dollars per
 month at the official exchanqe rate. The Republic trade
 unions demanded this figure--which the Government
 accepted--based on its calculation of the minimum wage
 necessary to assure a decent standard of living. Yugoslavia
 has extensive Federal and Republic laws and regulations on
 worker safety, although occasional press reports suggest that
 enforcement is lax.
