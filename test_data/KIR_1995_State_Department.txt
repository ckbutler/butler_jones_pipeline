 KIRIBATI
 Kiribati comprises some 78,400 people occupying 33 small islands widely scattered
 across 3.5 million square kilometers of the central Pacific. The population is pri-
 marily Micronesian, with a significant component of Polynesian origin. Kiribati
 gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a republic
 within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected president and a
 legislative assembly with 39 members elected by universal suffrage and 2 members
 ex officio.
 The main security apparatus is a police force of about 250 personnel, responsible
 to and effectively controlled by civilian authority.
 Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The is-
 lands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and limited arable land,
 severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There
 were no reports of specific human rights abuses, but in the traditional culture
 women have occupied a subordinate role with limited job opportunities.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other ExtraFjudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disapparances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are forbidden
 by the Constitution, corporal punishment is permitted under traditional mores for
 criminal acts and other transgressions. On some outer islands, the island councils
 occasionally order strokes with palm fronds to be administered for public drunken-
 ness and other minor offenses such as petty thievery.
 The authorities strive to meet minimum international standards for prisons but
 have limited financial resources. Food and sanitation are limited. Family members
 and representatives of church groups are allowed access to prisoners. The question
 of monitoring of prison conditions by local human rights gups has not arisen, and
 no policy concerning such monitoring has been formulate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or BExile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair PuLlic Trial.-The judiciary is independent and free of govern-
 mental interference. The right to a fair public trial is provided by law and observed
 in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused jperson be informed of the na-
 ture of the offense for which he is charged and be provided adequate time and facili-
 ties to prepare a defense. The right to confront witnesses, present evidence, and ap-
 peal convictions is enshrined in law. Procedural safeguards are based on English
 common law.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities respect these provisions, and viola-
 tions are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects this right in practice. The radio station
 and the only newspaper are government owned but offer a variety of views. Church-
 es publish newsletters and other periodicals. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assemb4y and Asseciation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group's interests, and the Govern-
 ment does not impose any significant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion-Freedom of religion prevails. There is no state or pre-
 ferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts.
 d. Freedo  of Moverent Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. Kiribati has no refugees or asylum-seekers, and the Government has not
 formulated a policy toward them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by the people in periodic free and open elections. Exec-
 utive authority is exercised by the President, who is elected by the people for a 4-
 year term. No less than three and no more than four presidential candidates are
 nominated by the elected Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the
 Constitution the President is limited to three terms.
 The snap general election of August 1994 saw the formation ofKiribati's frst real
 political party, the Maneaban Ta Mari Party (MTM), as opposition forces united
 to bring down the National Progressive Party (NPP). (The NPP, the  oup which
 had led Kiribati since independence in 1979, has never been organized as a political
 party.) In those elections, the MTM won 19 of the 39 seats (2 more re aex officio),
 and an MTM leader, Teburoro it, was elected President. Tite remains under pres-
 sure from the defeated NPP, which has lodged several judicial actions against ito.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There a   no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to data none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and the Government generally observed this prohibition in practice.
 KiMbati society fundamentally egalitarian, has no privileged chiefly class.
 Women.-Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem in this
 isolated, rural society. Rape is a crime under the law, and the law is enforced when
 charges are brought to court. To the extent that it exists, wife beating is dealt with
 informally and in a traditional way; frequently, communal pressure is brought to
 bear.
 The traditional culture in which males are dominant has been an impediment to
 women taking a mere active role in the economy. This is slowly changing, and more
 women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations. There are als
 signs of affirmative action in government hiring and promotions to redress this cul-
 turally based inequity. A recent example of such affru-mative action is the ap oint-
 ment of Makurita Baaro as the nation's first female Secretary for Forei  Afairs.
 The selection of female participants for overseas training programs in the United
 States, Japan, and other countries also bears out a firm commitment to the ad-
 vancement of women. Women have full and equal access to education.
 Statistics on the participation of women in the work force and on comparative
 wages are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of
 Property.
 Ch'dren.-Within the limited resources of the Government, adequate expendi-
 tures are made for child welfare. If child abuse exists, it is rare and has not become
 a source of societal concern.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence or complaint of discrimination in
 employment, education, or provision of other state services. Accessibility for the dis-
 abled has not been mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. Over 90 percent of the work
 force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but the small wage sector has
 a relatively strong and effective trade union movement. In 1982 the seven trade
 unions registered in Kiribati merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress
 (KTUC). It has approximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector.
 The KTUC is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 The law provides for the right to strike. However, strikes are rare, the last one tak-
 ing place in 1980.
 The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vidd for under the Industrial Relations Code. The government sets wages in the
 large public sector. However, in a few statutory bodies and government-owned com-
 panies, employees may negotiate wages and other conditions. In the private sector
 employees may also negotiate wages with employers. Negotiations are generally
 nonconfrontational, in keeping with Kiribati tradition. There have been no reports
 of antiunion discrimination. However, there are mechanisms for resolving any such
 complaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of children under age 14. Children through age 15 are prohibited from industrial
 employment and employment aboard ships. Labor officers from the Ministry of Com-
 merce, Industry, and Employment normally enforce these laws effectively, given the
 rudimentary conditions of the economy and its industrial relations system. Children
 are rarely employed outside the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement longanding legislation authorizing establishment of minimum wages.
 There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. The Government is the major em-
 ployer in the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers must, for example, provide an adequate supply of clean water for
 workers and ensure the existence of sanitary toilet facilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified personnel. Women may not
 work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in service jobs such
 as hotel clerks).
