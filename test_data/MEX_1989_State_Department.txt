 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been dominated by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since its founding in
 1929. Periodic political reforms have expanded the
 opposition's role and stake in the political system; never
 more so than in the 1988 presidential election year.
 Nevertheless, the PRI has maintained its preponderant
 political control throughout the Republic by a combination of
 voting strength, organizational power, and, the principal
 opposition parties and other observers charge, electoral
 fraud. The 1917 Constitution stipulates that power be divided
 among a bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive.
 The President's powers, however, far outweigh those of the
 other branches in Mexico's highly centralized system.
 The principal law enforcement crganization in Mexico is the
 Federal Judicial Police, which is controlled by the Attorney
 General, The General Directorate of Investigations and
 National Security under the control of the Secretariat of
 Government is responsible for investigations involving
 national security. Despite the tendency toward centralization
 of authority, municipal, state, and Federal police exercise
 authority in their respective areas of jurisdiction. Local
 police forces, often controlled by political bosses and
 landowners, have been involved in human rights abuses, and the
 Federal police have been responsible for deaths of detainees
 in their custody. There is no evidence, however, that these
 abuses are the result of policies favored or directed by the
 Mexican Government.
 Mexico has a mixed economy, which combines elements of
 domestic market capitalism with state ownership of major
 industries. Through a program of divestiture of some
 state-owned firms, principally those operating in
 "nonstrategic" sectors, the Government is increasing the role
 of the private sector in the economy. Notable examples of the
 privatization policy which were announced or implemented in
 1989 include the major airlines and the public telephone
 company.
 A wide range of individual freedoms is provided for by the
 1917 Constitution and honored in practice. Some important
 exceptions, however, continue to be noted. The exceptions
 include abuse by police and judicial authorities of detainees
 and prisoners; political and extrajudicial killings, mostly
 the result of confrontations between peasants and landowners,
 their agents, and local police over disputed land; and
 recurring credible charges by opposition parties, civic
 groups, and outside observers of election fraud. While these
 and other human rights abuses persist, the Government has
 taken several steps to improve the situation, notable among
 them a large-scale amnesty program for persons accused of
 crimes of a "political or social nature," various attempts at
 a national debate on electoral reform, and the establishment
 of a Director General for Human Rights under the Secretary of
 Government.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In Mexico's rural states disputes over land are often violent
 and sometimes result in extrajudicial killings. While the
 Federal Government continues its efforts to curb such
 violence, violations continue nonetheless.
 Paramilitary bands and local police controlled by political
 bosses and landowners are often accused of oppressing and even
 murdering peasant activists. Such charges have been made not
 only by independent peasant organizations, but also by the
 PRI-affiliated National Confederation of Peasants (CNC). The
 independent groups attribute the killings to persons employed
 by local strongmen (caciques), as well as to members of the
 CNC and to the local police. As an example, 11 persons died
 in mid-February in Pijijiapan, Chiapas State, in an apparent
 dispute between the Independent Central of Agricultural
 Workers-and Campesinos (CIOAC) and.CNC-affiliated claimants to
 the same parcel of land; the CIOAC had been a Mexican
 Socialist Party affiliate, while the CNC represents the PRI's
 peasant arm. Press reports bite police involvement in the
 incident, though no police have been charged with any crime.
 State governor Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, as well as CNC
 officials in Mexico City, decried the Pijijiapan violence.
 A CIOAC activist, Sebastian Perez Nunez, was shot to death,
 apparently by -a local Chiapas rancher, on December 29, 1988,
 in apparent retaliation for a CIOAC-led takeover of land. Two
 Mexican Socialist Party (PMS) activists, Santos Cabrera Rosas
 and Elpidio Dominguez Castro,, were also murdered early in
 1989, and four peasant sympathizers of presidential candidate
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas were killed in a confrontation-on January
 22 with state rural police in Xoxocotla, Morelos State,
 following municipal elections. The Federal Government
 continued its ongoing efforts to control this violence, and
 attorneys general from various states met frequently during
 the year with national law enforcement and Secretariat of
 Government officials to pursue this goal.
 A number of apparent assassinations of political activists and
 militants also occurred within the last year. Political
 motives cannot, as yet, be ascribed with certainty to any of
 the killings, though opposition groups assert such was the
 case. In each instance, state judicial officials have
 promised thoroughgoing investigations.
 In otherwise peaceful elections on July 12 for mayors and
 local legislators in the northern state of Durango, the
 candidate of the local Committee for Popular Defense (CDP) for
 mayor of the small town of Simon Bolivar was shot in a
 purported'robbery and left clinically dead in what may
 actually have been a politically motivated crime. PRI special
 delegate Cesar Martinez Bonilla was killed September 21 in
 Nochixtlan, Oaxaca, reportedly by an Authentic Party of the
 Mexican Revolution (PARM) militant.
 Meanwhile, several of 1988's most prominent cases of alleged
 political killings have no apparent solution in sight,
 including those of Cardenas' personal aides Francisco Ovando
 Gil and Roman Gil Heraldez. A suspect has been formally
 
 
 accused in the August 1988 murders of four young Revolutionary
 Workers Party (PRT) activists, but the party itself believes
 that the crime was politically motivated, and that the actual
 murderer is still at large.
 On February 17, a Mexican Federal judge found four defendants
 guilty of abuse of authority and injuries in connection with
 the August 1986 detention and torture of U.S. Drug Enforcement
 Administration (DEA) agent Victor Cortez in Guadalajara.
 Subsequently, the four defendants, all Jalisco state judicial
 police officers, were sentenced to 5 years in prison and fined
 the equivalent of $140. Two additional suspects remain at
 large. In related developments, Rafael Caro Quintero, Ernesto
 Fonseca Carrillo, and others accused of involvement in the
 kidnaping and murder of U.S. drug enforcement administration
 (DEA) agent Enrique Camarena were convicted and sentenced in
 Mexico City on drug trafficking charges, with Caro receiving a
 sentence of 116 years and Fonseca 140 years. Though lengthy,
 the trial has followed normal Mexican judicial procedures.
 On December 23, 1988, prisoners at the Venustiano Carranza
 Center for Social Readaptation in Tepic, Nayarit, rioted.
 Special tactical police teams flown in from Mexico City to
 quell the rebellion responded with excessive force, killing
 21. Among those left dead in the melee were the prison warden
 and the police team commander. Of the 21 fatalities, 13 had
 been filmed by an NBC television camera crew surrendering to
 prison authorities; each of the 13 was later found dead with a
 bullet wound in the head. The press in Guadalajara reported
 extensively on the deaths of two Mexican citizens while in
 detention.
 On December 21, 1988, Antonio Gomez Reyes died as an apparent
 consequence of beatings received after his arrest. He was
 never charged and the circumstances surrounding his arrest
 remained unclear. Jorge Perez Gonzalez died in detention on
 February 8, after allegedly being forced to sign a confession
 of growing marijuana. The Mexican press reported that a
 prisoner drowned in July at the hands of the Nuevo Leon State
 Police. In December the press reported the death of
 19-year-old Fernando Jordan de la Torba in La Paz, Baja
 California Sur. The victim, son of a prominent family, died
 of peritonitis, allegedly after being severely tortured and
 beaten while under detention by the Federal Judicial Police.
 By year's end there was no official investigation in progress,
 and a Federal Deputy for the state charged that high
 government officials were inhibiting legitimate investigations
 into this and other cases.
 b. Disappearance
 According to the Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the
 Persecuted, Disappeared Persons, and Political Exiles of
 Mexico, a prominent human rights organization, there are 552
 disappeared persons in Mexico, an increase of 5 over the
 previous year. The majority of disappearances are cases which
 occurred during the earlier presidential administrations of
 Luis Echeverria Alvarez and Jose Lopez Portillo. The
 Committee believes that a total of 26 persons disappeared
 during the Miguel de la Madrid administration, which ended on
 December 1, 1988.
 One of the five recent disappearances included PRT militant
 Jose Ramon Garcia Gomez, who was purportedly removed from his
 home in Cuautla, Morelos State, on December 16, 1988, by state
 
 
 656
 14XICO
 judicial police agents. There were no traces, at year's end,
 of his whereabouts, and both federal and state investigators
 have been unsuccessful in their respective searches. The
 Committee has also classified Francisco Sahagun Baca as
 disappeared. Sahagun was formerly head of the Federal
 Government's Division of Investigations for the Prevention of
 Delinquency (DIPD) and a purported member of the "White
 Brigades," a group charged with acts of torture,
 disappearance, and assassination during the Government's
 campaign in the 1970's against insurgent guerrillas.
 Reportedly arrested on July 10, 1989, on drug-related charges,
 he has not been heard from since.
 Many human rights activists and opposition politicians were
 very concerned when Miguel Nazar Haro was appointed head of
 the Intelligence Directorate of the Federal District's
 Secretariat of Public Security. In the 1970's, Nazar had been
 head of the Federal Directorate of Security and another
 purported member of the "White Brigades." Like Sahagun, he
 has been charged with direct participation in acts of illegal
 detention, torture, and disappearance. Nazar Haro
 subsequently resigned his DDF position, apparently under
 public pressure.
 c.- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, human
 rights organizations continue to charge that law enforcement
 officials employ psychological and physical abuse, most often
 in the period immediately following arrest and especially
 during interrogation. The Government has stated that the use
 of torture to extract confessions is an illegal and
 unacceptable substitute for investigative work. Accordingly,
 the Administration continued its efforts to recruit new
 personnel into the various police forces and emphasizes
 education and training in legitimate investigative skills.
 The Attorney General's Office has contracted with human rights
 organizations to provide courses designed to sensitize law
 enforcement personnel to the need to respect human rights.
 United States consulates continued to report problems
 concerning the arrest of U.S. citizens. In many instances,
 those detained alleged they were abused and tortured by
 military and law enforcement authorities, most often for
 purposes of obtaining admissions of guilt. They claimed to
 have been subjected to beatings, electric shocks applied with
 cattle prods and stun guns, sexual assaults, attempts at
 suffocation, and death threats. Some declined to discuss
 their cases with consular officials for fear of reprisal.
 As an example, six U.S. citizens were arrested in Baja
 California Sur in May 1989 by elements of the Federal Judicial
 Police for alleged possession of cocaine. All six, including
 one woman, were strip-searched. One was blindfolded and had a
 plastic bag tied around his head to the point of suffocation;
 a gun was later discharged at his head and a knife held to his
 throat. Overall, there have been 74 complaints by U.S.
 citizens throughout Mexico (through the month of September
 1989), an increase of 6 over the previous year.
 Unfortunately, formal diplomatic protests sent to the
 Secretariat of Foreign Relations have not always produced
 satisfactory responses.
 In late October, the Bar Association of the state of Sonora
 
 
 657
 MEXICO
 issued an open letter to protest the "constant violation" of
 fundamental constitutional rights and abuse of prisoners,
 including torture and murder, by the police authorities at all
 levels in the state. Some members of the church and the media
 supported the Association's allegations.
 There were some signs of improvement, however. The U.S.
 consulate in Nuevo Laredo noted a marked drop in abuse cases
 after the transfer of Federal police commander Hugo Tinoco
 Causor and his subsequent indictment on charges of torture and
 illegal deprivation of liberty. The consulate general in
 Guadalajara reported an end to complaints of mistreatment by
 military authorities in the Puerto Vallarta area. It also
 noted that Jalisco's relatively new governor, Guillermo Cosio
 Vidaurri, has made a significant effort to improve police
 recruitment, training, and compensation. About 150 corrupt
 state police and judicial officials were dismissed, and more
 were expected to follow.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under provisions of the Constitution, an arrested suspect can
 be held in police custody for up to 48 hours before he must be
 brought before a judge to make a preliminary statement of
 guilt or innocence. The judge has an additional 24 hours to
 determine whether detention should continue or not. Both
 standards, however, have frequently been violated, with
 charges of abuse, torture, and the extortion of forced
 confessions from accused persons during this initial period.
 Mexican citizens are guaranteed the right to seek restraining
 orders and to make appeals ("amparo"), a constitutional
 protection provided against "coercive and abusive acts of
 authority." In a recent reform of the restraining
 order/appeal system, certain categories of persons are
 automatically granted such petitions. Incidents of arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment occur most frequently in criminal
 cases and, notably, in land tenure disputes.
 Exile and extradition of Mexican citizens are not normally
 practiced in Mexico.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into Federal and state court
 systems, with the Federal courts having jurisdiction over most
 civil cases and those involving major felonies. Under the
 Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed within 12
 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at least a 2-year
 sentence. Despite efforts at reform, this standard is often
 not met because of delays caused by cumbersome court
 procedures, case backlogs, and defense motions. Trial is by
 judge, not jury, in nearly all criminal cases. Defendants
 have a right to counsel, and public defenders are available.
 Other rights include defense against self-incrimination, the
 right to confront one's accusers, and the right to a public
 trial.
 The political opposition alleges that the judiciary, with
 judges placed in office by renewable appointments, is
 dependent on the executive branch. The Government denies that
 political beliefs have any bearing on the impartial
 administration of justice. Factors such as low pay for judges
 
 
 658
 and law enforcement officials and high caseloads contribute to
 corruption in the judicial system
 The National Front against Repression (FNCR) states there are
 currently 33 political prisoners in the country. It
 acknowledges the release by the Government during the past
 year of four political prisoners, including PRT activist and
 23rd of September League militant Heladio Torres Flores, and
 Manuel Alba Vera, also imprisoned for crimes committed during
 the "armed struggle" of the 19701s. The majority of political
 prisoners, as defined by the FCNR, are peasants and peasant
 activists arrested in disputes over land. The Government has
 disputed the appellation "political prisoner" in these cases,
 charging that most of those listed by the FNCR are actually
 guilty of common crimes such as terrorism, criminal
 association, and damage to property. The Government has
 consistently denied that it holds political prisoners.
 President Salinas de Gortari initiated a sweeping amnesty
 program in February in which a total of 1,176 prisoners
 accused of committing crimes of a "political or social nature"
 were released from jail. Human rights activists, including
 the prestigious Mexican Academy of Human Rights, allege that
 the amnesty program distracts public attention from the
 problems of political prisoners and the disappeared and is
 really aimed at alleviating problems of overcrowding in
 Mexican prisons, particularly as the Government activates its
 new campaign against drug trafficking.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 Article 16 of the Constitution provides for the privacy of
 individuals. Although the Government generally does not
 intrude on this right, and search warrants are required by
 law, peasants and urban squatters involved in conflicts over
 land titles have charged that local landowners, accompanied by
 police, have entered their homes without appropriate judicial
 orders and sometimes have resorted to violence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are provided for by the
 Constitution. The current administration has tolerated much
 direct public criticism, particularly in the print media.
 Mexico's press is also a primary source for reporting
 allegations of human rights violations. However, the State's
 role as sole supplier of newsprint in Mexico has long given
 rise to charges that the Government uses this control to
 pressure editors into quashing unfavorable reports, with some
 journalists avoiding confrontation by self-censorship.
 President Salinas acknowledged the problem and, on October 9,
 announced his intention to privatize the supply of newsprint.
 Opposition political parties have often charged that Mexico's
 two principal television networks, one government owned and
 the other privately owned but allegedly partial to the
 Government, accord PRI candidates unfair advantage in coverage
 of their campaigns. Article 52 of the revised Federal
 Electoral Code does provide opposition parties with 15 minutes
 per month of television time and additional time during an
 electoral campaign. However, the opposition asserts that
 PRI's advantage derives from its status as Mexico's "official"
 
 
 659
 IMEXTCQ
 party, with party activities (including campaign events)
 covered as if they constituted national news.
 In sharp contrast with 1988, no Mexican journalists are known
 to have died violently or under suspicious circumstances in
 1989. However, press reports indicate that a reporter for El
 Sol Veracruzano was abducted in Mexico City in early January,
 and as many as nine press photographers were assaulted over
 the course of the year.
 In a major development, the murder of Excelsior journalist
 Manuel Buendia Tellezgiron was purportedly solved after a
 5-year investigation, with sometime police agent Juan Rafael
 Moro Avila accused of the crime. Moro, in turn, blamed former
 policeman Jose Luis Ochoa Alonso for the murder, averring that
 he only arrived at the scene after Buendia was hit; Ochoa
 himself was later murdered. Moro further alleged that Jose
 Antonio Zorilla Perez, a former chief of the now defunct
 Federal Security Directorate (Secretariat of Government), was
 the "intellectual author" of the crime. In addition, several
 cases pending from 1988 have apparently been solved, including
 the murders of Tijuana investigative reporter Felix Miranda
 and Mazatlan journalist Manuel Burgueno. No suspects have as
 yet been identified in the shooting of Ciudad Juarez
 television personality Linda Bejarano.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right of peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose. A government permit is generally required for
 major demonstrations, and the Government, with few exceptions,
 permits demonstrations by a broad range of political groups.
 Within the Federal District, opposition political groups as
 well as peasant and indigenous organizations are allowed
 frequent access to both main boulevards and the city's large
 central square for demonstrations. In rare instances,
 unauthorized marches, sit-ins, and other forms of protest are
 broken up forcibly by police and security forces, especially
 outside the capital.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution permits individuals to practice the religion
 of their choice. However, no religious body is granted legal
 standing, and the clergy is barred from participating in
 politics, voting, owning real estate, or wearing religious
 garb in public. Some of these prohibitions are not strictly
 enforced, nor is a constitutional restriction against
 preuniversity religious schools, many of which exist.
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic, though Protestant,
 Mormon, Jewish, and other religious communities also exist and
 enjoy freedom of worship. Protestant Evangelists and Mormons,
 principally foreign-supported groups, are active and
 especially successful in certain rural, largely indigenous
 communities. Some critics have stated that the Government
 finds these foreign groups threatening and, therefore,
 selectively enforces anticlerical laws in favor of the
 predominant Roman Catholic Church. Other critics assert the
 opposite; that the laws are not enforced against the
 Evangelists in order to reduce the influence of the Catholic
 Church.
 
 
 660
 MEXICO
 A rapprochement of sorts between church and state began under
 the previous presidential administration of Miguel de la
 Madrid. Incoming President Salinas de Gortari has taken the
 rapprochement several steps further, inviting leading clerics
 (including the Apostolic Delegate) to his December 1, 1988,
 inauguration and holding public meetings with them (including
 briefings by Cabinet members on the status of foreign debt
 negotiations).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted. Mexico has traditionally followed a liberal
 asylum'policy concerning Central American refugees and asylum
 seekers from other countries--even though the Constitution
 does not provide for their recognition, nor do laws exist
 which govern their entry into and residence in Mexico. The
 Government has usually admitted persons whom the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recognizes as
 refugees. Over 41,000 Guatemalan refugees reside in camps and
 resettlement centers in southern Mexico. According to the
 UNHCR, an additional 150,000 Guatemalans reside illegally in
 Mexico, mostly in the state of Chiapas, though large numbers
 also reside in Mexico City and other urban areas.
 Undocumented Guatemalans lead a precarious existence because
 they are subject to deportation if caught, and they also can
 be subjected to exploitation by private Mexicans as a source
 of cheap labor.
 Until quite recently, Guatemalan refugees in the southern
 border states have been restricted in their movements and in
 opportunities for legal work in order to avoid friction with
 local residents and to discourage permanent resettlement in
 the area. Under this same policy, refugee children born in
 Mexico were not recorded or issued birth certificates, and
 could not claim Mexican citizenship. These restrictions have
 since been relaxed, according to UNHCR and government
 officials, with refugees now able to seek some work outside of
 the camps and children now being registered. Government
 policy has been to encourage the voluntary repatriation of
 individuals and groups of refugees, with assurances that their
 personal safety and security would be respected.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Since 1929, Mexico's Government has been controlled by the
 PRI, which has won every presidential race since then and
 every gubernatorial race, save for the 1989 Baja California
 Norte contest. To secure its continuance in power, the PRI
 has over the years relied on extensive public patronage,
 massive government and party organizational resources and,
 according to opposition parties as well as independent outside
 observers, extensive electoral fraud.
 Following Federal elections in 1988, a total of six parties
 gained representation in the Chamber of Deputies and two in
 the Senate--the latter a first in Mexican political history.
 The President and senators are elected for 6-year terms;
 deputies for 3-year terms. The combined opposition won an
 unprecedented 237 seats out of total of 500 in the lower house
 of Congress and 4 of 64 in the upper. Though in a minority,
 the opposition made its weight felt on at least one occasion
 during the year, compelling the Government to revise its
 
 
 661
 foreign investment law by regulation instead of by legislation.
 Charges of electoral fraud were heard frequently and
 vociferously throughout the last presidential contest and in
 several follow-on state elections, notably elections in July
 1989 for the state legislature of Michoacan. Most observers
 acknowledge that fraud occurs in Mexican elections,
 particularly in outlying, rural areas, and less so in urban
 areas, where a more politically active and perceptive
 electorate exists; they also recognize, however, that most
 recent elections have been somewhat more honest those of the
 past. The Government has consistently defended the ruling
 party's victories and hai specifically denied allegations of
 fraud, while admitting that the electoral system is an
 imperfect one which could and should be improved.
 The PRI has, during 1989, pursued efforts to improve its
 method of choosing candidates for public office. A number of
 PRI state committees have experimented with limited nominating
 primaries or conventions.
 In municipal elections held through December 1989, the
 Government recognized several opposition victories by both
 leftist and conservative parties. In the state of Michoacan,
 for example, the center-left Party of Democratic Revolution
 won almost half of the state's municipalities, including the
 state's capital and most populous city, Morelia. In other
 regions, the Federal Government also recognized many
 opposition victories, but, in at least one case in the state
 of Sinaloa, only after occasionally violent protest activity
 by political activists from both sides. On the whole, the
 Government's ability to insure fair electoral practices at the
 local level remained flawed but improving.
 The Government has sponsored, largely at opposition behest, a
 series of debates in the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal
 Electoral Commission on reform of the Constitution and the
 Federal Electoral Code. During the week of October 16, the
 Chamber of Deputies approved amendments providing for newly
 initiated electoral bodies to review election results, the
 opening of all sessions of electoral bodies to the public, and
 the establishment of a minimum 35 percent of the vote for any
 one party to claim a majority of seats in the Chamber of
 Deputies. Although the leftist opposition criticized the
 changes as "cosmetic," the conservative opposition viewed the
 amendments as steps, albeit small ones, toward a more
 evenhanded political system.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment, and has pledged its full cooperation with efforts
 by Amnesty International (AI) to monitor human rights
 violations in Mexico. various ranking Mexican officials
 (including the Secretariat of Government's new Director
 General for Human Rights and Refugee Affairs, appointed in
 December 1988) met with AI representatives, domestic human
 rights activists, and UNHRC officials to discuss human rights
 problems. The Director General serves as an ombudsman to both
 domestic and foreign human rights and refugee groups, as well
 as to Mexico's state governors and judicial system officials.
 He has no independent authority, save for that which derives
 
 
 662
 from the political power of the Secretary of Government.
 There are three well-known human rights organizations in
 Mexico. The first of these, the Mexican Academy of Human
 Rights, is composed of leading political and academic figures;
 it serves primarily as an information clearinghouse on human
 rights abuses in Mexico, although some limited guidance is, on
 occasion, provided to individuals. The National Front Against
 Repression (FNCR) and the Committee in Defense of Prisoners,
 the Persecuted, Disappeared, and Political Exiles of Mexico
 both take highly public stances on individual human rights
 cases, as well as the larger issues of political prisoners and
 the disappeared.
 In its'report covering events in 1988, AI again expressed
 concern about reports of political killings, arbitrary arrest
 of political opponents, the use in evidence of confessions
 obtained under duress, continuing rural violence, and
 torture. AI also voiced concern about disappearances in
 previous years which have never been satisfactorily clarified
 by the Government; 52 disappearances occurring between 1972
 and 1983 are reportedly being investigated by AI.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and Indian origins and in
 the success the country has achieved in fostering a climate of
 racial harmony. Indigenous groups, many of which do not speak
 Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political life and
 the Government is respectful of the desire of these groups to
 retain elements of their traditional lifestyle. These groups,
 however, remain largely outside the country's political and
 economic mainstream, a result not of restrictive governmental
 policy but rather of longstanding patterns of economic and
 social development.
 Religious discrimination is generally nonexistent except for
 sanctions contained in the constitution denying any religious
 institution legal standing, and barring clergy of any
 denomination from participating in politics, voting, owning
 real estate, or wearing religious garb in public.
 Historically, women in Mexico have played a subordinate role,
 economically, politically, and socially. However, women are
 becoming increasingly active both in the economy and
 politically. Legally, women are equal to men. They have the
 right to file for separation and divorce and to own property
 in their own name. The Constitution provides for equal pay
 for equal work and for maternity leave. Violence against
 women, including wife beating, is not infrequent, but there
 are no reliable statistics on the extent to which it occurs.
 Domestic assault is a crime, but in practice, due to social
 tradition, women are often reluctant to file reports of abuse
 or to press charges, and police are reluctant to intervene in
 what is oten considered a domestic affair. Violence against
 women was not widely discussed as an issue of public policy
 during 1989 though the number of women's action groups is
 increasing, and they have begun to offer expanded counseling
 and legal services for victims of sexual crimes.
 
 
 663
 MEXICO
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Article 123 of the Constitution provides workers and employers
 the right to form unions and professional associations of
 their own choosing. Registration requirements are not
 onerous, and unions must register with the Labor Secretariat.
 These rights are widely exercised in Mexico where a fairly
 diverse trade union movement exists. Close to 35 percent of
 the Mexican work force--now estimated at 26 million--is
 organized into trade union confederations and independent
 unions. There are no limitations on union organizing among
 civil servanta, a sector that is highly unionized in Mexico.
 The Government does not formally control Mexican trade unions,
 but the vast majority, some 85 to 90 percent, are affiliated
 with the PRI. The remainder are independent or support
 opposition parties, including those of a leftist or Marxist
 orientation. In 1989 the Government went outside of the
 judicial process on at least two occasions to take action that
 affected the integrity of union structures. In May, after an
 illegal strike by bus drivers in Mexico City, the Government
 withdrew recognition of the union, fired the workers, and
 announced plans to restructure the bus company. The
 Government subsequently reinstated the workers and imposed
 terms for their continued employment. In August the
 Government declared the state-owned copper mine, CANANEA,
 bankrupt, effectively breaking the union at that plant.
 Mexican law grants workers the right to strike. Strikes are
 relatively infrequent, however, usually occurring when
 collective bargaining impasses arise or when plant closures or
 layoffs are threatened. Wildcat strikes also occur. The
 Federal Labor Law of 1931, as amended in 1971, sets forth
 lengthy and somewhat cumbersome procedures for calling a legal
 strike. Notice of intent to strike must be filed 6 to 10 days
 in advance, and efforts at conciliation, mediation, and
 arbitration between the parties in dispute are required.
 Local, state, and Federal tripartite conciliation and
 arbitration boards--composed of labor, employer, and
 government representatives--conduct these negotiations. The
 labor law also stipulates that strikes are a measure of "last
 resort." Article 123 grants public sector workers the right
 to strike under specific conditions set by the labor law.
 Several highly publicized illegal strikes occurred in 1989.
 As noted above, Mexico city bus workers walked out briefly in
 May. Earlier, dissident members of the 1.2 million member
 teachers union SNTE went on strike from April 17 to May 12,
 effectively shutting elementary and secondary schools in the
 Federal District and several states, especially in the south.
 The teachers' principal demands included the ouster of
 longtime union chieftain (and "moral guide for life") Carlos
 Jongitud Barrios, a 100-percent wage increase, and internal
 union democratization. The strike ended after Jongitud
 resigned (on orders from President Salinas) and the Government
 conceded a 25-percent wage increase. Additional work
 stoppages have followed, mostly over democratization issues.
 In August dissident workers at the parastatal SICARTSA steel
 mill in Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan initiated a wildcat strike
 in demand of a 60-percent wage increase; the strike remained
 in effect'at year's end.
 Only one legal strike of any significance took place in 1989.

 A strike in August closed 15 export processing zone factories
 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas state. Local rivalries between the
 dominant labor confederation and an independent union prompted
 the walkout, which lasted 3 weeks. Following state government
 intervention, the rivals reached an agreement permitting
 independent unions to continue to operate if they paid dues to
 the confederation.
 Mexican unions may freely form federations or associations and
 belong to international organizations. The largest of these
 federations, the 5-million strong Confederation of Mexican
 Workers (CTM), is also the most powerful. The second largest
 is the Federation of Government Employees (FSTSE), with
 slightly less than 2 million members. There are also other,
 smaller PRI-affiliated confederations. Nearly 8 out of 9
 million organized workers are affiliated with PRI-affiliated
 labor organizations. All PRI-affiliated trade union
 confederations, and a number of independent unions (totaling
 33 in all) are members of the Congress of Labor (CT), which
 provides overall coordination to the movement. Occasionally,
 both the CTM and CT take issue with the Government over
 official wage and economic policies, but open dissent is
 rare. Though diminished tomewhat of late (with several
 notable union leaders failing at the polls), the practice of
 placing a significant contingent of union officers in
 high-ranking government positions, such as that of Federal
 senator or deputy for the PRI, continues. This symbiotic
 relationship tends to limit their freedom of action.
 The CTM is affiliated with'the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions and the latter's Inter-American Regional
 Organization. One of the smaller independent unions belongs
 to the Latin American Confederation of Workers. The
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions has one
 minor Mexican affiliate.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts repeated its observation that several
 provisions of the 1963 Federal Act on State Employees do not
 conform with Convention 87 on Freedom of Association,
 including the prohibition of two or more unions in the same
 state body, the prohibition against employees in the service
 of the State from leaving the union, the prohibition of public
 sector unions joining union organizations of workers or
 peasants' and the extension of restrictions applicable to
 trade unions to public sector unions. The Committee asked
 that the Government make appropriate changes in the
 legislation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Both the right to organize and to bargain collectively are
 provided for by labor law, and are generally respected in
 practice. There appear to be few, if any, restraints on union
 organizing. Collective bargaining is widespread, particularly
 in industr' and commerce. The aforementioned tripartite
 boards of conciliation and arbitration promote voluntary
 worker-employer negotiations. The boards have additional,
 statutory responsibilities, such as registering collective
 bargaining agreements reached between labor and management.
 Workers are protected against antiunion discrimination. Labor
 laws encourage unionization though there are no legal
 requirements for unionization in any industry or branch of

 commerce. Although government workers are almost fully
 unionized, collective bargaining in the government sector is
 much less common since bargaining does not cover wages, but is
 limited to certain working conditions.  The right to organize
 and bargain collectively is respected in the in-bond or
 maquila zones, although workers in some 80 to 90 percent of
 the firms do not belong to unions. One reason, perhaps, is
 that in general the nonunion maquila firms provide benefits
 and working conditions that match or exceed those covered by
 union contracts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Mexico is a signatory to ILO conventions regarding the
 prohibition of forced labor. Such practices are also
 prohibited by Mexican law. There have been no reports for
 many years of forced labor in Mexico.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law sets the minimum age for employment at 14 years.
 Children over 14 years but under 16 years may work a maximum
 of 6 hours per day and are provided additional legal
 protection. They cannot be employed in certain hazardous
 jobs. Child labor laws are observed fairly strictly in large
 and medium-sized manufacturing and commercial establishments.
 This is less true in small shops and factories, and many
 street vendors are children. Enforcement of child labor laws
 is the responsibility of the Labor Secretariat and local,
 state, and Federal boards of conciliation and arbitration.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution provides for a minimum wage for for workers,
 with variations for geographic zones and professional
 specializations. The National Minimum Wage Commission
 --another tripartite body--sets the minimum rate of pay,
 approving periodic increases. Since late 1987, successive
 tripartite economic pacts have restricted the frequency of
 wage increases. In June 1989, the Government announced a
 6-percent increase, bringing the minimum daily wage in Mexico
 City (the highest of the three geographic zones) to
 approximately $3.50. The next adjustment is expected in
 January 1990.
 Inflation and frequent devaluations have significantly eroded
 the peso's purchasing power, with the average worker suffering
 a 50-percent decline in real wages since 1982. Although
 inflation in 1989 appeared to be under control, the current
 minimum wage provides for a barely acceptable standard of
 living for the substantial number of workers who receive it.
 With additional contract benefits, organized workers enjoy a
 somewhat better standard of living than the unorganized.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours. In recent years, the
 average workweek has declined considerably, to a level of 42
 to 43 hours. The CT4 and other Mexican unions are currently
 campaigning for legislation to reduce the legal maximum from
 48 to 40 hours. Current tripartite negotiations have featured
 this issue. In practice, however, many Mexicans work at more
 than one job and easily exceed the average 42 to 43 hours per
 week. The Constitution provides for required rest periods,
 stipulating that no worker may work more than 3 hours of
 overtime per day nor work overtime more than 3 consecutive
 days, with overtime pay calculated accordingly. Anecdotal
 
 
 666
 evidence suggests that workers frequently exceed these norms.
 With respect to occupational health and safety, legislation is
 relatively'advanced and provides substantial protection.
 Health and safety standards are better observed in large
 firms. There appears to be a higher incidence of industrial
 accidents in smaller firms and on construction sites. This
 does not reflect inadequate legislation, but rather a lack of
 sufficient inspection personnel to adequately monitor health
 and safety regulations. Mexican labor law requires the
 formation of mixed commissions of government, labor, and
 workers to oversee security and hygiene; it also sets
 conditions for compensation due to work related illness or
 injury.
