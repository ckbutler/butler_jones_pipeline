 LIBYA
 
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is in practice
 under the control of a military strongman, Col. Mu'ammar
 al-oadhafi. The form of government, however, is officially
 described as "popular democracy," with political power vested
 theoretically in the General People's Congress. The governing
 principles of the society are vaguely expressed in Qadhafi's
 "Green Book," rather than in the Constitution. Qadhafi has
 created a political system that borrows from Islamic and
 socialist doctrine and is heavily influenced by his own
 revolutionary philosophy. It ostensibly emphasizes full
 participation of the people, through a system of "people's
 committees," in the decisions which affect their daily lives.
 The committees have some influence in terms of local government,
 social institutions, and local enterprise, including farming and
 manufacturing. Despite this local level participation, Qadhafi,
 who holds no formal government position, is the only
 decisionmaker on important issues. The influence of popular
 views on him appears minimal.
 Like other petroleum-producing countries, Libya has benefited
 from the high prices of recent years, with oil income reaching a
 peak of $23 billion in 1980. This enhanced revenue has been used
 to finance an active internal development program (new schools,
 hospitals, roads) and to acquire large quantities of weapons.
 Qadhafi has used Libya's wealth and the vast arsenal purchased
 with this wealth in attempts to overthrow the governments of
 a number of other states and has supported a wide range of
 terrorist and subversive groups in many parts of the globe.
 Because of its own oil pricing policies, Libyan oil revenues
 declined considerably in 1981 (to about t15 billion), and
 somewhat further (to $13 billion) in 1982. Oil revenues have
 remained at this level in 1983. Significant parts of the
 1981-1985 development plan continue to be postponed because of
 related financial problems, but weapons purchases and Libya's
 efforts to destabilize moderate neighbors have not declined
 appreciably. Qadhafi has occasionally admitted that financial
 problems have made it difficult for him to finance "liberation
 movements," and from time to time funds for a few extremist
 groups hava been stopped or reduced. Nevertheless, the
 financial constraints which Libya claims to be experiencing did
 not prevent its invasion of Chad in June 1983.
 The Libyan human rights record has been poor since Qadhafi took
 power in the 1969 coup. Reports of torture and abuse continue.
 There are periodic reports and fears that Qadhafi may be planning
 to resume assassinations of Libyan exiles. On March 10, 1983,
 Amnesty International warned that Libyans abroad were under
 threat following a February 17 decision by the General People's
 Congress that all Libyans considered "hostile" would be "hunted
 down" and "liquidated."
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Reports of summary executions within Libya persisted in 1983, as
 well as reported deaths by torture and hangings. The 1980-81
 *After the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli on December 2,
 1979, Embaspy operations were suspended. On May 2, 1980 the
 Embassy was closed. Because of the absence of a United States
 Mission in Libya, this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.

 assassination campaign against Libyan exiles, a form of
 persecution of Libyan nationals practiced abroad, followed an
 April 1980 address in which Qadhafi issued an ultimatum to his
 enemies abroad to return to Libya or be killed. Although the
 campaign has not been openly resumed, Qadhafi made speeches in
 October 1982 in which he threatened to renew the killings.
 oadhafi was reportedly advised by his associates to defer
 implementation of his threats. In the past, some exiled
 dissidents have received threatening communications from Libyan
 officials including, in some cases, letters from the General
 Revolutionary Committee in Tripoli revoking their citizenship and
 vowing to "liquidate them physically." There are reports that
 pro-Qadhafi groups have met in Europe periodically to select
 assassination targets. These threats have been taken seriously
 among Libyan exiles in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. The
 constant fear of assassination as a result of this threat itself
 constitutes a form of terrorism.
 Amnesty International has expressed concern about the large
 number of offenses, including political offenses, which are
 punishable by death under Libyan law. For example, membership in
 an illegal organization such as opposition groups is a capital
 offense.
 Libyan forces invaded and occupied portions of northern Chad,
 beginning in June 1983. Libyan aircraft conducted extensive
 bombings, including the use of napalm and cluster bombs, against
 the northern town of Faya Largeau. This was followed by the use
 of Libyan armored columns to occupy several key locations in
 northern Chad. At present some 5,500 Libyan soldiers remain in
 that country. In addition, there is considerable evidence that
 Libya impressed citizens of other nations against their will into
 service with the Libyan Army or with Libya's "Islamic Legion."
 There were press reports of killing of prisoners by both sides in
 the Chad conflict, and allegations of Libyan offenses against
 civilians in Chad, which were difficult to document because of
 the nature of the isolated desert conflicts.
 b. Disappearance
 There continue to be reports that members of the Libyan business
 community, former government officials, religious opponents, and
 political activists have been taken into custody by the
 Government with no further information available as to their
 condition, whereabouts, or the charges lodged against-them.
 Amnesty International has stated that detainees apparently have
 been held incommunicado for unlimited periods in centers operated
 by the intelligence services.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 During 1983, occasional reports of torture and mistreatment of
 prisoners continued. The methods of torture which have most
 commonly been reported to Amnesty International include electric
 shocks to the head and genitals and beatings on the soles of the
 feet. According to Amnesty International's 1983 Report, the
 number of reports of torture in 1982 increased over previous
 years.
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 frequently beaten during interrogation. In some prisons,
 
 
 1341
 conditions reportedly are tolerable but, according to information
 received by Amnesty International, conditions of detention for
 political prisoners have worsened, including transfer to
 overcrowded cells and confiscation of reading and writing
 materials. Various reports suggest that beatings and degrading
 treatment of prisoners of conscience are commonplace.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many allegedly are held without charge or
 trial, apparently as an example to would-be opponents of the
 Qadhafi regime. Some are said to have been released quickly, but
 others reportedly were beaten and held indefinitely.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were then "no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Credible
 reports from a variety of sources, however, assert that Libyan
 prisons contain increased numbers of persons convicted of or held
 for political offenses. Qadhafi has personally justified
 imprisonment on political, as opposed to criminal, charges. In a
 1981 speech he stated, "those who are put into prisons are there
 because they are the enemies of the people and they fight for
 restoring the Government above the people. There is no shame and
 there is nothing wrong in putting these persons in prison or in
 treading on them with your feet."
 The number of political prisoners in Libya is not known. In 1983
 Amnesty International estimated that there were at least 80.
 Periodic arrest campaigns suggest the actual number may be much
 higher. More than 3,000 persons were reportedly arrested during
 the 1980-81 campaign, many of whom were later either killed or
 released. There is information from various sources that, during
 much of 1982, some 300-500 suspected dissidents, mostly students,
 were in detention at any given time. These persons reportedly
 were taken into custody during several waves of arrests at
 universities throughout the year. Amnesty International has
 information, for example, that some 200 professors and students,
 including Makhlouf and Abuhawiya, were arrested in April 1982 on
 orders of the Benghazi University Revolutionary Committee. There
 have been additional reports of arrests during 1983, but exact
 numbers of those imprisoned or the number of political prisoners
 is impossible to determine.
 There appears to have been an abortive coup attempt against the
 Qadhafi regime in January 1983 involving the Deputy Commander of
 the Libyan Popular Forces (or militia), Lt. Col. Rulhaybi. A
 number of military officers and civilians were arrested in
 connection with the plot, but there is no solid information with
 respect to numbers. There were allegations that some of those
 arrested subsequently died in jail or were summarily executed.
 There are reports of the hanging of one, or possibly several,
 Libyan students in April or Mey 1983. The hangings apparently
 coincided with Libyan Government allegations of an attempt on
 Qadhafi's life by a Palestinian belonging to Fatah, the
 Palestinian paramilitary organization. Fatah at the time alleged
 that the Libyan Government had executed five Palestinians who had
 been imprisoned in Libya since 1981 and therefore could not have
 been implicated in a plot. The announcement may, however, be
 related to the reports of hangings during this period, which
 according to Libyan exile sources may have numbered as many as 30
 persons.
 
 
 1342
 Amnesty International reported that 25 former members of the
 pro-Iraqi Ba'ath Party were arrested in February 1983 and tried
 as members of an illegal organization. They reportedly were
 acquitted at their trial, but were subsequently held in detention
 by administrative decree. In July they were reportedly re-tried
 by a revolutionary court. Parid Ashraf, Muhammad Hillal, and
 Mustapha al Nawari were sentenced to death. Two others, Dr.
 Abdul Hamid Albadour and Mahammout Omar Abu-Obeid, received eight
 year prison sentences. The remaining 20 reportedly were
 acquitted and are believed to have been released.
 In April 1983, Libyan authorities detained eight West German
 nationals in Libya who were ultimately released in May in
 exchange for two Libyan nationals who had been imprisoned in Bonn
 for torturing fellow Libyans at the Libyan People's Bureau there
 in 1982. In October, Libya refused to permit the exit of any
 French nationals from Libya for several days, apparently because
 a Libyan accused of murder in Italy was being held by the
 French. These incidents demonstrate that foreigners in Libya are
 also subject to arbitrary arrest and detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The normal court structure in Libya has been by-passed to a
 significant extent by the "people's courts." The parallel legal
 system has fewer safeguards, and trials are frequently held in
 camera or in absentia. Over the years, the Libyan authorities
 have put considerable pressure on the Libyan legal profession.
 For example, a book by exile attorney 'Imran Muhammad Buruways
 claims Qadhafi in 1977 personally threatened to execute the
 director and board of the Libyan Lawyers' Union if it did not
 issue a certain statement. The pressure culminated in a 1981 law
 prohibiting the private practice of law and making all attorneys
 employes of the Secretariat of Justice. The Union of Arab
 Lawyers, located in Cannes, France, has expressed concern for the
 ability and freedom of attorneys simultaneously to provide legal
 defense for political prisoners and to serve as government
 employees. There is thus some question about the claim by Libyan
 authorities that they "guarantee prisoners all necessary means of
 defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the principles
 contained in the declaration of human rights." The Libyan
 Government also claims that the accused may contact their lawyers
 and families "as soon as possible with respect to the exigencies
 of interrogation," but there are numerous reports to the contrary.
 In routine civil or criminal cases, these government claims about
 due process may reflect accurately the previling situation.
 However, in security cases, there are many reports that prisoners
 are held incommunicado and without trial for long periods. While
 undergoing interrogation, sometimes for periods of several
 months, they are given no access to legal representation.
 Alleged political offenses seem increasingly to be tried before
 ad hoc "revolutionary courts" rather than through the normal
 judicial procedure, with the opportunities for defense severely
 restricted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Libyan Government recognizes no right to privacy which might
 impede its ability to carry out Oadhafi's policies. The legal
 requirement that judicial warrants must first be obtained before
 
 
 1343
 entering a private home is reportedly often disregarded. Local
 and international telephone calls are routinely monitored. For
 his personal security, Libyan leader Qadhafi relies heavily on a
 network of secret police, informers, and bodyguards. The
 informer network extends to the revolutionary committees and
 other local organizations and does not respect individual
 privacy. Fear of Qadhafi's security apparatus severely restricts
 individual expression in Libya.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is severely limited in Libya, most particularly
 with regard to any criticism of the Government or Col. Qadhafi.
 Apparently some criticism is tolerated in the context of People's
 Committee meetings and the General People's Congress. In
 general, however, Most Libyans consider it necessary to be
 circumspect about voicing dissident views toward the regime's
 policies. Domestic and international telephone calls are
 routinely monitored. Libyan media are owned and controlled by
 the Government. JANA, the official news agency, is the
 designated conduit for politically accepted opinions. It is
 impossible to publish opinions contrary to Qadhafi's current
 policies in the press or any other printed material. There
 appears to be an underlying climate of fear and mistrust at all
 levels of Libyan society which severely restricts freedom of
 speech. Freedom of speech and other basic civil and political
 freedoms are further restricted during periods of internal
 security crises.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of association is granted only to those institutions
 affiliated with the apparatus of the regime. Attempts at public
 assembly are repressed if they are not government-controlled or
 supportive of regime positions. Organizations such as trade
 unions and professional associations are viewed as threats by
 Qadhafi, who has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between the
 revolution and its working forces." The previous trade union
 system has been changed considerably. New unions have been
 organized under government control and are administered through
 the People's Committee system. Collective bargaining does not
 occur. There have been no reports of sttikes for years;
 presumably they are not permitted. An exiled opposition group in
 June 1983 appealed to the International Labor Organization to
 investigate "the oppressive record of the Qadhafi regime with
 regard to its treatment of workers and laborers and employees in
 Libya, with particular emphasis on violations of human rights
 agreements and conventions governing labor and labor unions."
 This group also charged that Libya has forced foreign workers and
 employees into military training with the intention of coercing
 them into military and subversive activities against their native
 countries. Reports from other sources support this claim,
 including the case of individuals sent by Libya to fight in Chad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Services are permitted in some
 Christian churches. There is a Catholic bishop resident in
 Libya, and the small number of priests and nuns there are
 reportedly permitted to wear their habits. The once-powerful
 
 
 1344
 Sanusiyya Islamic religious organization was virtually banned by
 Qadhafi after the revolution as part of his efforts to eliminate
 rival power bases. Restrictions were placed on the operation of
 the organization's Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was
 appointed for Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored Islamic
 University was merged with the University of Libya. Nearly all
 of Libya's formerly large Jewish community has emigrated. No
 information is available on the status of any Jews who may remain
 in Libya; however, virulently anti-Jewish broadcasts on Libyan
 radio were the apparent cause of anti-Jewish violence in 1982
 inportions of Tunisia within broadcasting range.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, freedom of movement within
 the country is not usually restricted for Libyan citizens. An
 exit permit is required for travel abroad. Military conscription
 regulations have led to some restrictions on the issuance of exit
 permits to potential inductees. During the 1983 Libyan invasion
 of Chad, persons of draft age who had not yet served or had not
 obtained appropriate exemptions were not allowed to leave Libya.
 In many instances, approval for travel by such persons is subject
 to the whims of individual officials. Reportedly, it is
 increasingly difficult for Libyan nationals suspected of
 inadequate revolutionary attitudes to travel abroad. For
 example, during 1982 the authorities reportedly withdrew the
 passports of some persons suspected of intending to have contacts
 with Libyan exiles.
 Information concerning current Libyan policy with regard to
 emigration or voluntary repatriation is unavailable. Under
 Libyan Islamic law, a wife may not leave the country without her
 husband's permission; a child may not travel without the
 father's consent. Restrictions have also been implemented
 limiting the amount of currency which can be taken out of the
 country to about $1,000 (300 Dinars) per year regardless of the
 number of trips taken.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Major government decisions in Libya are controlled by Oadhafi.
 He personally makes all appointments of military officers and
 official functionaries down to a low level. Power flows down
 from Qadhafi through a small circle of trusted associates, whose
 own authority is a reflection of their proximity to him.
 Officially, Libya describes itself as the world's only
 Jamahiriya, or "Republic of the Masses." Major changes in the
 organization of the Libyan state occurred in 1971 designed to
 effect the "Jamahiriya." Qadhafi sought to replace subnational
 leaders, traditionally chosen from local tribal and regional
 bases, with leaders selected by and presumably loyal to Oadhafi.
 The changes centered on the establishment of the General People's
 Committee and a series of subordinate popular committees.
 Although political parties have been outlawed, many people have
 some involvement in the system through the local committees. .The
 method of selection of individuals for these committees is not
 clear; while they may be elected or chosen in a representative
 fashion in some cases, there is certainly a political component
 in the committees which reflects Qadhafi's imprimatur.' Efforts
 
 
 1345
 have been made to recruit women and members of the Berber and
 other minority groups in this local political structure.
 oadhafi's efforts to advance the status of women, provide
 military and university training, and change their status in the
 society have met with mixed success and have created some tension
 among various groups in the society, particularly where the new
 jobs and roles of women are in conflict with more fundamental
 Islamic religious teachings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An Amnesty International mission went to Libya in early 1980.
 Following the mission, Amnesty International issued a memorandum
 "setting forth its concerns to the authorities in which it called
 upon the Libyan authorities to put an end to 'physical
 liquidation' and to implement fully the provisions of the
 international instruments guaranteeing human rights which they
 had ratified." The Libyan authorities have failed to respond to
 written requests from Amnesty International for information on
 specific cases. In its 1983 report, Amnesty International
 reiterated these concerns about Oadhafi's calls for the "physical
 liquidation of enemies of the revolution," as well as for
 imprisonment of political dissenters, hundreds of arbitrary
 arrests, widespread use of torture, summary procedures in
 revolutionary courts, deaths of three detainees, and the use of
 capital punishment, sometimes for political offenses. In its
 1983 Report, Freedom House expresses concern over the same human
 rights violations and classifies Libya "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Aggressive marketing tactics and price discounts caused Libyan
 oil exports and revenues to rebound in the second half of 1982.
 Libya has abided by its OPEC quota of 1.1 million barrels per day
 since the spring of 1983. With austerity measures in place and a
 sharp cut in imports, the current budget marked a modest surplus
 in 1983. Continued fiscal austerity should bring the current
 budget into balance. Budget expenditures for the past two years
 have been scaled back and many projects under the 1981-85 plan
 have been delayed. These measures have reduced the abundance and
 variety of goods available to consumers and chronic shortages
 have been reported.
 Libya's substantial oil wealth has allowed the Qadhafi regime to
 improve the lot of Libyans significantly (especially the lower
 class) despite the curtailment of freedoms and rampant
 corruption. Per capita gross domestic product rose from $5,560
 (1971) to $11,700 in 1980 before slipping to $8,476 last year.
 Investment in health facilities and a marked growth in female
 literacy over the past decade accompanied an increase in life
 expectancy at birth from 52 years in 1971 to 57 years in 1980.
 However, the infant mortality rate was 88 per 1,000 live births
 in 1983, an increase from the rate of 53 per 1,000 live births in
 1971. Population, estimated at 3,498,000 increased at about 5.2
 percent last year. Between 1971 and 1979 the percentage of the
 population with access to safe water increased from 58 to 100,
 and the percentage of calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements increased from 105 to 122.
 Salt water encroachment into littoral aquifers, however, is
 contaminating fresh water supplies in some urban centers forcing
 the government to undertake massive water relocation projects.
