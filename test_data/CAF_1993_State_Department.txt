 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic (C.A.R.), ruled since 1981 by a military regime
 under General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba, made a peaceful transition from a mili-
 tary regime to a democratically elected Government. On September 19, citizens
 elected Ange-Felix Patasse, head of the Movement for the Liberation of the Central
 African People (MLPC), President, and a new National Assembly representing mul-
 tiple political parties and viewpoints. Despite General Kolingba's last-minute efforts
 to subvert the process, and notwithstanding several incidents that marred the vot-
 ing, an 80-person international observer delegation certified the validity of the out-
 come. In the National Assembly elections the new President's party, the MLPC, did
 not gain a majority, winning only 33 of the 85 seats, while the Confederation of
 Democratic Forces (CFD) coalition gained 25 seats, and Kolingba's Central African
 Democratic Assembly party (RDC) won 14 seats. The National Assembly convened
 on November 8 and elected Hugues Dodozendi of the MLPC as president of its Exec-
 utive Bureau. Besides Dodozendi, 5 other MLPC members hold seats in the 11-
 member Executive Bureau. The other five seats are held by members of five dif-
 ferent opposition parties.
 The military and the national gendarmerie, under the Ministry of Defense, share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian lice force, under the direction
 of the Ministry of Public Security. The Presidential Security Guard has been com-
 manded by Central African officers since mid-1993, when French officers and train-
 ers were relegated to advisory roles. There were two serious incidents of military
 unrest in 1993 over nonpayment of salaries, resulting in two short-lived mutinies
 and scattered human rights abuses. However, the comportment of security forces
 during the preelectral period and the elections was professional.
 The C.A.R. is a landlocked and sparsely populated country, most of whose inhab-
 itants practice subsistence agriculture. Its principal exports are coffee, cotton, tim-
 ber, tobacco, and diamonds. Economic structural reforms begun in 1992 in coopera-
 tion with international donors have had little success because of unfavorable world
 
 
 economic trends and government corruption and mismanagement. There were
 sweeping public strikes over the issues of salary arrears and the pace of political
 reform. However, following the October installation of the new President, the strikes
 ended, and public sector personnel, including teachers and doctors, returned to the
 workplace.
 The human rights situation improved markedly as the year progressed, culminat-
 ing in the democratic elections and the installation of a new Government on October
 22. However, efforts by the Kolingba regime to halt the political reform process and
 two military mutinies resulted in a number of human rights abuses, including the
 killing of one person and the deaths of two others under uncertain circumstances.
 Police beatings of some detainees continued, and the Government is not known to
 have punished those responsible. Other human rights abuses included continuing
 discrimination and violence against women and discrimination against Pygmies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Following a peaceful march on the
 Treasury by civil servants demanding pay, lawless elements of the population looted
 the downtown area as well as the market area west of town. Security forces used
 excessive force in containing these antigovernment riots on April 26 and 27, during
 which three persons died.
 On May 15, the Presidential Guard mutinied, and a member of the Guard shot
 and killed a woman whose car was commandeered. While the Prime Minister stated
 that the soldier responsible would face criminal charges, the Kolingba government
 took no action against him.
 The Government did not honor its pledge to conduct an inquest into the 1990 kill-
 ing by security forces of Pierra Wanga nor its pledge to release a report on the 1992
 beating death of opposition activist Jean-Claude Conjugo at the hands of security
 forces during an antigovernment demonstration. There were, however, no additional
 incidents of this sort in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found
 guilty of physical abuse, credible reports indicated that police beating and abuse of
 criminal suspects occurs. In one instance, a diplomat observed security forces ad-
 ministering a public beating to a detainee. As far as is known, the Government did
 not punish those responsible.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and inmates suffered from extensive overcrowding
 until September 1, when, to celebrate the 12th anniversary of his taking power,
 President Kolingba issued a general amnesty, releasing thousands of prisoners from
 20 prisons, including former President (Emperor) Bokassa.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Central African law stipulates that per-
 sons detained in nonpolitical cases must be brought before a magistrate within 96
 hours. In practice this deadline is often not respected, in part due to inefficient judi-
 cial procedures. Political detainees may be held legally without charge for up to 2
 months. Political detainees are defined in the law as "those held for crimes against
 the security of the State." The C.A.R. judicial system does not provide for bail, but
 persons are often released on their own recognizance.
 The Kolingba government abandoned the practice of arresting and detaining labor
 leaders and opposition supporters as threats to state security. It detained political
 activist Joseph Bendounga for art of one morning following an antigovemment riot
 and arrested Guy Mamadou Marabena of the MNP for a brief period, allegedly for
 vandalizing the property of a political rival; he was released when the charges could
 not be substantiated.
 The Government released in the September 1 amnesty three Sudanese nationals,
 Hafiz Abdel Galil, El Rayh Ahmed, and Mohammed Zein Hassan from Ngaragba
 prison. They had been held without charges since March 1990, reportedly for re us-
 ing to pay a bribe to a local official.
 There were no known instances of incommunicado detention, and there were no
 known political detainees held by the Government during the year.
 Exile is not permitted by law and does not occur in practice. The Government re-
 peatedly stated that any person in self-exile for strictly political reasons, rather
 than criminal, may return home without fear of persecution. Several took advantage
 of this policy. The best known remaining person in exile is Rodolph Iddi-Lala. He
 was originally sought for alleged criminal as well as political activities, and it was
 not clear at year's end whether the September 1 amnesty applied to those wanted
 for, but as yet not convicted for, criminal offenses.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary consists of regular and military
 courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. In criminal cases, the accused have
 the right to legal counsel, trials are public, and defendants have the right to be
 present at their trials. These safeguards are generally respected in practice, but the
 judiciary suffers numerous shortcomings, including executive interference, institu-
 tional neglect, inefficient administration of the law, and shortages of trained person-
 nel and material resources. The High Court of Justice, a body created to try political
 cases, did not convene and is virtually defunct.
 President Kolingba appointed by decree a new Chief Justice to the Supreme Court
 in June, following o pposition accusations that his predecessor was corrupt. While it
 was widely assumed that Kolingba hoped to influence the Court through this ap-
 pointment, the Court acquitted itself honorably in tabulating and proclaiming elec-
 tion results that led to a change of government.
 There were no political prisoners during 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home without a war-
 rant in civil and criminal cases. In certain political and security cases, defined in
 Title IV of the Penal Code, i.e., for treason, police are statutorily permitted to search
 private property without written authorization and do so in practice. The Kolingba
 regime maintained its close watch, including telephone monitoring, on opposition
 figures as the elections approached.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There was increased official respect in 1993 for
 the right of private citizens to speak publicly about political developments or to criti-
 cize the Government of political parties. In the election campaign, opposition leaders
 openly criticized the policies of the Government and opposition rival candidates at
 public rallies, in political broadsheets, and on the government-controlled national
 radio and television.
 One newspaper and both radio and television are government owned and con-
 trolled. Journalists working for these entities were not physically threatened, but
 few were permitted to offer dissenting points of view. The pro-RDC Minister of Com-
 munication initially refused the Prime Minister's instructions to open the media to
 the opposition during the electoral campaign, thus violating a key provision of the
 Electoral Code, but he later relented.
 During the preelectoral phase, the government media tacitly supported President
 Kolingba with ample coverage of him, his party, and his policies while neglecting
 other candidates, who received prportionately less print or air time to express their
 views. Prime Minister Lakoue s    cial Democratic Party (PSD) also received dis-
 proportionate media attention. The media glossed over civil unrest and other politi-
 cally relevant issues for much of the year. Under the new Government, the media
 are more open and objective. They cover opposition party rallies and meetings and
 air uncensored interviews in which opposition supporters and politicians are per-
 mitted to express their views.
 Opposition parties and groups published and distributed manifestos and policy
 statements, usually in stenciled and photocopied form without government restric-
 tion or censorship. Similarly, foreign journalists were not impeded in their work.
 Although a number of educators, including presidential candidate Abel Goumba,
 were actively involved in political activities, the University of Bangui remained on
 strike over nonpayment of teachers' salaries for most of the year, and issues of aca-
 demic freedom were not tested.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is con-
 stitutionally provided for but is restricted by regulations. A 1992 decree requires the
 organizers of all demonstrations and public meetings to register with the Govern-
 ment 48 hours before they occur. In May the Ministry of Public Security refused
 to permit an opposition rally. The police reportedly incited a riot the same month
 by firing tear gas into a crowd of civil servants who had been peacefully protesting
 arrears in payment of salaries. However, subsequently there was no government in-
 terference with political campaign rallies, and candidates and their supporters cir-
 culated freely throughout the country.
 The Government no longer enforced a 1961 law requiring all associations to reg-
 ister annually as a means of influencing the activities and policies of organizations
 opposed to the Government. A 1991 law compelling all parties to reister with the
 Ministry of Public Security in order to participate legally in the political process re-
 mained in force, but in practice it had little effect on the political process. Registered
 political parties and apolitical associations were permitted to hold congresses, elect
 officials, and publicly debate policy issues.
 
 
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and a variety of religious com-
 munities are active, including traditional African faiths, Christian denominations,
 and Muslims. Religious organizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize,
 worship, and construct places of worship. However, religious groups must register
 with the Government, and any group whose behavior is considered subversive in na-
 ture remains subject to sanctions, although no sanctions were imposed in 1993.
 The Government lifted its 1986 ban on the activities of the Jehovah's Witnesses
 community, but there is continued ambiguity about the status of this group, since
 the document restoring the group's rights states that it must obey undefined rel-
 evant regulations and statutes. Human rights monitors argue that the ban was un-
 constitutional in the first place.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People are free to move within the country, but olice and other offi-
 cials sometimes harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay tribes at checkpoints
 along major intercity roads and at major Bangui intersections. The Government has
 not taken effective measures to eliminate these practices. The Government recog-
 nizes the right of voluntary travel abroad and repatriation. Financial and edu-
 cational constraints, rather than government controls, restrict foreign travel and
 emigration. There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship during the year.
 By the end of 1993, more than 28,000 Sudanese had fled civil strife in Sudan to
 seek safe haven in the remote southeastern corner of the C.A.R. In collaboration
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), other U.N.
 agencies, and private relief organizations, the C.A.R. National Commission for Refu-
 gees provided assistance to this group. The C.A.R. also hosted some 20,000 Chadian
 refugees, most of whom entered the C.A.R. in early 1993 to escape the actions of
 Chadian security forces in the south of that country. The Chadian refugees are also
 under the protection and supervision of the UNHCR.
 Refugee populations near the Chadian border were encouraged by the Govern-
 ment to resettle in a site further from the frontier, but neither the refugees nor any
 Central Africans were forced to resettle elsewhere. There were no reports of forced
 repatriations of refugees in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens were able to exercise peacefully their constitutional right to change their
 government by democratic means following a protracted controversy between opposi-
 tion parties and the Kolingba regime, which throughout much of the year used con-
 stitutional arguments and political subterfuge to impede the electoral process. In
 the wake of the failed elections of October 1992, the Government agreed in January
 to the formation of a mixed Electoral Commission composed of representatives of all
 political parties. This body drafted a new Electoral Code that was submitted for a
 proval to the Provisional Political Council of the Republic, a quasi-legislative body
 appointed by Kolingba that included all presidential candidates from the annulled
 presidential elections of October 1992 save Abel Goumba, who did not participate.
 Following a riot and two military mutinies in May, President Kolingba in July
 accepted a mixed Electoral Commission proposal for Auu st and September elec-
 tions. There was heavy voter turnout (80 percent) for the first-round, multiparty
 presidential and legislative elections in August which pitted eight presidential con-
 tenders against each other and ended with the ouster of President Kolingba, who
 finished fourth with 12 percent of the popular vote. Public and external pressures,
 including from the French Government, blocked an attempt by Kolingba to annul
 the election results through a presidential decree altering the makeup of the Su-
 preme Court. In lighter second-round voting (63 percent) on September 19, Ange-
 Felix Patasse of the MLPC prevailed over Abel Goumba and the Patriotic Front for
 Progress (FPP) with 52 percent of the vote. Patasse was inaugurated on October 22.
 The 85 deputies from 11 identifiable political parties were sworn in on November
 3. An international observer group that monitored both rounds of voting described
 the electoral process as free, fair, and legitimate despite minor administrative irreg-
 ularities and the unsuccessful attempts by unknown persons in Bangui and the
 town of Berberati to use violence to derail the elections. The time-consumin process
 of tabulating votes did not permit the Supreme Court to proclaim first-round legisl a-
 tive and presidential results within 8 days, as stipulated by the Electoral Code, but
 the Court did adhere to the spirit of the Electoral Code throughout the electoral
 process.
 Women remained underrepresented in the political process. Three female can-
 didates were elected to the Parliament and two others were named to President
 Patasse's Cabinet.
 
 
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), who represent 1 to 2 percent of the national population, are not
 represented in the Government and have little political power or influence, although
 they voted in large numbers in the 1993 election. In general, the Ba'aka have little
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the
 allocation of natural resources.
 Section -4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation with multiple goals, including publicizing human rights violations in the
 CA.R. and pleading individual cases of human rights abuses before the courts. The
 LCDH raised its public profile with two public seminars and the advent of a publica-
 tion dedicated to relevant human rights issues. The LCDH took the lead in calling
 for a unified opposition response when the Government repeatedly delayed an-
 nouncement of electoral dates. Despite the LCDH's activist stance, the Government
 did not attempt to hinder its activities.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross visited the C.A.R. at least twice
 and was given access to prisons and refugee sites. There were no known requests
 from other international human rights organizations to visit in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 gard to wealth, race, or religion, but significant discrimination exists.
 Women.-Despite the Constitution, in practice women are not treated as equal to
 men economically, socially, or politically, and women in rural areas suffer more dis-
 crimination than women in urban areas. When school was in session, 60 to 70 per-
 cent of urban females went to primary school while only 10 to 20 percent of their
 rural counterparts did. Overall, at the primary level females and males enjoy equal
 access to education, but a majority of females drop out at age 14 to 15 due to social
 pressure to marry and bear children. At the University of Bangui, the sole univer-
 sity in the C.A.R., only 20 percent of the students are women.
 In rural communities, where farming is the chief livelihood, women continue tra-
 ditional child-raising duties and perform most food-farming tasks while men seek
 salaried work or produce cash crops. Women not engaged in traditional agricultural
 activities often work in commerce as market vendors. Customs forbidding women
 and children to eat certain classes of food, including some meats, persist in some
 areas of the country.
 There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of female wage earners, but in
 cities many educated women find work outside the traditional patterns. Some hold
 clerical positions, and a modest but growing number are establishing private busi-
 nesses or moving into the higher echelons of government. Women are in the mili-
 tary, the police force, and the gendarmerie.
 Polygyny is legal, although there is growing resistance among educated women to
 this practice. There is no [egal limit on the number of wives a man can take, but
 a prospective husband must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether
 he intends to take further wives. Women who are educated and financially inde-
 pendent tend to seek a monogamous relationship. Divorce is legal and may be initi-
 ated by either partner, but in practice many Central Africans never marry because
 men cannot afford the traditional bride payment. Central African law follows French
 law and does not statutorily discriminate against women in inheritance and prop-
 erty rights. However, a welter of conflicting customary laws (depending on region
 or ethnic background) often prevails.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it is impossible to
 quantify its extent as data are lacking, and cases are seldom officially reported. The
 courts hear very few cases of spouse abuse, although the issue does come up during
 divorce trials or in civil suits for damages. Some women reportedly tolerate abuse
 in order to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their children.
 The Government did not address this issue in 1993.
 The Government chartered the Association of Central African Women Jurists in
 1993. This group established a legal clinic to advise women of their legal rights and
 published pamphlets in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs that advised
 women of the legal prohibition and dangers of female genital mutilation. A second
 pamphlet, directed at women and young children, discussed food taboos.
 Children.-There is no official discrimination against children, but the Govern-
 ment spends little money on programs for children. There are some church and
 other nongovernmental youth projects. Given crippling strikes in the education sec-
 
 
 50
 tor, children did not attend school in 1993. As a result, the number of Bangui's
 street children increased markedly.
 Current interpretation of Article 187 of the Penal Code forbids blows or injuries
 to children under the age of 15.
 The Government has never enforced a 1966 law forbidding female genital mutila-
 tion (circumcision) or Article 187, which is also interpreted as prohibiting this proce-
 dure. Circumcision has been condemned by international health experts as damag-
 ing to both physical and psychological health. This traditional tribal practice is com-
 mon in certain rural areas, and to a lesser degree in Bangui, and is performed at
 an early age. According to health officials, about 10 to 15 percent of C.A.R. females
 have undergone this mutilation. The Association of Women Jurists initiated an edu-
 cational effort against the procedure with the support of officials in the Ministry of
 Health.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice some minorities
 are treated unequally. In particular, the indigenous forest-dwelling Ba'aka, com-
 monly known as Pygmies, are subject to discrimination and exploitation which the
 Government has done little to correct. Pygmies often work for villagers at wages
 lower than those paid to other groups.
 Nationall/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are about 90 ethnic groups, and in the
 past there has been little ethnic balance at the higher levels of government. Under
 the Kolingba government, members of the minority Yakoma ethnic group held a dis-
 proportionate number of senior positions in the Government, military, and state-
 owned firms. Under the Patasse Government, this trend has changed. Although
 residents of the north of the country are a majority in his Cabinet, a much broader
 ethnic balance has been achieved.
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peuhl) herders, claim to
 have been singled out for harassment, including police shakedowns and bandit at-
 tacks, due to popular resentment of their presumed affluence. Few Muslims hold
 senior executive posts in Government, but about a half-dozen Muslims won seats in
 the National Assembly.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no codified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several programs designed to assist the disabled, including
 handicraft training for the blindand the distribution of wheelchairs and motorized
 carts by the Ministry of Social Services. There is no legislated or mandated acces-
 sibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the new Labor Code, last revised in 1990, all
 workers are free to form or join unions of their own choosing without prior author-
 ization. The right of association has been widely exercised by the relatively small
 part of the population holding wage-earning obs, notably persons in the large public
 sector, including teachers, civil servants, and postal workers.
 The current Labor Code does not refer to any trade unions by name, a change
 from previous versions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) had requested
 this change to reflect the proliferation of new unions. There are now five recognized
 labor federations, including the Organization of Free Public Sector Unions (OSLP)
 and the Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC).
 The USTC and its member unions continued to assert and maintain their official
 independence from the Government and political parties. However, prior to the pres-
 idential elections USTC Secretary General Theophile Sonny-Cole expressed publicly
 his support for the candidate of the Confederation of Democratic Forces (CFD) and
 the USTC and CFD both participated in a so-called ghost town strike in April.
 In April the USTC executive bureau suspended from its ranks three of the six
 public sector union heads, following those unions' own suspension of their USTC ac-
 tivities at the end of 1992. The public sector unions formalized the break in October,
 with the creation of the OSLP, which the Government recognized almost imme-
 diately. The membership of the OSLP now outnumbers that of the USTC by nearly
 three to one (20,000 versus 8,000).
 Unions have the right to strike and exercised it in both the private and public
 sectors. To be legal, strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of de-
 mands, the employer's response to these demands, a conciliation meeting between
 labor and management, and a finding by an arbitration council that the union and
 employer failed to reach agreement on valid demands. Strikes did not always meet
 these requirements, although whenever the Government sought to enforce them, the
 unions acceded to them. In June the acting Minister of Public Works sent a note
 to labor leaders in which he observed that the right to strike is an individual deci-
 sion and, by implication, not one that collective union leadership can legally dictate.
 The Labor Code states that if employers initiate a lock-out which is not in accord-
 
 
 51
 ance with the Labor Code, then the employer is required to pay workers for all days
 of the lock-out. Other than this, no mention is made of sanctions on employers or
 acting against strikers. It is not known the extent to which this policy is actually
 followed.
 Repeated strikes by the public sector unions met with limited response. In most
 cases, the Government did not intervene, allowing health services to operate at a
 minimal level and schools to remain closed. In isolated cases, however, the Govern-
 ment sent in troops or issued provocative decrees to try to break the unions' solidar-
 ity. In April government troops occupied a labor union building following a strike
 officially called over salary arrears but influenced in large measure by the Govern-
 ment's reticence to hold long-promised presidential elections. In June the President
 and Prime Minister made statements that employees not showing up for work would
 not be paid. That statement resulted in a student uprising during which the Min-
 ister of Finance was briefly taken hostage.
 Federations are free to affiliate internationally. The USTC maintains inter-
 national labor contacts, although it is not formally affiliated with any international
 bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code accords trade
 unions full legal status, including the right to sue in court. However, by requiring
 a union official to be employed full time in the occupation as wage-earner, the Labor
 Code serves to restrict union organizing activities to after hours.
 The Labor Code does not specifically state that unions may bargain collectively.
 While collective bargaining has nonetheless taken place in some instances, the Gov-
 ernment is usually involved in the process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service, but have been
 only a tangential issue in labor negotiations; the outright nonpayment of salaries
 continued to be the major complaint of the unions, and the main impetus for the
 public sector strikes, which finally ended in November after a month's arrears were
 paid.
 The law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or union activity. However, leaders of public sector unions, particularly
 teachers, continued to complain of government discrimination against them and
 their members, most often through arbitrary reassignment to provincial posts. The
 Labor Code does not state whether employers found guilty of antiunion discrimina-
 tion are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code and there were no reports of such labor. The ILO in 1993
 reiterated its longstanding concern that the C A.R. Government amend or replace
 laws and ordinances dating from 1966, 1972, and 1975 that stipulate imprisonment
 involving compulsory labor for persons engaged in independent activities of a politi-
 cal nature. The Government stated these laws were in "abeyance" but indicated it
 was "aware of the need to bring its legislation and practice into conformity with
 international labor conventions."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age is orbidden bylaw, but this provision is only loosely enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice, the role of children in the labor
 force is generally limited to helping the family in traditional subsistence farming or
 in retailing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that minimum wages
 are to be set by decree of the Minister of Labor rather than by an act of the Na-
 tional Assembly. Minimum wages differ among the various sectors. In September
 1991, minimum wages were raised for the first time since 1980 by between 10 and
 50 percent depending on the category of employee. The lowest paid workers re-
 ceived the largest percentage increases in the minimum wage, which assures a fam-
 ily the basic necessities but is barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of liv-
 ing in a country with a high cost of living. Agricultural workers are guaranteed a
 minimum of $26 (FCFA 7,800) per month, while office workers are guaranteed $60
 (FCFA 18,000).
 Still more serious for public sector employees has been the outright nonpayment
 of wages due to the Government's chronic revenue shortfalls. Most labor is per-
 formed outside the wage and social security system, especially by farmers in the
 large subsistence agricultural sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 42 hours for government employees and
 most private sector employees. Domestic employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. The law also states that there must be a minimum rest period of 24 consecu-
 tive hours on Sundays, although in certain circumstances the Sunday requirement
 may be waived.
 
 
 52
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 they are neither precisely defined nor actively enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Civil Service, a matter about which the ILOhas expressed concern to the Govern-
 ment for many years. The Labor Code states that a labor inspector may force an
 employer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions, but it makes no mention
 of the right of workers to remove themselves from such work conditions.
