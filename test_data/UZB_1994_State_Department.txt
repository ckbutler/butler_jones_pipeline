 UZBEKISTAN
 Three years after declaring independence, Uzbekistan, while having taken signifi-
 cant steps toward economic market reform, has made little progress in the transi-
 tion from its authoritarian legacy toward democracy. President Karimov and the
 centralized executive branch which serves him are the dominant forces in political
 life.
 The President heads the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (PDP). One
 other party, the Fatherland Progress Party, is legally registered, but it was created
 by a presidential adviser, presumably to give the appearance of a multiparty sys-
 tem, and, although it supports the President, it fielded candidates to oppose the
 PDP in most parliamentary districts. The Government continued severely to repress
 genuine opposition parties and movements, despite its frequently stated commit-
 ment to multiparty democracy. It justifies its repressive policy by invoking the spec-
 ter of Islamic fundamentalism, the civil strife that has plagued neighboring
 Tajikistan, and possible opposition preparations for armed struggle.
 e National Security Service (NSS-formerly the Committee for State Security,
 or KGB) deals with a broad range of national security questions-including corrup-
 tion, organized crime, and narcotics control-but continues to be one of the main
 organs for suppression of the opposition. The Ministry of the Interior prosecutes do-
 mestic crimes and often plays the lead role in investigating cases against political
 opposition figures.
 The economy is based primarily on agriculture and agricultural processing;,
 Uzbekistan is the world's fourth largest prducer of cotton. It also has large deposits
 of gold, strategic minerals, gas, and oil. The Government has proclaimed its commit-
 ment to a gradual transition to a mixed government-owned and free market econ-
 omy and introduced in February a package of reforms to stimulate private enter-
 prise, promote private ownership, encourage privatization of state enterprises, and
 attract foreign investment. Thousands of private small farms were created in 1994.
 By the end of 1984, the Government had undertaken reform and stabilization meas-
 ures recommended by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 Government observance of human rights did not significantly advance in 1994. To
 control the political arena, the Government continued to deny registration to politi-
 cal parties and some other social groups, which legally may not function until they
 are duly registered. It continued to suppress unregistered opposition parties and
 movements and severely limited distribution of opposition literature. It continued to
 ban unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations. Security forces detained or arrested
 opposition activists on false charges, particularly in the early part of the year. Police
 often beat criminal suspects and detainees. Although the Constitution expressly pro-
 hibits it, press censorship continued, and freedom of expression was constrained by
 an atmosphere of repression which made it difficult to criticize the Government pub-
 licly. There continues to be significant discrimination and violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There are no known cases of abductions by official forces or
 politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible reports that police often beat criminal suspects while taking
 them into custody or in the period between arrest and trial Birlik (Unity) move-
 ment leader Pulat Akhunov was beaten during incarceration, and he stated that the
 prison administration frequently placed him in solitary confinement. Atanazar
 
 
 1039
 Aripov, an Erk (Freedom) Party leader, stated that he was kept in solitary confine-
 ment for most of the time he was in prison.
 Prison conditions are inadequate and worse for male than for female prisoners,
 with severe overcrowding. Political prisoners are often not allowed visitors or any
 other direct form of contact with family and friends. The families of Atanazar Aripov
 and Erk member Salavat Umarzakov, two defendants in the Melli Majlis (alter-
 native parliament) political trial in 1993 who were imprisoned in 1994 after their
 suspended sentences were revoked, were unable to meet or communicate with them
 until their release from prison. The six Erk Party activists being tried for the dis-
 tribution of banned newspapers were only released from the basement of NSS head-
 quarters and permitted to see their relatives during court sessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Laws on detention have not changed
 since independence. According to the law, police may hold a person suspected of
 committing a crime for up to 3 days. At the end of this period, the suspect must
 be either officially charges or released. A procurator's order is required for arrests
 but not for detentions. A court case must be scheduled within 15ays of the arrest,
 and the defendant may be detained during this period. A defendant may not have
 access to counsel while in detention but only after formal arrest.
 The legal provision permitting detention without the filing of charges led to sev-
 eral cases in which opposition figures were detained for questioning and then re-
 leased without prosecution. The Government used this provision to harass and re-
 stict the actions of opposition figures. For example, during the June 2-4 visit to
 Uzbekistan by US. Senator Arlen Specter, four opposition activists were detained
 to prevent them from meeting him. They were released following his departure.
 In some cases, opposition figures were arrested on false charges for offenses unre-
 lated to their criticism of government policy, such as drug possession, weapons pos-
 session, or disorderliness. Vasilya Inoyatova, one of the three activists held in jail
 to prevent their attendance at a human rights conference in Almat, Kazakhstan,
 in ay, was retroactively charged with insulting a policeman. Mikhail Ardzinov, an-
 other activist held, was charged with hooliganism. Mamadan Makhmudov, Uzbek
 writer and friend of Erk leader Mohammed SOlikh, was arrested for possessing a
 pistol believed planted by police. Makhmudov was also charged with narcotics pos-
 session, abuse of government position and misappropriation of government funds.
 Nasrullah Saidov, Erk secretary in Bukhara, was arrested for possessing a grenade
 reportedly found among his children's clothing, as well as Erk newspapers. Erk ac-
 tivist Saparoy Bekchanov was convited in Febuy for allegedly stealing a rare
 coin to fimance Erk. Nosir Zokir, Erk chairman of the Namangan region, and
 Atmatkhan Turakhanov, Erk chairman of the city of Namangan, were arrested on
 charges of pssessing weapons and drugs.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the President appoints all
 judges for 10-year terms. They may be removed for crimes or failure to fulfill their
 obligations. Power to remove judges for failure to fulfill their obligations rests with
 the President, except for Supreme Court judges, whose removal must also be con-
 irmed by Parliament. No judges are known to have been removed for political rea-
 sons. In political cases, government direction influences the~ udiciary.
 Uzbekstan still uses the Soviet juiar systern which features trial by a panel
 of three judges: one professional j an two "peple's assessors" who are chosen
 by the workers' collectives for a period of 2 ' years. The professional judge presides
 and directs the proceedings.
 There is a thee-tier court system: the people's court on the district level, the re-
 onal ourts, and th u   ee Court. District court decisions may be appealed to
 ten     h    Pwer level wii 10 days of the r   The new dra  r  al code re-
 duces the ist of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason,
 eliminating the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code. Offi-
 cially and in recent practice, most court cases ,  open to the public but may be
 closed in exceptional cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young de-
 fendants. When the probations of Anpv and Umarzakov were revoked, there were
 no observers present. Aipov's        no    ow the exact    so
 tion of his praton until he was released 8 months later.   dsr
 Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, onfront witnees, and
 present evidence. The State will provide a lawyer without charge, but by law the
 accused has the right to hire an attorney. In some political cases, the dfendant
 have not had access to lawyers. For example, when the suspended sentences of
 Atanazar Arpov and Salavat Muradov were revoked, they did not have the oppor-
 tunity to hire a lawyer to assist in their defense.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bond, but in such cases the accused must
 usually sign a pledge not to leave the city.
 
 
 1040
 The Government denies that there are any political prisoners in Uzbekistan. How-
 ever, by all evidence, the Government does hold political prisoners. Several opposi-
 tion members are bein held for "antigovernent activities" (distributing Erk news-
 papers). In the cases of Makbmudv, &idov, Bekchanov, and Tu-akhanov, the evi-
 dence strongly suggests that they are political prisoners (see Section 1.d.). Aripov
 and Zokir were he  under similar charges until their release by presidential decree
 in November. In addition, Pulat Akhunov and Erk chairman in the Fergana region
 Inamjan Tursunov are opposition activists who were released by the same presi-
 dential decree from sentences imposed in 1992 under similar circumstances. There
 is not enough reliable information available to determine whether other prisoners
 are jailed for political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondene.-By law,
 search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There is no provision for judi-
 cial review of search warrants. There does not appear to be a legal mechanism for
 authorizing telephone tapping or monitoring. Security agencies nonetheless monitor
 telephone calls, and there is evidence that they employ surveillance and wiretap
 telephones in the cases of persons involved in opposition political activities. Certain
 higi-profile opposition activists were the subject of very visible surveillance, includ-
 ing round-the-c ock police monitoring of all movements.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech remained severely limited.
 The fear of expressing views critical of the President and the Government persisted
 as the Government continued its general crackdown on all forms of opposition. A
 February 15, 1991, law (before independence) against "offending the honor and dig-
 nity of e President" limits the ability to criticize the President.
 Although the Constitution prohibits censorship, it is widely practiced, and the
 Government tolerates little, i any, criticism of its actions. Newspapers may not be
 printed without the censor's approval. Journalists and writers who want to ensure
 that their work is published report that they practice self-censorship.
 The Uzbekistan Information Agency cooperates closely with the presidential staff
 to prepare and distribute all officially sanctioned news and information. Press re-
 ports from Moscow and Uzbekistan media sources allege that the presidential staff
 has advised newspaper editors in chief to limit strictly their contact with American
 and some European diplomats. Nearly all of Uzbekistan's newspapers are govern-
 ment owned and controlled; the key papers are organs of government ministries.
 State enterprises control the printing presses.
 The last opposition newspaper to be published was the paper of the Erk Party.
 In January 1993, the newspaper was banned and has not been published in
 Uzbekistan since then. Attempts to smuggle in copies of the newspaper from outside
 the country resulted in several arrests and confiscation of the newspapers. On
 March 3, following a nationwide search of the homes of Erk activists, eight members
 of the Erk presidium were arrested on charges of distributing antigovernment lit-
 erature when copies of banned Erk newspapers were found in their homes. Ismail
 Adylov and a companion were arrested for possession of Erk newspapers on August
 4 in Tashkent. Birlik leader Vasilya Inoyatova was charged in the same incident
 for accepting the newspapers.
 The Government forbade the distribution of foreign newspapers critical of
 Uzbekistan. The publication of the local editions of Izvestia and Pravda and the sale
 of the Moscow editions remained suspended throughout 1994. All newspapers, mag-
 azines, and weeklies have to be registered, a procedure which includes providing in-
 formation about the sources of funding, means of distribution, founders, and spon-
 sors. A resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers banned private persons and journal-
 ists' collectives were banned from founding newspapers or magazines. Foreign cor-
 respondents based in Tashkent reported that the security services harassed and
 threatened their translators and other employees after the correspondents posed
 questions at government press conferences and published articles abroad which dis-
 pleased the Govement. In October the Government refused to renew the accredita-
 tion of Steven Le Vine, a free-lance journalist for several US. publications and one
 of the few foreign journalists in Uzbekistan, reportedly because of articles he wrote
 critical of the Prsident and of the Government,'s human rights record.
 Television broadcasting is state controlled. Although there are local stations in
 various regions, nationwide programmingis carried on two state-run channels that
 fully support the Government and its poicies. Tugh an agreement with Russia,
 two Moscow channels were broadcast as well. The Russian channels were Ostankino
 and Russian Television (Rossiskaya Televideniya). In 1994 the Government canceled
 the latter channel, and shortened the broadcast hours of the Ostankino channel full-
 time to only evening broadcasts. Its news broadcasts are blacked out when they are
 
 
 1041
 critical of the Uzbek Government. Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, and the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation are among the few sources of uncontrolled news, al-
 though there have been unconfirmed reports that the Government occasionally
 interieres with Radio Liberty broadcasts.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications. In an attempt to circumvent the requirements of state-controlled
 publishing, Erk party supporters attempted to smuggle in a pamphlet of its leader's
 speeches as well as its newspaper.
 Political repression envelopdi academia as welL In March Tashkent State Univer-
 sity expelled three students from the journalism department after they questioned
 the Government's press treatment of Erk leader Mohammed Solikh. In addition, it
 closed the department of journalism and folded a few of its functions into the Uzbek
 philology department. However, in November the journalism      department was
 reinstituted. Also, the three students expelled in the spring reentered the University
 in the fall semester without incident. In Samarkand the Government unsuccessfully
 attempted to have local Erk leader Suleiman Muratov fired from his teaching job
 after a police search discovered copies of the banned Erk newspaper at his house.
 The Government has not allowed independent academic institutions to register.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The 1992 Constitution states
 that the authorities have the right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and dem-
 onstrations on security grounds. The Government must sanction demonstrations
 and does not routinely grant this permission. After cordons of militia prevented at-
 tempts to hold unsanctioned demonstrations in 1992, the opposition made no at-
 tempts to hold public meetings during 1993 or 1994.
 The Government also limited the exercise of freedom of association by refusing to
 register opposition political parties and movements. The Constitution provides no
 general guarantees of freedom of association; it places broad limitations on the types
 of groups that may form and requires that all organizations be formally registered
 with the Government. The Government frequently and seemingly without legal
 basis denies such registration to groups in any way opposed to the established
 order. To be considered a public association, organizations must be registered in ac-
 cordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
 To register, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members and meet other
 requirements, such as providing an official address. Government control over build-
 ings and office space limits the ability of unofficial groups to obtain an official ad-
 dress. The Government has repeatedly denied the Birlik movement permission to
 register as a party, first claiming irregularities on its membership list, then com-
 plaining about the group's name, and  nally noting its lack of an official address.
 A 1993 Cabinet of Ministers decree required all public organizations and political
 parties officially registered in Uzbekistan to reregister by October 1, 1993, or be sus-
 pended. This decree provided a quasi-legal mechanism for the elimination of various
 organizations that were already registered. The mainstream PDP and Fatherland
 Progress Party applied for and quickly received their reregistration. The Erk Party
 did not submit papers, holding that the decree was unconstitutional as only the Su-
 preme Court has the right to withdraw registration. The Government considers both
 the Erk Party and the Birlik movement to have officially lost their registration in
 1993 because they failed to meet the requirements of the 1993 decree.
 Nonpolitical associations and social organizations usually do not encounter com-
 parable difficulties in registering, and the number of such groups expanded in 1994.
 Some evangelical churches anX several foreign humanitarian assistance groups
 found it 'fict to obtain registration or reregistration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and for
 the principle of separation of religion and state. After the enforced atheism of the
 Soviet period, religious communities are experiencing a significant revival. Religious
 education is becoming more widespread, although it is not included in state schools.
 While Islam is the religion of the majority, ethnic minorities may also practice
 their religion in relative freedom. Synagogues for the Jewish community are openly
 functioning Hebrew education (long banned under the Soviets) Jewish cultural
 events, ana the publication of a community newspaper take place undisturbed.
 Churches have been returned to their ethnic communities and openly function with-
 in them.
 However, tensions arise when churches attempt to convert across ethnic lines, es-
 pecially when they attempt to convert members of generally Muslim ethnic groups
 to Chnstianity.
 Although distribution of religious literature is legal in Uzbeldstan, missionary ac-
 tivity and proselytizing is not. One evangelical church, Word of Faith, lost its reg-
 istration for conducting missionary activities, and all churches are under pressure
 not to evangelize among Uzbeks. In reaction to antimissionary sentiments, for a
 
 
 1042
 short period of time in the summer of 1994 the Tashkent city government stopped
 allowing churches to rent its property, specifically auditoriums and other gathering
 places.
 The Constitution and a December 1991 amendment to the law on political parties
 ban those of a religious nature. This principle is cited for denying registration to
 religious parties, including the Islamic Renaissance Party.
 Feai    the destabilizing influence of extremist Islamic forces, the Government
 has tried to temper the extent of this spiritual renaissance by controlling the Is-
 lamic hierarchy the content of imams' sermons, and the extent and substance of
 Islamic materials published in Uzbekistan.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 across its borders. In January 1995, the Government began to issue new passports
 to everyone over age 16, which will replace the old system of separate internal and
 external passports. In addition, Uzbekistan has greatly simplified the process of ob-
 taining exit visas, which will be valid for a period of 2 years and will no longer re-
 quire invitations. Prior to this, foreign travel was restricted by difficulties in obtain-
 ing an external passport and by a law that required an exit visa for each trip based
 on an invitation. Government authorities frequently withheld exit visas when they
 did not approve of the purpose of the travel. Those who left without an exit visa
 could be sub4ect to severe penalties upon return.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifted before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country willing to accept them are able to
 leave the country. Since independence, a significant number of non-Uzbeks, includ-
 ing Russians, Jews, Ukrainians, and others, have emigrated, although no exact fig-
 ures are available. These people have not left because of any systematic human
 rights abuses but rather because of what they fear will be limited future economic
 and social prospects for non-Uzbeks. Emigration increased markedly in 1993 but re-
 mained steady n 1994.
 The travel of local citizens within Uzbekistan is not controlled, unlike travel by
 foreigners, including journalists. Foreign visitors must have each city they wish to
 visit noted in their visas. Travel to some sensitive areas of the country, particularly
 the environmentally degraded Aral Sea region and the Fergana valley, is controlled
 even more carefully;, requests for travel to these areas are turned down in some
 cases. Even travel to nonsensitive tourist areas is unnecessarily complicated by in-
 ternal visa requirements, and tourists seeking to check into hotels without the ap-
 propriate internal visa often find themselves having to pay fines or bribes to the
 visa police first. Due to agreements between their countries and Uzbekistan, citizens
 of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Korea receive visas
 valid for travel throughout Uzbekistan.
 The law on citizenship stipulates that citizens do not lose their citizenship if they
 reside overseas. However, since Uzbekistan does not provide for dual citizenship,
 those acquiring the citizenship of other countries will lose their citizenship in
 Uzbekistan. If they return to Uzbekistan as foreign citizens, they are subject to for-
 eign visa regulations. There is no evidence that anyone was denied permission to
 return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot exercise their right to change their government through peaceful
 and democratic means. Government measures severely repress opposition groups
 and individuals and apply harsh limits on freedom of expression.
 The Government's professed desire to create a multiparty democracy is belied by
 its actions. Due to the deregistration of the one opposition party and the one opposi-
 tion movement in 1993, there were no opposition parties legally active in 1994. An
 across-the-board crackdown on actual and potential opposition groups and individ-
 uals continued so that by the end of the year few people were willing to challenge
 the Government's grip on power or even criticize it. On May 27, there was a explo-
 sion at the residence of Hamidulla Nurmukhamedov, an activist of the Erk Party.
 No one was injured, but substantial property damage occurred.
 Only the two political parties linked to President Karimov participated in
 Uzbekistan's first postindependence parliamentary elections on December 25. Inde-
 pendent candidates representing local governments won the majority of the 250
 seats. Most of these candidates were also affiliated with the PDP but were opposed
 by PDP-sponsored candidates. All persons wishing to vote apparently were able to
 do so and to choose from among the available candidates. However, not all political
 
 
 1043
 parties were able to register and offer candidates. In addition the practice of one
 person voting for multiple famil members appeared widespread.
 Uzbekistan is ruled by a highly centralized presidency, comprising the President
 and a small inner circle of advisers and semor government officials. President
 Karimor, formerly the first secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan under
 Soviet rule, was elected in a limited multicandidate election in 1991. That election
 was marred by goveent ontrol of the media but Erk oppsition candidate Mo-
 hammed Solikh was able to compete and won 12.7 percent of the vote.
 The President is the chairman of the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan, the
 country's largest party. Most government officials are also members of the PDP, al-
 though it does not play the leading role in governance or cadre selection that was
 played by the Communist Party during the Soviet piod. There is currently only
 one other legally registered party, the Fatherland  ograss Party. Other political
 groups such as Birlik, the People's Movement of Turkestan, and the Islamic Renais-
 sance Party have been denied permission to register as parties. The Erk Party lost
 its registration in 1993 when the Government required all parties to reregister.
 The Fatherland Progress Party was created as a loyal 'constructive opposition"
 party in June 1992. Its existence provides the appearance of a multiparty system.
 The party is headed by a presidential adviser Shafkiddin Juraev, and supports the
 President politically. The party claims a platform that differs from that of the PDP
 in that it seeks more rapideconomic reform and development of conditions favorable
 to businessmen, but the difference is insignificant.
 Although women participate much less than men in government and politics,
 there are several female parliamentary deputies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government disapproves of independent nongovernmental local human rights
 organizations and has restricted their operations. It denied the Human Rights Soci-
 ety of Uzbekistan, a local group organized in 1992, permission to register. The Gov-
 ernment has often regarded international criticism of its human rights record as in-
 terference in its internal affairs, but in September it hosted a Conference on Secu-
 rity and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) seminar in Tashkent, which showed an in-
 creased level of tolerance for foreign discussion of human rights in Uzbekistan.
 Mikhail Ardzinov, deputy chairman of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan,
 was detained in May to prevent his attendance at a human rights conference in
 Almaty, Kazakhstan, and in June to prevent him from meeting with Senator Spec-
 ter.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the 1992 law on citizenship prohibit discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, language, or social status, and officially sanctioned dis-
 crimination does not occur.
 Women.-There is no legal discrimination against women; women enjoy the same
 legal rights as men. Despite nominal equality under the law, however, women are
 severely underrepresented in high-level positions. Due to traditional roles, women
 usually marry young, bear many children, and confine their activities within the
 family. However, women are not formally impeded from seeking a role in the work-
 place. In rural areas, women often find themselves limited to arduous labor in the
 cotton fields. However, the barriers to equality for women are cultural, not legal,
 and women who open businesses or seek careers are not legally hindered.
 Spouse abuse certainly takes place in Uzbekistan, but local activists have no sta-
 tistics. Wife beating is considered a personal, family affair rather than a criminal
 act, and thus such cases rarely come to court. A female journalist who has written
 on women's problems estimates that some 50 percent of the self-immolation suicides
 (of which there are reportedly several hundred each year in Uzbekistan) are related
 to seeking an escape from chronic beatings.
 Children.-Uzbekistan has one of the highest birthrates in the former Soviet
 Union. Over half the country's population is under the age of 15. The Constitution
 provides for children's rights, stating that parents are obliged to support and care
 for their children until they are of age.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-n a population of about 22 million, official
 figures indicate that 71 percent are Uzbeks, 8 percent Russians, 5 percent Tajiks,
 4 percent Tatars, and 3 percent Kazakhs. The real number of Tajiks is significantly
 higher, as many Tajiks have declared Uzbek nationality in their passports.
 Uzbekistan's citizenship law, passed in 1992, does not impose language require-
 ments for citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive.
 
 
 1044
 
 Uzbek has been declared the state language, and tle Constitution requires that the
 President must speak Uzbek.
 In March Russian Orthodox and Jewish graves were desecrated on two occasions
 at a cemetery outside Tashkent. Uzbeks from the adjoining neighborhood were sus-
 pected in the incidents. Europeans complain of harassment from Uzbeks. Non-
 Uzbek speakers report unpleasant experiences with their neighbors or in stores.
 When government organizations and academic institutions have been forced to cut
 back, it is frequently the Russian speakers who have lost their jobs. However, the
 Government does not promote emigration by minority groups and publicly encour-
 ages them to stay.
 The Government decided in 1993 to introduce a Latin script to replace Cyrillic,
 will begin teaching Uzbek in the Latin script in 1995, and hopes to have fully con-
 verted to a Latin script by 2000. Many store and street signs are already in the
 Latin script.
 People With Disabilities.-One of Uzbekistan's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in November 1991, was a law guaranteeing support for invalids.
 This law was aimed at insuring the disabled the same rights as oter people. How-
 ever, little effort is made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. Society does
 not accept them, and for the most part the disabled are kept out of sight, either
 at home or in institutions. The State cares for the mentally retarded in special
 homes. The Government has not mandated access for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 law on unions specifically proclaims that
 all workers have the right voluntarily to form and join unions of their choice, that
 trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate territorially or sectorally, and
 that they may choose their own international affiliations. Membership in trade
 unions is optional. The law also declares all unions independent of the State's ad-
 ministrative and economic bodies (except where provided by law), and states that
 trade unions may develop their own charters, structure, and executive bodies and
 organize their own work.
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet period. Uzbokistan's independence has eliminated subordina-
 tion to the Soviet Union or Russia but has not altered the centralized trade union
 hierarchy which remains dependent on the Government. No "alternative" central
 union structures exist. A few new professional associations and interest groups have
 been organized, such as a Union of Entrepreneurs, a Union of Renters, an Associa-
 tion of Private Physicians and Pharmacists, and one of lawyers. Their role and
 strength are as yet uncertain. Some of these hope to play a significant role in licens-
 ing and otherwise regulating economic activity of their members.
 According to the law, the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a consultative voice in the preparation of all legislation affecting workers and is en-
 titled to draft laws on labor and social issues. Trade unions are legally described
 as organizations that defend the right to work and protect jobs. They have lost their
 previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis
 now is on the unions' responsibility for "social protection" and social justice-espe-
 cially unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law does give the unions oversight over both individual and collective labor dis-
 putes, which are defined as those involving alleged violations of labor laws, worker
 rights, or collective agreements.
 The only reported strike in Uzbekistan was a short strike in August by teachers
 in the city of Richtan calling for higher wages. Union and government officials alike
 assert that this social calm reflects general support for the Government's policies
 and common interest in social stability. It probably also reflects the absence of truly
 representative trade unions as the standard of living fell, and growing unemploy-
 ment raised social tensions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Barqain Collectively.-Trade unions may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatzation is in its very early phases, so there is
 no experience yet with negotiations that could be descried as adversarial between
 unions and private employers. With very few exceptions, the State is still the major
 employer, and the state-appointed union leaders do not view themselves as having
 conflicts of interest with the State.
 The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the
 CFTU, set the wages for various categories of state employees. In the small private
 sector, management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who contract
 for employment.
 
 
 1045
 The law forbids discrimination against union members and their officers, and
 there were no complaints registered.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition  Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except as legal punishment or as may be specifiedby law. Lar&e.
 scale compulsory mobilization of youth and students (by closing schools) to help with
 the cotton harvest continues. Young peole in rural areas are expected to participate
 "voluntarily" in harvesting acivities o all kinds, and universities still shut down
 temporarily to send both students and faculty into the fields.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age is 16
 years; 15-year-olds may work with permission but have a shorter workday. In rural
 areas, younger children and the elderly often turn out to help harvest cotton and
 other crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection service responsible for enforcing
 compliance with these and other regulations governing employment conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Minstry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFTU, sets the minimum wage and raised it several times in 1994 as the value of
 the sum (the Uzbek currency) fell. As of September, it was about $10 per month
 at the official commercial exchange rate (or 200 sum, almost two times the nominal
 level of January 1, 1994). Most agree that the minimum wage is not sufficient to
 feed a family.
 The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes a 24-hour rest period.
 Some factories have apparently reduced work hours in order to avoid layoffs. Over-
 time pay exists in theory but is not always paid.
 The Labor Ministry establishes occupational health and safety standards in con-
 sultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate within the Min-
 istry. Workers do leave jobs that are hazardous without apparent jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment; but the local press occasionally published complaints about the
 failure of unions and government authorities to do enough to promote worker safety.
