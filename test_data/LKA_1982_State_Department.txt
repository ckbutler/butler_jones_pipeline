 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a constitutional democracy with a French-style
 executive president independent of the parliament, a system
 created by the 1978 Constitution to replace the
 Westminster-style parliamentary system that prevailed during
 the first 30 years of independence. On October 20, 1982,
 President J.R. Jayewardene was returned to the presidency with
 a 52.9 percent Vote.
 Rather than holding the general (parliamentary) election that
 is due before the expiration of the six-year term of the
 current Parliament in August 1983, the Government called for a
 national referendum on a constitutional amendment which
 provides for an extension of the term of the sitting Parliament
 for an additional six years. On December 22, 1982, the voters
 of Sri Lanka approved the extension of Parliament by a 54 per
 cent majority.
 Sri Lanka has maintained its adherence to democracy despite the
 strains posed by tensions among the various ethnic groups in
 the population, primarily between the majority Sinhalese, who
 make up 74 percent of the population, and the "Ceylon" Tamils
 (12.6 percent), elements of which have been demanding greater
 autonomy or independence. Other major groups are the "Indian"
 Tamils (5.5 percent) and Muslims (7.1 percent).
 On two occasions in 1982, the Government imposed a nation-wide
 state of emergency as a measure to prevent the spread of
 violence. The first, of a month's duration, was declared in
 July in the wake of clashes between Muslims and Sinhalese
 groups in the southwest city of Galle.
 The second state of emergency was declared after the polls
 closed for the October 20 presidential election in order to
 give the Government additional authority to stem violence that
 is traditional in Sri Lanka after national elections. The
 post-election state of emergency was unanimously approved by
 the Parliament on October 28, with the support of opposition
 parties. The Government later twice extended the state of
 emergency and, as of December 23, it remained in effect.
 Opposition parties objected to both of the extensions, arguing
 that it was not proper to conduct a referendum/campaign while
 emergency provisions were in force.
 A nighttime curfew was imposed on the northern district of
 Jaffna on October 28 in an effort to track down up to fifteen
 terrorists of the Tamil Tigers who attacked the Chavakachcheri
 police station on October 27, killing three policemen and
 wounding two others. The curfew was lifted the next day.
 Basic human rights are protected by the 1978 Constitution, and
 due process is a hallmark of Sri Lanka's legal system inherited
 as part of the British colonial legacy. National security
 concerns have led the Government, however, to resort to
 extraordinary measures to deter and combat terrorism. The
 principal legislation, which provides for arrest without
 warrant and extended detention, is the 1979 Prevention of
 Terrorism Act. It is aimed primarily at northern Tamil
 separatists whose terrorist acts include the murder of 27
 policemen in the last five years, 14 of those in 1982.
 While combatting terrorism, the Government of President
 Jayewardene has also continued to engage the leaders of the
 Tamil United Liberation Front, the major party in Parliament
 
 
 1270
 representing the Tamils on Sri Lanka's northern and eastern
 coasts, in an ongoing dialogue. The talks are intended to
 defuse tensions, reduce misunderstandings, and implement a
 system of local government which devolves control of some local
 development funds to development councils in every district of
 the nation. As part of the accommodation process, the
 Government during the summer of 1982 paid compensation to the
 victims of the police violence that occurred between May 31 -
 June 2, 1981, in Jaffna in the wake of the assassination of two
 police constables by Tamil terrorists.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 As in previous years, assassination units of the Tamil Tigers
 in 1982 continued their attacks on policemen and soldiers in
 Jaffna Peninsula in Sri Lanka's far north. Fourteen policemen
 were killed there in 1982.
 On June 7 and 8, the Tigers struck at innocent civilians with a
 package bomb campaign that traumatized Jaffna Peninsula and
 disrupted the rail and postal networks of the country. A boy
 picked up a package lying by the side of a street in Jaffna on
 June 7 and died when the package detonated. One day later, a
 package bomb exploded in a mail car of a train bound for
 Colombo from Jaffna, killing two postal employees and injuring
 eight others.
 The Tamil Tigers represent the most militant and violent
 element of a movement by some Ceylon Tamils in Sri Lanka's
 northern and eastern coastal regions to seek an independent
 Tamil "Eelam" (separate Tamil state). Terrorist operations are
 funded by the booty taken during bank robberies and
 burglaries. There is increasing evidence that a number of
 expatriate Tamils are sending substantial contributions to
 various organizations -- both violent and non-violent -- which
 espouse the creation of a separate Tamil state. Military and
 police intelligence officials believe that some Tamil Tigers
 have received guerrilla training at former Palestine Liberation
 Organization camps in Lebanon.
 Arbitrary killings by agents of the Government are forbidden by
 the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. There were
 no known allegations of such killings in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations of disappearances in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Although the Constitution of Sri Lanka clearly states that "no
 person shall be subjected to torture....," police and military
 authorities reportedly resort to hazing and other abuses,
 primarily on male Tamil youths from Jaffna district and other
 areas in the north, to elicit information concerning the
 activities and whereabouts of Tamil Tigers. Many youths taken
 into custody and detained for indefinite periods of time under
 the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act are alleged
 to have been tortured by military personnel at two army prisons.
 Under the Constitution, any Sri Lankan citizen who believes
 that his fundamental rights have been infringed may file an
 
 
 1271
 application for redress to the Supreme Court. The application,
 however, must be filed within one month of the act of
 infringement. In September, three justices of the Supreme
 Court heard a case which charged four policemen with assault
 with fists and rifle butts in June 1982. The court, while not
 charging the police officers, did rule that they had submitted
 a false report (alleging that the victim had hurt himself while
 in a drunken state) and also condemned the magistrate who
 remanded the alleged violator for 14 days without judicial
 review. While the Supreme Court decision was welcomed by civil
 rights groups in Sri Lanka, there is criticism that a 30-day
 period is not long enough to permit an individual to make a
 proper application to the court.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such brutality as may occur in Sri Lankan detention centers is
 reported to be generally directed against persons who have
 neither been formally charged nor given a prison sentence; it
 is an aspect of "interrogation" rather than a conscious
 government policy.
 Prisons in Sri Lanka are both crowded and primitive; poor
 conditions are a function of penal philosophy and a lack of
 funds.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In the wake of a series of assassinations of political figures
 and policemen by the Tamil Tigers, the Government in 1979 acted
 to counter the increasing terrorism with enactment of the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act. The far-reaching Act permits
 detention for an initial period of three days before a court
 appearance is required and allows preventive detention of up to
 18 months, if ordered by the Minister of Internal Security.
 Police and military authorities continued to make widespread
 use of the Act to take into custody and detain Tamil youths
 during 1982.
 Under normal circumstances, citizens are protected against
 arbitrary arrest and imprisonment by an article of the
 Constitution which reads: "No person shall be arrested except
 according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested
 shall be informed of the reason for his arrest." An arrested
 person must normally be produced within 24 hours before a
 magistrate, who may authorize further detention for certain
 serious crimes. An accused person may be detained up to three
 months without bail, and longer if a court so rules.
 Tamil legal circles reported that as of the end of October
 1982, 61 Tamils were in custody under the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act, at least three of whom had been incarcerated
 without charge since May 25, 1980.
 With the imposition of a state of emergency on October 20,
 1982, and the Government's intensive investigation of alleged
 assassination plots and plans for widespread post-election
 violence by the defeated Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a number of
 party officials were taken into custody without charge under
 emergency provisions;  some of them are still under detention,
 and there is no indication yet when they will be formally
 charged. Among the more prominent detainees is Vijaya
 Kumaranatunga, high-ranking Sri Lanka Freedom Party official,
 son-in-law of former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and
 prominent activist on behalf of presidential candidate Hector
 Kobbekaduwa.
 
 
 1272
 Another prominent Sri Lanka Freedom Party official, Secretary
 General Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, whose main responsibility was
 to organize the opposition's anti-referendum campaign, was
 detained on November 10, 1982 in connection with an incident
 reported to have occurred in 1980. Mr. Wickremanayake was
 released conditionally on November 23.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Sri Lanka follows the British common law tradition, and the
 legal profession and the court system are held in high esteem.
 Both the Constitution and the law provide, under normal
 circumstances, that persons are entitled to a fair trial in a
 colnpetent court, to be represented by counsel, to be informed
 of the charges brought against them, and to have access to the
 evidence against them. Trial by jury is the custom in Sri
 Lanka, although the Prevention of Terrorism Act requires trials
 by justices only, on the grounds that juries in such cases can
 be intimidated. Defendants may appeal convictions to the Court
 of Appeal and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court.
 Trials for capital crimes during the past year seem to have
 taken place within approximately 12-15 months after the accused
 were arrested. Delays in trials occasionally occur, however.
 A leading English-language Colombo newspaper reported on
 September 26 that two remanded prisoners were still awaiting
 trial after four and seven years, respectively. Remanded
 prisoners are particularly affected by delays, for unlike
 charged persons out on bail, remanded prisoners will not get a
 remission for the time they wait in prison and must serve the
 full sentence that is finally imposed.
 The President appoints the Chief Justice and all the judges of
 the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, and the High Court. A
 Judicial Service Commission, comprised of the Chief Justice and
 two Supreme Court Judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses
 all lower court judges and magistrates. The judiciary at large
 is independent and jealous of its status and its rights.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Search or arrest warrants are required to enter premises in
 ordinary circumstances. This requirement is eroded, however,
 by the Prevention of Terrorism Act, under which police officers
 above a certain rank are not required to have warrants to enter
 and search any premises in which there is a presumption or
 evidence of support to or involvement with terrorist activity.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the Constitution entitles every citizen to "freedom of
 speech and expression, including publication," it also states
 that fundamental rights "shall be subject only to such
 restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the interests of
 national security."
 The Government controls two of five major newspaper groups and
 owns the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and national
 television station. Such control constrains, but does not
 preclude, criticism against the Government. There is a wide
 range of smaller publications -- daily, weekly, and monthly --
 many of which are organs of political parties. Independent
 
 
 1273
 publications complain of government pressures to control
 criticism. There is, nevertheless, an active expression of
 differing views in the press. Under the Public Security Act,
 direct censorship may be invoked and, in the wake of the
 island-wide declaration of emergency on July 30, 1982
 (following violence involving Sinhalese and Muslims in Galle),
 the Government also imposed censorship. This applied only to
 communal news and remained in effect through August 29, 1982,
 including the trial period of two people accused of killing
 policemen.
 On October 21, military authorities in Jaffna, invoking
 enabling provisions of the regulations governing the state of
 emergency then in force (following the presidential election),
 sealed the Tamil separatist newspaper "Sutantiran." Its
 current edition was alleged to contain "highly inflammatory"
 material (said to be a picture of a Tamil youth tortured in a
 military prison) which was considered by authorities as a
 threat to peace. Copies of the paper sent to vendors were
 confiscated.
 On November 2, 1982, also invoking provisions of the emergency
 regulations, the Government closed the "Aththa" newspaper, a
 major Sinhalese daily and organ of the Communist Party.
 "Aththa" had strongly supported Sri Lanka Freedom Party
 candidate Hector Kobbekaduwa during the recent presidential
 election campaign and has since vigorously opposed the
 extension of the life of the present parliament. On October
 29, the paper carried a statement by the Sri Lankan Communist
 Party condemning the referendum and subsequently repeated the
 contents of a telegram which the Civil Rights Movement in Sri
 Lanka had sent to the President protesting the holding of the
 referendum and the manner in which the referendum bill was
 pushed through Parliament without opportunity for public
 debate. "Aththa" was reportedly closed by the Government as a
 measure to prevent it from serving as a vehicle to incite
 post-election violence. The editor, the publisher, and the
 proprietor of the Mahajana Press, which publishes "Aththa,"
 have petitioned for the reopening of the paper and for
 compensation for financial losses they have incurred since the
 paper was closed.
 There is no evidence of interference in scholarly research at
 Sri Lankan colleges, universities, and research institutes; nor
 have there been any instances of harassment or persecution of
 professional groups during the past year.
 Terrorist activities of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka's far
 north have had a dampening effect on normal political activity
 there. Since the assassination in May 1981 of the leading
 United National Party contender for the Jaffna District
 Development Council, politicians supporting the ruling party in
 the north have been circumspect in their legitimate political
 activities. Both the possibility of terrorist activity or
 intimidation during the October 20 presidential election
 campaign and a call for a boycott by the Tamil United
 Liberation Front motivated voters in Jaffna District to keep
 away from the polls. Only 46 percent turned out to vote, in
 contrast to the national average of 81 percent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly generally is not restricted except when
 emergency provisions are in force. Political and other rallies
 may be held in public places, subject to permits. During a
 state of emergency, however, no political party is allowed to
 hold political processions or street demonstrations.
 
 
 1274
 There are more than 1,500 registered trade unions in Sri
 Lanka. Under the law, unions have the right to organize, to
 bargain collectively, to lobby, and, in the private sector, to
 strike. While workers in the factories of Sri Lanka's free
 trade zone northeast of Colombo are not members of unions, they
 do participate in the activities of company "associations."
 Employees of the public sector are governed by the provisions
 of the Essential Public Services Act of 1979 which gives the
 Government the authority to ban strikes in essential sectors of
 the economy and provides stiff penalties for violations.
 The largest unions in Sri Lanka are associated with political
 parties. The Jatika Sevaka Sangamaya of the ruling United
 National Party is the largest public sector union. The Ceylon
 Workers Congress, the largest union representing the Indian
 Tamil tea estate laborers, is associated with the AFL/CIO in
 the United States and regularly sends delegates to major
 meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution declares
 that "every person is entitled to .... the freedom to have or to
 adopt a religion or belief of his choice." Reflecting the fact
 that 69 percent of the Sri Lankan populace are Buddhists, a
 special chapter of the Constitution entitled "Buddhism"
 provides that the "Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism
 the foremost place" and states that it shall be the "duty of
 the state to protect and foster the (religion of the Buddha)."
 The present United National Party Government has devoted
 considerable funds and attention to the preservation and
 construction of temples and monasteries.
 Despite the favored Constitutional position of Buddhism,
 Hindus, Muslims, and Christians practice their religion freely
 in Sri Lanka, and religious differences per se do not serve as
 a basis for discrimination in government services or benefits.
 To safeguard the interests of minority religions, two cabinet
 ministers are assigned additional portfolios of Minister of
 Muslim Affairs and Minister of Hindu Affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right to choose
 one's place of residence are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 permitted in practice. The present Government of Sri Lanka,
 which came to power in 1977, lifted the former exit visa
 requirement and now permits virtually unimpeded emigration by
 any Sri Lanka citizen. Free emigration has opened up
 possibilities of better-paying jobs in the Middle East, where
 many Sri Lankans (estimates run between 100-150,000), including
 Tamils, Sinhalese, and Muslims, now work. Women are not
 subjected to different rules regarding travel. The right to
 voluntary repatriation is specifically guaranteed by an article
 which states that "every citizen is entitled to the freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka."
 The Government of Sri Lanka is extremely reluctant to permit
 refugees from foreign lands even temporary stay on Sri Lankan
 soil while a permanent recipient country is being sought.
 
 
 1275
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sri Lanka is a multiparty democracy with an executive president
 and a popularly elected parliament. Six of eight general
 (parliamentary) elections since independence have resulted in a
 change of government. Voter participation is high -- over 80
 percent. The October 20, 1982 Presidential election returned
 President J. R. Jayewardene to another term in office. There
 have been no confirmed reports of tampering with the electoral
 process.
 Opposition parties function freely, operate their own party
 newspapers, and are covered in the national news media,
 although they are not satisfied with the type of coverage
 accorded them on radio and television and in the papers
 controlled by the Government. No political parties are banned,
 but all must meet certain qualifications to appear on the
 ballot as recognized parties.
 Under the proportional representation system of elections
 provided for by the 1978 Constitution, parties must poll at
 least 12 1/2 percent in an electoral district in order to have
 the votes gained by the party list of candidates count towards
 allocating seats. The minor parties consider the 12 1/2
 percent cutoff point too high and complain that the
 proportional representation system, as presently constituted,
 will effectively shut small parties out of the political life
 of the nation. However, with the electorate's approval on
 December 22, 1982, of the constitutional amendment which
 extends the term of the present Parliament for six years, the
 proportional representation system will not come into use until
 the next general election, which is not required until 1989.
 Sri Lankan women have equal suffrage, equality under general
 law, and equal property and inheritance rights. They play a
 prominent role in the society, and organizations like the
 Jaycees have men and women members. Under the personal laws of
 various ethnic groups, there are some limitations on women in
 those groups. Women are believed to exercise their vote
 extensively but play a much more limited role in the political
 process and decision-making. One of Sri Lanka's best-known
 women is former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, head of
 the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Mrs. Bandaranaike has taken an
 active role in opposing the Government's referendum proposal,
 even though she is prevented from a more active political life
 and is barred from elective office by a seven-year suspension
 of her civic rights imposed by a 1980 commission judgment which
 found her to have exceeded her powers during her 1970-77 term
 as head of the Sri Lankan Government.
 One group which has not yet been fully integrated into the
 political, social, and economic fabric of Sri Lanka are the
 so-called Indian Tamils, whose forebears were brought from
 southern India by the British in the 19th and 20th centuries to
 work in the Ceylon tea estates. A bilateral agreement
 negotiated in 1964 between India and Sri Lanka was intended to
 resolve the citizenship status of an estimated 975,000
 "stateless" Indian Tamils over a period of 15 years (a
 subsequent amendment extended the period to 17 years). During
 this period it was agreed that 600,000 Indian Tamils (plus any
 children born to them after 1964) would be granted Indian
 citizenship and repatriated to southern India; 375,000 (plus
 offspring) would be granted Sri Lankan citizenship. When the
 17-year period ended on October 31, 1981, India announced that
 
 
 1276
 
 the agreement had lapsed and that no more applications for
 Indian citizenship would be considered after that date. As of
 July 31, 1982, 295,160 Indian Tamils covered by the 1964
 agreement (plus 97,697 later offspring) had been repatriated to
 India; an additional 103,636 (plus 44,894 later offspring)
 granted Indian citzenship are still in Sri Lanka pending
 repatriation. A total of 171,176 (plus 52,178 later offspring)
 of the envisaged 375,000 have been granted Sri Lankan
 citizenship. The Government of Sri Lanka believes that the
 1964 pact is still valid; in the Government's view, the pact
 remains in effect until all 600,000 of the Indian Tamils
 originally covered by the pact are granted citizenship and
 physically repatriated to India. There is no indication that
 India is willing to negotiate further at this time.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 Sri Lanka on February 3, 1982, acceded to two additional human
 rights conventions, the International Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the
 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of
 the Crime of Apartheid. In September, Sri Lankan
 constitutional lawyer Dr. Joseph A. L. Cooray was elected a
 member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 Amnesty International sent a two-person team to Sri Lanka in
 early 1982 to update the organization's information. The
 Colombo press reported on October 27 that Amnesty International
 had recently written to President Jayewardene requesting
 discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka about the
 implementation of recommendations contained in an Amnesty
 memorandum sent to the Goverment in May 1980. The Government,
 according to the press account, had not yet replied to the
 memorandum. Full details of Amnesty's 1982 report have been
 published in the Sri Lankan press. The report stated Amnesty's
 concern about the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and
 allegations and reports about arbitrary arrest, torture, and
 deaths of prisoners. Freedom House rated Sri Lanka as "free"
 in 1982.
 A number of local civic and human rights organizations monitor
 and criticize human rights violations in Sri Lanka through
 public seminars and the publication of newsletters, press
 releases, and communications to the Government. Among the most
 active are the Civil Rights Movement of Sri Lanka and the
 Movement for Inter-Racial Justice and Equality. A
 representative for Asia of Amnesty International resides in Sri
 Lanka, but her concerns are more regional than local.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Sri Lanka is an island nation of 15 million people about the
 size of the state of West Virginia; its northernmost part lies
 18 miles off the southeast coast of India. Since independence
 in 1948, successive governments have tried to alleviate
 illiteracy, hunger, and disease in the context of an
 enlightened democratic system.
 Although primarily an agrarian society (tea, rubber, and
 coconuts are the main export crops), Sri Lanka seeks to expand
 its industrial sector, particularly through the establishment
 of foreign-owned factories in the Investment Promotion Zone
 near Colombo. To energize the stagnant economy, the United
 
 
 1277
 National Party Government liberalized import and export
 licensing and exchange and price controls, introduced tax
 incentives to attract foreign investment, and launched a
 massive capital investment program in 1977.
 A Sri Lankan citizen has a life expectancy at birth of 68
 years. The infant mortality rate is 37 per 1,000 live births
 (1978). The latest population growth rate provided by the
 Government is 2.2 percent, as compared to the 1970-80 rate of
 1.7 percent.
 While health care is widely distributed and, in principle,
 freely accessible to the people, there are still not enough
 facilities to accommodate the number of people requiring a
 hospital bed or a physician. In 1980, it was estimated that
 there was one hospital bed for every 300 persons and one
 physician for every 6,000 persons. A major hospital of 1,001
 beds donated by the Government of Japan is being constructed in
 the new capital city of Sri Jayewardenapura (eight miles east
 of Colombo). In present hospitals, there are frequent
 shortages of medicines. Power outages, equipment malfunctions,
 shortage of trained personnel, and labor strikes complicate the
 provision of health services, and some facilities are quite
 old. Communicable diseases continue to pose a major problem,
 and outbreaks of cholera and diarrheal diseases occur because
 of inadequate supplies of potable water and poor sanitation
 facilities. Medical facilities are not evenly distributed
 throughout the country. Of particular concern to the
 Government is the condition of the Indian Tamil tea estate
 laborers in the hill country. Their rate of infant mortality
 is 75 per 1,000 live births, twice the national average.
 Since 1977, there has been a steady increase in rice production
 and yield. In general, food is available, as reflected in the
 96 percent ratio of calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements. The poorest, however,
 find it more difficult now to maintain their level of food
 intake because of high prices.
 For a developing country, Sri Lanka has a high literacy rate of
 87 percent, reflecting traditional Sri Lankan emphasis on
 education and over a century of British influence on
 educational development. The de-emphasis of English in 1956
 under the first Sri Lanka Freedom Party Government resulted in
 an entire generation of Sri Lankans without adequate
 instruction in the language. As a result, Sri Lankans are now
 finding it difficult to qualify for government and private
 sector jobs that require a knowledge of English.
 As a preliminary step to reforming the educational system, the
 Government prepared a "white paper" on education and presented
 it to Parliament in January 1982 for discussion. The paper
 envisages placing more emphasis on the teaching of English,
 increasing the proportion of admissions in the universities
 based on merit rather than quotas (in order to keep standards
 at a reasonably high level), and offering private schools the
 opportunity to join the national system. Opposition political
 groups seized on the "white paper" as another issue with which
 to confront the Government and mounted a series of street
 demonstrations, leading to postponement of future action.
 As with health, education facilities are not evenly
 distributed. Most affected by the imbalance are the children
 of Indian Tamils working in tea and rubber estates. Although
 their schools are now integrated into the national educational
 
 
 1278
 system, many Indian Tamil children are not receiving an
 education that is up to the standards of the rest of the
 island. Too many still drop out of school after a few years.
 The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio estimated for
 1976-79 is 94 percent (male 98; female 90).
 Despite its high literacy rate and other encouraging
 indicators, Sri Lanka remains a poor country with many sectors
 of the economy badly in need of development. The per capita
 gross national product is roughly $270 (1981 figure). While
 entrepreneurs and farmers have benefited from incentives and
 fixed prices introduced by the present government, many others,
 particularly low-level government employees on fixed incomes,
 urban unskilled laborers, and tenant farmers, have suffered
 from the effects of an inflation rate which has ranged as high
 as 40 percent in recent years. Currently it has dropped to 10
 percent in line with worldwide trends. Unemployment is
 officially estimated at 15.3 percent (1981), down from about 24
 percent in 1977.
 Up to 150,000 Sri Lankans are believed to be working in Persian
 Gulf countries for several times the salary that they would be
 making in Sri Lanka. While creating shortages of trained
 personnel at home, the outflow of Sri Lankans has benefited the
 country greatly by repatriating large amounts of foreign
 exchange. A recent report estimated the amount of 1982
 remittances at nearly $300 million, an amount that may exceed
 the earnings from Sri Lanka's traditional number one foreign
 exchange earner, tea.
 Sri Lankan citizens have the right to acquire, hold, and
 dispose of property. Legislation passed during the 1970-77
 regime limits a family to one house per individual and allows
 landowners to hold up to 50 acres of land per individual in the
 family. House and property laws apply equally to all Sri
 Lankan citizens. Resident non-citizens, including long-term
 guest residents and Indian Tamils who have not acquired Sri
 Lankan citizenship, are not permitted to own property.
