 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
 a parliamentary democracy. After defeating the incumbent St. Vincent Labour Party
 in 1984 elections, Prime Minister James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party
 won all 15 parliamentary seats in general elections held in May 1989. Although
 some concern was voiced about the resulting absence of any parliamentary opposi-
 tion, the elections were judged to be free and fair.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 Coast Guard and a small Special Service Unit with some paramilitary training. The
 force is controlled by and responsive to the civilian Government and traditionally
 maintains standards of professionalism that place a high value on respect for
 human rights. In 1991 charges of corruption and other misconduct led the political
 opposition to call for the resignation of Police Commissioner Randolph Toussaint. An
 official one-man commission of inquiry assigned by the Government to investigate
 these allegations did not find evidence to support the charges. On December 23,
 1991, Prime Minister Mitchell announced the reinstatement of Commissioner
 Toussaint, but his tenure remained controversial in 1992.
 St. Vincent has a young population, a high rate of illiteracy relative to other is-
 lands in the Eastern Caribbean, and serious unemployment, possibly as high as 35
 percent. St. Vincent's major export product is bananas, which also represents the
 major source of foreign exchange earnings. St. Vincent has embarked on a path of
 nontraditional economic diversification, with some success in new agricultural prod-
 ucts, tourism expansion, and industrial sectors.
 The country's human righets problems included a few instances of extrajudicial
 killings b police, use of harsh treatment to extract confessions, and a backlog of
 Cass        overburdened court system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin$.-There were no political killings but
 there were several fatal shootings by the police. Although there were calls for inves-
 tigations into these shootings, there were no allegations that these incidents were
 politically motivated.

 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and there were no reports of such practices in 1992.
 However, a very high percentage of convictions (estimated at 95 percent by the
 regional human rights group, Carbbean Rights) is based on confessions. This has
 led to credible charges that harsh treatment by law enforcement officials during in-
 carceration is used to extract confessions. The local media reported several cases in
 which police officers treated suspects brutally in 1992.
 In one case of police misconduct, a female police constable was found guilty in Au.
 gust of assaulting four ward assistants in a hospital in Kingstown. The women were
 subjected to vaginal searches in response to a report of missing money by another
 hospital employee, then taken to a police station but never arrested nor charged.
 The constable was ordered by a court to pay the complainants or serve a jail term.
 Prison facilities in St. Vincent arc grossly inadequate. Overcrowding and unsani-
 tar conditions remain serious problems.
 .Arbitrary Arrest Detention, or Exie.-According to the Constitution, persons
 detained for criminal offenses are entitled to a fair hearig within a reasonable time
 by an impartial court. The Government has made progress in addressing the prob-
 lem of slow administration of justice resulting from a backlog of cases. Instances of
 arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile have not been reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials before
 an independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants are entitled to select their
 own legal counsel. Indigent defendants are provided with court-appointed attorneys
 only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defendants are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty and may appeal cases to a regional high court system
 and ultimately to the Privy Council in London. There are no separate security or
 military court systems.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens. In 1992, there were no reports of such
 abuses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press. There are two major newspapers and numeros smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and mst are openly critical of the Govern-
 ment's policies. In general, the Government does not censr or otherwise interfere
 with the operation of the press. In 1990, however, the Government withdrew its own
 advertisements and official noties from the country's leading newspaper to protest
 its critical treatment of government officials. In 1988, the government-owned radio
 station caneled a prra' that the Government onsidered provocative; the station,
 with the Government s approval, agreed late in 1989 to reinstte the program, but
 this had not been done as of the end of 1992. The Government supervises the con-
 tent of the station's programming, a fact that is often noted by opposition political
 parties. The opposition also complains that it is denied access to radio air time. On
 the other hand, St. Vincent's television station is privately owned, and its policies
 regarding coverage of opposition views and political matters in general are consid-
 ered to be evenhanded.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-All religions are free to practice and proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Notwithstanding the New Democratic Party's clean sweep of all 15 parliamentary
 seats in the May 1989 elections, St. Vincent has a genuine multiparty political sys-
 tem, with three major parties. St. Vincent's parliamentary system is based on the
 Westminister model. However, the incumbent Governor General, supported by the
 Government, refused to appoint the two opposition members to the Senate called for
 by the Constitution. He contended that because there is currently no parliamentary
 opposition and therefore no leader of the opposition, consultations concerning these
 appointments could not take place. Elections must be held at least every 5 years,
 by secret ballot, with universal suffrage. Opposition allegations of irregularities in
 some recent elections have not been substantiate&

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent Human Rights Association, affiliated
 with the regional body Caribbean Rights, closely monitors government and police ac-
 tivities, especially in the area of treatment of prisoners, publicizing any cases of
 abuse. In 1990 it published a booklet on the administration of justice which focused
 on the delays in the court system and offered a number of recommendations. The
 Government's response was to appoint an additional (part-time) judge.
 The Government is generally responsive to public and private inquiries about its
 human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under law regardless of race, sex,
 or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision. In 1989 the Government
 took a significant step forward in terms of wage scales for women by adopting a new
 minimum wage law calling for equal pay for equal work. The law went into effect
 during 1990.
 Violence against women occurs in St. Vincent, but there are no studies indicating
 its extent. Penalties for violent crimes against women are identical to those involv-
 ing acts of assault perpetrated against men. For rape, depending on the magnitude
 of the offense and the age of the victim, the penalty is generally 10 or more years
 in prison. Although some victims of domestic violence such as wife beating are reluc-
 tant to press charges, women are increasingly willing to report such incidents to the
 police and the National Council of Women. The Government's Ministry of Education
 Youth, and Women's Affairs has a women's desk which assists the National Council
 of Women with seminars, training programs, and public relations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions,
 organize employees, and strike; these rights are generally respected in practice.
 However, there is no legislation for compulsory recognition of trade unions, which
 is determined by precedent. Unions are independent of the Government and of polit-
 ical parties. Somewhat more than 10 percent of the labor force is unionized, and no
 new unions were formed in 1992. There were no major strikes in 1992. Unions are
 free to form federations and to affiliate with international labor bodies, and do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, employers are not legally bound to recognize a par-
 ticular union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of
 benefits with terms of employment better than or comparable to what a union can
 normally obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members and organizers. Generally effective mechanisms
 exist for resolving complaints. There are no export processing zones in St. Vincent.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law sets the minimum work-
 ing age at 16, although a worker must be 18 to receive a national insurance card.
 This provision, monitored and enforced by the Labour Inspection Office of the Min-
 istry of Labour, is generally respected in practice. There are no known incidents of
 child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages, which are set by law, vary
 by sector and type of work. In many sectors the minimum wage is not sufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living or workers and their families, but most workers
 earn more than the minimum. There is no legislation concerning the length of the
 workweek; however, the general practice is to work 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are
 guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labour, legislation concerning occupational safety
 and health is outdated. The Factories Act of 1955 has some regulations concerning
 only factories, but enforcement of these is ineffective de to a lack of inspectors.
