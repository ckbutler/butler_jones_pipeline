 NIGERIA
 General Sani Abacha, who seized power in a palace coup in November 1993, re-
 mained Head of State throughout 1997. Under Abacha, the main decisionmaking
 organ is the exclusively military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), which rules by
 decree. The PRC oversees the 33-member Federal Executive Council composed of
 military officers and civilians. Pending the promulgation of the Constitution written
 by the Constitutional Conference in 1995 and subsequently approved by the Head
 of State, the Government observes some provisions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitu-
 tions. The decree suspending the 1979 Constitution was not repealed and the 1989
 Constitution was not implemented. The transition timetable announced by Abacha
 in 1995, which purports to return the country to democratically elected civilian gov-
 ernment by October 1, 1998, underwent significant revisions in July. The judiciary's
 authority and independence are significantly impaired by the military regime's arro-
 gation of judicial power and p rhibition of court review of its action.
 The Government continued to enforce its arbitrary authority through the Federal
 Security System (the military, the State Security Service (SSS), the national police,
 and other regulatory and law enforcement agencies), a variety of official and quasi-
 governmental security forces, and through decrees blocking action by the opposition
 in the courts. All branches of the security forces committed serious human rights
 abuses.
 Most of the approximately 105 million population is rural, engaging in small-scale
 agriculture. Oil exports account for over 90 percent of national foreign exchange
 earnings. The economy stagnated during the year, and gross domestic product per
 capita dropped to $260 after marginal growth in 1996. The general level of economic
 activity continued to be depressed, with factory capacity utilization remaining in the
 30 percent range, and many major companies reporting lower profits and expanding
 inventories. Endemic corruption and recurring fuel shortages further hindered the
 functioning of the economy. There was a continued lack of transparency in govern-
 ment transactions. Government control over the economy remained extensive, in-
 cluding government mandated below-market fuel prices. Although the Government
 continued to espouse a program of "guided deregulation," actual steps taken to liber-
 alize investment and foreign exchange rules were disappointing.
 The Government's human rights record remained dismal. Throughout the year,
 Abacha's Government relied regularly on arbitrary detention and harassment to si-
 lence its most outspoken critics. The winner of the annulled 1993 presidential elec-
 tion, Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola, remained in detention on charges of treason, as
 did prominent politician Olu Falae, prodemocracy activist Fredrick Fasehun, and
 several others. Although Abacha announced on November 17 that he would release
 political detainees, the Government failed to do so by year's end. Security forces con-
 tinued to commit extrajudicial killings and use excessive force to quell
 antigovernment protests as well as to combat crime, resulting in the death or injury
 of many individuals, including innocent civilians. Security forces tortured and beat
 suspects and- detainees. There were many reports of sexual abuse of female suspects.
 and prisoners by security forces. Prison conditions remained life threatening; many
 prisoners died in custody. The Government repeatedly engaged in arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. Security services rou-
 tinely harassed human rights and prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders,
 journalists, and student activists. The Government also infringed on citizens' right
 to privacy.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government by peaceful means. De-
 spite the announced timetable for transition from military to multiparty rule, there
 was little meaningful progress toward democracy. Local government elections held
 on March 15 were largely peaceful, but a flawed voter registration process,
 preelection screenings of candidates, and unresolved debates over the delineation of
 constituencies cast doubts upon the exercise. In April the Government issued Decree
 Number 7, which allowed for the arbitrary removal of any elected official by the
 Head of State. Several disputes over election results remained unresolved at year's
 end. On July 3, the Transition Implementation Committee announced significant
 changes to the transition tocivil role program outlined in 1995. State assembly elec-
 tions, moved from the third to the fourth quarter of the year, took place on Decem-
 ber 6. Although they showed some improvement over the March local government
 elections, they were flawed, and the authorities annulled the results in some con-
 
 
 stituencies and called for by-elections. Under the new timetable, gubernatorial elec-
 tions originally scheduled for the end of the year were postpned until 1998, and
 the inauguration of governors and state assemblies was rescheduled for September
 1998. The presidential election remains scheduled for August 1, 1998, with the inau-
 guration of a civilian government to follow on October 1.
 The Government's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the constitutional
 court system, and harsh decrees prohibiting judicial review seriously undermined
 the integrity of the judicial process and often resulted in legal proceedings that de-
 nied defendants due process. Former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo and more
 than 30 others convicted by secret military tribunals remained in prison for their
 alleged roles in a purported March 1995 coup plot. Obasanjo's erstwhile deputy and
 outspoken National Constitutional Conference delegate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, one
 of those imprisoned for the alleged March 1995 coup plot, died in government cus-
 tody on December 8, provoking large public protests in the north. Yar'Adua's death
 appears to have been from natural causes exacerbated by lack of proper medical at-
 tention. Several days later a newspaper reported that another of the coup plotters,
 staff sergeant Patrick Usikekpo, had died in prison of typhoid fever at an undeter-
 mined date late in the year. Leading attorney and former presidential aspirant
 Otunba Olabiyi Durojaiye was held incommunicado without charge throughout the
 year, the Government ignored court orders to bring his case to court. The Govern-
 ment's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undercut the independence and
 integrity of the judicial process.
 On December 21, the Government announced the arrest of the country's second
 highest-ranking military officer, Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Oladipo
 Diya, 10 other officers, and 1 civilian on charges of coup plotting. Subsequently, the
 Government announced that it had arrested an unstated number of additional per-
 sons for roles in the purported coup plot, and that it would try the accused before
 a military tribunal. By year's end, the Government had not released details of the
 alleged plot, although its public pronouncements were prejudicial to the presump-
 tion of innocence for the accused.
 Other human rights problems included infringements on freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and travel; violence and discrimination against women; and
 female genital mutilation. Worker rights deteriorated as the Government continued
 to interfere with organized labor. The Government further weakened the independ-
 ence and viability of the labor movement by enacting decrees and taking other
 measures that restricted fundamental rights of association.
 The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), established by the Government
 in 1995 but not inaugurated until June 1996, was slow to get started but met sev-
 eral times with independent human rights groups and began a nationwide review
 of prison conditions. Public opinion of the NHRC was mixed, as some hoped that
 the Commission might prove useful while others dismissed it as irrelevant.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, security forces
 committed extrajudicial killings and used excessive force to quell antigovernment
 and prodemocracy protests and civil unrest. Credible reports by domestic human
 rights groups indicate numerous deaths of suspects in the custody of security forces.
 These reports are consistent with other credible accounts of abuse, including the use
 of torture to extract criminal confessions. The Government seldom held security
 forces accountable for their use of excessive, deadly force or for the death of individ-
 uals in custody. The Government's inaction fostered a climate of impunity in which
 these abuses flourished. Widespread violent crime prompted a proliferation of sup-
 plemental security forces, including state organized paramilitary forces, personal se-
 curity teams, special squads, civil-military task forces, and quasi-governmental vigi-
 lante groups. Security forces employed roadblocks and checkpoints where extortion,
 violence, and lethal force were common. Accounts of security officers shooting at in-
 dividuals who refused to pay bribes, comply with security orders, or who simply ap-
 peared "suspicious" resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.
 In January security forces called to quell disturbances at Lagos State University
 shot and killed two students (see Section 2.a.). In February police killed five Muslim
 demonstrators in Kano (see Section 2.c.). In April Florence Okoye, a passenger in
 a private commuter bus, was fatally wounded when members of the Lagos State
 Task Force on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offenses shot at the bus when
 the driver allegedly failed to stop on demand. The bus driver may have been in-
 volved in an earlier altercation with task force members over illegal parking; Okoye,
 who was shot in the thigh as she disembarked and subsequently bled to death, was
 
 
 an unintended casualty. On June 26, 37-year-old bus driver Bassey Paul was killed
 after security forces, including members of the National Drug Law Enforcement
 Agency (NDLEA), police, military, customs, and immigration, stopped his bus at a
 checkpoint. During an argument between competing security forces, the unarmed
 Paul was shot through the chest and died instantly. Similar accounts of excessive
 use of force and extrajudicial killings at checkpoints were recorded throughout the
 year. There has been no official reaction to the violence at checkpoints. In late No-
 vember, a mobile policeman in Delta State allegedly killed Solomon Areigbore, a
 local prince, after he drove through a roadblock without paying a bribe. The police-
 men reportedly pursued Areigbore, stopped him at his house, and then one police-
 man shot him in the head. Areigbore's death led to an attack on the divisional police
 station by local youths. The police commander for the Delta area had no comment,
 and no action had been taken against the policemen by year's end.
 On July 1, newspaper vendor Godfrey Chukwu was fatally wounded when uni-
 formed soldiers in an Operation Sweep vehicle fired shots from their car window.
 According to eyewitnesses, Chukwu was selling newspapers by the roadside and was
 shot in the head by a stray bullet. It was not clear whether the security team was
 chasing a suspect or merely firing at random. An employee of the national fertilizer
 company was shot and killed on July 12 by Rivers State Internal Security Task
 Force (RSISTF) members who opened fire on a private transport bus for allegedly
 violating travel restrictions in effect on federally designated environmental cleanup
 days. Two other passengers on the bus were injured. Secondary school student
 Saheed Arasi also died in July after becoming involved in an altercation with a po-
 liceman on the trail of suspected drug dealers. Arasi was shopping in an outdoor
 market when the policeman stopped him, accused him of criminal activity, and, de-
 spite his protests of innocence and the corroboration of nearby witnesses, shot him
 in the head at point blank range. As a result of the incident, a mob later approached
 the local police station brandishing cans of gasoline and threatening to burn down
 the office. The Government has taken no legal action against the policeman.
 Repeated fuel shortages often stimulated incidents, and armed security forces
 killed several people when special treatment was refused. In March the body of gas
 station manager Kehinde Ehindero was delivered to the Ondo state specialist hos-
 pital after armed men claiming to be NDLEA officials had arrested him earlier in
 the day. The station owner reported that the security men had become enraged after
 their request for fuel was denied because the station had only kerosene in stock.
 Hospital staff confirmed that the body was brought to the hospital by an NDLEA
 officer, who they then turned over to the police. According to police on duty, the offi-
 cer was released upon orders from "above." On June 21, an altercation at a gas sta-
 tion in Ogun state turned violent when an attendant refused to provide fuel on de-
 mand to a deputy superintendent of customs and three uniformed customs officers.
 According to eyewitness reports, the deputy superintendent hit the attendant sev-
 eral times on the head with the butt of his rifle before station manager James
 Olugbenga Dosumu intervened. The superintendent then shot the unarmed Dosumu
 in the chest at close range. He died instantly. The Government has taken no action
 against the deputy superintendent.
 Credible reports of security forces shooting people suspected of armed robbery or
 other crimes continued throughout the year, and excessive use of force in response
 to demonstrations resulted in the deaths of many unarmed civilians. On February
 6, Lagos police shot and killed seven people accused of robbery. The victims included
 an elementary school teacher. Police claimed that the suspects resisted arrest. On
 March 17, Oghenebrme Ebur was shot and killed in Warrn, Delta state, by secu-
 rity escorts of navy Captain Ekpeyong Ita during a protest march following the
 March 15 elections. Soldiers sent to quell disturbances in Warri in March were
 gven shoot-to-kill orders, but no shots were fired and no demonstrators killed. In
 August police officials in Kaduna state opened fire on demonstrators protesting the
 continued detention of religious leader Sheikh Ibrahim AI-Zakzaky and killed four
 people. In February Operation Sweep forces shot and killed two student demonstra-
 tors (see Section 2.a.). Security forces sometimes turned against each other, and as
 many as 80 people were injured and 1 policeman was killed in the northern city
 of Kano in April after fighting broke out between soldiers and policemen. Report-
 edly, the clash was caused by policemen arresting off duty soldiers suspected of
 marijuana possession. In May a confrontation between Federal Aviation Authority
 security agents and members of the Air Force Presidential Task Force turned vio-
 lent as members of the two security forces fired on each other. Although no one was
 killed, a third security force (the police) had to intervene to end the shooting. On
 September 29, four boatloads of soldiers reportedly attacked the ethnic Ijaw village
 of Ekermor Zion, Delta State, killed 1 man, detained 58 others, and destroyed 10
 homes. The attack was an apparent reprisal against the town for the earlier dis-
 
 
 260
 appearance and presumed killing of four soldiers who reportedly were involved in
 extorting money from the community.
 The harsh interrogation methods reportedly practiced by some security officers re-
 sulted in the deaths while in custody of several people. The Civil Liberties Organiza-
 tion, a domestic nongovernmental human rights group, called for a formal investiga-
 tion into the death of Victor Udoma while in the custody of the Special Fraud Unit
 of the Lagos state police. Udoma was arrested on May 12 in connection with crimes
 committed by his employer and died after 2 weeks in detention. The official report
 released by authorities attributed his death to "infectious diseases." After 6 months
 in detention by the Lagos Special Antirobbery Squad, the bodies of two security
 guards employed by a Lagos company were deposited at the state general hospital
 mortuary in January. The men were originally arrested for suspected complicity in
 a robbery at the company premises. The two were never charged with a crime and
 no explanation for their deaths has been forthcoming.
 There were no developments in the June 1996 slaying of Kudirat Abiola, out-
 spoken senior wife of M.K.O. Abiola or the October 1995 killing of political leader
 Alfred Rewane. The perpetrators were never found and the Government ceased in-
 vestigations shortly afterwards, asserting without evidence that the attack was
 staged. No progress was made in the investigation of the January 1996 attempted
 murder of prominent independent publisher Alex Ibru.
 Nigerian forces in the West African Peacekeeping Force in Sierra Leone at times
 used excessive force. In June Nigerian warships shelled Freetown, apparently trying
 to hit army headquarters. More than 30 civilians were killed in September at a
 dockside marketplace in Freetown when Nigerian troops fired at ships unloading
 rice in defiance of a West African embargo. In October Nigerian planes bombed a
 television and radio station near the capital.
 A series of bombings in Lagos, which later spread to other parts of the country,
 resulted in several deaths and many injuries. On January 7, an explosion near
 Abati military barracks in Lagos left 2 soldiers dead and 29 injured. On February
 12, a bomb in the Maryland district of Lagos injured nine persons. On May 7, a
 bomb detonated as a military truck passed a busy thoroughfare in Lagos, leaving
 four soldiers injured. An explosion in the southwestern city of Ibadan on May 12
 damaged a military vehicle but killed none of the soldiers and police on board. In
 May our people were killed and several others wounded when two bombs exploded
 in Onitsha, Anambra state, in eastern Nigeria, one outside a mosque and the other
 in an open market. An August 6 bomb blast outside a cathedral in Port Harcourt
 left one person dead. On September 2, a bomb exploded outside the offices of the
 Ekiti state military administrator. The administrator escaped unhurt but four chil-
 dren were injured. Late in 1996 and early in 1997, the Government arrested several
 leading opposition figures including Fred Fasehun and Olu Falae, and brought
 charges against government critics Wole Soyinka, Anthony Enahoro, and General
 Alex Akinrinade, all living in self-imposed exile, in connection with the bombs, but
 by year's end had not made public the substance of the case against the men (see
 Section 1.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-Government detention practices cause many persons to be
 "missing" for extended periods. The only known case of a politically motivated dis-
 appearance was that of former Razor newspaper editor Moshood Fayemiwo, who
 spent 7 months in detention before escaping to neighboring Benin in September
 1996. On February 14, Fayemiwo disappeared from the United Nations refugee
 camp where he had been living with his family. Mrs. Fayemiwo reported that her
 husband had been kidnaped by "unknown security agents," but reliable sources
 claim that he is being held incommunicado by Nigerian security services. The Gov-
 ernment was asked repeatedly about the case by the media, but did not acknowl-
 edge any involvement.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1979 Constitution (suspended) and the 1989 Constitution (never implemented)
 prohibit torture and mistreatment of prisoners and provide criminal sanctions for
 such excesses. The Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction of evidence ob-
 tained through torture. Nevertheless, detainees frequently died while in custody (see
 Section l.a.), and there were credible reports that security officers seeking to extract
 confessions regularly beat suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners. Security offi-
 cers tortured prisoners with whippings, suspension by the limbs from the ceiling,
 burning with candes, and extraction of teeth. Detainees are often kept incommuni-
 cado for long periods of time (see Section 1.d.).
 There were continued reports of torture or abuse by the Rivers State Internal Se-
 curity Task Force in Ogoniland. Reported abuses included extrajudicial killings,
 beating a victim's head with a gun butt, and arbitrary detention.
 
 
 In pursuit of their objectives, security forces, task force, and other law enforce-
 ment personnel routinely assaulted or arrested anyone perceived as uncooperative
 or "undisciplined," usually market women, traders, street hawkers, children, jay-
 walkers, or errant drivers.
 Several instances of violence against prominent individuals or strategic targets oc-
 curred throughout the year, but government investigations into the causes of the at-
 tacks were haliheartedand inconclusive. In January gunmen fired into the car of
 National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) leader Abrhm Adesanya on a busy
 Lagos street, but he escaped unhurt. The perpetrators were never found and the
 Government ceased investigation quickly, asserting that the attack was staged.
 There were numerous reliable reports that flogging, stripping, and acts of public
 humiliation, such as duck-walking or crawling, were used as punishment for minor
 infractions or public disturbances. Caning continued as a form of punishment for
 some crimes, and four men were publicly caned with 100 strokes after a court con-
 victed them of adultery under the Penal Code. Reliable sources reported witnessing
 a mobile police officer in Lagos jump on the back of a truck driver who had been
 forced onto his hands and knees at the side of the road. In another incident, an eye-
 witness reported watching mobile police officers stop a young man on a motorcycle
 and, after an argument, beat him on the head with their rifle butts. Credible reports
 continued throughout the year of security forces intervening in personal disputes
 and by publicly stripping or whipping the alleged perpetrator.
 Security forces often use force or threats to extort money from civilians. In Oyo
 state, journalist Rinde Oladele was stopped at a checkpoint by soldiers and police
 from Operation Gbale, the Oyo state paramilitary anticrime squad. The security offi-
 cers reportedly searched his car and interrogated him at gunpoint. Upon finding
 over $1,400 in local currency in the trunk, the security officers accused him of being
 a thief, demanded money, and beat him. In June a staff member of the Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR), a local nongovernmental organization
 (NGO), was stopped on the street by Operation Sweep security force personnel who
 searched him at gun point and took about $25. The CDHR also reported that in
 March, two journalists, Mallam Mohammed Abubakar of The Guardian and Alhaji
 Meto Adamu of the British Broadcasting Corporation Hausa service, were beaten
 unconscious by military officers, acting on the orders of an aide of the Yobe state
 military administrator.
 In April policemen at a Lagos state checkpoint opened fire on a minibus full of
 passengers after the driver reportedly ignored an order to stop. No one was injured
 but, upon learning that one of the passengers was the wife of Chief of General Staff,
 Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, top police officials described the incident as "embarrassing
 to the force."
 Chief Onii Egbunine, publisher of the Owerri-based newspaper, The Horn, was in-
 terrogated by an assistant to the Imo state military administrator before being se-
 verely beaten by security forces, reportedly for publishing a story alleging corruption
 at the highest levels of state government. Aides of former Chief of Defense Staff
 Brigadier General Babatunde Idiagbon severely beat a state official who arranged
 a meeting between the general and journalist Comfort Obi. The aides contended
 that the meeting, which later appeared as the cover story of Obi's magazine, had
 not been agreed to by Idiagbon. Security agents of Ogun state military adminis-
 trator Wing Commander Sam Ewang flogged Nigerian Youth Service Corps mem-
 bers who protested eviction from a state-run housing complex in July. Subsequently,
 the youths, both men and women, were forced by security officials to crawl across
 the concrete on their knees as punishment after they failed to disperse when or-
 dered by the administrator. The administrator later "reprimanded" the security men
 involved.
 For the most part, the Government neither acknowledged nor denied that security
 force abuses occurred and left perpetrators unpunished. Those security force officials
 who were punished faced, at the worst, dismissal from service and, more often, de-
 motion or a "stern reprimand." However, some officials, most notably Lagos state
 administrator Colonel M. B. Marwa, acknowledged that there had been abuses and
 said that he would try to curb them, but by year's end, he had taken no action on
 these problems.
 Prison and detention conditions remained life threatening. Lack of potable water,
 inadequate sewage facilities, and severe overcrowding resulted in unhealthy and
 dangerous sanitary conditions. Disease was pervasive in the cramped, poorly venti-
 lated facilities, and chronic shortages of medical supplies were reported. Prison in-
 mates were only irregularly allowed outside their cells for recreation, and many in-
 mates must provide their own food. Only those with money or whose relatives
 brought food regularly had sufficient food. Poor inmates often relied on handouts
 from others to survive. Prison officials, police, and security forces often denied in-
 
 
 mates food and medical treatment as a form of punishment or to extort money from
 them. Reports of sexual abuse of female prisoners were common. The Government
 derived considerable savings from the practice of leaving children born in prison
 with their jailed mothers rather than placing them in foster homes. Women are gen-
 erally housed separately from men, but juvenile prisoners, usually boys, are de-
 tained together with adults. There are no overall statistics on prison deaths due to
 harsh conditions or lack of medical treatment. However, one human rights group
 counted 56 prisoners who died in 4 Lagos prisons in 1996. Forty-three of the dead
 were males awaiting trial. The human rights group attributed the deaths to mal-
 nutrition, torture, and tuberculosis.
 Political detainees are commonly dispersed around the country, often in remote
 locations. For example union leader Frank Kokori is held in Borno state, near the
 Chadian border. Another labor leader, Milton Dabibi, is reportedly in a prison in
 the far southeast. Such action poses financial and logistical burdens on the detain-
 ees' families, in cases when visitation is allowed.
 The Government acknowledged the problem of overcrowding in the prisons and
 promised to seek a solution to the problem, but few substantive changes were made.
 A committee established in late 1996 to review the problem of overcrowding submit-
 ted a report in April that prompted the Government to direct state administrators
 to take steps to reduce prison congestion. However, no method to reduce the prob-
 lem was announced, and by year's end there was no indication that overcrowding
 had been reduced. According to 1996 prison statistics, approximately 55,000 pris-
 oners inhabit the nation's 43 prisons, which were built to hold 33,345 inmates.
 Human rights groups contend that even these figures are conservative, and Interior
 Minister Babagana Kingibe said that there were over 70,000 inmates in the prisons.
 A report by the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies stated that the num-
 ber of inmates in Ikoyi prison in Lagos exceed by 250 percent the designed capacity
 of the prison.
 Prison officials generally do not allow human rights monitors access to prisons.
 However, some NGO's fare better than others and have occasional access.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government repeatedly engaged in
 arbitrary arrest and detention. Police and security forces are empowered to make
 arrests without warrants if they believe that there is reason to suspect that a per-
 son has committed an offense; they often abused this power. The law requires that
 the arresting officer inform the accused of charges at the time of arrest and take
 the accused to a station for processing within a reasonable time. By law police must
 provide suspects with the opportunity to engage counsel and post bail. However, po-
 lice generally did not adhere to these safeguards and often held suspects incommu-
 nicado under harsh conditions for extended periods without charge. Over 50 percent
 of the nation's prison inmates are awaiting trial. In some prisons such as Ikoyi pris-
 on, 90 percent of the population were Awaiting Trial Persons (ATP's). Many of these
 ATP's have been detained for 5 years or more, with some waiting as long as 12
 years for their case to be heard in court. More than 100 supporters of Shi'ite reli-
 gious leader Sheikh Ibrahim A1-Zakzaky arrested in 1996 remain in jail and have
 not been charged with any offense.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) allows the
 Government to detain without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. When invoked, Decree
 Two suspends the detainee's civil liberties and precludes judicial review. Many citi-
 zens consider Decree Two to be the main threat to their basic freedoms, because the
 judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary detention and fails to define what con-
 stitutes acts under the Decree's purview. Decree 11 of 1994 authorizes the PRC Vice
 Chairman or the Commissioner of Police to detain persons for up to 3 months with-
 out charge.
 In June 1996, the Government announced the repeal of Decree 14 of 1994, which
 had effectively suspended the right of habeas corpus by forbidding courts from hear-
 ing cases demanding that the Government produce in court those detained under
 Decree Two. However, despite this repeal, the Government still retains full legal au-
 thority under Decree Two and Decree 12 of 1994 to detain citizens arbitrarily and
 dispense with habeas corpus challenges, and the Government regularly defied court
 orders to produce detainees. In the case of prominent attorney and politician Otunba
 Olabiyi Durojaiye, who was arrested on December 3, 1996, the Government ignored
 a court order requiring it to present Durojaiye in court on February 2, 3 months
 after his detention. The Government subsequently ignored two more calls for
 Durojaiye's appearance in court.
 Police and security forces often disregarded court orders to arraign or release de-
 tainees. Calabar businessman Effiong Henshaw was arrested by the NDLEA on
 March 12 and remained in detention at year's end as the NDLEA ignored a court
 
 
 263
 order to arraign him. An April 7 order from the Lagos federal high court to release
 Omochiere Aisagbonhi was ignored by police and Aisagbonhi, who was arrested on
 March 26 in relation to a dispute over money, remained in detention without
 charge.
 Persons unfortunate enough to be nearby when a crime is committed are normally
 held for interrogation for periods ranging from a few hours to several months. Even
 after their release, those detained are asked to return repeatedly for further ques-
 tioning. Each of the bombing incidents (see Section L.a.) was followed by the arbi-
 trary arrest of dozens of bystanders. In one bombing case, a local employee of a for-
 eign embassy was detained for several hours for questioning and required to report
 to authorities routinely for weeks.
 Relatives and friends of wanted suspects were regularly placed in detention with-
 out criminal charge to induce suspects to surrender to arrest. The wife and pregnant
 daughter of retired army officer Lieutenant Colonel Raphael Iluyomade, reportedly
 a close friend of NADECO leader Alex Akinrinade, were arrested on February 20
 by security forces searching for the lieutenant colonel. The women were held for
 over 3 months at a military installation in Apapa, Lagos. Folasade, lluyomade's
 daughter, was 4 months pregnant at the time of her arrest and miscarried while
 in detention. Neither of the women was charged with any offense. NDLEA officials
 searching for architect Chijioke Okoye, wanted in connection with the collapse of a
 building in Enugu, broke into the Okoye house on the night of July 24 and, when
 they did not find Okoye, arrested his wife. Mrs. Okoye and her 4-month-old baby
 were detained for 3 days until her husband surrendered to authorities. The wife of
 Tell magazine editor in chief Nosa Igiebor was taken into custody on the night of
 September 10, after armed security officers broke into her home, intimidated her
 children, and detained her for several hours of interrogation. According to a Tell
 press release the security agents held a gun to the head of the  ebor's 4-year-old
 daughtr and asked the child repeatedly, "Where is your father? The harassment
 came just a few days after Tell published an article on Abacha's ill health. Nosa
 Igiebor, who spent 6 months in detention in 1996, has grown accustomed to spend-
 ing much of his life in hiding as a result of the confrontational stand taken by his
 magazine.
 The Government routinely arrested, harassed, and detained without charge lead-
 ing human rights and prodemocracy activists, including the Iluyomades, who were
 presumably detained for their relative's political associations, and Otunba
 Durojaiye. Ogoni human rights activist Bari-Aara Kpalap originally arrested in Oc-
 tober 1996 by the RSISTF, remained in detention without charge. Chief Osaro
 Oseghale spent a week in detention in January for his alleged association with
 NADECO. In an apparent effort to block human rights activist Anyakwee
 Nsirimovu, executive director of the Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian
 Law (IHRHL), from meeting with visiting Organization of African Unity representa-
 tives, security officers raided IHRHL offices in Port Harcourt on March 13. The se-
 curity officers reportedly broke open doors and lockers and took documents and
 project materials.
 Several leading labor and prodemocracy activists who were arrested in 1994 re-
 mained in detention, including M.K.O. Abiola and Frank Kokori, General Secretary
 of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) (see Sec-
 tion 6.a.). General Secretary of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Associa-
 tion (PENGASSAN) Milton Dabibi, who was arrested in January 1996, remained in
 detention without charge. Dabibi was not permitted visitors. Former Petroleum
 Minister Don Etiebet was detained for several days in March (see Section 3).
 The Government routinely detained human rights monitors, journalists, and polit-
 ical opponents for making or publishing critical statements. Government security
 forces frequently harassed, arrested, detained, and threatened journalists for a vari-
 ety of reasons, including the alleged spreading of false information and printing of
 stories that exposed the actions of government officials (see Sections 2.a., 2.b., and
 4).
 Ladi Olorunyomi, the journalist wife of a prominent critic of the Government cur-
 rently living in exile, spent 2 months in detention. The Abuja bureau chief of Afri-
 can Concord magazine, Mohammed Adamu, was arrested on July 27 after his maga-
 zine published an article critical of presidential security officer Hamza A1-Mustapha,
 and he remained in detention at year's end. A reporter for the independent daily
 Vanguard, George Onah, spent a year in detention after publishing an article about
 military personnel issues and remained in prison at year's end. Onah spent 7
 months in solitary confinement and often had his arms and legs chained. The editor
 of The Week magazine, Godwin Agbroko, was arrested on December 18, 1996, and
 not released until May. Chris lkwunze, a Vanguard correspondent, and Akandem
 James, a reporter with The Punch, were arrested on September 4 and detained for
 
 
 several days after reporting that RSISTF members had impounded copies of a book
 written by the late Ken Saro-Wiwa.
 There are no reliable figures for the number of political detainees, but local
 human rights groups estimates range between 100 and 200.
 There were no known instances of forced, exile as a means of political control, al-
 though several NADECO members, including former Senator Bola Tinabu, retired
 Air Commodore Dan Suleiman, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, and elder statesman
 and senior NADECO figure Anthony Enahoro live in self-imposed exile. Other activ-
 ists such as Owens Wiwa, brother of executed Ogoni rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa,
 Ledum Mittee, President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni Peoples
 (MOSOP), and outspoken journalist Dapo Olorunyomi, joined them. An unknown
 number of Ogoni reportedly fled to neighboring countries, North America, or Europe
 in search of asylum.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Government has taken several steps to under-
 cut the independence and integrity of the judiciary. To suppress opposition to its
 rule, the regime first bypassed the regular courts in favor of "tribunals" and then
 declared itself above the law by prohibiting court review of any government action.
 Tribunal sentences are generally severe. The Government's reliance on tribunals,
 which operate outside the constitutional court system, seriously undermines the ju-
 dicial process and often results in legal proceedings that deny defendants due proc-
 ess, as in the 1995 case of Ken Saro-Viwa and his eight codefendants. The Govern-
 ment's frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undermines the integrity of the
 judicial process.
 The regular court system is composed of both federal and state trial courts, state
 appeals courts, the federal Court of Appeal, and the federal Supreme Court. Under
 the 1979 Constitution, courts of the first instance include magistrate or district
 courts, customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and for some specified
 cases, the state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court
 has jurisdiction. In principle customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction onlyif
 both plaintiff and defendant agree. In practice, however, fear of legal costs, delay,
 and distance toalternativcourtsencouragedmanylitigantstchoose these courts.
 Myriad administrative, logistical, and financial hurdles repeatedly hinder the
 work of the judicial system. One Lagos state judge conducted hearings in prison
 when prison officials informed him that there were no vehicles to transport the ac-
 cused to court. Decree One of 1984, the first decree promulgated by the military offi-
 cers who overthrew the civilian regime of President Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari in
 1983, left the institutional framework of the judiciary largely intact. However, it es-
 tablished a parallel system of military tribunals with sole jurisdiction over certain
 offenses, such as coup plotting, corruption, armed robbery, and illegal sales of petro-
 leum. A 1991 decree amended Decree One by providing that only sitting or retired
 civilian judges could preside over tribunals hearing nonmilitary cases. Decree 12
 states that "no act of the federal military Government may henceforth be questioned
 in a court of law" and "divests all courts of jurisdiction in all matters concerning
 the authority of the federal Government."
 Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of arraignment for most
 categories of crimes. Inefficient administrative procedures, petty extortion, bureau-
 cratic inertia, poor communication between police and prison officials, and inad-
 equate transportation continue to result in considerable delays, often stretching to
 several years, in bringing suspects to trial.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionally protected individual rights, including a presumption of innocence, the right
 to be present, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented by
 legal counsel. However, there is a widespread perception that judges are easily
 bribed or "settled," and that litigants cannot rely on the courts to render impartial
 judgments.
 There are no legal provisions barring women or other groups from testifying in
 civil court or giving their testimony less weight. The testimony of women is, how-
 ever, accorded less weight in Shari'a courts.
 In most cases before the tribunals, the accused have the right to legal counsel,
 bail, and appeal, although some tribunals substitute a presumption of guilt for the
 presumption of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals reportedly exceed
 conviction rates in the regular courts.
 In June 1996, in response to the report of a U.N. fact-finding team sent to inves-
 tigate human rights and the transition process, the Government announced two de-
 crees, one repealing Decree 14 of 1994, which had effectively suspended the right
 of habeus corpus (see Section 1.d.), and the other amending the Civil Disturbances
 (Special Tribunal) Decree of 1987 to remove members of the armed forces from the
 membership of the tribunal and allow for a right of appeal to the Special Appeals
 
 
 265
 Tribunal. Military personnel convicted of coup plotting do not, however, enjoy the
 right of appeal to the Secial Appeals Tribunal, and the decree remained silent re-
 garding appeals for civilians convicted of coup plotting, but all indications are that
 -the decree does not apply to-them. These changes came in the wake of the inter-
 national outcry after the November 1995 execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
 other Ogoni leaders who were convicted of murder by the Ogoni Civil Disturbances
 Special Tribunal (which included a military officer) and denied the right of appeal.
 The Ogoni 19, originally arrested in 1994 and accused of murder along with Ken
 Saro-Wiwa and the 8 Ogonis executed in 1995, remained in detention awaiting trial.
 Although arraigned in July 1996 in connection with-the murder of 4 Ogoni leaders,
 the case of the Ogoni 19 (20 men were originally arrested but 1, Clement Tusiima,
 died while in custody) has been stymied by the Government's indifference to con-
 stituting a new tribunal composed of only civilian members to hear their case. Strict
 adherence to the amendment of the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree of
 1987 precludes the hearing of the case by the tribunal that condemned the Ogoni
 9, as a military officer was a member of the board.
 Despite assurances that military-style tribunals are no longer used in nonmilitary
 cases, the practice continued. In the highly publicized trial of seven Nigerian men
 known as the "Otokoto 7," a three-member tribunal, which included a military major
 and a police superintendent, convicted and-sentenced the alleged armed robbers to
 death. The seven were permitted to appeal the tribunal's ruling; however, the ap-
 peal was heard not by a Special Appeals Tribunal but by the state military adminis-
 trator. The administrator upheld the death sentences for six of those convicted and
 commuted the sentence of one juvenile to life in prison. The six were executed by
 firing squad on July 31.
 In March the Government formally charged 16 people with treason, including
 elder statesman   Chief Anthony   Enahoro, Nobel laureate   Wole Soyinka,
 prodemocracy advocate Dr. Fred Fasehun, and prominent politician Chief.Olu Falae.
 While 12 of the accused had- been in official custody for several months without
 charge, 4 of those accused reside in self-imposed exile. Arrest warrants were issued
 for those living abroad. By year's end, little progress had been made in the case and
 .the substance of the Governments investigations had -not been revealed. The 12 ac-
 cused remained in detention while a team of lawyers, including prominent attorney
 Chief Gani Fawehinmi and senior advocates former Senator-Abraham.Adesanya and
 Chief Bola Ige, filed motions to enforce court orders granting the detainees leave
 to seek bail, access to medical treatment, and improved detention -conditions. At
 year's end, there had been no action on these motions.
 The number of political prisoners (as distinct from political detainees) held by the
 Government is also unknown (see Section Ld.). Thirty-three individuals convicted
 in 1995 of coup plotting and related charges by a secret military tribunal-remained
 in prison. These included former Head of State Olusegun Obasanjo; editor in chief
 of The Sunday Magazine Chris Anyanwu; Tell magazine assistant editor George
 Mbah; The News magazine editor Kunle Ajibade; Weekend Classique editor Ben
 Charles Obi; and chairman of the prominent human rights organization Campaign
 for Democracy (CD) Beko Ransme-Kuti. Two others convicted by the 1995 coup plot
 tribunal died while-in prison: former Obasanjo deputy and national constitutional
 conference delegate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, and Sergeant Patrick Usikekpo.
 Eleven military men allegedly involved in a 1990 coup plot against the regime of
 former President Ibrahim Babangida and convicted for their actions remained in de-
 tention despite an October 31, 1991, state pardon granted on their behalf. The Con-
 stitutional Rights Project (CRP), took their case to court and obtained in July a re-
 lease order for seven of the men. The Government ignored the court order, and at
 year's end the men were still in detention.
 Queenette Allogoa, detained in 1996 after finishing- her sentence, was released.
 The case of the Ogoni 19, arrested in 1994 in connection -with the murder of 4 Ogoni
 politicians and arraigned in July 1996, is unresolved-and those arrested xemain in
 jail.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Provi-
 -sions of the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide for the right to privacy in the
 home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. However, the mili-
 tary Government regularly interfered in the lives of citizens, and if the authorities
 desired to use a warrant in a particular search case, they often secured it from a
 military tribunal rather than a regular court. Human rights and prodemocracylead-
 ers reported that security agents regularly followed them and cut off or monitored
 their organizations' telephones. Police routinely detain relatives and friends of sus-
 pects without charge to induce suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.).
 
 
 266
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Constitutional provisions providing for freedom
 of speech and of the press were not enforceable because of the continued suspension
 of constitutional rights. The regime often publicly declared support for these free-
 doms, but it nevertheless sought to limit or confine public political dialog. The Gov-
 ernment continued its arbitrary intimidation and harassment of the press through
 legal and extralegal means.
 Although there is a large and vibrant independent domestic press that is fre-
 quently critical of the Government, the Government also owns or controls many
 publications. All newspapers and magazines are required to register with the Gov-
 ernment under the Newspaper Registration Board Decree 43 of 1993, and Minister
 of Culture and Information Walter Ofonagoro threatened to close newspapers not
 registered with the board. The registration fee is about $3,000, and the registration
 process requires editors to provide their home as well as office address. Although
 no newspaper had registered by year's end, the Culture and Information Minister
 regularly threatened to close unregistered newspapers. The regime has, at various
 times, shut independent newspapers for offenses, but there were no known cases of
 papers being prosecuted for failing to register. Ofonagoro also called repeatedly for
 a "press court" to check the "excesses" of the media. A decree establishing such
 courts was reportedly drafted but had not been promulgated by year's end. Through-
 out the year, security agents frequently harassed, arrested, and detained journalists
 (see Section 1.d.). Virtually all senior editors of publications critical of the Govern-
 ment were subject to surveillance and harassment by security agents. Some were
 driven underground by fear of arrest and operated clandestinely from numerous lo-
 cations scattered throughout Lagos; others fled the country. overnment security
 forces continued to intimidate the media with a series of arrests of editors and re-
 porters from journals critical of the Abacha regime. One human rights group esti-
 mates more than 30 journalists are in prison, including 9 journalists who were ar-
 rested during the year and remain in detention at year's end. This figure also in-
 cludes four journalists convicted of involvement in an alleged 1995 coup plot (see
 Section i.e.). Security forces detained for varying lengths of time but released at
 least 17 other journalists during the year.
 * On July 27, the Abuja bureau chief of the African Concord was arrested. Begin-
 ning in October, security forces stepped up pressure with a series of arrests of edi-
 tors and reporters from journals critical of the Abacha regime. The weekly maga-
 zines The News and Tell were particularly hard hit. On October 2, Iyoboisa
 Uwugiaren, correspondent for The News was detained by police in Lagos and re-
 leased later the same evening. On October 10, Henry Ogbolue, Kaduna correspond-
 ent of The New     s detained, reortedly beaten, and released later that day. On
 October 17, Gbenga Alaketu and A~demol a Abi mbye, both assistant editors of The
 News, were arrested in Lagos. Alaketu and Abimboye were released by year's end.
 On October 24, Seji Omotunde, editor of The African Concord, was abducted by se-
 curity operatives on a busy Lagos street. On November 4, Aoetokunbo Fakeye, de-
 fense correspondent for The News, was arrested. On November 8, Jenkins Alumona,
 editor of The News, was arrested by SSS agents at a Lagos television station. On
 November 9, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, managing editor of Tell magazine, was arrested
 by SSS agents in Lagos while driving to church with his children. On October 29,
 Osifo-Whiskey had warned that the magazine had received a written death threat,
 which listed the names of 27 staff members. On November 16, SSS agents arrested
 Babafemi Ojudu, editor of the News/Tempo. Raiu Salau, an administration editor
 for the News/Tempo, was also arrested in mid-November. On December 28, armed
 soldiers reportedly from the Directorate of Military Intelligence arrested for un
 known reasons four journalists in Lagos from the Diet newspaper, including editor
 Niran Malaolu. Thre   e   released after 1 day and instructed to report to DM1 of-
 fice weekly, while editor Malaolu remained in detention at year's end.
 Subsequent to the December 21 arrest of second-in-command Lieutenant Ceneral
 OladipoeDiya and 11 others for alleged coup plotting, the Government repeatedly
 warned journalists that they could face treason charges if they repeated unsubstan-
 tiated reports carried in international media. In issuing these strong warnings, the
 government spokesman referred to the four journalists convicted of coup-related of-
 fenses a r the fact by a secret military tribunal in 1995 (see Section i.e.).
 The Government used other means to harass and intimidate the press. These
 methods included intimidation of advertisers, surveillance of printers, seizure of
 print runs, and withholding information. For some publications, the relationship
 with the Government is so adversarial that they are forced to operate essentially
 as underground publications. The Government did not proscribe any newspapers
 during the year, although it has done so in the past.
 
 
 The Government granted broadcasting rights to private radio stations in 1994, but
 maintains careful watch over broadcasts. Television, both Nigerian and otherwise,
 is widely available. Access is limited more by substandard cable installation, elec-
 trical power surges and outages, and technical-broadcasting difficulties than by gov-
 ernment intervention. However, government-controlled broadcast media still domi-
 nate the country, and even private broadcasters do not transmit stories that criticize
 the Government. The Government continued to. enforce laws permitting only govern-
 ment broadcasters to air programs nationwide, limiting the scope of private stations.
 The Government has used the foreign content provision of the Press Law of 1993
 to revoke licenses granted to some broadcasters. The -regulation requires local tele-
 vision stations to limit programming from other countries to 40 percent; satellite
 broadcasters are limited to 20 percent. Despite the limitations, however, private tel-
 evision and radio broadcasters gained wider audiences and more robust advertising
 support. While government broadcasters complained that government funding and
 advertising were inadequate for their needs, private stations- thrived on advertising
 support alone.
 Foreign journalists are routinely required to inform the Nigerian embassy of the
 subject matter of their proposd~overage before they are granted visas. Proposing
 political coverage is discouraged and may result in the visarequest being-refused.
 There are fewer than 10 residentforeign correspondents.
 The Government increased its efforts to limit academic freedom. Security forces
 routinely monitored and on occasion interfered -with conferences they perceived as
 forums or rodemoracy or human rhts rups (see Section 2.b.). The Government
 tape records faculty conversations. The May 1996 government ban on activities by
 the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) continued. The Government
 also continued a ban on university staff unions (see Section 6.a.). Nigerian embas-
 sies often refused to issue vi to to visiting lecturers and artists. This policy limited
 discussions between foreign and Nigerian academicians on topics of mutual interest.
 In 1996 the American Studies Association of Nigeria (ASAN) annual conference
 was banned on openingday by the SSS. In April the annual conference was post-
 poned until August when the Nigerian Universties Commission (NUC) sent a letter
 to all university vice chancellors rommending that they discourage their staff from
 attending the confernce, and later canceled entirely when it became clear that the
 authorities would not allow the conference to proceed. In June the University of Jos
 announced with great fanfare the establishment of an American studies diploma
 prgram. Only days later, the program was officially put on indefinite hold by the
 NUC, reportedly actingoinstructions from the Government.
 Security forcs were called in to quell campus disturbances several times during
 the year. Some student activities, such as elections, were disrupted by security
 agents. Student groups believe that university authorities followed government di-
 rectives to suspend or expel activist students. In a Januar      confat the
 Federal Polytechnic in Offa, Kwara state, 10 students were arrested, reportedly as
 a result of their involvement in student elections. The students were held without
 charge for 2 weeks, released, and then expelled from school. The parents of two
 other students, who were sought but not found on campus, were arrested in place
 of their children. The parents were released by September. On February 10, the
 Vice Chancellor of Lagos State University (lsU) called on Operation Sweep forces
 to quell disturbances on campus that he attributed to "cult violence." Two students
 were shot and killed by the sweep team and several others were injured. On Decem-
 ber 10 and 11, security forces were again used to stop student demonstrations at
 LASU that erupted after the university's dismissal of student union leaders.
 Eighteen professors were arrested at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, after stu-
 dent unreston the campus in February. Eight of the professors, one of whom was
 the former chairman of the Nsukka wing of the banned Academic Staff Union of
 Universities (ASUU), were later charged with sedition and arson. The professors
 maintained their innocence and argued that the student demonstration was merely
 a reaction to proposed increases in school fees. The professors were reportedly re-
 leased, although their cases have yet to be resolved. In August thousands of second-
 ary school students demonstrated in Kaduna, calling for the resignation of state
 military administrator Colonel Hameed Ali. When tear gas proved ineffective in dis-
 persing the demonstrators, police spokesman Tanimu Bindawa warned that, in the
 future, police would have "no other option than to shoot;" no further student pro-
 tests took place by year's end.
 b. Freedom of Peceful Assembly and Association.-pThe two Constitutions provide
 citizens with the right to assembl freely and associate with other persons in politi-
 cal parties, trade unions, or special interest associations. However, the Government
 proscribed all political activity 1 day after coming to power in 1993. In August 1994,
 Abacha announced that "individuals or groups may henceforth canvass political
 
 
 ideas, but they cannot form political parties for now." In June 1995, the Government
 announced a partial lifting of the ban on political activity, but it was not until June
 1996 that a reconstituted National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) an-
 nounced cumbersome and complex requirements for registering political parties.
 Parties were allowed an unrealistic 6-week period in which to satisfy requirements
 that included registering 40,000 members in each of the then 30 states and 15,000
 in the federal capital territory of Abuja and issuing photo identity cards to each of
 them. Despite the logistical difficulty of satisfying NECON's requirements, 23 par-
 ties purchased registration forms 0mNEGOh for approximately $6,000; 18 of
 them submitted the forms and supporting documentation by the deadline.
 In response to widespread protests over the registration process, NECON an-
 nounced in 1995 a new exercise allowing the 18 groups to apply for mergers. The
 merger requests required another burdensome set of documents, including addresses
 of the national, state and local government council chapters of the party; the new
 name, constitution, acronym, symbol, and manifesto of the party; and the names of
 proposed staff members at al levels of the organization. In September 1996,
 NECON announced the registration of five parties and ordered all other parties to
 be dissolved, effectively preventing the participation of the majority of established
 politicians and potential opposition leaders.
 Although Abacha announced the lifting of remaining restrictions on political ac-
 tivities in his October 1, 1995, Independence Day address, he did not issue the ena-
 bling decree until February 1996. When the text of the decree was released in
 March 1996, it became clear that the Government had negated its decree lifting re-
 strictions on political activity by establishing vague new categories of crimes for im-
 peding the transition to democracy, which carried a penalty of 5 years in prison for
 those found guilty. This action effectively allowed the regime to remove its oppo-
 nents from the political scene until after completion of the transition program (see
 Section 3).
 The Government continued to repress the political activities of opposition groups.
 A number of public meetings were arbitrarily canceled or prevented during the year,
 including cultural events, academic conferences, and human rights meetings (see
 Section 2.a.). While permits are not normally required for public meetings indoors
 and permit requirements for outdoor public functions are often ignored by both gov-
 ernment authorities and those assembling, the Government retained legal provi-
 sions banning gatherings whose political, ethnic, or religious content might lead to
 unrest. Security forces used permit requirements as one of the justifications for dis-
 rupting prodemocracy conferences, meetings, or seminars. Open-air religious serv-
 ices away from places of worship remained prohibited in most states due to religious
 tensions in various parts of the country (see Section 2.c.). Although most religious,
 professional, and other organizations do not have to register with the Government
 and are generally permitted to associate freely with other national and foreign bod-
 ies, the regime significantly tightened regulations on organized labor (see Section
 6.a.).
 The Government continued to ban political organizations that it contended were
 founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial lines for the pur-
 pose of sponsoring various political candidates. Only the five government-sanctioned
 political parties may sponsor political candidates.
 In February a seminar organized by the Katsina state branch of the Nigeria
 Union of Journalists (NUJ) was cordoned off by antiriot police, who turned away
 union members and dignitaries. Police officers in the northern city of Kaduna pre-
 vented the holding of three meetings scheduled by NGO's for March 1. The various
 venues of the meetings, which were to address the issues of human rights, labor
 unions, and the progress of the transition program, were closed by police, who in
 two cases used tear gas to disperse participants. A May 1 workshop on conflict man-
 agement in Port Harcourt was canceled when the SSS warned local coordinators
 that such a meeting could not be held on Workers Day, a local holiday. Similar
 workshops elsewhere proceeded unimpeded despite the holiday. In August a semi-
 nar organized by the Bureau of African Labor, Human, and Democratic Rights was
 canceled after police occupied the seminar site and ordered participants to disperse.
 On August 27, police canceled a reception and award ceremon organized by the
 domestic NGO, Human Rights Africa (HRA), in honor of Justice Elizabeth Kayissan
 Pognon, President of Benin's Constitutional Court, arrested ARA director Tunji
 Abayomi, and detained him for 3 days. On September 25, police and SSS agents
 broke up an nRA seminar for students in Jos, arrested Abayomi and 4 others, and
 briefly detained some 70 students. Abayomi and the others were held for 10 days
 and then released on bail. On August 28, security forces prevented the public
 launching of a book entitled "Abiola, Democracy and Rule of Law," which was pub-
 lished susequently. In September a farewell reception hosted by Nigerian democ-
 
 
 269
 racy and human rights NGO's in honor of a departing foreign ambassador was dis-
 persed by uniformed military and police officers, who forcedtheir way into the pri-
 vate residence where the party was being held and ordered guests at gunpoint to
 disperse.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of belief,
 practice, and religious education provided for by the suspended 1979 and 1989 Con-
 stitutions. Both Constitutions also prohibit state and local governments from adopt-
 ing an official religion. The Government instituted a ban in 1987 (which is still in
 effect) on religious organizations on campuses of primary schools, although individ-
 ual students retain the right to practice their religion in recognized places of wor-
 s hi,
 Distribution of religious publications remained generally unrestricted. There is a
 lightly enforced ban on pu lished religious advertisements, and religious program-
 ming on television and radio remains closely controlled by the Government. While
 it did not outlaw the practice, the Government discouraged proselytizing in the be-
 lief that it stirs up religious tensions. The Government continued to enforce a ban
 on open-air religious services away from places of worship (soe Section 2.b.).
 Both Christian and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fairs and the Immigration Department restrict the entry into the country of certain
 religious practitioners, particularly persons suspected of proselytizing.
 Isolated incidents of religious tension, either motivated by or resulting in govern-
 ment intervention, occurred throughout the year. Both Muslim and Christian groups
 were affected by these incidents. The continued detention of Shi'ite religious leader
 Sheikh Ibrahim al-Zakzaky sparked demonstrations in northern Nigeria that were
 handled harshly by government security forces. In January over 100 people were ar-
 rested in Sokoto when police raided a meeting in a mosque where plans to "breach
 the peace" were allegedly being discussed. On February 7, the Muslim holy day
 marking the end of Ramadan, police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators in Kano
 and killed at least five persons. The Government took no action against the police
 who had fired on the demonstrators. In July similar protests in Kaduna also re-
 sulted in some deaths.
 Over 100 people were arrested in late 1996 after the September arrest of Zakzaky
 led to a series of demonstrations by his followers. Zakzaky was arraigned in late
 July on charges of inciting disaffection against the federal and Kaduna state govern-
 ments and publishing and distributing magazines critical of the regime. Zakzaky
 has repeatedly called for the establishment of Islamic government and urged sup-
 porters to reject the authority of the present regime. Many of his followers who were
 arrested during demonstrations in 1996 remained in detention without charge.
 In June Lagos state police and Operation Sweep members raided the Agege area
 of Lagos and arrested at least 36 people believed to be members of the Maitatsine
 religious sect. A subsequent raid in August reportedly resulted in over 200 arrests,
 and those detained remain in prison at year's end. The Maitatsine follow the teach-
 ings of Maitatsine Marwa, an Islamic leader from Cameroon whose activities in Ni-
 geria led to his expulsion from Kano in 1960 and a series of bloody uprisings in the
 1980's in which more than 4,000 persons are believed to have died. According to
 many sources, hundreds of supporters of the two main Islamic groups in northern
 Nigeria, the Islamic Brotherhood and the Tajdid Jihad lslamiya, were detained for
 varying periods during the year, while others "disappeared."
 A Palm Sunday procession in Ilorin, Kwara state was dispersed by soldiers after
 a member of the procession asked a car owner, a military officer, to remove his vehi-
 cle from the procession route. In response the officer reportedly ordered his col-
 leagues to disperse the crowd, and the soldiers proceeded to whip members of the
 religious gathering. The Government took no action against the officer or the sol-
 diers. Several Christian leaders who were outspoken on political issues reported
 being harassed, being threatened by unknown persons, and receiving threatening
 letters.
 A debate over taxation of religious organizations was sparked in June when the
 Ifelodun/Ajeromi local government council of Lagos state sent notices to local
 churches that they would soon be required to pay a fee of about $110 (10,000 naira)
 under a new religious premises permit edict. Christian and Muslim leaders united
 against the proposed legislation, and the federal Internal Revenue Service soon de-
 nied that there was any plan to tax religious bodies.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The two Constitutions entitle citizens to move freely throughout the
 country and reside where they wish. However, increasing violent crime in many
 parts of the country prompted police to set up roadblocks and checkpoints where se-
 curity and law enforcement officials routinely engaged in extortion, violence, and ex-
 cessive use of force (see Section 1. a.).
 
 
 270
 The Constitutions also prohibit expulsion or denial of exit or entry to any citizen.
 In practice, however, women must often obtain permission from a male family mem-
 ber before being granted a passport, and the Government commonly prevented trav-
 el for political reasons. Throughout the year, the Government seized the passports
 of critics.
 Journalists reported harassment at the nation's airports by security officials, in-
 cluding being required to fill out special entry and exit forms detailing their move-
 ments abroad, reasons for traveling, and names of friends and associates overseas.
 Security officials continued to interrogate and temporarily confiscate the passports
 of journalists seeking to travel. The Government assigned security personnel to
 Murtala Mohammed International Airport to screen departing passengers and ap-
 prehend prodemocracy supporters. Government security agents questioned exten-
 sively citizens who had been issued U.S. visas. Agents reportedly had orders to seize
 passports and detain citizens whose responses were not satisfactory. Some travelers
 were transferred to military intelligence officers or SSS personnel for further ques-
 tioning.
 The passport of Eke Ubiji, Executive Secretary of Amnesty International Nigeria,
 was seized in December 1996 when he attempted to travel to London for an official
 workshop. The passport remained with security officials throughout the year. On
 July 26, the Executive Director of the independent human rights monitoring group
 Media Rights Agenda, Edetaen Ojo, was prevented from traveling when security
 agents seized his passport at the airport. After his flight had departed, his passport
 was returned and he was allowed to go home. NADECO leader Abraham Adesanya
 sought in July to regain his passport, which had been held since his detention in
 the wake of the 1995 murder of Kudirat Abiola, to enable him to travel for a special
 meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. The passport was returned
 the day before his proposed travel but had expired and was not renewed. Former
 chairman of the editorial board of the daily The Guardian and a visiting professor
 of journalism at a U.S. university, Olatunji Dare, was detained overnight and his
 passport seized upon his arrival from the United States on June 2. He was told to
 report to the SSS to retrieve his passport. After being interrogated on June 17 by
 SSS officials about his activities abroad, his passport was returned. Many human
 rights and prodemocracy activists preferred to use alternative travel routes for fear
 of being stopped by security agents, and some reported that they circumvented po-
 tential problems with travel documents by having them renewed at embassies and
 consulates abroad.
 The Government cooperates with the Lagos office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies in assisting
 refugees through the National Commssion for Refugees and its Federal Commis-
 sioner. Regulations governing the granting of refugee status, asylum, and resettle-
 ment are outlined in Decree 52 of 1989, which incorporates many aspects of the
 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Ref-
 ugee and resettlement applications are reviewed by the Eligibility Committee estab-
 lished under Decree 52. A representative from the UNdCR participates in this com-
 mittee. The issue of the provision of first asylum has not arisen since the establish-
 ment of the National Commission for Refugees under Decree 52.
 There are an estimated    5,000 to 6,000 Liberian, 1,400 Chadian, 1,500
 Cameroonian, 140 Ghanaian, 100 Sierra Leonean, and an undetermind number of
 Togolese, Somalian, Sudanese and Ethiopian refugees. The UNHCR, in cooperation
 with the Government, began a program of voluntary repatriation of Liberian refu-
 gees in July. There were no reports that refugees were expelled. There were no re-
 ports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 i,&ent
 Citizens did not have the right to change their government in 1997. There was
 little indication that Abacha's military regime intended to allow citizens to exercise
 this right other than through a process tightly controlled by the regime. Laws con-
 tinued to be made by decree approved by the Head of State. Throughout the year,
 the regime committed numerous, repeated, and serious human rights abuses in its
 effort to prevent citizens from mounting peaceful opposition.
 After coming to power, the PRC headed by General Sani Abacha promised to re-
 turn the country to civilian, democratic role but did not provide a timetable until
 Abacha's 1995 Independence Day address. In this speech, Abacha an aucd a tran-
 sition timetable leading to inauguration of a civilian president on October 1, 1998.
 The transition process provided for a series of local, state, and federal elections over
 the 3-year period. After significant delays and repeated organizational problems
 marred the original transition program, the head of the Transition Implementation
 
 
 271
 Committee, a government body set up to oversee and advise on the program, an-
 nounced in July significant changes to the transition timetable delaying the dates
 for gubernatorial and state assembly elections. The National Assembly elections,
 however, are still scheduled to take place in the second quarter of 1998 and the date
 for inauguration of a new government remained October 1, 1998.
 By year's end, there was little meaningful progress towards democracy despite
 Abacha's 3-year transition program. Local government elections originally scheduled
 for late 1996 were held March 15, but significant problems with voter registration,
 the delineation of constituencies, guidelines for the conduct of elections, and the
 screening of candidates remained even after the elections were held, casting doubts
 on the process. At year's end, disputes over the results of several elections were still
 pending before the government- appointed election tribunals, and questions re-
 mained as to whether the boundaries of local government areas and wards would
 again be shifted, leading to the removal of some elected officials. In April the Gov-
 ernment promulgated a decree granting the Head of State the authority to replace
 at will any elected, local government official with a sole administrator and forbid-
 ding court review of election contests. At year's end, the Government had not used
 this authority.
 Most leading politicians remained outside the political arena, after key political
 parties were denied registration by the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria
 (NECON) in 1996 (see Section 2.b.). NECON retained the right to revoke the reg-
 istration of political parties at any time, leaving a loophole to disqualify parties for
 arbitrary reasons. Individual members of unregistered parties are permitted to join
 the officially registered parties. Former Petroleum Minister and prominent political
 figure, Don Etiebet, founded the National Center Party of Nigeria (NCPN), which
 was registered by NECON. Early in the year, Etiebet made public his intention to
 run for the presidency under the NCPN banner. On March 15, the day of local gov-
 ernmient elections, security operatives arrested Etiebet. He was detained for several
 days; upon his release, he gave a press conference in which he renounced his presi-
 dential ambitions and announced his decision to transfer to the dominant United
 Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP).
 At the end of the year, the electoral process had failed to generate popular sup-
 port for the authorized political parties or their leadership. The possibility of the
 transition program producing a serious presidential candidate other than Abacha
 appeared remote. State assembly elections took place on December 6, but voter turn-
 out was very low.
 The Government took no further action against 10 former state administrators re-
 moved from their positions in 1996, reportedly for their activities while holding of-
 fice. None of the administrators were formally charged with any offense.
 Politics remained dominated by men. However, there are no legal impediments to
 political participation or voting by women or members of any minority group. There
 are three women in the Cabinet announced on December 15 and female judges and
 magistrates at all levels of the judiciary. Government regulations restrict the par-
 ticipation of dual nationals in politics (NECON guidelines for local government elec-
 tions stipulated that dual nationals may not ron for office), but the regulations were
 only loosely enforced. There were several reports that minority voters living outside
 their traditional regions were prevented from voting by overly zealous government
 officials.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permittediocal human rights groups to operate but often inter-
 fered with their activities, detaining and intimidating their members, and prevent-
 ing them from criticizing the-Government's human rights record (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.a.). High-level government officials regularly denounced the activities of the
 human rights community, often accusing its members and the independent press of
 participating in foreign-inspired plots to destabilize the country.
 Notwithstanding the Government's hostile attitude, domestic and international
 human rights groups engaged in a vocal and public campaign to promote human
 rights. Among the most active organizations are: the Civil Liberties Organization;
 the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights; the Constitutional Rights Project;
 the National Association of Democratic Lawyers; Human Rights Africa; and the
 Legal Research and Resource Development Center. A number of prominent authors,
 artists, educators, and jurists, in addition to professional and labor organization
 leaders, spoke out frequently on human rights issues as well. Amnesty international
 is active and the International Committee of the Red Cross has a regional office in
 Lagos.
 
 
 The regime established a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in 1996,
 but the scope of its activities was hindered by lack of adequate funding and organi-
 zational support. Although some NGO's agreed to coordinate with the NHRC, the
 Commission lacked credibility as an.independent monitoring body. The Commission
 was further hampered by the lack of a clear mandate to do anything other than con-
 vene meetings. The Commission did begin reviewing some cases submitted for adju-
 dication and was instrumental in procuring the release of some people who had been
 detained without trial for periods exceeding 10 years. The Commission embarked on
 a factfinding tour of the nation's prisons. However, repeated requests for the NHRC
 to review the cases of alleged coup plotters and political detainees went unanswered.
 The Government impeded visits by foreign human rights monitoring gups and
 individuals by delaying or refusing visas and attempting to manipulate their sched-
 ules. The most notable example was the aborted trip in Februar of United Nations
 special rapporteurs who intended to review problems of judicial independence and
 extrajudicial killings. The rapporteurs, who initially had received government assur-
 ances of access to detainees, were later denied assurances of access to alleged coup
 plotters convicted by secret military tribunals and detained political figures such as
 M.K.O. Abiola and postponed the trip "indefinitely." After the Government pre-
 vented a delegation from the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group from meeting
 with human rights and prodemocracy leaders, several groups were invited to Lon-
 don by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to present their points of view.
 In August a prominent jurist from Benin, who was to receive an award from
 Human Rights Africa, canceled her trip to Lagos following a warning by government
 officials to diplomats at the Benin embassy in Lagos that she should not enter Nige-
 ria.
 Since November 1995, the International Labor Organization (ILO) has repeatedly
 called on the Government to receive an ILO direct contacts mission to examine vio-
 lations of workers rights and to visit prominent detained labor leaders. In a June
 18 letter to the ILO, the Government agreed that such a mission could take place
 in September. Several days before the planned departure of the mission, however,
 the Government notified the ILO that September was no longer suitable. The ILO
 has expressed "grave concern" over the Government's continual postponement of the
 mission.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide citizens with the right to freedom
 from discrimination based on "community, place of origin, ethnic group, sex, reli-
 gion, or political opinion." However, customary and religious discrimination against
 women persisted, and tension between the Government and disaffected minority
 groups also continued.
 Women.-Reports of spousal abuse were common, especially those of wife beating
 in polygynous families. Police did not normally intervene in domestic disputes,
 which were seldom discussed publicly. The Penal Code permits husbands to use
 physical means to chastise their wives as long as it does not result in "grievous
 arm," which is defined as loss of sight, hearing, power of speech, facial disfigure-
 ment, or other life-endangering injuries. In more traditional areas, courts and police
 were reluctant to intervene to protect women who formally accused their husbands,
 if the level of alleged abuse did not exceed customary norms in the area. Purdah,
 the Islamic practice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men outside the
 family, continued in parts of the far north.
 Women also bore the brunt of attacks for social and religious reasons, particularly
 for "immodest" or "inappropriate" behavior. There were credible reports that sus-
 pected prostitutes in Lagos (prostitution is not illegal; pandering is) were detained
 routinely by security forces and subjected to involuntary HIV testing. The extent to
 which this action was part of a national government policy was not clear, and what
 sanctions would be placed on those who tested positive for the virus remained unde-
 termined. In January women wearing trousers were prevented from entering the
 federal secretariat in Abuja, sparking a national debate over standards of immodest
 or inappropriate dress for women. In February the Government announced that
 women in trousers were to be permitted free access to government buildings.
 Women experienced considerable discrimination as well as physical abuse. There
 are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment, but women often
 experienced discrimination because the Government tolerates customary and reli-
 gious practices that adversely affect them. Women remained underrepresented in
 the formal sector, but played an active and vital role in the country's increasingly
 important informal economy. While the number of women employed in the business
 sector increases every year, women do not receive equal pay for equal work and
 
 
 often frind it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or obtain tax deductions
 or rebates as heads of households.
 While some women have made considerable individual progress, both in the aca-
 demic and business world, most remained underprivileged. Although women are not
 legally barred from owning land, under some customary land tenure systems only
 men can own land, and women gain access to land through marriage or family. In
 addition many customary practices do not recognize a woman's right to inherit her
 husband's property, and-many widows are rendered destitute when their in-laws
 take virtually all of the deceased husband's property. In other areas, a widow is con-
 sidered part of her husband's property and she too may be "inherited" by his family.
 Polygny continued to be widely practiced-among all ethnic groups -in both Christian
 and Islamic -communities. Women were sometimes .rquired to obtain permission
 from a male family-mnember to get a pasot(see Section 2.d.). The testimony of
 women is not equat at of men    h' courts (see Section .e.).
 Children.-The Government remained only sporadically committed to children's
 rights and welfare. Puhlic schools continued to deteriorate, and limited facilities pre-
 cluded access to education for many children. The requirement for compulsory pri-
 mary education is rarely .enforced. While the Government has increased spending
 on children's health in recent years, it seldom enforced even the inadequate laws
 designed toprotect the rights of children.
 Although the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be imprisoned," ju-
 venile oftnders are routinely incarcerated along with hardened criminals. The oy-
 emrnent only occasionally condened child abuse and neglect andmade little effort
 to stop customary practices harmful to children, such as the sale uf young girls into
 marriage. There were credible reports that poor families sold their daughters into
 marriage as a means of supplementing their income. Young girls were often forced
 into marriage as soon as they reached puberty, regardless of age, to prevent the "in-
 decency" associated with premarital sex.
 The Government publicly oppsed female genital mutilation (FGM) which is wide-
 lycondemned byinternational health experts as damagingto both physical and psy-
 chological health. However, the G3overnment took only limited steps to abolish the
 procedure. Government officials have supported the campaign against FGM, which
 is. spearheaded by private groups. In February the Minister of Health, Ihechukwu
 Ciadubuike, announcedthat the Government had established a25-person committee
 to study the issue, but no results from the study were available at year's end. FGM
 is -practiced extensively in all parts of the country and among all religious groups,
 and many-ethnic groups continued to subject young females to FGM. Current esti-
 mates place the prevalence of FGM between 60 anG0 percent. According to a 1997
 World health Organization (-WHO) study, an estimated 30.6 million women and
 girls, or about 60 percent of the nation's total population, have experienced FGM.
 Ae1996 United Nations Development Systems (UNDS) study reported a similar
 number of 32.7 million women affected by FGM. However,- according to recognized
 experts in FGM study in Nigeria, the actual prevalence of FGM may be much high-
 er than either of the figures reported by WHO or UNDS, for there is speculation
 that many communities may be less than straightforward with information regard-
 ing their FGM practices. For example some          ofata indicate that the prevalence of
 FGM could be as high as 90 percent. Other local experts estimated that as many
 as 50 percent of women have undegone FgM, and most agreed that the number
 of young girls now facing FGM is declining. Indigenous forms of FGM vay from the
 simple removal of the clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the clitoris and
 the most dangerous form, infibulation. The age at which females are subjected to
 _FGM varies from the first week of life until after a woman delivers her first child.
 The Ministry of Health and many NGO's sponsored public awareness projects to
 educate communities about the health hazards of FGM. The press openly con-
 dened the practice.
 People With Disabilities.--While the Government called for private businesses to
 institute policies ensuring fair treatment for the disabled, it did not enact any laws
 requiring greater accessibility to buildings or public transo rtation nor did it formu-
 late any policy specifically ensuring the right of the disabled to work. The Govern-
 ment announced its intention to establish a National Rehabilitation Institute and
 resource center in Abuja and encouraged the work of private organizations involved
 with the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonetheless, re-
 ports were common that government officials discriminated against persons practic-
 ing a religion different from their own. Private businesses are frequently guilty of
 infomal religious discrimination in their hiring practices.
 Religious tensions led to several instances of violence during the year. There were
 regular clashes in northern Nigeria between Shi'ite Muslim groups and Sunni Mus-
 
 
 lirs, which resulted in deaths and injuries. Sporadic incidents of attacks on individ-
 ual religious leaders were reported, but the nature and perpetrators of the attacks
 were various, and there was not a pattern of one religious group attacking another.
 National/Racial[Ethnic Minorities.-The Government has promulgated no official
 policy concerning discrimination against any of the more than 250 ethnic groups,
 and laws do not favor one group over another. However, there is a long history of
 tension among the diverse ethnic groups. Clashes continued between rival ethnic
 ups in Delta, Rivers, Benue, Cross River, Bayelsa, Osun, Kaduna, Plateau, and
 aba states, often resulting in casualties. Tradition continued to impose consider-
 able pressure on individual government officials to favor their own ethnic group,
 and ethnic favoritism persisted. The ongoing government review of boundaries for
 state and local government areas sparked several communal clashes, most notably
 in Ife-Modakeke, Osun state (that by some estimates cost over 100 lives), and the
 Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict in Delta state (that has led to over 110 deaths according to un-
 official estimates).
 The Ogoni, an ethnic group indigenous to Rivers state in eastern Nigeria (one of
 the oil-producing regions), maintained that the Government continued a systematic
 campaign to deprive the group of its land and wealth. Members of the Ogoni group
 claimed that the Government seized their property without fair compensation, ig-
 nored the environmental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and failed to pro-
 vide adequate public services, such as water and electricity. The confrontation be-
 tween the Government and the Ogoni remained tense at times. The Movement for
 the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), an NGO that campaigns for Ogoni au-
 tonomy, described government policy toward the Ogoni as genocide. Ogoni concerns
 about environmental degradation and the quality of social services have merit. The
 Ogoni 19, accused of murdering 4 Ogoni leaders in July 1994, remained in detention
 at year's end (see Section i.e.) as did other Ogonis suspected of opposing the Gov-
 ernment. On November 10, military authorities in the Ogoni area banned all public
 meetings to prevent public demonstrations on the second anniversary of the hanging
 of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa. The ban, backed by a heavy armed forces presence,
 was effective. MOSOP leaders claimed on December 29 that authorities had in-
 creased harassment of Ogoni residents and arrested 20 people in an alleged attempt
 to forestall the January 4 commemoration of Ogoni Day.
 Other ethnic minorities, particularly in Delta, Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom
 states have echoed Ogoni claims of environmental degradation and government in-
 difference to their development. Groups such as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo grew
 increasingly vocal in expressing their unhappiness, while incidents of ethnic conflict
 and confrontation with government forces increased significantly in these areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Worker rights further deteriorated as the Govern-
 ment continued its far-reaching interference in the affairs of organized labor. Since
 1994, the Government has systematically weakened the independence and viability
 of the labor movement by enacting decrees to restrict selection of union leaders; di-
 recting union mergers; dissolving some unions entirely; and throwing into question
 the legal status of other labor organizations. In 1997 the Government officially an-
 nounced two new decrees that seriously infringe upon worker rights: Decree 26 of
 1996 grants the Labor Minister broad administrative authority to dissolve unions,
 while Decree 29 of 1996 prohibits union affiliation with international labor organiza-
 tions, except with express government approval. The Government continues to ad-
 minister directly the central labor body and two key petroleum unions, refusing to
 allow a return to freely elected leadership. Despite domestic and international p eas
 for their release, two prominent union leaders remain detained without charge. Ni-
 geria's frequent disregard for the right of association drew concern and condemna-
 tion from the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees designated as essen-
 tial by the Government, may join trade unions. Essential employees include fire-
 fighters, police, employees of the central bank, the security printers (printers of cur-
 rency, passports, and government forms), and customs and excise staff. Since issu-
 ing the Teaching Essential Services Decree in May 1993, the Government has con-
 sidered education an essential service. The Decree did not, however, proscribe edu-
 cation sector unions.
 By law any nonagricultural enterprise employing 50 or more people in commerce
 or industry must allow blue-collar and clerical employees to unionize and must insti-
 tute a compulsory dues checkoff. The Government has in the past withdrawn the
 obligatory dues checkoff provision when unions pursue strikes, as in the cases of the
 1993 general strike and the 1994 petroleum strike.
 
 
 Approximately 11.5 percent of the total work force belong to unions. With the ex-
 ception of a small number of workers in food processing enterprises, the agricultural
 sector, which employs some 70 percent of the work force, is not unionized. Most of
 the informal sector and practically all small businesses remain nonunionized.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except for those performing essential
 services. However, workers are required to give 21 days' notice prior to commencing
 a strike. Numerous public and private sector strikes occurred, often due to nonpay-
 ment of salaries or noncompliance with previous agreements.
 There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers and strike leaders, but
 strikers who believe that they experience unfair retribution may submit their cases
 to the Industrial Arbitration Panel (lAP) with prior approval of the Labor Ministry.
 Decisions of the IAP are binding on all parties, but may be appealed to the Nigerian
 Industrial Court (NIC). Union representatives have described the arbitration proc-
 ess as cumbersome and time consuming.
 Since 1978 the Government-has mandated a single trade union structure with
 service and industrial unions grouped under the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC). The
 NLC claims to represent 3 million workers out of a total work force of 30 million.
 In 1994 the Government dissolved the elected National Executive Council of the
 NLC and placed it under the authority of a government-appointed sole adminis-
 trator. Despite repeated promises over a period of several years that a freely elected
 executive council would replace the sole administrator, the Government took no
 credible steps to hold such elections. Although state-level NLC executive councils
 continue to function, direct government control over the NLC at the national level
 prevents it from representing workers in any credible manner.
 In 1994 the Government also dissolved the elected national executive councils of
 two key oil sector unions, the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Work-
 ers (NUPENG), and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Associations
 (PENGASSAN). The unions remain under the authority of government-appointed
 sole administrators, despite ILO calls for a return to freely elected leadership.
 In 1996 the Government unveiled the Trade Unions (amendment) Decree, known
 as Decree 4. The measure reduced-the number of industrial trade unions from 41
 to 29 through directed mergers; barred full-time union managers and organizers
 from seeking elective positions in the NLC or the unions that employ them; directed
 unions to collect dues on behalf of the NLC; and included a clause to preclude judi-
 cial challenges to the decree. The Government has yet to officially register four of
 the newly merged unions prescribed by Decree 4.
 In the past, mid-level employees, termed "senior staff," have been allowed to form
 labor unions, called senior staff associations, but these were not permitted to affili-
 ate with the NLC. These staff associations formed a nationwide body, the Senior
 Staff Consultative Association of Nigeria (SESCAN), in 1985. Though comprised of
 22 affiliates with a potential membership of some 600,000, SESCAN is not recog-
 nized by the Government. In the midst of a 1986 strike involving senior university
 staff, the Government ruled -hat a dues checkoff for senior staff is not compulsory,
 although many private companies continue the practice. Decree 4 did not mention
 senior staff associations, leaving their status ambiguous and resulting in legal chal-
 lenges to their authority in labor matters.
 In August 1996, the Government dissolved three campus-based unions in response
 to a nationwide strike launched in April 1996 by the Academic Staff Union of Uni-
 versities (ASUU). In addition to proscribing the ASUU, the Government dissolved
 two non-striking unions, the Nonacademic Staff Union (NASU) and the Senior Staff
 Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), and seized their assets.
 The Government further strengthened its control over organized labor with the
 January release of an .additional amendment to the Trade Unions Act, Decree 26
 of 1996, granting the Labor Minister broad administrative authority to revoke the
 registration of any union "due to overriding public interest." The Decree stipulates
 that the Minister's decision cannot be appealed in a court of law.
 In an apparent -violation of ILO Convention 87, the Government promulgated the
 Trade Unions International Affiliation Decree in April, which bars labor federations
 and trade unions from affiliating with international laber organizations, except with
 express government permission. The Decree requires all unions to sever any existing
 links. Labor leaders who fail to follow the decree face -criminal penalties and
 deregistration of their unions.
 Civil servants in Kaduna state began a strike on June 16 to demand full imple-
 mentation of an increase in allowances originally approved in 1994. Relying upon
 Decree 4, the state administration refused to negotiate with representatives chosen
 by the workers. The state administrator subsequently dismissed all civil servants
 who failed to return to work by June 30, an order affecting some 16,000 employees.
 
 
 Criminal charges were pending against some 21 strike leaders in Kaduna at year's
 end.
 The Government used threats of arrest and short-term and long-term detention
 without charge to intimidate labor activists. The Government continues to hold
 without charge NUPENG General Secretary Frank Kokori, detained since August
 1994, and former PENGASSAN General Secretary and Secretary Generalof
 SESCAN, Milton Dabibi, imprisoned since January 1996 (see Section 1.d.).
 In 1997 Nigeria was again the subject of a special paragraph at the International
 Labor Conference (ILC), due to the Government's disregard for worker rights and
 violations of Convention 87. The ILC expressed great concern that, although the Ni-
 gerian case had been the subject of two previous special paragraphs (in 1995 and
 1996), "no concrete progress had been made to date in relation to the very grave
 trade union situation in the country." The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion, meeting in March, noted with concern a "persistent deterioration of trade
 union rights. The committee's report called on the Government to release Kokori;
 repeal decrees dissolving the executive councils of the NLC, NUPENG, and
 PBNGSS     ; allow independently elected officials to exercise their trade union
 functions; and urgently authorize an ILO direct-contacts mission without further
 delay. The ILO .called repeatedly and urgently for the Government to accept a direct
 contacts mission to examine complaints of serious violations of worker rights. The
 Government did not give p ermission for an ILO mission and failed to respond offi-
 cially to the ILO proposal for a September visit.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor laws provide for
 both the rightto organize and the right to bargain collectively between management
 and trade unions. Collective bargaining continues in many sectors of the economy.
 Complaints of antiunion discrimination may be brought to the Ministry of Labor for
 mediation and conciliation. Unresolved disputes subsequently may be taken to the
 Industrial Arbitration Panel (LAP) and the NIC (see Section 6.a.). Union officials
 have questioned the independence of the NIC in light of its refusal to resolve var-
 ious disputes stemming from the Government's failure to fulfill contract provisions
 for public employees.
 In his January budget speech, Sani Abacha announced the abolition of the uni-
 form national salary structure and deregulation of collective bargaining in the civil
 service. The Government directed each state administration to establish its own sal-
 ary structure on the basis of its ability to pay and with reference to the minimum
 wage (see Section 6.e.). The Government announced this decision without consulting
 the civil service unions. The Government abolished the uniform wage structure for
 state enterprises in 1991.
 An expert processing zone remains in development in Calabar, Cross River state,
 and a second is planned for Port Harcourt, Rivers state. Workers and employers in
 such zones are subject to national labor laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Conpulsory Labor.-The 1974 Labor Decree and the
 1979 and 1989 Constitutions prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and it is not
 known to occur with any prevalence. Alhough employment of persons under 18
 years of age, except for agricultural and domestic work, is generally prohibited, the
 Government does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children. Re-
 ports of such practices are infrequent. In 1996 one private organization reported an
 illegal child trade exporting Nigerian children to other West African nations and
 also importing children into the country. The children are reportedly sold into do-
 mestic servitude or forced to work as prostitutes. In August police in Benin report-
 edly arrested 3 men trying to transport 90 children to Nigeria to be sold in Lagos.
 In October the Lagos press reported that child "traders' from other parts of the
 country and from Gabon were operating in the southeast state of Akwa-Ibom, alleg-
 edly shopping for children to serve as house boys and maids. The ILO has noted
 that, with no constitution in force, the Government may be unable to enforce the
 ILO Convention against forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The 1974
 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children under 18 years of age in commerce
 and industry, and restricts other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic
 work. The law further stipulates that children may not be employed in agricultural
 or domestic work for more than 8 hours per day. The decree allows the apprentice-
 ship of youths at age 13 under specific conditions.
 Primary education is compulsory, although this requirement is rarely enforced.
 Studies indicate declining school enrollment due to the continuing deterioration of
 public schools and to increased economic pressures on families. The lack of sufficient
 primary school infrastructure has ended some families' access to education, forcing
 them to place children in the labor market. Growing economic difficulties have led
 to a substantial increase in the use of children for commercial activities aimed at
 
 
 enhancing meager family income. The use of children as beggars, hawkers, and bus
 conductors is widespread in urban areas. Private and government initiatives to stem
 the growing incidence of child- employment have not been effective.
 The Government does not specifically- prohibit forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, and reports of such practices are-rare. However, there were reports of traffick-
 ing in children (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1974 Labor Decree sets a minimum wage,
 which is reviewed on an ad hoc basis. The last review, undertaken in 1991 by a tri-
 partite group consisting of representatives of the NLC, the Nigeria Employers' Con-
 sultative Association,- and the Ministry of Labor, raised the monthly minimum wage
 to about $5.30 (450 naira)-a level now rendered meaningless by inflation and de-
 preciation of the naira-which does not provide a decent living for a worker and
 family.
 The 1974 Labor Decree called for a 40-hour workweek, prescribed 2 to 4 weeks
 of annual leave, and stipulated that workers must be paid extra for hours worked
 over the legal limit. The Decree also stated that employees who work on Sundays
 and statutory public holidays must be paid a full day's pay in addition to their nor-
 mal wages. There is no law prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.
 The 1974 Labor Decree contains general health andsafety provisions, some aimed
 specifically at young or female workers. While it requires that the factory
 inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor and Employment inspect factories for compli-
 ance with health and safety standards, this agency often neglects safety oversight
 of construction sites and other nonfactory work. The Decree also requires employers
 to compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial
 accidents. The Labor {)ecree does not provide workers with the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without loss of employment. The Labor
 Ministry, which is charged with enforcement of these laws, has experienced large
 staff turnover and has been largely ineffective in identifying violations. The Govern-
 ment has failed to act on various ILO recommendations since 1991 to update its
 moribund inspection and accident reporting program.
