 SAINT LUCIA
 Saint Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. The Government comprises a prime minister, a cabinet, and
 a bicameral legislative assembly. A Governor General, appointed by the British
 monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial powers. In general
 elections in 1997, the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) defeated the incumbent
 United Workers Party (UWP), gaining 16 of 17 seats in the House of Assembly. Dr.
 Kenny Anthony of the SLP assumed the prime ministership from the UWP s Dr.
 Vaughan Lewis, who had taken over from long-serving UWP Prime Minister John
 Compton in March 1996. The judiciary is independent.
 The Royal Saint Lucia Police is the only security force and includes a small unit
 called the Special Services Unit (which has some paramilitary training) and a coast
 guard unit. Although the police traditionally have demonstrated a high degree of re-
 spect for human rights, there were allegations of abuse by the police.
 The economy is based on tourism and on the export of bananas, which represent
 the principal sources of foreign exchange earnings. Saint Lucia is diversifying its
 edonomy into other types of agriculture, light manufacturing, and construction. Un-
 employment, estimated at 20 percent, remains a source of potential instability. Per
 capita gross domestic product was about $3,000 in 1997.
 The authorities generally respected human rights. Occasional credible allegations
 of physical abuse of suspects or prisoners by the police, very poor prison conditions,
 long delays in trials, government criticism of the media and pressure on
 antigovernment radio stations under the UWP, domestic violence against women,
 and child abuse were the major problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KMlling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such
 abuse. However, many criminal convictions in recent years have been based on con-
 fessions, which may reflect an effort by police to force confessions rather than rely
 on criminal cases, which could be subject to long judicial delays and procedural ob-
 stacles. The Crusader newspaper reported one such incident in February 1997, in
 which the police severely beat a suspect while questioning him regarding a pas-
 senger van's stolen windscreen. The article inciuded the medical examiner's report,
 which revealed multiple marks of violence.
 Prison guards are generally well-trained. The island's only prison, built in the
 1800's to house a maximum of 101 prisoners, was subject to severe overcrowding
 with over 400 inmates. Very poor prison conditions, overcrowding, and lengthy trial
 delays led to a prison riot in June 1997; prisoners set fires that destroyed over half
 of the antiquated prison. The inmates asserted that the fires were part of a protest
 for improvements in conditions at the prison. Following the fires, the authorities
 transferred about 250 inmates to a factory shell outside the capital and stationed
 the paramilitary Special Services Unit at the prison. The prison has since been re-
 aired, the majority of prisoners have been returned to the prison, and the Special
 Services Unit has ceased guarding the prison.
 Following the riots, the Government invited Penal Reform International (PRI), a
 London-based nongovernmental organization (NGO), to conduct a study of the pris-
 on and make recommendations. Its recommendations included the release of pris-
 oners awaiting trial for minor offenses and the introduction of noncustodial alter-
 natives as a sentencing option. As a result of the PRI report, the authorities selected
 a new Superintendent of Prisons who took over in February, established a perma-
 nent Complaints Board comprised of prominent citizens to meet every month to
 hear prisoners' complaints, hired 24 new prison officials, and made some limited im-
 provements to the facility. Despite these measures, inmates made another attempt
 to burn down the main prison facility on September 22, but caused only limited
 damage. According to the Superintendent, both the 1997 and the 1998 incidents of
 
 
 unrest occurred prior to the start of a new session of the High Court when prisoners
 on remand discovered that their cases were not on the published list of cases to be
 heard. There are 90 prisoners on remand who have been denied bail and are await-
 ing trial.
 The Government also started the groundwork for a new $17 million (EC$50 mil-
 lion) prison facility near Dennery in the eastern part of the island. The projected
 completion date for the new prison is September 2000.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours afr detention. However, the authorities frequently have
 held prisoners for years "on remand" after charging them (there is no constitutional
 requirement for a speedy trial). At the time of the 1997 prison riot, about 160 of
 the prisoners were on remand. One extreme case involved a prisoner put on remand
 in 1993, who finally was tried and convicted in June.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 There are two -levels of courts: Courts of summary jurisdiction (magistrate's
 courts) and the High Court. Both levels have civil and criminal authority. The lower
 courts accept civil claims up to about $1,900 (EC$5,000) in value, and criminal cases
 generally classified as "petty." The High Court has unlimited authority in both civil
 and criminal cases. All cases can be appealed to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Ap-
 peal. Cases may be appealed to the Privy Council in London as the final court of
 appeal.
 The Constitution requires public, trials before an independent and impartial court
 and, in cases involving capital punishment, provision of legal counsel for those who
 cannot afford a defense attorney. In criminal cases not involving capital punish-
 ment, defendants must obtain their own legal counsel. Defendants are entitled to
 select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,
 and have the right of appeal. The authorities observe both constitutional and statu-
 tory requirements for fair public trials.
 The court system faces a backlog of over 6,000 cases. The Government invited a
 team of justices from Australia to conduct a study and make recommendations to
 address the backlog. According to this report (the Bauer report), the pending case
 load as of July 1997 stood at 8,598 cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Saint Lucian governments generally have re-
 spected constitutional provisions for free speech and press. However, the UWP Gov-
 ernment occasionally demonstrated hostility to elements of the print and electronic
 media, resulting in the closure of Radio Saint Lucia and Radyo Koulibwi in 1996.
 According to the Observer newspaper, Radyo Koulibwi was .seen as facilitating
 antigovernment sentiments through its talk-show format. Both stations remain
 closed; however, this government action did not appear to affect the overall degree
 of press freedom.
 Five privately owned newspapers, two privately owned radio stations, and one
 partially government-funded radio station operate in Saint Lucia. They carry a wide
 spectrum of political opinion and are often critical of the Government. The radio sta-
 tions have discussion and call-in programs that allow persons to express their views.
 The two local television stations are also privately owned and cover a wide range
 of views. In addition there is subscription cable television service, which provides
 programming from a variety of sources.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association and assembly, and the Government generally respects these
 rights in practice. The law requires permits for public meetings and demonstrations
 if they are to be held in public places, such as on streets or sidewalks or in parks.
 The police routinely grant such permits; the rare refusal generally stems from the
 failure of organizers to request the permit in a timely manner, normally 48 hours
 before the event.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and exercised that right in
 1997 when the SLP defeated the UWP, which had governed with only one interrup-
 tion since 1964. The SLP won 16 of 17 seats, campaigning on a platform of job cre-
 ation and economic diversification and appealing explicitly to women and younger
 voters. In response to concerns about the size of the SLP's parliamentary majority,
 Prime Minister Anthony publicly emphasized that the Government would make ef-
 forts to reach out to the opposition to ensure that the country's democratic tradi-
 tions were not -undermined by the small size of the parliamentary opposition. The
 1996 merger of smaller parties-the Concerned Citizens' Movement, the Saint Lucia
 Freedom Party, and the Citizens' Democratic Party-into the SLP left the country
 with only two major political parties. The Governor General, who had been affiliated
 with the UWP, stepped down following the elections. He was replaced by Pearlette
 Louisy.
 Under the Constitution, general elections must be held at least every 5 years by
 secret ballot, but may be held earlier at the discretion of the government in power.
 Two members of the Senate are independent, appointed by the Governor General.
 There are no impediments to participation by women and minorities in govern-
 ment. Two of the 13 members of the Cabinet are women, as are 4 of the 5 mag-
 istrates and the Governor General. However, women and minorities are not rep-
 resented in numbers proportional to their share of the population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is one local human rights group, the Aldet Center, which published its first
 national human rights report in April. According to the report, the Government is
 involved in five human rights cases before the Inter-American Commission on
 Human Rights and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Court of Appeal.
 Alleged human rights abuses include abuse of power by the police during "Operation
 Restore Peace" following the 1997 prison riots and the incumbent SLP's "affirative
 action" practice of hiring party supporters for civil service positions.
 Following the prison riot in 1997 (see Section 1.c.), the Gvernment invited Carib-
 bean human rights monitors, including Penal Reform International, to investigate
 prison conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Government policy is nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs, education,
 and opportunity for advancement. There are no legal restrictions on the role of
 women or minorities.
 Women.-There is increased awareness of the seriousness of violence against
 women. The Government does not prosecute crimes of violence against women un-
 less the victim presses charges. If the victim chooses for any reason not to press
 charges, the Government cannot bring a case. Charges must be brought under the
 ordinary Civil Code. In 1997 the Government established a family court to hear
 cases of domestic violence and crimes against women and children.
 The police force conducts some training for police officers responsible for inves-
 tigating rape and other crimes against women, but there is no special unit that han-
 dles crimes against women. Police and courts enforce laws to protect women against
 abuse, although police are hesitant to intervene in domestic disputes, and many vic-
 tims are reluctant to report cases of domestic violence and rape or to press charges.
 The 1994 Domestic Violence Act allows a judge to issue a protection order prohib-
 iting an abuser from entering or remaining in the p lace where the victim is. It also
 allows the judge to order that an abuser's name be removed from housing leases
 or rental agreements, with the effect that the abuser would no longer have the right
 to live in the same residence as the victim.
 The Saint Lucia Crisis Center for women was established in 1988 in Castries, the
 capital; a second was to open -in the southern town of Vieux-Fort in January 1999.
 These centers monitor cases of abuse (physical and emotional) and help clients deal
 with such problems as incest, nonpayment of child support, alcohol and drug abuse,
 
 
 homelessness, custody, and visitation rights. The Crisis Center has publicized the
 plight of battered women and has protested the rare deaths of women who were vic-
 tims of domestic violence. The organizers also are working to establish a shelter for
 battered women and homeless girls, but no progress had been made at year's end.
 The Crisis Center reports that the number of new cases has declined since the es-
 tablishment of the family court because women can now seek help in two places.
 Some secondary schools address the problems of sexual harassment and battering
 in their curriculum topics.
 Women's affairs come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Human
 Services, Family Affairs, and Women. The Minister is responsible for protecting
 women's rights in domestic violence cases and preventing discrimination against
 women, including ensuring equal treatment in employment.
 Children.-Since independence, successive governments have given high priority
 to improving educational opportunities and health care for the nation's children.
 Education is free and compulsory from age 5 through 15. However, only about one-
 third of primary school children continue on to secondary schools, and the drop-out
 rate from primary to secondary school is higher for boys than for girls. Government
 clinics provide prenatal care, immunization, child health care, and health education
 services throughout the island.
 A broad legal framework exists for the protection of children through the Criminal
 Code, the Children and Young Persons Act, the Family Court Act, the Domestic Vio-
 lence Act, and the Attachment of Earnings Act. Although the Government adopted
 a national plan of action in November 1991 for the survival, protection, and develop-
 ment of children, the Government has not fulfilled this program by implementing
 effective programs. The Saint Lucia Crisis Center reports that the incidence of child
 abuse remains high.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the disabled, nor mandating provision of access to buildings or government services
 for them. There is no rehabilitation facility for the physically disabled, although the
 Health Ministry operates a community-based rehabilitation program in residents'
 homes. There are schools for the deaf and for the blind up to the secondary level.
 There is also a school for the mentally retarded.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Most public sector employees are unionized; about 20 percent of the total work force
 is unionized. Unions are independent of government, and are free to choose their
 own representatives in often vigorously contested elections. There are no restrictions
 on the formation of national labor federations. In 1994 several of the major unions
 formed an umbrella grouping called the Industrial Solidarity Pact.
 Strikes in both the public and private sectors are legal, but there are many ave-
 nues through collective bargaining agreements and government procedures that
 may preclude a strike. The law prohibits members of the police and fire depart-
 ments from striking. Other "essential services" workers-water and sewer authority
 workers, electric utility workers, nurses, and doctors-must give 30 days' notice be-
 fore striking.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations, and some have done
 SO.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining, and they fully exercise this right. Union rep-
 resentatives have reported attempts by government and other employers to under-
 mine this process.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. It also requires that employers reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Labor law is applicable in the export processing zones (EPZ's), and there are no
 administrative or legal impediments to union organizing or collective bargaining in
 those zones. In practice, however, many firms resist union efforts to organize in the
 EPZ's, even to the point of closing operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. While there is no specific prohibi-
 tion of forced or bonded labor by children, there were no reports of such practices.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ermnent does not prohibit specifically forced and bonded labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). The Children and Young Persons
 Act stipulates a minimum legal working age of 14 years. Ministry of Labor officials
 
 
 -are responsible for enforcing the law. There were no reports of violations of child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, in ef-
 fect since 1985, set out minimum wage rates only for clerks. These office workers
 receive a legislated minimum wage of about $300 (EC$800) per month. The mini-
 mum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family, but some categories of workers receive more than the legal minimum for
 clerks, which is used only as a guide for setting pay for other professions.
 There is no legislated workweek, although the common practice is to work 40
 hours in 5 days. Special legislation covers hours which shop assistants, agricultural
 workers, domestics, and young people in industrial establishments may work.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees' Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The
 Ministry enforces the act through threat of closure of the business if it discovers vio-
 lations and the violator does not correct them. Workers are free to leave a dan-
 gerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
