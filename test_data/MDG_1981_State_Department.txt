 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar gained full independence in 1960, but remained
 under strong French political, cultural, and economic
 influence. It is a one-party socialist state. The 1975
 anti-French, pro-socialist revolution of President Ratsiraka
 sought to diminish western ties, and at the same time reori-
 ented Madagascar toward the east. Having deliberately diversi-
 fied its earlier close and almost exclusive ties with the
 West, Madagascar asserted increased government control over
 the national economy. The establishment of close relations
 with socialist countries and radical third-world states and
 the nationalization of large foreign-owned holdings have been
 further corollaries of these policies. Internally, the
 government is attempting to decentralize administrative
 functions, although power remains closely held by the President.
 Economically, Madagascar's socialist policies are designed to
 expand production and social services and to reduce income
 disparities.
 The break with the past after the socialist revolution
 of 1975 has alienated certain elements of the population,
 particularly the beneficiaries of the post-independence
 order which ruled in Madagascar from 1968 through the early
 1970's. The government often blames acts of 'sabotage* and
 other difficulties on supporters of the old regime (although
 not by name), but it has not otherwise acted against them. A
 few military officers accused of attempting a coup d'etat
 since the 1975 revolution are imprisoned, and some of their
 supporters in France claim they are being held for political
 reasons. The government maintains that the officers have been
 charged with crimes, and are imprisoned as criminals.
 Political activity is restricted to specified organizations
 which supported the establishment of the new regime in 1975,
 and the government exercises tight control over the information
 media. Ethnic frictions between the traditional Asian Merina
 elite and the coastal Africans, poor law enforcement, and
 political decentralization, have resulted in occasional
 breakdowns in law and order in which lives and property have
 been lost. There has been, especially in the south, the
 reappearance recently of outlaw gangs. The gangs overpower a
 village or hamlet and take money, jewelry or cattle. A
 worsening economic situation also contributed to rioting in
 the capital at the beginning of 1981 and again in November.
 General references to human rights are found throughout the
 Malagasy constitution. It contains the Malagasy presidential
 oath, in which the president swears that he will defend
 human rights.in Madagascar.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is forbidden by law. Violent acts in general,
 which could include torture, are addressed in various articles
 of the penal code. Article 341 is more specific on torture.
 While there have been occasional reports of physical abuse of
 prisoners, there have been no reports of torture. Amnesty
 International has alleged instances of torture, however.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are crowded and conditions are primitive. while
 differential treatment is not officially accorded to various
 classes of prisoners, those with resources often are able to
 buy a significantly better penal environment. Mistreatment
 of prisoners is forbidden by the penal code and does not
 appear to be a significant problem. There have been occa-
 sional reports of physical abuse of prisoners,-but this is
 not the norm.
 c. Disappearances
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions,
 by official or quasi-official sources are not known to
 occur in Madagascar.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Madagascar's penal code is patterned after that of the
 French, and the concept of habeas corpus does not exist.
 In ordinary criminal cases, the defendant may be held for no
 more than three days before being formally charged. Indivi-
 duals suspected of activity against the state can be detained
 legally under the penal code (and held incommunicado) for
 fifteen days of investigation. This period may be extended if
 the government deems it necessary. Occasional long delays in
 the administration of justice are encountered, primarily due
 to an overworked and inefficient judicial system, but in some
 cases the delays are obviously politically inspired. There
 are 8 or 10 foreigners imprisoned in Madagascar for alleged
 subversive activities of one kind or another and whose arrest
 and imprisonment seem quite arbitrary to all but the government.
 Some unrest generated in February 1981 by students unhappy
 with school conditions resulted in the confinement of the
 leaders. They were subsequently released. A night-time
 curfew was imposed but was lifted on June 26.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that'all courts must be open to
 the public except in cases involving national defense matters
 or in trials of minors. Defendants are charged formally and
 clearly, and have a right to counsel when informed of being
 charged   Trials in Madagascar are generally fair. Departures
 from impartiality usually have involved light sentences for
 government officials, slowness in getting cases to trial,
 and occasional lengthy detention of those accused. At least
 three Malagasy military officers and several foreigners have
 been in prison without trial for several years because of
 suspected activities against the state.
 There are civilian, military, and special economic courts
 in Madagascar. Civilians can be tried before military
 courts for crimes involving the external security of the
 state. There is a court of appeals for civilian cases,
 and final appeal from all three courts may be made to the
 supreme court.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under the penal code, process servers may enter a private
 dwelling only during daylight hours. No reports of violations
 have been received.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Malagasy people, nearly half of whom are Christian,
 take their religion and spiritual lives very seriously,
 and freedom of worship by all groups is fully respected
 by the government. Freedom of speech, press and assembly
 are guaranteed by the constitution. However, anyone arguing
 openly against the government's policies, or advocating what
 the government calls "tribalism", risks contravening the
 constitution, which authorizes the suspension of the rights
 and liberties of individuals "impeding the advent of the
 socialist state." Freedom of assembly and freedom of the
 press are limited. Permits needed to hold meetings can be
 withheld. Meetings to criticize the government are rare,
 although students and labor groups occasionally have demon-
 strated their displeasure with specific government measures
 affecting their interests. For the most part labor unions are
 affiliated with approved political organizations (parties),
 and as such can participate in workplace and political activi-
 ties. Those unions not affiliated with parent political
 groups cannot conduct political activities, but are allowed to
 participate in collective bargaining. One such independent
 union was instrumental in leading a civil servant walkout
 and slowdown in August of 1979, which the government ended by
 the temporary detention of some union leaders, harassment of
 "unauthorized" gatherings and meetings, and the firing of some
 workers combined with warnings of more to come if the others
 did not return to work. There is prepublication censorship of
 the press, causing any written criticism of the government or
 of its socialist and radical country friends to be subtle and
 indirect. Books and works of art are not censored, although
 western materials are generally not available.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel is not restricted within the country, and in principle
 passports are obtainable by all. The government must authorize
 specifically, by journey, all travel abroad, but both business
 and tourism trips seem to be on the rise. Government limita-
 tions on the amount of foreign currency which may be taken out
 of the country (Malagasy currency is not convertible abroad)
 serves as a significant brake on international travel.
 Theoretically, all Malagasy have the right to emigrate, but
 tradition and lack of resources make the numbers who leave
 very low. Repatriation is also a right of all Malagasy.
 Madagascar has no refugees and the question of granting
 asylum has so far been moot; reasons for this are basically
 geographical, and the matter of policy has not been addressed.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The government prohibits political activity by any political
 organizations except those which supported the establishment
 of the present regime in a referendum in 1975. These organiza-
 tions are specified by ordinance and their activities must be
 exercised within the National Front for the Defense of the
 Revolution. Women are particularly active in Malagasy politics.
 Each of the political "parties" has its women's auxiliary.
 President Ratsiraka's wife is active in her husband's party,
 participating in political events on the president's behalf,
 
 
 149
 and organizing women to become more active in political
 affairs. Women hold many high positions in government,
 although their influence seems to be less than their level of
 participation would indicate.
 The Front submitted a single list of candidates for the
 national assembly elections of June 31, 1977, the last
 national elections to be held. Another general election
 is scheduled in 1982. The government claims a high level
 of political participation by its citizenry, but in fact
 the large majority of the population is politically apathetic,
 except perhaps when organized for elections.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no resident human rights groups in Madagascar,
 nor have there been visits. The government permitted an
 investigation by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) into
 the 1976 massacre of Comorian residents of the city of Majunga
 by a hostile Malagasy ethnic group. The investigators had
 freedom of movement and access to all persons concerned.
 Their report, said to be highly critical of the Malagasy
 security forces' performance, has not been disseminated by
 the OAU.
 In its 1981 report, Amnesty International expressed concern at
 the continued detention without trial of at least 8 persons
 about whom Amnesty International has either requested informa-
 tion or issued appeals. The government has remained unrespon-
 sive.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 While the government of Madagascar seems genuinely committed
 to improving the economic well-being of its citizens, it has
 had only limited success. Madagascar's nine million popula-
 tion, with a per capita income of approximately $300 per year,
 continues to rank among the world's poorest. The World Bank
 estimates that approximately half of the populace subsists
 below the poverty level. Despite the fact that agriculture
 employs about 85 percent of the population, Madagascar was
 forced to import over 200,000 tons of rice this year to
 satisfy its daily per capita consumption of 450 grams, which
 is the world's highest. Such imports of the country's basic
 dietary staple, which are expected to increase substan-
 tially in 1982, seriously aggravate Madagascar's growing
 balance of payments deficits and thereby contribute to
 increasing scarcities in a wide range of previously available
 consumer products. On top of this, export volumes for the
 three major cash crops.-- coffee, vanilla and cloves -- have
 either stagnated or declined since 1975. By 1980, the receipts
 from these exports could purchase only 57 percent of the
 volume of imports they were capable of buying in 1975. The
 picture may improve somewhat in the year ahead, largely due to
 projected increases in clove and vanilla exports. But the
 present situation of little or no overall economic growth is
 likely to continue in the immediate future as the government
 attempts to implement a series of austerity measures worked
 out with the IMF, and to reduce its external indebtedness in
 accordance with a rescheduling plan worked out with leading
 
 
 150
 foreign government and private creditors. Because of the
 large scale nationalization of key industries which began in
 1975 and which has left the government in control of over 75
 percent of the economy, private enterprise's participation in
 economic revitalization efforts will remain severely restricted.
 The shortages of basic foodstuffs which periodically occur are
 felt more keenly in the rural areas where 80 percent of the
 population lives. while the problem was considered serious
 enough for Madagascar to qualify as a recipient of vegetable
 oil and rice under Titles I and II of the U.S. Government's
 PL 480 program, it has not reached a point at which people are
 starving. According to 1977 World Bank figures (the latest
 available) the ratio of calorie supply aveilable for consump-
 tion relative to nutritional needs is 115.00. Nevertheless,
 both tradition and government subsidies to the rice consumer
 tend to discourage exploitation of the country's favorable
 potential for superior food cultivation.
 Population size continues to grow, but the annual rate has
 slowed during the past two years from 3 percent to about 2.8
 percent (the total fertility rate for the year 1979 was 6.5
 percent). The slower growth rate is probably not sufficient
 to help the government in its efforts towards meeting the
 basic needs of the population. One of those needs - medical
 care - is now available in principle to all Malagasy. More
 and more frequently, however, doctors are forced to tell
 families of hospitalized patients to scour the marketplace
 in search of medication that is simply not to be found.
 Children born in Madagascar in 1980 could be expected on the
 average to live until the age of 43. The infant mortality
 rate in 1979 was 177 per 1,000. The percentage of population
 with access to safe water in 1979 was 26 percent according to
 World Bank statistics but the ministry of population puts the
 figure at 20 percent. On the average, about 4.3 persons are
 housed per room in rural areas whereas in the capital of
 Antananarivo and its surrounding suburbs the figure is about
 3.5 per room.
 In the field of education, the government has had consider-
 ably more success. In the 1970s alone, the literacy rate
 jumped from 39 percent to 53 percent. Total enrollment
 of those eligible for primary school jumped from 52 percent
 to 83 percent by 1979. The percentage is considerably
 higher for males - 93 percent - than for females - 79 percent
 - due in large part to persistent acceptance of traditional
 roles for females. Post-primary school facilities remain
 unevenly distributed with continued widespread concentration
 in the central plateau. The significant improvement in
 overall enrollment during the decade can largely be attributed
 to strong government efforts, manifested in part by the
 induction of baccalaureat graduates into two years of national
 service as teachers.
 By and large, however, the government's efforts at lifting
 the masses above their subsistence level have not borne
 fruit. The causes can be attributed as much to disruption
 resulting from state entry into the economy as to external
 market conditions and resistance of many citizens to market-
 ing and agriculture innovation.
