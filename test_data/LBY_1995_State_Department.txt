 LIBYA*
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a dictatorship ruled
 Colonel Muarnmar Al-Qadhafi (the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution)
 who is aided by extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees and a Comrades Or-
 ganization. Libya's governing principles are expressed in Qadhafi's "Green Book."
 Borrowing from Islamic andpan-Arab ideas, Qadhafi has created a political system
 that purports to establish a ithird way" superior to capitalism and Communism. He
 uses assassination and intimidation to control the opposition abroad and summary
 judicial proceedings to suppress it at home. The Government exercises tight control
 over ethnic minorities, such as Berbers, and continues to repress banned Islamic
 groups.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Qadhafi's persnal bodyguards, as well as the local Revolution-
 ary Committees and People's Co    ittees. The result is a multilayered, pervasive
 surveillance system which monitors and controls the activities of individuals.
 The Government dominates the economy through complete control of the country's
 oil resources, the principal source of foreign exchange. It uses part of the oil income
 for development, but much income has been lost to waste, corruption, and attempts
 to develop weapons of mass destruction.
 The human rights situation is poor. Citizens do not have the ability to change
 their government. Security forces arbitrarily detain and torture prisoners during in-
 terrogations or for punishment. The Government restricts the freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, association, religion, and basic worker rights. Citizens do not have
 the right to a fair public trial, to be represented by legal counsel, to be secure in
 their homes or persons, or to own private property.
 In September the Government carried out mass arrests after violent clashes be-
 tween Islamic activists and security forces in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city
 left at least 30 people dead. The violence was sparked when the Government tried
 to arrest several Islamic leaders. Afterward, Qadhafi publicly called for violence
 against opponents of his regime. Also in September, the regime expelled hundreds
 of Palestinian residents to signal its displeasure at the signing of a peace accord be-
 tween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. The regime also expelled
 thousands of other foreign workers from Egypt, Sudan, and Chad because of height-
 ened government concern over alleged ties between these workers and Islamic ex-

 tion is therefore limited.

 tremist groups. Traditional attitudes continue to restrict women's rights. Female
 genital mutilation is still practiced in remote tribal areas.
 Libya continues to be subject to economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the
 U.N. Security Council in connection with the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 over
 Scotland in 1988 and the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Chad in 1989. These sanc-
 tions require that Libya fulfill the following conditions: ensure the appearance of
 those charged; cooperate with US., British, and French investigations into the Pan
 Am and UTA bombings; compensate the victims of Pan Am 103; and renounce ter-
 rorism and support for terrorism.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In September Islamist groups in
 Benghazi and Tobruk attacked police stations and road checkpoints after security
 forces attempted to arrest several Islamist leaders. At least 30 people were killed
 in the unrest. After the disturbances were quelled, Qadhafi told a crowd of support-
 ers that the Government would kill anyone who betrayed the country. According to
 the British Broadcasting Corporation, Qadhafi said that "we will corner the traitors
 here, and we will trample them underfoot, and we will physically liquidate them.
 With their blood, we will wash off the disgrace they have left on our soil."
 In November a prominent dissident, Ali Mehmed Abuzeid, was found stabbed to
 death in his grocery store in London, where he was living in exile. British police
 have not made any arrests, but family members maintain that Abuzeid was killed
 by Libyan agents.
 In 1995 the Government took no steps to fulfill U.N. Security Council resolutions
 concerning the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and
 UTA flight 722 over Chad in 1989. Two Libyan agents, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and
 Abdel Basset All Al-Megrahi, have been accused in the Pan Am bombing. The U.N.
 Security Council has imposed diplomatic and economic sanctions on Libya (see
 above).
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses and "economic crimes," are
 punishable by death. Law No. 71 of 1972 mandates the death penalW for any person
 associated with a group opposed to the principles of the revolution. Despite  ilong-
 standing stated intention, Qadhafi has not acted to abolish the death penalty for
 this offense.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Libya is a party to the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, security personnel reportedly
 torture prisoners during interrogations or for punishment. Government agents peri-
 odically detain and reportedly torture foreign workers, particularly those from sub-
 Saharan Africa. Torture reports are difficult to corroborate because many prisoners
 are held incommunicado.
 Methods of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours, clubbing, elec-
 tric shock, the application of corkscrews in the back and lemon juice in open
 wounds, breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffo-
 cation by plastic bags, deprivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of
 the feet. The law calls for fines against any official using excessive force, but there
 are no known cases of prosecution for torture or abuse.
 In November the Chadian Human Rights League issued a statement condemning
 "acts of extortion, torture, and arbitrary arrests" against Chadians living in Libya.
 Libya had announced a month earlier that it intended to expel 1 million Africans
 from its territory, among them an estimated 300,000 Chadians (see Section 6.e.).
 The League also denounced the "painful health conditions" of the hundreds of ex-
 pelled Chadians who were repatriated to Chad that month. According to the
 League's statement, the Chadians were "arrested, tortured, stripped of their prop-
 erty, andjailed before their expulsion."
 There is insufficient information to make a determination on prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By law the Government may hold detain-
 ees incommunicado for unlimited periods. It holds many political detainees incom-
 municado in unofficial detention centers controlled by members of the Revolutionary
 Committees. There are an estimated 400 to 500 political detainees. Many have been
 held for years without charge. Thousands of other detainees may have been held
 for periods too brief (3 to 4 months) to permit confirmation by outside observers.
 
 
 1224
 In September the Government reportedly arrested hundreds of suspected oppo-
 nents following clashes in the cities of Benghazi and Tobruk which left an estimated
 30 people dead (see Section La.).
 Security forces continued to arrest suspected members and sympathizers of
 banned Islamic groups and to monitor activities at mosques. Some practicing Mus-
 lims have shaved their beards to avoid harassment from security services. Qadhafi
 has publicly denounced Libyan "mujaheddin' (generally, conservative Islamic activ-
 ists who fought with the Afghan resistance movement against Soviet forces) as
 threats to the regime.
 The Government does not impose exile as a form of punishment; to the contrary,
 Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return home. The
 Government arbitrarily expels noncitizens (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public TWal.-There are four levels of courts: Summary courts
 which try petty offenses; the courts of first instance, which try more serious crimes;
 the courts of appeal; and the Supreme Court, which is the final appellate level. The
 Erivate practice of law is illegal; all lawyers must be members ofthe Secretariat of
 Justice.
 Special revolutionary courts were established in 1980 to try political offenses.
 Such trials are often held in secret or even in the absence of the accused. In other
 cases, the security forces have the power to pass sentences without trial, especially
 in cases involving political opposition. In the past, Qadhafi has incited local cadres
 to take extrajudicial action against suspected opponents.
 There is no reliable estimate of political prisoners. Many political detainees are
 reportedly associated with banned Islamic groups.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies often disregard
 the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private home. They also
 routinely monitor telephone calls.
 The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive in-
 formant network. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime op-
 ponents may result in government harassment and detention. The Government may
 seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of the people" or those who
 "cooperate" with foreign powers. In the past, citizens have reported that Qadhafi
 has warned members of the extended family of any regime opponent that they too
 risk the death penalty.
 There were no known developments in a government move to seize excessive
 amounts of private wealth. In 1994 Qadhafi had proposed a program to seize all pri-
 vate assets above a nominal amount, describing wealth in excess of such an unde-
 termined nominal amount as the fruits of exploitation or corruption.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities tolerate some difference of opin-
 ion in People's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress but in
 general severely limit freedom of speech. This is especially true with regard to criti-
 cism of Qadhafi or his regime. Infrequent criticism of political leaders and policies
 in the state-controlled media is interpreted as a government attempt to test public
 Vamfon, or weaken a government figure who may be a potential challenger to Qa-
 The regime restricts freedom of speech in several ways: by prohibiting all political
 activities not officially approved, by enacting laws so vague that many forms of
 speech or expression may be interpreted as illegal, and by operating a pervasive sys-
 tem of informants that creates an atmosphere of mistrust at all levels of society.
 The State owns and controls the media. There is a state-run daily newspaper, Al-
 Shams, with a circulation of 40,000. Local Revolutionary Committees publish sev-
 eral smaller newspapers. The official news agency, JANA, is the designated conduit
 for official views. -The regime does not permit the publication of opinions contrary
 to government policy. Such foreign publications as Newsweek, Time, the Inter-
 national Herald Tribune, Express, and Jeune Afrique are available, but authorities
 routinely censor them and may prohibit their entry onto the market.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is permitted
 only with regime approval and in support of the regime's positions. The Government
 limits the right of association; it grants such a right only to institutions affiliated
 with the regime. According to Law No. 71 of 1972, political activity found by the
 authorities to be treasonous is punishable by death. An offense may include any ac-
 tivity that is 'opposed. . . to the principles of the Revolution." Independent trade
 unions and professional associations do not exist. The regime regards such struc-
 tures as unacceptable "intermediaries between the revolution and the working
 forces."
 
 
 1225
 Despite these restrictions, members of the Worfala tribe staged several informal
 protests during the year to protest the regime's decision to carry out the death pen-
 alty against tribe members involved in the 1993 coup attempt. The Government re-
 sponded by arresting hundreds of tribe members, and expelling others from the mili-
 tary and security forces. At year's end, the death sentences were not carried out.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort
 to eliminate all alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once powerful
 Sanusiyya Islamic sect. In its place, Qadhafi established the Islamic Call Society
 (ICS), which is the outlet for state-approved religion as well as a tool for exporting
 the Libyan revolution abroad. In 1992 the Government announced that the 191
 would be disbanded; however, its Director still conducts activities, suggesting that
 the organization remains operational. Islamic groups at variance with the state-ap-
 preved teaching of Islam are banned.
 Members of some minority religions are allowed to conduct services. Services in
 Christian churches are attended by the foreign community. A resident Catholic bish-
 op, aided by a small number of priests, operates two churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-With the exception of security areas, the Government usually does not
 restrict the internal movement of Libyan citizens. It requires exit permits for travel
 abroad and limits access to hard currency. A woman must have her husband's per-
 mission to travel abroad. Authorities routinely seize the passports of foreigners mar-
 ried to Libyan citizens upon their entry into Libya.
 The right of return is more nearly an obligation; the regime often calls on stu-
 dents, many of whom receive a government subsidy, and others working abroad to
 return to Libya on little or no notice. Students studying abroad are interrogated
 upon their return. Some citizens, including exiled opposition figures, refuse to re-
 turn.
 In September the Government expelled hundreds of Palestinian residents to sig-
 nal its displeasure with the signing of the Interim Agreement between Israel and
 the Palestine Liberation Organization. As a result, dozens of Palestinian families,
 many of which were longtime residents of Libya, were stranded for weeks in a
 makeshift camp along the Egyptian border. By year's end, these people had either
 been accepted by other countries or returned to their homes in Libya.
 The Government also expelled thousands of workers from Chad, Sudan, and
 Egypt (see Section 6.e.).
 The Government does not accept asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Major government de-
 cisions are controlled by Qadhafi, his close associates, and committees acting in his
 name. Political parties are banned. Qadhafi appoints military officers and official
 functionaries down to junior levels. Corruption and favoritism, partially based on
 tribal origin, are major problems, adversely affecting government efficien _.
 In theory, political participation is guaranteed by the grassroots Peoples Commit-
 tees, which send representatives annually to the nationsl General People's Congress
 (GPC). In practice, the GPC is a rubber stamp which approves all recommendations
 made by Qadhafi.
 Qadhafi established the Revolutionary Committees in 1977. These bodies are com-
 posed mostly of Libyan youths who are charged with guarding against political devi-
 ation. Some Committees have engaged in show trials of regime opponents; in other
 cases, they have been implicated with assassinating opponents abroad. The Commit-
 tees approve all candidates in elections for the GPO.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The regime prohibits the establishment of independent human rights organiza-
 tions. It created the Libyan Arab Human Rights Committee in 1989, but the Com-
 mittee has not published any known reports.
 The regime does not respond substantively to appeals from Amnesty International
 (Al) on behalf of detainees. In 1994 the regime described AI as a tool of Western
 interests and dismissed its work as neocolonialist. AI representatives last visited
 Libya in 1988.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There is little information on the extent of violence against women. In
 general, the intervention of neighbors and extended family members tends to limit
 
 
 1226
 
 the prevalence and scope of such violence. Abuse within the family is rarely dis-
 cussed publicly, owing to the value attached to privacy in this traditional society.
 Women were granted equal status under law by the Constitutional Proclamation
 in 1969. Despite this legal provision of equality, many traditional attitudes and
 practices continue to discriminate against women.
 Most observers agree that, with the advent of oil wealth in the 1970's, women
 have made notable social progress. Oil wealth, urbanization, development plans,
 education programs, and even the impetus behind Qadhafi's revolutionary govern-
 ment have all contributed to the creation of new employment opportunities for
 women. In recent years, a growing sense of individualism in some segments of Liby-
 an society, especially among the educated young, has been noted. For example,
 many educated young couples prefer to set up their own households, rather than
 move in with their parents, and view polygamy with scorn. Since the 1970's the
 level of educational differences between men and women has continued to narrow.
 In general, the emancipation of women is a generational phenomenon: urban
 women under the age of 35 tend to have more "modern" attitudes toward life and
 have discarded the traditional veil; at the same time, older urban women tend to
 be more reluctant to give up the veil or the traditional attitudes towards family and
 employment. Moreover, a significant proportion of rural women still do not attend
 school and tend to instill such traditional liefs as women's subservient role in soci-
 et to their young.
 Employment gains by women also tend to be inhibited by lingering traditional re-
 strictions which discourage women from playing an active role in the workplace, and
 by the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalist values. Some observers have noted that
 even educated women tend to lack self-confidence and social awareness and seek
 only a limited degree of occupational and social participation with men.
 The ambiguous position of women is illustrated by Qadhafi's own attitudes and
 utterances. His development plans have made an effort to include women in the
 modern workforce, yet he has criticized women's emancipation in the West, includ-
 ing their employment gains.
 Children.T eGovernent has subsidized education and medical care, improv-
 ing the welfare of children in the past 25 years. However, declining revenues and
 general economic mismanagement have led to cutbacks, particularly in medical
 services. Some tribes located in remote areas still practice female genital mutilation
 (FGM) on young girls, a procedure widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to a  irrs physical and psychological health.
 People WithDabiities.-No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities.
 NationalIRacialaEthnic Minorities.-Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed Arab and
 Berber ancestry comprise 97 percent of the population. The principal non-Arab mi-
 norities are Berbers and blacks. There are frequent allegations of discrimination
 based on tribal status, particularly against Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in
 the south.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers do not have the right to establish or join
 unions of their own choosing. They may join the sole official trade union organiza-
 tion, the National Trade Unions' Federation, which was created in 1972. The Fed-
 eration is administered by the People's Committee system. The Government pro-
 hibits foreign workers from joining unions.
 The law does not guarantee the right to strike. There have been no reports of
 stries in years. In a 1992 speech, Qadhafi affirmed that workers have the right
 to strike but added that strikes do not occur because the workers control their en-
 terprises.
 The official trade union organization p lays an active role in the International Con-
 federation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. It exploits international trade union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts
 on behalf of the regime. The Arab Magreb Trade Uniony Federation suspended the
 membership of Libya's trade union organization in 1993. The suspension followed
 reports that Qadhai had replaced all union leaders, in some cases with loyal fol-
 lowers without union experience.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist in any meaningful sense because the labor law requires that the Government
 must approve all agreements.
 e.Proibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In its 1995 report, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts stated that "pens ex-
 pressing certain political views or views ideologically opposed to the established po-
 litical, social, or economic system may be punished with penalties of imprisonment
 
 
 1227
 .. in    n.., an obligation to perform labor." That statement accurately de-
 scribes the stuation. The same report noted that public employees may be sen-
 tenced to compulsory labor "... as a punishment for breaches of labor discipline
 or for participation in strikes even in services whose interruption would not endan-
 ger the life, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The
 Government has informed the ILO that legislation has abolished these provisions,
 but it has not submitted any corroborating evidence to the ILO.
 There have been credible reports that the Government has arbitrarily forced some
 foreign workers into involuntary military service or has coerced them into perform-
 ing subversive activities against their own countries.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 18. Education is compulsory to age 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The work force is about 1.1 million workers
 (with an additional 1.2 million foreign workers) in a population of 4.4 million. There
 is a legally mandated minimum wage, which appears inadequate to afford a worker
 and family a decent standard of living. Wages, particularly in the public sector, are
 frequently months in arrears. A wage freeze imposed in 1981 remains in effect and
 has seriously eroded real income. The average monthly wage is $700 (about 250 di-
 nars.)
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. The labor law defines the rights and
 duties of workers, including matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest
 periods, and working hours. Labor inspectors are assigned to inspect places of work
 or compliance with occupational health and safety standards. Certain industries,
 such as the petroleum sector, try to maintain standards set by foreign companies.
 The labor law does not accord equality of treatment to foreign workers. Foreign
 workers may reside in Libya only for the duration of their work contracts, and may
 not send more than half of their earnings to their families in their home countries.
 They are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as changes in work rules and con-
 tracts, and have little option but to accept such changes or to depart the country.
 Foreign workers who are not under contract ejoy no protection.
 The Government uses the threat of expulsion of foreign workers as leverage
 against countries whos foreign policies run counter to Libya's. In 1995 the regime
 threatened to expel Tunisian workers if Tunisia normalized relations with Israel
 The Government expelled hundreds of Palestinian residents to signal its displeasure
 with the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (see
 Section 2.d.).
 In October, the regime announced its intention to expel as many as 1 million Afri-
 can workers from its territory inclunsome 300,000 Chadians. By the end of the
 year, the regime had expelled thousand of workers from Chad, Sudan, and Egypt,
 claiming that they were in Libya illegally. Government fears of worker ties to Is-
 lamic extremist groups may have motivated the wave of expulsions.
