 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic ruled by a democratically elected govern-
 ment. President Zhelyu Zhelev, former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces
 (UDF), was elected in 1992 to a 5-year term in the country's first direct presidential
 elections. The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), heir to the Communist Party, and
 two nominal coalition partners won an absolute majority in preterm elections in De-
 cember 1994 and formed a government in January. The judiciary is independent but
 continued to struggle with structural and staffing problems. Most citizens have little
 confidence in their legal system.
 Most security services are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which
 controls the police the National Security Service (civilian intelligence), internal se-
 curity troops, border guards, and special forces. A number of persons known to be
 involved in repressive activities during the Communist regime returned to senior-
 level positions in the security services in 1995. Some members of the police force
 committed serious human rights abuses.
 The post-Communist economy remains heavily dependent on state enterprises.
 Most people are employed in the industrial and service sectors; key industries in-
 clude food processing, chemical and oil processing, metallurgy, and energy. Principal
 exports are agricultural products, cigarettes and tobacco, chemicals, and metal prod-
 ucts. The transformation of the economy into a market-oriented system has been re-
 tarded by continued political and social resistance. Privatization of the large Com-
 munist-era state enterprises has been very slow and is the main reason for Bul-
 garia's economic stagnation. The Government is now developing a mass privatiza-
 tion program which, if successfully implemented, would partially address this prob-
 lem. The service and consumer goods sectors in private hands continued to be the
 most vibrant. Although all indicators point to a reviving economy this year, the last
 several years' decline has affected the employment of people from ethnic minorities
 disproportionately. The annual per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $1,300
 provides a low standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but prob-
 lems remained in some areas. Constitutional restrictions on political parties formed
 on ethnic, racial, or religious lines effectively limit participation. There were several
 reports that police used unwarranted lethal force against suspects and minorities,
 and security forces beat suspects and inmates. Human rights observers charged that
 the security forces are not sufficiently accountable to Parliament or to society and
 that the resultant climate of impunity is a major obstacle to ending police abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and pretrial detention is often prolonged. Mistreatment
 of ethnic minorities by the population at large is a serious problem, and both the
 Government and private citizens continued to obstruct the activities of some non-
 Eastern Orthodox religious groups. Discrimination and violence against women and
 Roma are serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extraiudicial Killing.-There were several reports of police
 officers using unwarranted lethal force against criminal suspects, as well as against
 
 
 806
 members of minority groups whether or not suspected of any crime, resulting in
 three deaths. On February 11, a Rom was found dead in Gradets near Sliven. A
 witness told a human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) that a police offi-
 cer had beaten the victim in the illage center the previous day, and the deceased's
 family described numerous signs of severe beating. An investigation is in progress.
 During a March attempt to apprehend a man previously sentenced for committing
 theft, a police officer in Nova Zagora allegedly beat an 18-year-old Rom, then shot
 and killed the man's 22-year-old brother when the older brother intervened. Neither
 of the victims was being sought by the police. The alleged perpetrator, a police ser-
 geant, has been chargel with murder resulting from excessive use of force in self-
 defense. The investigation continues.
 A 22-year-old male died in April while in police custody, apparently as a result
 of beating. The deceased, an ethnic Bulgarian, had been arrested for alleged com-
 plicity in a burglary. Six policemen were arrested in this widely publicized case; one
 officer, a police lieutenant, remains under investigation, and the national police di-
 rector resigned.
 No progress was made in the case of a detainee who died while in police custody
 following an August 1994 roundup of suspected criminals in Pazardjik, although the
 Government's investigation remains open. There was little progress in the Septem-
 ber 1994 case of a detainee who died one day after being taken into police custody
 in Pleven, and there were no developments in the investigation of the 1993 incident
 in which police allegedly beat three escaped prisoners (two of whom reportedly died)
 upon recapture.
 In November Amnesty International (AI) sent a letter to the Ministry of Interior
 expressing concern about five incidents in which AI said that police officers opened
 fire on suspects in violation of U.N. basic principles on the use of force and firearms
 by law enforcement officials. Interior Mirnstry data on serious police violations over
 the 18 months ending March 31 show 18 deaths due to police negligence, 59 cases
 of physical injury, more than 60 charges of serious offenses, and 58 convictions of
 police officers on these and lesser charges during the period. The Minister of Inte-
 rior publicly acknowledged that police abuses occur and made a commitment to ad-
 dress the problem- a number of cases are under investigation. However, the police
 have generally reiused the requests of human rights groups to make investigative
 reports available to the public. The climate of impunity that the Government allows
 to prevail is the single largest obstacle to ending such abuses.
 b. Diappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment.
 Despite this prohibition, there were a number of credible reports describing police
 beating of Roma during arrests. In January and February, a riot control unit of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs shot and wounded at least 3 people and beat more than
 10 during an operation in response to illegal felling of trees near Velingrad. All of
 the victims were Roma. No police officers were charged or investigated.
 In a Sofia neighborhood in March, police reportedly beat almost 40 Romani teen-
 agers and young men in an incident following several confrontations between Roma
 and 'skinheads. No police officers were investigated, despite numerous victims' ac-
 counts and a credible NGO report to law enforcement and other governmental au-
 thorities.
 Conditions in some prisons are harsh, including severe overcrowding, inadequate
 lavatory facilities, and insufficient heating and ventilation. Credible sources re-
 ported cases of brutality committed by prison guards against inmates; in some
 cases, prisoners who complained were placed in solitary confinement. The process
 by which prisoners may complain of substandard conditions or of mistreatment does
 not appear to function. The Government cooperated fully with requests by independ-
 ent observers to monitor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for access to
 legal counsel from the time of detention. Police normally obtain a warrant prior to
 apprehending an individual; otherwise, in emergency circumstances judicial authori-
 ties must rule on the legality of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the
 right to visits by family members, to examine evidence, and to know the charges
 against them. Charges may not be made public without the permission of the Chief
 Prosecutor. Pretrial detention is limited to 2 months under normal circumstances,
 although this may be extended to 6 months by order of the Chief Prosecutor who
 may also restart the process. In practice, persons are often detained for well over
 6 months.
 About one-third of Bulgaria's approximately 9,000 prison inmates are in pretrial
 detention. In the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention is credited
 
 
 807
 toward the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees have
 been released under this provision, although bail is not widely used. Neither inter-
 nal nor external exile is used as a form or punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Thal.-Under the Constitution the judiciary is granted
 independent and coequal status with the legislature and executive branch. However,
 most observers agreed that the judiciary continued to struggle with problems such
 as low salaries, understaffing, and a heavy backlog of cases. Partly as a legacy of
 communism and partly because of the court systems structural and personnel prob-
 lems, most citizens have little confidence in their judicial system. Human rights
 groups complain that local prosecutors and magistrates sometimes fail to pursue
 vig~rousy crimes committed against minorities.
 The court system consists of regional courts, district courts, and the Supreme and
 Constitutional Courts. The Government has notyet carried out several of the re-
 farms provided for in the June 1994 judicial Refr  Bill, including the establish-
 ment of separate supreme courts of cassation (civil and criminal appeal) and admin-
 istration. J      a  pointed by a 25-member Supreme Judicial Council and, after
 aerving for 3 years, may not be replaced except under limited, specified cir-
 cumstances. The 12 justices on the Constitutional Court are chosen for 9-year terms
 as follows: a third are elected by the National Assembly, a third appointed by the
 President, and a third elected by judicial authorities.
 The Constitution stipulates that all courts shall conduct hearings in public unless
 the proceedings involve state security or state secrets. There were no reported com-
 plaints about limited access to courtroom proceedings. Defendants have the right to
 know the charges against them and are given ample time to prepare a defense. The
 right of appeal is guaranteed and widely used. Defendants in criminal proceedings
 have the right to confront witnesses and to have an attorney, provided by the State
 if necessary, in serious cases.
 The Constitutional Court is empowered to rescind legislation it considers uncon-
 stitutional, settle disputes over the conduct of general elections, and resolve conflicts
 over the division of powers between the various branches of government. Military
 courts handle cases involving military personnel and some cases involving national
 security matters. The Constitutional Court does not have specific jurisdiction in
 matters of military justice.
 A number of criminal cases against former leaders for alleged abuses during the
 Communist period were carried forward. Former dictator Todor Zhivkov is serving
 a 7-year sentence under house arrest for abuse of power involving personal expense
 accounts and state privileges. Legal review of his case continues; the most recent
 step was a Supreme Court hearing on September 15. Although the investigation
 continues, there was little progress in the case in which 43 former high-level Com-
 munists were indicted in 1994 for having given grant aid during the 1980's to then-
 friendly governments in the developing world such as Cuba, Angola, and Libya. In-
 vestigation also continues in a case begun in 1993 involving a charge of emezzle-
 ment for giving grant aid to Commums t parties in other countries (the "Moscow
 case"), with no tangible progress. Some human rights observers criticized these and
 previous indictments, asserting that the activities in question were political and eco-
 nomic in nature, not criminal.
 One of the primary fiures in these cases, former Prime Minister and once senior
 Communist official Andrei Lukanov, brought a complaint against these proceedings
 to the European Commission of Human Rights. Acting on his petition in January,
 the Commission ruled that Lukanov's appeal of the procedure by which he was
 stripped of parliamentary immunity was adssible be fore the Commission, but has
 not yet issued a decision on the merits of the case. Lukanov's appeals under two
 other articles of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
 Fundamental Freedoms were not admitted.
 There was no progress in a case begun in 1993 relating to the forced assimilation
 and expulsion of ethnic Turks in 1984-85 and 1989, nor in a trial relating to the
 notorious death camps set up by the Communists after they came to power in 1944.
 Police authorities concluded their investigation of the 1994 murder of a key witness
 in the latter case in February without definite result.
 In one of its first acts, the new Socialist-dominated Parliament repealed a con-
 troversial 1992 lustration act ("Law for Additional Requirements Toward Scientific
 Organizations and the Higher Certifying Commission"), known as the "Panev Law."
 The law had barred former secretaries and members of Communist party commit-
 tees from positions as academic council members, university department heads,
 deans, rectors, and chief editors of science magazines, applying a presumption of
 guilt that conflicts with international human rights standar.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 808
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, for the right to choose one's
 place of work and residence, and protects the freedom and confidentiality of cor-
 respondence. Human rights observers expressed concerns that illegal wiretaps may
 still persist but provided no tangible evidence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice, al-
 though there were signs that it was seeking to increase editorial control over gov-
 ernment-owned electronic media. The variety of newspapers published by political
 parties and other organizations represents the full spectrum of political opinion, but
 a notable degree of self-censorship exists in the press among journalists who must
 conform to what are often heavily politicized editorial views of their respective
 newspapers.
 National television and radio broadcasting both remain under parliamentary su-
 pervision. A September Constitutional Court ruling declared unconstitutional some
 portions of a "provisional" statute that had placed the electronic media under par-
 liamentary supervision since 1990. In October Parliament passed legislation restor-
 ig its right to exercise control over the national electronic media; in December the
 Constitutional Court again struck down this provision. In November 34 journalists
 from a national radio station issued a declaration accusing radio management of
 censoring their work and threatening uncooperative journalists with dismissal. A
 month later, seven of the journalists were fired, provoking widespread public con-
 cern about freedom of speech and the establishment of at least two NGO's to mon-
 itr the issue. This ongoing dispute illustrates a growing concern about the lack of
 balance in the state-cntrlled news media.
 Some observers criticized changes in the senior leadership of the national lec-
 tronic media and editorial control by a newly established board of directors of Bul-
 garian national radio, charging they were politically motivated. In September the
 Constitutional Court overturned a provision of the July Local Elections Act which
 prohibited journalists working for state-owned media and local electronic media
 from expressing opinions on parties, coalitions, and candidates in the October 29
 local elections.
 There are two state-owned national television channels and a grwing number of
 privately owned regional stations. Two channels broadcast in Bulgarian, while a
 third broadcasts Russian programnin, and a fourth carries a mixture of Cable
 News Network International and Frenc langage programming. Bulgarian national
 television has been planning Turkish-language programming or at least 2 years,
 but broadcasts have not yet begun. Foreign government radio programs such as the
 British Broadcasting Corporation and the Voice of America (VOA had      access
 to commercial Bulgarian radio frequencies, although in April the interim council for
 radio frequencies and television channels turned down a request by Radio Free Eu-
 rope to add VOA programming on its frequency. After initial government approval
 in the fall of 1994 of an application to create a privately owned national broadcast
 television station, further pregress has floundered, with no action being token by
 the current Government. Television and radio news programs on the state-owned
 media present opposition views but are generally seen as being biased in favor of
 the Government. There are no formal restrictions on programming. Some political
 goups omplained that coverage was one-aided, although they acknowledged that
 their representatives were interviewed regularly. Both television and radio provide
 a variety of news and public interest programming, including talk and public opin-
 ion shows.
 More than 30 independent radio stations are licensed. Some private stations com-
 plained that their licenses unduly restricted the strength of their transmissions in
 comparison to state-owned stations. Radio transmitter facilities are owned by the
 Government.
 Private book publishing remained lively, with hundreds of publishers in business.
 Respect for academic freedom continued.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful and un-
 armed assembly is provided for by the Constitution, and the Government generally
 respected this right in practice. The authorities require permits for rallies and as-
 semblies held outdoors, but most legally registered organizations were routinely
 granted permission to assemble. However, one non-Orthodox religious group re-
 ported difficulties obtaining a permit for an outdoor assembly, and several other re-
 irious groups also had   iculty renting assembly halls. In most cases, these reli-
 gious groups had been denied registration by the Council of Ministers (see Section
 
 
 809
 2.c.). Vigorous political rallies and demonstrations were a common occurrence and
 took place without government interference.
 The Governmentlnas undertaken to respect the rights of individuals and groups
 freely to establish their own political parties or other political organizations. How-
 ever, there are constitutional and statutory restrictions that limit the right of asso-
 ciation and meaningful participation in the political process. For example, the Con-
 stitution prohibits organizations that threaten the country's territorial integrity or
 unity or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. Some observers considered
 the dovernment's refusal since 1990 to register a Macedonian rights group, Umo-
 Ilinden, on the grounds that it is separatist to be a restriction of the constitutional
 rights to express opinions and to associate. Tfhe group, which is seeking registration
 as a Bulgarian-Macedonian friendship society, was allowed to hold an outdoor public
 meeting in April, but police broke up attempts to hold a second public meeting in
 July.
 The Constitution forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic,
 or racial lines, and prohibits "citizens' associations" from engaging in political activ-
 ity. Although these restrictions were used in 1991 to challenge the legitimacy of the
 mainly ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), that party is cur-
 rently represented in Parliament, and its right to compete in the October 29 local
 elections was not questioned.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, the Government restricts this right in practice. The ability of a number of reli-
 gious groups to operate freely continued to come under attack, both as a result of
 government action and because of public intolerance. The Government requirement
 that groups whose activities have a religious element register with the Council of
 Ministers remained an obstacle to the activity of many religious groups. Dozens of
 articles in a broad range of newspapers depicted lurid and inaccurate pictures of the
 activities of non-Orthodox religious groups, attributing suicides of teenagers and the
 breakup of families to their activities.
 The Government refused visas and residence permits for foreign missionaries, and
 some came under physical attack in the street and in their homes. Members of the
 Mormon church reported continued acts of harassment and assault, including some
 perpetrated by the police themselves. The police response was indifferent despite
 the expressed concern of the Government about such cases.
 In February the Supreme Court ruled that a mother and supporter of the
 nonregistered community of Christ's Warriors be denied parental custody of her 4-
 year-old son because she had taken the boy to religious meetings of the community.
 The court grounded its decision on "educational qualities" claiming that "it is obvi-
 ous that the child's presence at such a public place is harmful to his mind and his
 health as a whole."
 At the Department of Theology of Sofia University, all students have been re-
 quired to present a certificate of baptism from the Orthodox Church, and married
 couples to provide a marriage certificate from the Orthodox Church, in order to en-
 roll in the Department's classes.
 Authorities initiated an investigation of the case of the April 1994 shooting death
 of Yordan Tsolov, an Orthodox pnest in Surnitsa, about which charges of police com-
 plicity were raised by a human rights organization and the press in 1994.
 Several religious groups appaed the denials of their registration by the Council
 of Ministers under a 1994 amendment to the Famiies and Persons Act. Most of the
 appeals were denied by the Council of Ministers. Following the Supreme Court's
 April decision to affirm the Council's denial of registration to the "Word of Life"
 group, the press reported that the group was banned and that the police would seek
 out and stop religious gatherings of the group, even if held in private homes. Some
 observers made credible charges that the police sought to break up meetings of non-
 Eastern Orthodox religious groups which were denied registration.
 The Constitution designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the "traditional" re-
 ligion. A number of major religious bodies, including the Muslim and Jewish com-
 munities, receive government financial support. There was no evidence that the
 Government discriminated against members of any religious group in restituting to
 previous owners propertiesthat were nationalized during the Communist regime.
 For most religious groups which were able to maintain their registration, there were
 no restrictions on attendance at religious services or on private religious instruction.
 A school for imams a Muslim cultural center, university theological faculties, and
 religious primary schools operated freely. Bibles and other religious materials in the
 Bulgarian language were freely imported and printed, and Muslim, Catholic, and
 Jewish publications were published on a regular basis. However, during compulsory
 military service most Muslims are placed into labor units where they often perform
 commercial, military, or maintenance work rather than serve in normal military
 
 
 810
 
 units. The mainly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) pro-
 tested this practice (see Section 5).
 A significant proportion of Muslims considered the current Government's approval
 of the statutes of the Muslim faith and its registration of a new Chief Mufti and
 new head of the Supreme Theological Council, all developed at a November 1994
 Islamic conference, to be government interference in the affairs of the community.
 A rival Chief Mufti, elected at an alternative Islamic conference in March, appealed
 the Government's actions unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court.
 The schism which opened in the Orthodox church in 1992 persisted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country
 and the right to leave it, and these rights are not limited in practice, with the excep-
 tion of limited border zones off limits both to foreigners and Bulgarians not resident
 therein. Every citizen has the right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expa-
 triated, and may not be deprived of citizenship acquired by birth. A number of
 former political emigrants were granted passports and returned to visit or live.
 As provided under law, the Chief Prosecutor restricted foreign travel by Lukanov
 (see Section i.e.) and also by Ivan Slavkov, son-in-law of Todor Zhivkov, due to out-
 standing investigations of them. Observers criticized the lack of time limits on such
 inactive investigations and questioned whether the travel restrictions were not
 being used punitively.
 The Government has provisions for granting asylum or refugee status in accord-
 ance with the standards of the 1951 U.N. Convention and its 1967 Protocol relating
 to the status of refugees. Domestic and international human rights organizations ex-
 pressed concerns over the Government's handling of asylum claims and reported
 that there may be cases in which bona fide refugees are forced to return to countries
 where they fear persecution. The Bureau for Territorial Asylum and Refugees as-
 serts that it gives a fair hearing to all persons seeking asylum or refugee status but
 admits that there may be cases which do not come to its attention before the appli-
 cant is returned to the country from which he or she entered Bulgaria. The Bureau
 is still seeking to establish registration and reception centers blocked in 1994 by
 skinheads and local citizens groups and has identified some new sites for the cen-
 ters.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and head of state through the
 election of the President and of the members of the National Assembly, although
 the constitutional prohibition of parties formed on ethnic, racial, or religious lines
 has the effect of circumscribing access to the political process (see Section 2.b.). Suf-
 frage is universal at the age of 18. The mest recent parliamentary elections took
 place in December 1994. President Zhelev was elected in 1992 in the first direct
 presidential elections.
 Local elections were held in the fall. With the exception of the mayoral election
 in Kurdjali, all major political parties accepted the results and agreed that the elec-
 tions were conducted in a free and orderly manner. In the ethnically mixed city of
 Kurdjali, in a politically charged atmosphere, the Socialist Party challenged in court
 the narrow runoff victory of the MRF candidate, questioning the registration of sev-
 eral hundred voters. After lengthy delays the court took up the case, but it has not
 yet ruled, and the elected mayor has not been allowed to take office.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government. A
 number of women hold elective and appointive office at high levels, including a cabi-
 net-level post and several key positions in the Parliament. However, women hold
 only about 14 percent of the seats in the current Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rights cases. At the initiative of several groups
 concerned with children's rights, the Government conducted a dialog with them on
 its compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Government was
 particularly cooperative in allowing an NGO committee to survey prison conditions.
 However, the Government is otherwise often reluctant to provide information or ac-
 tive cooperation.
 
 
 811
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection agnst
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Rma
 and women.
 Women.-Domestic abuse is reportedly a serious problem, but there are no fig-
 ures, official or otherwise, on its occurrence. The courts prosecute rape, although it
 remains an underreported crime because some stigma still attaches to the victim.
 The maximum sentence for rape is 8 years; convicted offenders often receive a lesser
 sentence or early parole. Marital rape is a crime but rarely prosecuted. Courts and
 prosecutors tend to view domestic abuse as a family rather than criminal problem,
 and in most cases victims of domestic violence take refuge with family or friends
 rather than approach the authorities. No government agencies provide shelter or
 counseling for such persons, although there is a private initiative to address the
 problem.
 Many of the approximately 30 women's organizations in Bulgaria are closely asso-
 ciated with political parties or have primarily professional agendas. Of those which
 exist mainly to defend women's interests, the two largest are the Women's Demo-
 cratic Union in Bulgaria, heir to the group which existed under the Zhivkov dicta-
 torship, and the Bulgarian Women's Association, which disappeared under com-
 munism but has now reemerged and has chapters in a number of cities.
 The Constitution forbids privileges or restrictions of rights on the basis of sex.
 However, women face discrimination both in terms of recruitment and the likelihood
 of layoffs. Official figures show the rate of unemployment for women to be higher
 than that for men. women are much more likely than men to be employed in low-
 wgjosrequiring little education, although statistics show women are equally
 llkey t3 attend university. Women, in the main, continue to have primary respon-
 sibility for child-rearing and housekeeping even if they arue employed outside the
 home. The liberal provisions for paid maternity leave may actually work against em-
 ployers' willingness to hire and retain women employees, especially in the private
 sector.
 Children.-The Government appears to be committed to protecting children's wel-
 fare. It maintains, for example, a sizable network of orphanages throughout the
 country. However, government efforts in education and health have been con-
 strained by serious budgetary limitations and by outmoded social care structures.
 Groups that exist to defend the rights of children charge that an increasing number
 of children are at serious risk as social insurance payments fall further behind infla-
 tion and are often disbursed as much as 6 months late.
 The vast majority of children are free from societal abuse, although skinhead
 groups have beaten some Romani children; the homeless or abandoned were particu-
 larly vulnerable. Some Romani minors were forced into prostitution by family or
 community members; there was little police effort to address these problems.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons receive a range of financial assistance
 including free public transportation, reduced prices on modified automobiles, and
 free equipment such as wheel chairs. However, as in other areas, budgetary con-
 straints mean that such payments have fallen behind. Disabled individuals have ac-
 cess to university training and to housing and employment, although no special pro-
 grams are in place to allow them to live up to their full employment potential. To
 date little effort has been made to change building or street layouts to help blind
 or otherwise physically disabled persons. At the end of the year, Parliament passed
 legislation requiring the relevant Ministry and local governments to provide a suit-
 able living and architectural environment for the disabled within 3 years. Also, poli-
 cies of the Communist regime which separated mentally and physically disabled
 persons, including very young children, from the rest of society have persisted.
 Religious Minorities.-Bulgarian Muslims or "Pomaks" constitute a sizable minor-
 ity, comprising 2 to 3 percent of the population. Bulgarian Muslims are a distinct
 group of Slavic descent whose ancestors converted rum orthodox Christianity to
 Islam. Most are Muslim, although a number have become atheists or converted to
 Christianity.
 Reports continued that some Muslim religious figures refused to perform burial
 services for Muslims with Slavic names, a practice which some observers saw as an
 encroachment on religious freedom.
 There were a series of acts of vandalism directed at Jewish institutions.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minoities.-Ethnic Turks comprise about 10 percent of
 the population. Although estimates of the Romani population vary widely, several
 experts put it at about 6 percent. These are the country's two largest minorities.
 There are no restrictions on the speaking of Turkish in public or the use of non-
 Slavic names. A defense bill before Parliament renewed controversy over the issue
 
 
 812
 of language. The bill declared Bulgarian to be the official language in the armed
 forces and the language in which military duties were to be carried out. Members
 of Parliament of the mainly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms
 tried unsuccessfully to amend the bill to affirm the constitutional right to use the
 "mother tongue," for example, in personal conversations and correspondence. The
 motion was rejected, but use of the mother tongue is not prohibited in the military.
 and Turkish is freely spoken in off-duty situations.
 Voluntary Turkish-language classes, funded by the Government, continued in
 areas with significant Turkish-speaking populations, although some observers com-
 plained that the Government was restricting the availability of training for teachers
 and discouraging the optional language classes in areas with large concentrations
 of Bulgarian Muslims. Some ethnic Turkish leaders, mainly in the MEF, demanded
 that Turkish-language schooling be made compulsory in ethnic Turkish areas, but
 the Government resisted this.
 In the 1992 census approximately 3.4 percent of the population identified itself
 as Romani. The real figure is probably about twice that high, since many persons
 of Romani descent tend to identify themselves to the authorities as ethnic Turks or
 Bulgarians. Romani groups continued to be divided among themselves, although
 several groups had some success presenting Romani issues to the Government. As
 individuals and as an ethnic group, Roma faced high levels of discrimination.
 Attacks by private citizens on Romani communities continued to occur in 1995.
 The most serious were a series of attacks in two Romani neighborhoods of Stara
 Zagra in March and April. A group of young men wielding bats and sticks report-
 peoplear                                       aunigmsk  leAi
 edl dmaedth  poprt o 1 Rmai famlie  8       ind  hru   on
 pohe haveidnt      the agedly beat 2 Romani women on school groun  in
 alleged perpetrators of the March incident, and an inves-
 tigation is underway. An arson investigation resulting from the February 1994 inci-
 dent in Dolno Belotintsi was suspended later that year because of the reluctance
 of the sole witness to testify. A human rights NGO was able to gather new evidence
 implicating individuals in the crime and~has asked the Chief Prosecutor to resume
 the investigation; no action has yet been taken. Authorities often fail to aggressively
 investigate cases of assault or other crimes against Romani individuals, although
 there was some improvement in their responsiveness to inquiries of human rights
 organizations.
 Roma encounter difficulties applying for social benefits, and rural Roma are dis-
 couraged from claiming land to which they are entitled under the law disbanding
 agricultural collectives. Many Roma and other observers made credible allegations
 that the quality of education offered to Romani children is inferior to that afrforded
 most other Bulgarian students.
 The Government took some steps to address the problems faced by Roma. The
 Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology convened a forum in July to discuss
 the education of Romani children, during which representatives of the President's
 office, concerned ministries, and human r-ights organizations discussed pedagogical
 issues. The Council of Ministers disbanded the interagency Ethnic Affairs Council
 established in 1994, replacing it with a National Board on Social and Demographic
 matters with broader responsibilities. Some observers expressed concern over oner-
 ous requirements for admission of NGO's to the bard. For exaple, NGO's must
 have established branches in more than on-third of Bulgarian municipalities.
 The Ministry of Education continued its program to introduce Romani-language
 schoolbooks into schools with Romani populations and issued follow-on textbook for
 the program. The program has had mxed success, partly due to a lack of qualified
 teahers.
 Workplace discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem, especially
 for Roma. Employers justify such discrimination on the basis that most Roma have
 relatively low training and education. Supervisory jobs are generally given to ethnic
 Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Bulgarian Muslims, and Roma among the
 first to be laid off.
 During compulsory military service most Roma (and Muslims-see Section 2.c.)
 are shunted into labor units where they often perform commercial, military con-
 struction, or maintenance work rather than serve in normal military units. The
 MRF protested this practice, as did human rights groups and labor observers who
 cited it as a violation of International Labor Organization (ILO) accords. There are
 only a few ethnic Turkish and Romani officers in the military.
 Thousands of Bulgarians, mainly in the southwest, identify themselves as Mac-
 edenans, most for historical and geographic reasons. Members of the two organiza-
 tions which purport to defend the interests of ethnic Macedonians, Umo-Ilinden and
 Tmo-Jlinden, are believed to number in the hundreds (see Section 2.b.).
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution provides for the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choice, and this right was appar-
 ently freely exercised. Estimates of the unionized share of the workforce range from
 30 to 50 percent. This share is shrinking as large firms lay off workers, and most
 new psitions appear in small, nonunionized businesses.
 Bulgaria has two large trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independ-
 ent Trade Unions of Bulgaria (CITUB), and Podkrepa. CITUB, the successor to the
 trade union controlled by the former Communist regime, operates as an independent
 entity. Podkrepa, an independent confederation created in 1989, was one of the ear-
 liest opposition forces but is no longer a member of the Union of Democratic Forces,
 the main opposition party. In February a third trade union confederation, the Com-
 munity of Free Union Organizations in Bulgaria (CFUOB), was admitted to the Na-
 tional Tripartite Coordination Council (N1CC), which includes employers and the
 government (see Section 6.b.). CITUB and Podkrepa filed a joint complaint to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) against the Government's selection of
 CFUOB as the labor delegate to the 1995 ILO conference. The ILO found that the
 Government had unilaterally imposed rotation of the labor delegate among three
 trad, union organizations without consulting the other two.
 The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right to strike when other means of conflict
 resolution have been exhausted, but "political strikes" are forbidden. Workers in es-
 sential services are prohibited from striking. There was no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment interfered with the right to strike, and several work stoppages took place.
 The Labor Code's prohibitions against antiunion discrimination include a 6-month
 period of protection against dismissal as a form of retribution. While these provi-
 sions appear to be within international norms, there is no mechanism other than
 the courts for resolving complaints, and the burden of proof in such a case rests en-
 tirely on the employee.
 The ILO in 1993 requested further information on lustration proceedings, meas-
 ures directed at compensating ethnic Turks for abuses under the previous regime,
 efforts taken to improve the economic situation of minorities, and measures to pro-
 mote equality between men and women in workplace opportunity. At year's end, the
 ILO was still reviewing the information provided to it by the Government, including
 information provided this year on efforts to improve the situation of minorities. The
 ILO has not yet issued opinions or recommendations on these matters.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation or contact with international labor organi-
 zations, and unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code institutes
 collective bargaining, which was practiced nationally and on a local level. The legal
 prohibition against striking for key public sector employees weakens their bargain-
 ing position; however, these groups were able to influence negotiations by staging
 protests and engaging in other pressure activities without going on strike. Both
 CITUB and Podepa complained that while the legal structure for collective bar-
 gaining was adequate, many employers failed to bargain in good faith or to adhere
 to concluded agreements. Labor observers viewed the Government's enforcement of
 labor contracts as inadequate.
 Only the three labor members of the National Tripartite Cooperation Council are
 authorized to bargain collectively. This restriction led to complaints by smaller
 unions, which may in individual workplaces have more members than the NTCC
 members. Smaller unions also protested their exclusion from the NTCC.
 There were no instances in which an employer was found guilty of antiunion dis-
 crimination and required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. Inter-
 national labor organizations criticized the "national representation" requirement for
 participation in the National Tripartite Coordination Council as a violation of the
 right to organize.
 The same obligation of collective bargaining and adherence to labor standards
 prevails in the export processing zones, and unions may organize workers in these
 areas.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. Many observers agreed that the practice of shunting minority
 and conscientious-objector military draftees into work units which often carry out
 commercial construction and maintenance projects is a form of forced labor (Section
 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age fbr employment at 16; the minimum for dangerous work is set at 18. Employers
 and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) are responsible for enforcing
 these provisions. Child labor laws are enforced well in the formal sector. Underage
 employment in the informal and agricultural sectors is increasing as collective farms
 
 
 814
 are broken up and the private sector continues to grow. In addition, children work
 on family-owned tobacco plantations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage was ap-
 proximately $38 (2,555 leva) at year's end. The minimum wage is not enough to pro-
 vide a wage earner and family with a decent standard of living. The Constitution
 stipulates the right to social security and welfare aid assistance for the temporarily
 unemployed, although in practice such assistance is often either late or not dis-
 bursed.
 The Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one
 24-hour rest period per week. The MLSW is responsible for enforcing both the mini-
 mum wage and the standard workweek. Enforcement has been generally effective
 in the state sector, although there are reports that state-run enterprises fall into
 arrears on salary payments to their employees if the firms incur losses. Enforcement
 of work conditions is weaker in the emerging private sector.
 A national labor safety program exists, with standards established by the Labor
 Code. The Constitution states that employees are entitled to healthy and
 nonhazardous working conditions. The MISW is responsible for enforcing these pro-
 visions. Under the Labor Code, employees have the right to remove themselves from
 work situations which present a serious or immediate danger to life or health with-
 out jeopardizing their continued employment. In practice, refusal to work in situa-
 tions with relatively high accident rates or associated chronic health problems would
 result in loss of employment for many workers. Conditions in many cases are wors-
 ening owing to budget stringencies and a growing private sector which labor inspec-
 tors do not yet supervise effectively.
