 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Two political parties have alternated in power since the first
 elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944; a third major party was estab-
 lished in late 1995. Prime Minister P.J. Patterson's People's National Party (PNP)
 won 50 of the 60 seats in Parliament in national elections in December 1997. The
 general election campaign was significantly less violent than previous electoral cam-
 paigns. However, there continued to be intimidation of voters and party agents and
 restrictions on the free movement of voters. The judiciary is independentbut lacks
 adequate resources.
 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has primary responsibility for internal se-
 curity, assisted by the Island Special Constabulary Force. The Jamaica Defense
 Force (JDF-army, air wing, and coast guard) is charged with supporting the JCF
 in maintaining law and order, although it has no powers of arrest. While civilian
 authorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces, some members
 of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is based on primary products (bauxite and alumina, sugar, bananas),
 services (tourism, finance), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment promoted private investment to stimulate economic growth and moderniza-
 tion, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural adjustment.
 Annual per capita income is $2,460, but this flgnre is misleading as there is a large
 and widening gap between the wealthy and the impoverished.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remained in certain areas. Although members of the security forces com-
 mittd extrajudicial killings and beatings and carried out arbitrary arrests and de-
 tentions, the Government moved effectively to punish some of those involved. Prison
 and jail conditions remained poor; overcrowding, brutality against detainees, dismal
 sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet are problems. The judicial system was
 overburdened and lengthy delays in trials were common. Economic discrimination
 
 
 680
 and violence against women remained problems, as did mob violence against those
 suspected of breaking the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces frequently em-
 ployed lethal force in apprehending criminal suspects, usually in the guise of shoot-
 outs. This resulted in the killing by police of 145 people during the year. While alle-
 gations of "police murder" were frequent, the validity of some of the allegations was
 suspect. This problem is .the result of unresolved, long-standing antipathy between
 the security forces and certain communities, especially among the urban poor. The
 JCF conducted both administrative and criminal investigations into incidents in-
 volving fatal shootings by the police. The JCF policy statement on the use of force
 incorporates United Nations-approved language on basic principles on the use of
 force and firearms by law enforcement officials.
 In September there were 2 days of riots in downtown Kingston that resulted in
 the deaths of two persons,-including a JDF soldier. The JDF was called in to assist
 when the police were unable to quell violent clashes with rioters. The police force
 lacks training in effective crowd control techniques and often resorts to the use of
 excessive-and sometimes deadly-force.
 Political violence continued to diminish. However, during the period prior to the
 1997 national elections, the opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) accused the secu-
 rity forces of targeting the opposition leader's West Kingston constituency for special
 attention, culminating in a May 6-7 confrontation with residents of Tivoli Gardens.
 In this confrontation, the. police shot and killed four persons (three women and one
 child) and injured nine others by gunfire. All the victims were unarmed civilians.
 No member of the security forces was injured, and no arrests were made. In August
 the jury in a coroner's inquest found that members of the security forces had been
 fired upon, that they fired in self defense, and that none of them were criminally
 responsible. Many press commentators, local human rights activists, and the leader
 of the opposition condemned this verdict. However, the Defense Force refused to
 make public the results of its own inquiry, which possibly might have shed further
 light on the incident.
 The police closed their fles-without taking disciplinary action in the cases of two
 deaths in which excessive force apparently was used. In January police allegedly
 shot a Spanish Town man who was sitting on his toilet seat. The incident sparked
 public protests and received wide media attention after the police hurled tear gas
 at the leader of the opposition National Democratic Movement (NDM) while he was
 trying to calm one of the protests. In March police or soldiers allegedly executed
 three men in the Grants Pen area of Kingston. The police alleged that they detained
 a car whose occupants (three men and a woman) engaged the police in a shootout.
 However, forensic evidence in the form of bullet holes and human blood and tissue
 found on a nearby wall apparently were more consistent with the allegations by
 area residents that members of the security forces placed the three men against the
 wall and shot them.
 There were new developments in several cases from previous years. An arrest
 warrant was issued for a police constable alleged to have been involved in the 1996
 beating death of a 22-year-old man in a west Kingston police station; the constable
 remained a fugitive from justice at year's end. In the 1996 death of a man held in
 the Port Antonio jail, a court convicted the deceased's cellmate of murder and sen-
 tenced him to death. In the civil case of one of three men who suffocated to death
 in the Constant Spring jail in 1992 after being confined all night in an 8 by 7 foot
 cell with 16 other men (who survived the life-threatening confinement), the court
 of appeal heard arguments in February as to whether to increase the trial court
 damage award of $22,815 (J$829,560) in a wrongful death case brought by the
 mother of one of the victims. The court of appeal awarded her additional damages
 of $27,000 (J$1,000,000)-for breach of her son's constitutional rights. This was the
 first time a court had allowed a damage claim on constitutional rather than statu-
 tory grounds. The plaintiff appealed to the Privy Council for a higher award; no rul-
 ing had been issued at year's end.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions in response to crime, contin-
 ued to be a problem. There were 16 vigilante killings in 1998, compared with 16
 in 1997, and 21 in 1996. Official investigations into such killings generally do not
 uncover any information, since the persons and the community involved usually
 band together to intimidate potential witnesses.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 681
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. However, re-
 ports of physical abuse of prisoners by guards continued, despite efforts by the Gov-
 ernment to remove abusive guards and improve procedures.
 On December 18, the court of appeal announced that flogging could not be im-
 posed as a punishment because the legislative authority for it had expired. This sen-
 tence was rarely used; prior to 1994, no sentence of flogging had been imposed for
 25 years.
 In April 1997, the Police Commissioner condemned the excessive use of force by
 police in Hopewell, Hanover, who shot six persons who were demonstrating against
 substandard roads and water supply. The authorities charged three policemen with
 unlawful wounding; no trial date had been set by year's end. In April a court denied
 the appeal of a policeman who had been convicted in 1997 of unlawful wounding,
 and it ordered the convicted constable to begin serving his 18-month prison terms.
 Prison conditions remained poor; overcrowding, inadequate diet, poor sanitary
 conditions, and insufficient medical care are typical. In August 1997, violence erupt-
 ed at both men's maximum security prisons after prison warders engaged in a mass
 sickout. Inmates killed 16 of their fellow prisoners, many of them because they had
 been identified as homosexuals. The Government convened a commission of inquiry,
 which made its findings public in March. The commission concluded that lack of co-
 ordination among responsible government agencies contributed to the spread of the
 rioting. It recommended that prison security, prison conditions, and the quality of
 prison staff be improved. The Ministry of National Security accepted the rec-
 ommendations and began to implement them, including construction of a new cor-
 rectional facility.
 In general, the Government allowed private groups, voluntary organizations,
 international human rights organizations, and the media to visit prisons and mon-
 itor prison conditions. However, foreign diplomats were denied access to the cell
 block areas of the police remand center when they visited the facility in June, de-
 spite earlier assurances that full access would be given.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1994 Parliament repealed the Sup-
 pression of Crimes Act of 1974, which permitted warrantless searches and the arrest
 of persons "reasonably suspected" of having committed a crime. However, the Ja-
 maica Constabulary Force Act now contains several of these provisions, and there
 were continued reports that the police abused these provisions. In March 1997, the
 Jamaican Bar Association (JBA) protested that the police were unlawfully detaining
 and fingerprinting groups of citizens in poor, inner city areas. At the time, the Po-
 lice Commissioner disavowed the practice and ordered it discontinued; however,
 both the JBA and the Jamaica Council on Human Rights state that the practice con-
 tinues.
 The law requires police to present a detainee in court within 48 hours of deten-
 tion, but the authorities continued to detain suspects, especially those from poor
 neighborhoods, without bringing them before a judge within the prescribed period.
 Magistrates inquire at least one time per week into the welfare of each person listed
 by the JCF as being detained. There is a functioning bail system.
 Foreign prisoners must pay for their own deportation once they have completed
 their sentences. If they cannot afford to pay, they are jailed until relatives or con-
 sulates can arrange for transportation. In effect this constitutes an additional prison
 term for indigent foreigners.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and no instances of exile occurred.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, which exists in practice. However, the judicial system is overburdened and op-
 erates with inadequate resources.
 Three courts handle criminal matters at the trial level. Resident magistrates try
 lesser offenses (misdemeanors). A Supreme Court judge tries felonies, except for
 felonies involving firearms, which are tried before a judge of the Gun Court. Defend-
 ants have the right to appeal a conviction in any of the three trial courts to the
 Court of Appeal, which is the highest court. The Constitution allows the Court of
 Appeal and the Parliament to refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom as a final court of appeal.
 The lack of sufficient staff and resources hinders due process. Trials in many
 cases are delayed for years, and other cases are dismissed because files cannot be
 located. The Government initiated a night court in September 1995, which has had
 some success in reducing the backlog of cases.
 While the defendant's right to counsel is well-established, the courts appoint coun-
 sel for the indigent only for serious offenses (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, and gun
 offenses). However, the law does not consider many offenses, including wounding
 
 
 682
 with intent to cause great bodily harm, as "serious." Thus the courts try many de-
 fendants without benefit of counsel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of an in-
 dividual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act continues to give security
 personnel broad powers of search and seizure similar to those granted by the former
 Suppression of Crimes Act (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Government privatized the Jamaica Broadcasting Company in June 1997,
 and the television station and two radio stations it operated became privately
 owned. The Government's broadcasting commission has the right to regulate pro-
 gramming during emergencies. Foreign television transmissions are unregulated
 and available through satellite antennas. The four largest newspapers, all privately
 owned, regularly report on human rights abuses, particularly those involving the
 JCF. Foreign publications are widely available.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the authorities respect
 them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment provides first asylum, and provided it to approximately 40 persons in 1994.
 Similar but smaller numbers of first asylum cases, mainly Cubans and Haitians,
 were accepted in 1995 and 1996, but none have been accepted since. The Govern-
 ment established a committee and formal procedures to review claims to refugee
 status. This committee has denied all claims to refugee status by Cubans and Hai-
 tians who have arrived in Jamaica since 1994.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in periodic elections held on the basis of
 universal suffrage. All citizens age 18 and over have the right to vote by secret bal-
 lot. However, voters living in so-called garrison communities, which are located in
 inner-city areas dominated by one of the two major political parties, face substantial
 impediments to the free exercise of their right to vote. During the 1997 general elec-
 tion campaign, both international and local observer groups concluded that, al-
 though the process was significantly less violent than recent election campains,
 problems persisted in the garrison communities. These problems included intimida-
 tion of party agents and voters of nondominant parties and restrictions on the move-
 ment of voters and election workers. Some areas are so dominated by one party that
 the polls simply closed early and vote counts were taken that resulted in 100 per-
 cent (or nearly 100 percent) of the votes being awarded to the dominant party.
 These problems persisted in the December 1997 election, despite the best efforts of
 the security forces, which were credited with controlling violence, such as the beat-
 ing of voters, and reducing election malpractice, such as the theft of ballot boxes
 from polling places.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics. Women
 hold about 13 percent of all political offices and 30 percent of the senior civil service
 positions. Two of the 16 cabinet members are women, as is the PNP General Sec-
 retary.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. In July the Jamaica
 Council for Human Rights reorganized under a new name, the Independent Jamaica
 Council for Human Rights (IJCHR), and remains the country's only formal organiza-
 tion concerned with all aspects of human rights. The IJCHR attracted substantial
 
 
 683
 international donor funds, which alleviated some of the resource constraints that
 hampered it in the past. Government officials are generally cooperative and respon-
 sive to the views of human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, polit-
 ical opinions, color, creed, or sex. The Government largely enforces these prohibi-
 tions in practice, except for widespread discrimination on the basis of political opin-
 ion in the distribution of scarce governmental benefits, including employment, espe-
 cially in the garrison communities (see Section 3).
 Women.-In practice women suffer from economic discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment in the workplace, and social and cultural traditions that perpetuate violence
 against women, including spousal abuse. The Domestic Violence Act of 1995 came
 into effect in May 1996. It provides additional remedies for domestic violence, in-
 cluding restraining orders and other noncustodial sentencing. Violence against
 women is widespread, but many women are reluctant to acknowledge or report abu-
 sive behavior, leading to wide variations in estimates of its extent.
 The Constitution and the 1975 Employment Act accord women full equality. The
 Bureau of Women's Affairs in the Ministry of Labor oversees programs to ensure
 the legal rights of women. These programs have had limited effect but have raised
 the awareness of problems affecting women. In June 1996, the Government estab-
 lished a steering committee, charged with creating a Commission on Gender and So-
 cial Equity. The committee forwarded its recommendations to Parliament, which ac-
 cepted them; Parliament continued to discuss methods of implementation at year's
 end.
 A number of active women's rights groups exist. They are concerned with a wide
 range of issues, including employment, violence against women, political representa-
 tion, and the image of women presented in the media. Their effectiveness is mixed,
 but the groups were successful in advocating enactment of the Domestic Violence
 Act.
 Children.-The Government is committed to improving children's welfare. The
 Ministry of Education, Youth, and Culture is responsible for implementation of the
 Government's programs for children.
 The Juvenile Act of 1951 deals with several areas related to the protection of chil-
 dren, including the prevention of cruelty, a prohibition on causing or allowing juve-
 nile begging, the power to bring juveniles in need of care or protection before a juve-
 nile court, the treatment of juvenile offenders, the regulation and supervision of
 children's homes, and restrictions on employment of juveniles. In 1996 the visiting
 Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said the Gov-
 ernment had done very well in its efforts to improve the welfare and survival of chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-No laws mandate accessibility for people with disabil-
 ities. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations provide serv-
 ices and employment to various groups of disabled citizens. In January the Prime
 Minister appointed the first blind member of the Senate, an action that is expected
 to raise the parliamentary profile of issues affecting disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to form or join a trade
 union, and unions function freely and independently of the Government. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) defines worker rights. There is a
 spectrum of national unions, some of which are affiliated with political parties. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 The LRIDA neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but strikes do
 occur. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but cannot be
 assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "essential services"
 are prohibited from striking, a provision the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 has repeatedly condemned as overly inclusive. The Government did not declare any
 strikes illegal during the year.
 Unions maiainin a wide variety of regional and international affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government rarely inter-
 feres with union organizing efforts. Judicial and police authorities effectively enforce
 the LRIDA and other labor regulations. All parties are firmly committed to collec-
 tivebargaining in contract negotiations, even in some nonunion settings. An inde-
 pendent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) hears cases where management and
 labor fail to reach agreement. Any cases not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil
 courts. The IDT generally handles 35 to 40 cases each year. Most are decided within
 
 
 684
 90 days, but some take longer to resolve due to the complexity of the dispute or
 delays requested by the parties. The LRIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination, and
 employees may not be fired solely for union membership. The authorities enforced
 this law effectively.
 Domestic labor laws apply equally to the "free zones" (export processing zones).
 However, there are no unionized companies in any of the 3 zones-established in
 1972, 1985, and 1988-that employ 10,797 workers. Organizers attribute this cir-
 cumstance to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing efforts, but at-
 tempts to organize plants within the zones continue. Company-controlled "workers'
 councils" handle grievance resolution at most free zone companies, but do not nego-
 tiate wages and conditions with management. Management determines wages and
 benefits within the free zones; these are generally as good as or better than those
 in similar industries outside the zones. The Ministry of Labor is required to perform
 comprehensive factory inspections in the free zones once each year, and actually
 performs them at 6- to 9-month intervals. There were no reports of substandard or
 unsafe conditions in the free zone factories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor, but there were no reports
 that this practice exists.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Juve-
 nile Act provides that children under the age of 12 shall not be employed except
 by parents or guardians, and that such employment may only be in domestic, agri-
 cultural, or horticultural work. Enforcement, however, is erratic. While the Con-
 stitution does not prohibit forced or bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.), such
 practices were not known to occur. Children under the age of 12 peddle goods and
 services on city streets, but there is no evidence of widespread illegal employment
 of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipulates that all
 children between 6 and 11 years of age must attend elementary school. Industrial
 safety, police, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Under current eco-
 nomic circumstances, however, thousands of children are kept home to help with
 housework and avoid school fees. A 1994 UNICEF report stated that 4.6 percent of
 children below the age of 16 worked to help support their households. '
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, raised from $15.00
 (J$500) to $22.50 (J$800) per week in 1996, is widely considered inadequate to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most salaried workers are
 paid more than the legal minimum. Work over 40 hours per week or 8 hours per
 day must be compensated at overtime rates, a provision that is widely observed.
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division sets and enforces industrial
 health and safety standards, which are considered adequate. Industrial accident
 rates, particularly in the bauxite and alumina industry, remained low. Public serv-
 ice staff reductions in the Ministries of Labor, Finance, National Security, and the
 Public Service have contributed to the difficulties in enforcing workplace regula-
 tions. The law provides workers with the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment if they are
 trade union members or covered by the Factories Act. The law does not specifically
 protect other categories of workers in those circumstances.
