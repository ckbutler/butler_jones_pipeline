 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and multipartyparliamentary democracy with
 an independent judiciary in which citizens periodiealy choose their representatives
 in free and fair elections. In 1993 parliamentary elections, the Panhellenic Socialist
 
 
 875
 Movement (PASOK) won a comfortable majority, and its leader, Andreas
 Papandreou became Prime Minister. The defeated New Democracy party assumed
 the role of the main opposition. Though in failing health, Prime Minister
 Papandreou remained in office through year's end and resigned in January 1996.
 The national police and security services have responsibility for internal security.
 Civilian authorities maintain effective control of all security forces, and police and
 security services are subject to a broad variety of legal and constitutional restraints.
 The Greek Parliament, a vigorous free press, the judiciary, committees and deputies
 of the European Parliament, and Greek and international human rights organiza-
 tions monitor their activities. Some members of the police and security forces com-
 mitted human rights abuses.
 Greece has a mixed economy in which the market system is overlaid by a large
 public sector that accounts for about 50 percent of gross domestic product. Relatively
 low growth, a high but declining inflation rate, a large but also declining budget
 deficit, and a 9.7 percent unemployment rate characterize the economy, which nev-
 ertheless provides residents with an advanced standard of living. To promote fur-
 ther economic development, Greece relies heavily on the European Union (EU) for
 subsidies and loans.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but there
 were problems in some areas. There continued to be credible reports that police mis-
 treat suspects during interrogation in some drug and other criminal investigations
 and that some police and military personnel occasionally abused Albanian illegal
 aliens. However, during their expulsion, conditions for Albanian illegal aliens im-
 proved considerably in 1995 after the massive expulsions of September-October
 1994. The Government continued to use Article 19 of the Citizenship Code to revoke
 the citizenship of Greek citizens who are not ethnically Greek, and Article 20 of the
 same Code was used to revoke the citizenship of several Greek citizens abroad who
 have asserted a "Macedonian" ethnicity.
 On occasion the Government placed international and domestic human rights
 monitors under surveillance. Information about their private meetings and activities
 subsequently appeared in the press. In September the courts dismissed a lawsuit
 initiated by a private citizen in May 1994 and joined by the public prosecutor
 against Christos Sideropoulos under Article 191 of the Criminal Code for statements
 Sideropoulos allegedly made at a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCM press conference in Copenhagen in 1990.
 The Government formally recognizes only one minority, the Muslim minority re-
 ferred to in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. It refuses to acknowledge formally the
 existence of any other minority and denies members of the Slavophone community
 the right to declare themselves a minority. As a result, some members of minorities
 (as defined in accepted international human rights norms) find it difficult to express
 freely their identity and to maintain their culture.
 Responding to a Council of Europe (COE) team of international monitors which
 issued a report on its visits to police stations, prisons, and psychiatric hospitals, the
 Government took corrective action to relieve severe overcrowding and harsh living
 conditions in some prisons and police holding centers. Problems remain, however,
 as evidenced by a violent prison riot in November. All pending cases which restrict
 freedom of expression, except two, have been dropped since the Government pro-
 scribed the prosecution of crimes committed by or through the press. There are some
 restrictions on freedom of religion; one prosecution for proselytizing was initiated in
 1995, and more Jehovah's Witnesses were harassed by authorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were a few credible reports of shootings at the Greek-Albanian border of
 illegal Albanian migrants being apprehended by Greek authorities. One death was
 reported in February, and another Albanian was reported shot and hospitalized the
 same month. The Government of Albania complained to the Government about
 these incidents, stating that both Albanians were killed. A military inquiry exoner-
 ated the soldiers involved.
 There were no deaths attributed to Greek terrorists in 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of 3 years to life imprisonment. However,
 this law has never been invoked, even though a December 1993 report by the COE's
 
 
 876
 
 Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment (CPT) concluded that certain categories of persons detained or arrested
 by the police particularly persons arrested for drug-related offenses or for crimes
 such as murder, rape, or robbery run a significant risk of being ill-treated and are
 occasionally subjected to severe il-treatment or torture.
 The CPT reprted allegations of ill-treatment that included kicks, punches, slaps,
 stampin on feet, as well as blows with the butt of a pistol or wooden sticks. The
 report auo noted allegations of an even more serious kind, in particular of falanga
 (beating on the soles of the feet) and the administration of electric shocks. It indi-
 cated that the Athens and Thessaloniki police had inflicted such treatment at police
 headquarters. The CPT team's medical personnel confirmed that physical evidence
 from the victims was consistent with their allegations.
 The Government conducted its own internal review of the CPT charges and as of
 September reported that of the 33 lawsuits filed against policemen m the period
 1989-93 for abuse, torture, and ill-treatment, 11 cases were still pending in court
 or under investigation; in 8 cases the police officers were found innocenf; 1 police
 officer has appealed his sentence to 2 years in prison for harassing a prisoner dur-
 ing interrogation; and in 14 cases the charges were dropped. The Government re-
 fused to accept the Committee's observations concerning investigation methods, tor-
 ture, and ill-treatment dismissing them as unreliable and without foundation.
 Two police commanders were retired following their decision to use tear gas dur-
 ing a demonstration by pensioners in Athens in March. At least four of the dem-
 onstrators required hospitalization. Two members of the Thessaloniki traffic plice
 were reportedly suspended from duty in September after an investigation confimed
 they had abused a 32-year-old man. No judicial action was taken against officers
 accused of abuse, and few strong disciplinary actions were reported.
 A 1994 law which permits paroling prisoners who have served two-fifhs (versus
 the previous three-fifths) of their prison terms has not relieved prison overcrowding.
 Credible reports indicate that prisons, especially in Attica, remain overcrowded. Ac-
 cording to prison statistics from the Ministry of Justice, substantial overcrowding
 continues to plague Korydallos and other Greek prisons. Overcrowding contributed
 to serious rioting in Korydallos. While the capacity of Korydallos (the largest prison,
 located in Athens) is 450 inmates, over 1,100 were housed there throughout the first
 10 months of the year. As of October 1, the number of prisoners throughout Greece
 was 5,866 while the total capacity of the prison system was 4,087.
 In the prison system, there were several credible reports of rape by inmates (in-
 cluding rape of juveniles by other juveniles), physical abuse by prison guards, and
 violence perpetrated by inmates including against foreign prisoners. Several inmate
 revolts over conditions occurred. The Albanian Government in February protested
 inmate violence directed at Albanian inmates at the Larissa prison and reportedly
 condoned by prison officials. When given permission to visit the prison, Albanian
 consular officers found that the individuals who had complained of violence had all
 been transferred to other prisons. Helsinki Watch monitors were refused permission
 to evaluate prison conditions for Albanian inmates at Korydallos prison in Septem-
 ber. In November a violent revolt in that prison led to the hanging by inmates of
 one prisoner and three other self-induced deaths from drug over ose. Prison condi-
 tions for conscientious objectors improved somewhat as a result of government ac-
 tions to reduce overcrowding and to increase work opportunities in prisons, which
 reduced the time of imprisonment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests, except during the actual commission of a crime, and the law
 prohibits arbitrary arrest orders. Police must, by law, bring a person arrested on
 the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime before an examining magistrate
 within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the release
 of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day exten-
 sion of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "speedy procedure." Al-
 though legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases, the short period of time may inhibit the defendants ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendants may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The speedy procedure was
 used in less than 10 percent of misdemeanor cases. It does not apply to felonies.
 The police sometimes violate these legal safeguards. For example, both the CPT
 team and two credible defense lawyers stated that the police, during investigation
 of serious crimes, occasionally interrogated suspects as "witnesses, allegedly be-
 cause witnesses do not have the right to legal representation during police question-
 ing. Statements made to the police in these circumstances may be used against
 
 
 877
 these persons in court if they are later charged and brought to trial. Witnesses do
 not have the legal right to remain silent, although they are not required to testify
 against themselves. In such cases access to a lawyer can be effectively denied until
 aer interrogation, which in some cases has resulted in torture or ifl-treatment and
 the subsequent signing of a statement. These circumstances were reportedly most
 likely to occur in cases of serious crimes, including drug offenses, in which the police
 did not have sufficient evidence to convict without a confession. The Governent did
 not prosecute and punish any officials for such misconduct during the year.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention was 18 months for felonies
 and 9 months for misdemeanors. Defense lawyers complain that pretrial detention
 is overly long and overused by judges. A panel of judges may grant release pending
 trial, with or without bail. A person convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to
 2 years or less may, at the court's discretion, pay a fine in lieu of being imprisoned.
 The percentage of the incarcerated population comprised of pretrial detainees was
 33 percent, according to government sources.
 Exile is unconstitutional, and no cases have been reported since the restoration
 of democracy in 1974. However, Greek citizens not of ethnic Greek origin who travel
 outside the country may be deprived of their citizenship and refused readmittance
 to the country under Article 19 of the Citizenship Code. Article 20 of the Code per-
 mits the Government to strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to
 the interests of Greece for the benefit of a foreign state." Article 19 was applied in
 72 cases in 1995; no Article 20 cases were reported (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial--The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary, but there are charges that judges sometimes allow political criteria,
 including the desire to obtain promotion, to influence their judgments. The judicial
 system includes three levels of courts, appointed judges, an examining magistrate
 system, trial by judicial panels, and the right of appeal by both prosecution and de-
 fense.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses, or the cases involve national security matters. A-cording to defense attor-
 neys, the latter provision has not been invoked since the restoration of democracy
 in 1974. The defendant enjoys the presumption of innocence, the standard of proof
 of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the
 right of access to the prosecution's evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses,
 and the right to counsel. Lawyers are provided to defendants (in felony cases, only)
 who are not able to afford legal counsel.
 Although non-Greek speaking defendants have the right to a court-appointed in-
 terpreter, the low fees paid for such work often results in poor quality of translation;
 foreign defendants complain that they do not understand their trials.
 The legal system does not discriminate against women or minorities, with some
 exceptions: Article 19 of the Citizenship Code (see Section 2.d.) applies only to Greek
 citizens who are not ethnically Greek; Orthodox and non-Orthodox religions have
 different legal procedures for applying for a "house of prayer" permit (see Section
 2.c.); non-ethnic Greek citizens are legally prohibited from settling in a large "super-
 vised" zone near the frontier (in practice this prohibition is not enforced); and a
 1939 law prohibits the functioning of private schools in buildings owned by non-Or-
 thodox rehgious foundations. (However, in practice non-Greek Orthodox schools and
 churches are given permission to be established.)
 The Government hias taken Christos Sideropoulos to trial two times in 4 years for
 speakin  publicly about the existence and rights of what he identifies s a "Macedo-
 nian" inority. One of his cases was dismissed by the courts this year; the other
 was dismissedearlier.
 As noted above, the courts continue to permit prosecutions of minority activists
 who violate laws that limit freedom of expression (see Section 2.). However, no one
 has been imprisoned as a result of such charges in the last 5 years. Those convicted
 have been a owed to convert their convictions into a fine of approximately $14 per
 da.ere were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Greece
 in September ratified the European Convention on Protection of an Individual from
 Use of Personal Information Thrugh Informatics Technology, which prohibits the
 collection or use of sensitive personal information. Th~e Constitution prohibits inva-
 sion of privacy and searches without warrants, and the law permits the monitoring
 of personal communications only under strict judicial controls. However, the number
 of persons and groups subjected to government surveillance in recent years raises
 questions about safeguards.
 
 
 878
 The security services continued to target human rights activists, non-Orthodox
 reliogious groups and minority group representatives and to monitor foreign dip-
 lomats who met with such indivi uals. On several occasions, information about such
 *vate meetings was given to the press, apparently by government representatives.
 fluman rights activists also reported the continuation o suspicious openings and di-
 versions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published
 in newspapers with apparent links to Greek security services. So far as is known,
 the Government took no steps to stop such practices or to prosecute those involved.
 In June 1994, a parliamentary investigating committee recommended indictment
 of former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former
 Mitsotakis administration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989
 to 1991. In January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against
 Mitsotakis. Criminal charges against the others were also dropped.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected these rights in
 practice, but with some exceptions. Some legal restrictions on free speech remain
 in force; the Government continues to use laws to charge individuals who raise po-
 litically sensitive topics such as the assertion of nonrecognized ethnic minority iden-
 tification.
 These laws were invoked in September when the public prosecutor of Florina
 charged the "Rainbow" Party with instigating division among the people by using
 a Slavic place name for a Greek city on a bilingual sign p laed outside its office.
 The prosecutor confiscated the sign, but it was subsequently replaced by party offi-
 cers. Later the same day a mob including the Mayor of Florina forcibly removed the
 new sign; the office was later ransacked and its contents burned by unidentified per-
 sons during the night. Rainbow leaders filed suit against the State for its actions.
 Two other freedom of expression cases from previous years involving the "Oakke
 Six" and Michael Papadakis were scheduled to be heard by appeals courts in 1996.
 Charges against Christos Sideropoulos (see Section i.e.) concerning the right of an
 individual to identify himself as a member of a 'Macedonian" minority in Greece
 were dropped. The charges in this case were based on what the individual said, not
 on violent acts or criminal behavior.
 On matters other than those involving the question of ethnic minorities, Greece
 generally enjoys a tradition of outspoken public discourse and a vigorous free press.
 Still, the Athens prosecutor filed charges in December against a university professor
 and an actor for defending on a television talk show the actions of rioting students
 at the Athens Polytechnic University in November. (The two blamed society for not
 living up to its responsibilities more than they blamed the students.) The two were
 charged under a law which states that 'whoever publicly praises a committed crime
 thus putting public order at risk is punishable by up to 3 years' imprisonment." Sa-
 tirical and opposition newspapers do not hesitate to attack the highest state au-
 thorities. The Constitution allows for seizure (though not prior restraint), by order
 of the public prosecutor, of ublications that insult the President, offend religious
 beliefs, contain obscene artic es, advocate violent overthrow of the political system,
 or disclose military and defense information. Seizures have been rare, however, and
 none occurred in 1995.
 In December 1993, the Government repealed a law which forbade "insulting au-
 thority" and proscribed prosecution of otherwise actionable "offenses committed by
 or through the press." As a result of these changes, a number of trials involving re-
 strictions on freedom of speech initiated under the previous Government, including
 the cases of five Trotskyites and two journalists, were terminated. With the Decem-
 ber 1993 repeal of an antiterrorism law, the Government lifted restrictions on the
 publishing of the public communications of terrorist groups.
 Several other articles of the Penal Code that were used in the past to restrict free
 speech and press remain in force. (Article 141 of the Criminal Code forbids "expos-
 ing the friendly relations of the Greek State with foreign states to danger of disturb-
 ance;" Article 191 prohibits "spreading false information and rumors liable to create
 concern and fear among citizens and cause disturbances in the country's inter-
 national relations and inciting citizens to rivalry and division, leading to disturb-
 ance of the peace;" Article 192 prohibits inciting citizens to acts of violence or to
 disturbing the peace through disharmony among them.) No new cases were reported
 in 1995 which involve these laws, with the single exception of charges against the
 Rainbow organization in Florina, which involved Article 192 of the Criminal Code.
 In June Ioannis Nomidis and Aradni Papfaotiu were sentenced to 3  and 3 years
 for aggravated defamation under Article 363; they remain free pending a spring
 1996 appeal.
 
 
 879
 The appal of a freedom of speech conviction based on events in 1989 brought be-
 fore The European Commission of Human Rights by former member of parliament
 Sadik Ahmet Sadik was referred to the European Court of Human Rights in 1995.
 The Commission found that the Government had restricted Sadik's freedom of ex-
 Sression in violation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human
 ights. Two other appeals by Sadik were pending before the Commission or Court
 when Sadik died in an automobile accident in July. No evidence of foul play has
 been brought to light as a result of the official investigation into Sadik's death.
 The Constitution provides that the State exercise immediate control" over radio
 and television. An independent, government-appointed body with the authority to
 enact rules governing private broadcasting established procedural regulations for
 radio severalyears ago. In 1993 it did so or television as well, issuing licenses to
 six private stations. Many other private television stations operated without i-
 ceases, however. State-run stations tended to emphasize the Governmnt's views
 but also reported objectively on other parties' proras and positions. Private radio
 and televsion stations operated independntly, of any government control on their
 reporting.
 Members of ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities freely publish periodicals
 and other publications, ofen in their native language. In Thrace, Turkish-language
 television broadcasts are widely available.
 Academic freedoms are respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceu Assembly and Assocation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. Police permits were routinely issued for public demonstrations,
 and there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused. However, reli-
 gious celebrations in the province of Florina in July, which included the perform-
 ance of Slavic songs and dances, were interrupted when power was cut to the vil-
 lages involved.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which was generally re-
 spected, except in cases involving ethnic minorities. In 1994 theSupreme Court
 upheld the 1991 decision of lower courts to deny registration to the "Macedonian
 Cultural Center"' in Florina, organized by Greeks who consider themselves of Slavic
 descent. The 1991 ruling held that "the true goal of the society.., is to affirm the
 idea of the existence of a "Macedonian" minority in Greece, which contradicts
 (Greece's) national interests and the law.' The organizers have appealed the deci-
 sion to the European Court of Human Rights, where it is pending._
 Government authorities, while recognizing in law the existence of the Muslim mi-
 nority, do not recognize de exi stence of any other minorities (see Section 5). This
 is contrary to the 1990 Copehaen document of the CSCE to which the Govern-
 ment is a party, which asserts that "to belong to a national minority is a matter
 of a person s individual choice."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes the Greek Orthodox Church,
 to which pe.rhaps 95 to 97 percent of the population at least nominally adhere, as
 the prevailing religion but prohibits discrimination against adherents of other reli-
 gions. The GekOrhoox Churh wield signfiant nfuence through itsrelton-
 ship with the Minisr of Education and Religion. Religious training  is mandatoi"g"ry
 in Greek public schools for Grek Orthodox pupils. Non-Orthodox students are ex-
 empt from this requirement. However, reports suggest that some teachers punish
 Jehovah's Witnesses for not attending Orthodox services in school and suspend
 them for not participating in school parades. The Constitution limits religious prac-
 tice by prohibiting proselytizing, but only one prosecution was initiated in 1995.
 This case involved two young Jehovah's Witnesses arrested in Volos. More Jehovah's
 Witnesses were harassed by authorities who arrested and held them for several
 hours at police headquarters but subsequently released them without pressing
 charges. Several cases involving proselytism from previous years resulted in not
 guilty verdicts in 1995; one such case was postponed until 1997. Several past convic-
 tions for proselytizing are pending before the European Court of Human Rights.
 Traditionally, Jehovah's Witnesses ministers were not granted the exemption
 from military service accorded under the law to clergy of "known religions" and thus
 served prison sentences for refusing military service. Since 1990-91, the Council of
 State, the highest court dealing with civil and administrative matters whose opin-
 ions are binding on the Government, has ruled that the Jehovah's Witnesses were
 a known religion" and has ordered the release of ministers who had refused induc-
 tion. However, the recruiting service of the armed forces regarded these rulings as
 applying only to individual appellants, not as binding precedents for subsequent Je-
 hovahs Witnesses ministers who were called up. It thus continued to rely, in the
 first instance, on the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Religion, which in
 turn accepted the view of the Greek Orthodox Church that the Jehovah's Witnesses
 are not a "known religion." As a consequence, for the past few years, ministers of
 
 
 880
 the Jehovah's Witnesses have been called up for military service and prosecuted for
 refusal to serve; only after conviction could they appeal to the Council of State.
 To open and operate a non-Greek Orthodox house of worship requires approval
 by the-Ministiy of Education and Religion. The Ministry bases its decision on the
 advisory opinion of the local Orthodox bishop. In reent years, it has not been un-
 common for such permission to be delayed or even, at times, withheld, though some
 denominations have been able to open and operate churches in the guise of cultural
 centers. Two Jehovah's Witnesses were sentenced in February to 4 months' impris-
 onment for holding meetings in an unliensed eeting plae on the island of
 Thassos. In May the European Commission on Human Rights found that Greece
 was in violation of Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of
 Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of worship, when in 1990 it
 convicted four Jehovah s Witnesses for holding religious meetings without a permit.
 In February and April, the police visited several unlicensed Mormon houses of
 prayer in Athens and threatened to arrest members meeting there. As a result
 these meeting places were closed, and Mormon worship services were consolidated
 at the church a single licensed house of prayer in the Athens area. The Government
 in September approved the church's 1993 application for a permit to build another
 house of prayer in the Athens area, after a Supreme Court ruling directing it to do
 so.
 wSeveral non-Orthodox religious denominations, including Mormons and Jehovah's
 Witnesses, report difficulties getting residence permits for foreign, non-EU citizen
 members of their faiths who come to Greece to perform missionary or charity work.
 Although such problems continued, these denominations reported overall better re-
 lations with immigration authorities and routine approval of extensions of tourist
 visas for these persons for up to 9 months.
 Mosques operate freely in western Thrace and in the islands of Rhodes and Kos,
 where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith reside. Some Muslims claimed that
 Greek law weakens the financial autonomy of the "Wakfs," community funds used
 for maintaining mosques, schools, and for charitable works, by placing the Wakfs
 under the administration of appointed "muftis" (Islamic judges and religious lead-
 ers) and their representatives. Those who object to this system say it violates the
 terms of the Treaty of Lausanne.
 In accordance with a 1990 presidential decree, the State appointed the two muftis
 and one assistant mufti in Greece, all resident in Thrace, based on the recommenda-
 tions of a committee of local Muslim scholars, religious authorities, and community
 leaders. The Government argued that it must appoint muftis because, in addition
 to their religious duties, they perform judicial functions in many civil and domestic
 matters under Muslim religious law, for which the State pays them.
 The Muslim minority remains divided on the mufti selection issue. Some Muslims
 accept the authority of the two officially appointed muftis; other Muslims have elect-
 ed two other muftis to serve their communities. The Government prosecuted the two
 unofficial muftis in 1995. Mehmet Amin Aga was sentenced in February to 10
 months in jail for usurping the authority of the mufti; he served half the sentence
 and paid a fine in lieu of serving the remainder after suffering health problems in
 jail. Ibrahim Sheril's trial on identical charges was postponed on May 24 for a year
 due to the absence of the main witness.
 Former Greek Orthodox priest Nikodomos Tsarknias, whose current affiliation
 with the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not recognized by the Government, lost
 his appeals of four earlier convictions in absentia for the crime of "pretense of au-
 thority," for wearing the garb of a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.
 Tsarknias, who has been charged more than a dozen times with similar charges
 since his 1991 defrocking from the Greek Orthodox Church, was sentenced in De-
 cember 1994 to 3 months in prison, convertible to a fine. Tsarknias has appealed
 this and all his previous convictions.
 Leaders of various non-Greek orthodox religious groups assert that their members
 face discrimination in reaching the senior ranks in government service. In March
 the Roman Catholic archbishop publicly asserted that according to existing regula-
 tions, only a Greek Orthodox can join the police force. Police authorities deny any
 such regulation. Furthermore, it appears that only those of Greek Orthodox faith
 can become officers in the Greek military. To avoid this restriction some members
 of other faiths resort to declaring themselves Orthodox. Senior government officials,
 when questioned about such allegations of discrimination, deny that it exists and
 point out certain persons not of the Orthodox faith who have successful careers in
 the military. No statistical evidence is available to support either allegation.
 The law mandates that Greek citizens declare their religion on their European
 Union (EU) identity cards that-if and when issued-would allow Greeks to travel
 freely within the EU instead of using passports. Current Greek national identity
 
 
 881
 cards, which will be replaced when the new EU cards are issued, include reference
 to the holder's religion, although individuals have the option of leaving that section
 blank. The law mandating the declaration of religion on the EU cards has caused
 particular concern among the Catholic and Jewish religious communities in Greece
 and abroad and has drawn strong criticism from the European Parliament. The
 Government declined in 1995 to act either to change the law mandating the declara-
 tion of religion on the cards or to issue the new EU cards.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution calls for freedom of movement within and outside the
 country and the right to return. However, Article 19 of the Citizenship Code distin-
 guishes between Greek citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Most
 Article 19 cases involve ethnic Turks from western Thrace, since only the 'Muslim
 minority is recognized as having non-Greek ethnicity. Greek citizens who are not
 ethnic Greeks may be deprived of their citizenship if it is determined that they left
 Greece with the apparent intention not to return. Determination of intent is made
 without input from the affected individual; in practice, this law is applied to mem-
 bers of the Muslim community c3nsidered to be "undesirable" by the security serv-
 ices. However, immigrants who are ethnic Greeks are normally recognized as citi-
 zens and accorded full rights, despite years or even generations of absence from
 Greece.
 The Interior Ministry initiates proceedings under Article 19 on the basis of re-
 ports by local domestic authorities or by Greek embassies or consulates abroad. It
 holds hearings at which the affected person is neither present nor notified of the
 hearing. Those who lose citizenship as a result of such hearings sometimes learn
 of this lss only when they seek to reenter Greece. According to the Ministry of the
 Interior, 72persons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 m 1995 (up from 42 for
 the whole of 1994). Of this number, the Government claims that 45 voluntarily re-
 linquished their citizenship. The former president of a predominantly Pomak (Mus-
 lims who speak a language akin to Bulgarian) village in western Thrace lost an ap-
 peal of a 1991 case stemming from his refusal to provide police with birth certifi-
 cates of village residents. He argued that the certificates would be used to strip citi-
 zenship under Article 19 from residents who had left the country. He paid a fine
 in lieu of serving his 1-year jail sentence.
 Persons who lose their Greek citizenship under Article 19 have the right of "ad-
 ministrative appeal" to the Interior Ministry; they can also appeal to the Greek
 Council of State and to the Council of Europe. Leaders of the Muslim community
 complained that the time and expense involved tended to discourage such appeals.
 Three persons who lost citizenship in 1994 have filed administrative appeals which
 are pending. In the past 3 years, 10 Muslims have won appeals of the Government's
 decisions to revoke their citizenship under Article 19.
 Another section of the Greek Citizenship Code, Article 20, permits the Govern-
 ment to strip citizenship from those who commit acts contrary to the interests of
 Greece for the benefit of a foreign state." While the law as written applies equally
 to all Greeks regardless of their ethnic background, the Ministry of Interior con-
 firmed in 1995 that the four cases in which Article 20 was applied in 1994 all in-
 volved former Greek citizens who identified themselves as members of the "Macedo-
 nian" minority. No such cases were reported in 1995.
 Greece maintains restricted military zones along its borders, including along the
 northern border with Bulgaria, an area where many Pomaks live. Until this year
 entry into the zone was controlled by authorities even for local inhabitants, causing
 them to complain that their freedom of movement was restricted. The Government
 announced this year that the sole remaining checkpoint into the village of Exinos
 within the zone would be removed, and restrictions for entry into the zone would
 be lifted. Although the regulations concerning the zone remain formally in place, in
 practice they are no longer enforced for Greek citizens. At least one foreign group
 was turned away from the zone following implementation of the new policy.
 Ethnic Greek immigrants, including those who came from the former Soviet
 Union since 1986 and from the civil war in Georgia, normally qualify promptly for
 citizenship and special assistance from the Government. The returnees have been
 settled initially on government-owned land in western Thrace, where government
 programs encouraging them to remain have met with limited success. Most move
 to Athens, Thessaloniki, or other cities, where job prospects are better.
 Greece frequently offers temporary asylum, though rarely permanent resettle-
 ment, to a rowing number of refugees from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. Permanent re-
 settlement in Greece is not usually available for non-ethnic Greek refugees. Approxi-
 mately 6,000 refugees have been officially recognized in Greece between 1980 and
 1995, including 400 Vietnamese refugees who have been accepted by the Govern-
 ment since 1979 for permanent resettlement. Two hundred eligible asylum seekers
 
 
 882
 have pending applications for refugee status that are under review by the Govern-
 ment in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 The Government continues to apprehend and return to Albania illegal Albanian
 inmigrants. Greece and Albania are currently engaged in discussions to come up
 with an agreement which would control and regularize the flow of what are now
 illegal Albanian emigrants to Greece.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution calls for full political
 rights for all citizens and for the peaceful change of governments and of the Con-
 stitution. While the Government generally respects these rights, there are some-
 times charges that the Government limits the right of some individuals to speak
 publicly and associate freely on the basis of their self-proclaimed ethnic identity and
 thus impinges on the political rights of such persons. It also combined voting dis-
 tricts in Thrace which had the consequence of making it impossible for ethnic Turks
 to be elected to national positions. Additionally, Roma representatives report that
 local authorities sometimes deprive Roma of the right to vote by refusing to register
 them.
 The Government headed by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of the Pan-
 hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won in free and fair elections in October 1993.
 Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term. Voting is mandatory for those
 over age 18, but penalties are not applied in practice. Members of the unicameral
 300-seat Parliament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot. Opposi-
 tion parties function freely and have brad access to the media.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in government or politics, representation of both at the higher levels of political
 life remains low. Women hold no ministerial positions in the Government and only
 2 of 29 subministerial positions. Eleven of the 300 members of Parliament are
 women. Women are underrepresented in the leadership of the two largest parties.
 The head of the Communist party is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allows domestic human rights organizations to operate but co-
 operation with them varies. In principle, it respects the right of foreign diplomats
 to meet with officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy, although
 the security services on occasion observe contacts of Greek human rights monitors,
 including listening in on conversations held between those monitors and human
 rights investigators and diplomats. The security services have also questioned mon-
 itors' intrlocutors in the afermath of meetings, reports of which have subsequently
 appeared in the press. Monitors view this activity as a form of intimidation which
 deters others from meeting with investigators. Human rights monitors have been
 called spies and traitors in the press.
 In September the Government denied permission for a representative from the
 International Helsinki Committee in Skopje, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Mac-
 edonia, to attend the trial of Christs Sideropoulos (see Section i.e.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law and the full protection of
 individual life, honor, and freedom irrespective of nationality, race, language, or reli-
 gious or political belief. Government respect for these rights in practice is uneven.
 Violence against homosexuals is not common in Greece. However, police occasion-
 ally harass gay bar owners and gay men, including detaining them at police stations
 overnight and sometimes physically mistreating them. Homosexuals discovered in
 the military service are dismissed for reasons of "mental illness," and would-be
 draftees are exempted from compulsory military service for the same reason. De-
 clared homosexuals exempted from military service for that reason are ineligible for
 public sector jobs.
 Women.-The incidence of violence against women that is reported to the authori-
 ties is low, but Athens' Equality Secretariat-which operates the only shelter for
 battered women-believes the actual incidence is "high. No statistics are available.
 The General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes (GSES), an independent govern-
 ment agency, asserts that police tend to discourage women from pursuing domestic
 violence charges and instead undertake reconciliation efforts, although they are nei-
 ther qualified for nor charged with this task. The GSES also claims that the courts
 are lenient when dealing with domestic violence cases.
 
 
 883
 As a result of pressure from women's groups, the Government established a center
 for battered women in Athens in 1988, and a residential facility for battered women
 and their children opened in 1993. These centers provide legal advice, psychological
 counseling, information on social services, and temporary residence for battered
 women and their children.
 According to the police, trafficking in women for prostitution, mostly from the
 former Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, has increased sharply in re-
 cent years. Of 1,300 arrests for prostitution without a license in 1994 in Attica prov-
 ince (which includes Athens), 500 were foreigners. Sixty percent of the foreign pros-
 titutes were Albanian, 30 percent were Russian, and 10 percent were from other
 former Eastern European countries. Police estimate that foreigners constitute 2,000
 of the 5,000 prostitutes in Greece. In July the police broke up a prostitute-smug-
 gling ring, arresting the local head of the Aliens' Police Bureau and several other
 police officers at the Greek-Bulgarian border crossing of Promahonas and several
 nightclub owners. Press allegations of the sale of visas at Greek consulates abroad
 to trafficking rings is reportedly being investigated by the Government.
 There are broad constitutional and legal protections for women, including equal
 pay for equal work, but the GSES maintains that these laws are not consistently
 enforced, and as a consequence women generally receive lower salaries than men
 for similar jobs. A GSES report states that in 1993 average women's salaries in re-
 tail trade were 79.4 percent of those of men in comparable positions. Although there
 are still relatively few women in senior positions, in recent years women have en-
 tered traditionally male-dominated occupations such as the legal and medical pro-
 fessions in large numbers.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing adequate basic health and
 education services for children. However, some social groups, such as Roma and ille-
 gal immigrants, are underserved, according to child health specialists. A 1993 study
 of child abuse estimated that 4,000 children are abused each year. The Child Health
 Institute, which receives referrals of children who have been abused, reports that
 its cases involve physical abuse (52.5 percent), neglect/malnutrition (37 percent),
 burns (7 percent), and sexual abuse (3.5 percent), the latter including sexual exploi-
 tation (most common), incest, and rape. Legislation enacted in 1992 prohibits and
 provides penalties for all forms of mistreatment of children perpetrated by parents
 or others. The State provides preventive and treatment programs for abused chil-
 dren and for children deprived of their family environment, seeking to ensure that
 alternative family care or institutional placement is made available to them.
 Children's rights advocacy groups claim that protection of hi h-risk children in
 state residential care centers is inadequate and of low quality. They cite lack of co-
 ordination between welfare services and the courts, inadequate funding of the wel-
 fare system, and poor staffing of residential care centers as systemic weaknesses in
 child abuse prevention and treatment efforts. Societal abuse of children in the form
 of prostitution, pornography, and child labor is rare.
 fn recent years, Greece has experienced a rise in the population of street children
 who panhandle or peddle at city intersections on behalf of adult family members or
 for organized crime. Police occasionally take these children into custody and bring
 them to state or charitable institutions which care for wayward children. Parents
 can reclaim their children from these institutions, but risk deportation if they are
 ille al immigrants.
 ew children are available for adoption by childless couples. As a result, cases of
 prosecution for the sale of Greek babies to childless couples have been reported. In
 May the Thessaloniki public prosecutor conducted an inquiry into allegations of a
 baby selling ring in a local maternity clinic which reportedly sold over 400 "orphans"
 to childless couples between 1935 and 1975. Some of the natural parents reportedly
 consented to give their children up for adoption while others were duped by clinic
 doctors and staff, who declared the newborns dead. In September the press reported
 the arrest of three Bulgarian women in northern Greece who were charged with at-
 tempting to sell their babies. The women were reportedly part of a network which
 has brought more than 100 pregnant women from Bulgaria to give birth in Greek
 hospitals.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation mandates the hiring of disabled persons in
 public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons. However, the law
 is reportedly poorly enforced, particularly in the private sector. The law states that
 disabled persons should number 3 percent of staff in private enterprises. In the civil
 service, 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of telephone operator posi-
 tions are reserved for disabled persons. Persons with disabilities have been ap-
 pointed to important positions in the civil service, including that of Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Ministry of Welfare.
 
 
 884
 The Construction Code mandates physical access for disabled persons to private
 and public buldigs, but this law too is poorly enforced. In thepast 2 years, ramps
 and special curbs for the disabled have been constructed on Athens streets and at
 public buildings, and sound signals have been installed at some city street crossings.
 Since 1993 the Government has been replacing old city buses with new ones with
 stairs specially designed for the disabled. The new Athens subway lines under con-
 struction will provide full access for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Several religious denominations, including the Roman
 Catholic Church, reported difficulties mn dealing with Greek authorities on a variety
 of administrative matters. Privileges and lega prerogatives granted the Greek Or-
 thodox Church are not routinely extended to other recognized religions. Rather, the
 non-Greek Orthodox must make separate and lengthy applications to government
 authorities on such matters as arranging appointments to meet with Ministry of
 Education and Religion officials and gaining permission to move places of worship
 to larger quarters.
 Members of several non-Greek Orthodox churches report receiving death threats
 or threats against the careers of family members if they did not disassociate them-
 selves from their religion.
 According to Jehovah's Witnesses, teachers no longer face difficulties gaining or
 keeping employment in public and private schools, except in rare instances in rural
 areas. Jehovah's Witnesses are now treated as a "known religion" for the purpose
 of employment by the Ministry of Education, which hires public school teachers.
 Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses who claim employment discrimination
 now number only three: one pending before the Council of State and two in lower
 courts.
 In 1994 there were six cases regarding employment discrimination against Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses one of which reached the Council of State. Each case involved the
 refusal of the Ministry of Education to grant teaching permits to the Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses. In the lead case, which dated from 1989, the Adinistrative Court of Appeal
 in Patras overturned the Ministry's decision; although he subsequently received his
 permit, the Jehovah's Witness reportedly intends to file a civil suit against the State
 to collect damages. As a result o this ecision, all six litigants (after filing new ap-
 plications) received permits by June.
 Lenders of the Jewish community in Greece have lobbied the Greek government
 for several years to delete anti-Semitic references from Greek public school text-
 books. Although the Government deleted two such references in 1994, three ref-
 erences to Jews as moneylenders remain.
 National/RaciallEtwhnic Minoritis.There are communities in Greece which
 identify themselves as Turks, Pomaks, Vlachs, Roma, Arvanites, and Macedonians
 or Slavomacedonians. Many are fully integrated into Greek society. The only minor-
 ity Greece formally recognizes is the "Muslim minority" referred to in the 1923
 Treaty of Lausanne. The Government insists on the use of that rubric to refer to
 several different ethnic communities. A substantial part of the Muslim minority is
 ethnically Turkish or consists of Turkish-speakers in western Thrace; the Govern-
 ment estimates their number at some 120,000 persons. In addition to people of
 Turkish origin, the Muslim minority includes Pomaks and Roma. Many Greek Mus-
 lims, including Pomaks, identify themselves as Turks and say that the Muslim mi-
 nority as a whole has a Turkish cultural consciousness. The use of the word
 "tourkos" ('Turk") is prohibited in titles of organizations, though individuals may le-
 gally call themselves asourkos." To most Greeks, the word ourkos" connotes Turk-
 ish identity or loyalties, and many object to its use by Greek citizens of Turkish ori-
 gin. Use of a similar adjective, "tourkoyennis" (of Turkish dscentaffdiationeth-
 nicity), however, is allowed (see Section 2.b.).
 Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (estimates range widely,
 from under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of Greek citizens who are descended from
 Slavs or Slavophons. Some still speak a Slavic dialect, particulariy in the Florina
 district. A small number of them consider themselves to be members of a distinct
 ethnic group which they identify as "Macedonian" (sef-dcribed "Macedonians" are
 hereafter referred to as "Macdonian") and assert their right to minority status. The
 Government continues to harass and intimidate some of these people, including
 Slacing one person on trial for asserting the existence of a "Macedonian" minority
 (see Section 2.a.), denying their right to association (see Section 2.b.), monitoring ac-
 tivists' meetings with human rights investigators (see Section 2.d.) and accusing ac-
 tivists publicly of being agents of a foreign government. These activists say that, as
 a result, some Greeks who consider themselves "Macedonian" did not declare them-
 selves openly for fear of losing their jobs or for fear of other sanctions. The Gover-
 ment's sensitivity on this issue stems from a widely-held belief that people who
 claim to be members of a "Macedonian" minority may have separatist aspirations.
 
 
 885
 Greece's dispute with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over that coun-
 try's name heightened this perception.
 A 1994 report by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki entitled "Denying Ethnic Iden-
 tity-the Macedonians of Greece" charged that an ethnic "Macedonian" minority
 with its own language and culture exists in northern Greece and that the Greek
 Government's denial of that minority is in violation of international human rights
 laws and agreements. The report also states that the Greek Government discrimi-
 nates against this minority in violation of international law or agreements to which
 it is a party. In responding to these charges, the Government says that it recog-
 nizes, under the  ope  agen CSCE document, the right of individuals to identify
 themselves as members of ethnic minorities. It states that such self-identification
 nevertheless does not require government recognition of such a minority or entitle
 its members to any privileges under CSCE or other instruments. As noted, however,
 the Government continues to deny the rights of free speech and association to some
 who have tried peacefully to assert what they consider to be their minority rights.
 Government officials and courts deny requests by individuals and groups to iden-
 tify themselves using the ancient term "Macedonian," because some 2.2 million eth-
 nic (and linguistically) Greek citizens in the northern Greek region of Macedonia al-
 ready use the term to identify themselves. The Government does not define the
 Slavic dialect spoken by some thousands of northern Greeks as "Macedonian," and
 government officials deny that it is a separate language at all. The officials also note
 that Greece regulates the establishment of all commercial language academies and
 question whether advocates of "Macedonian" language schools meet the relevant re-
 quirements. They say that the Government would not interfere with the holding of
 informal language classes within the Slavophone community. When a political party
 hung a bilingual Greek and Slavic name sign outside its office, the public prosecutor
 in Florina confiscated the sign and charged the party with instigating division. In
 response, the Party sued the mayor and other officials. These cases remained open
 at ya?' end.
 Re Secretariat for Adult Education (a government agency) estimates the number
 of Roma in Greece at some 300,000. Almost half of the Roma population is perma-
 nently settled, mainly in the Athens area. The other half is mobile, working mainly
 as agricultural laborers, peddlers, and musicians throughout the country. Govern-
 ment policy is to encourage the assimilation of Rma. Poverty, illiteracy, and social
 prejudice continue to plague large parts of the Roma population. The Secretariat for
 Adult Education conducts education and training programs targeting the Rma pop-
 ulation, including the use of mobile schools. Some 1,200 Roma children attended the
 mobile school program during the last school year.
 The usage of public health facilities by Rma is low because of the low rate of
 integration of Rma communities into Greek society and social security systems.
 Ninety percent of Rma are not insured by any of the government social security
 systems because they are self-employed or work in off-the-boks jobs that do not
 make contributions to the social security system. The fact that health facilities are
 not located close to the Roma camps also contributes to their low rate of access.
 The Treaty of Lausanne provides that the Muslim minority has the right to Turk-
 ish-language education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Is-
 tanbul (now reduced to about 3,000 . Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular
 Turkish-language schools. Government disputes with Turkey over teachers and text-
 books caused these secular schools serious problems in obtaining faculty and teach-
 ing materials in sufficient number and quality.
 Under a 1952 educational protocol, Greece and Turkey may annually exchange 35
 teachers on a reciprocal basis. The teachers serve in Istanbul and western Thrace,
 respectively, but in recent years the Greek side limited the exchanges to 16 teachers
 per country due to the dwindling needs of the small and agg Greek population
 in Turkey. In Greece over 9,000 Muslim children attended Turkish-language pri-
 mary schools. Around 650 attended Turkish-language secondary schools, and ap-
 proximately 1,000 attended Greek-language secondary schoolsany Muslims re-
 ortedy went to high school in Turkey due to the limited number of places in the
 Turkish-lnuae secondr schools, which are assigned by lottery.
 In 1995 no uslim Greeks succeeded in passing the entrance examinations to at-
 tend a Greek university. The Government has enacted several measures that should
 improve the educational situation of Muslims in Thrace. A new education bill pro-
 incentives for Muslim and Christian educat rs to reside and teach in isolated
 villages. The new law also permits the Minister of Education to give special consid-
 eration to minority, i.e., Muslim, graduates of Muslim high schools and of the Spe-
 cial Pedagogic Academy of Thessaloniki for admission to Greek universities and
 technical institutes.
 
 
 886
 The rate of employment of Muslims in the public sector and in state-owned indus-
 tries and corporations is much lower than the Muslim percentage of the population.
 In Xanthi and Komotini, while Muslims hold seats on the town council, there are
 no Muslims among the regular employees of theiprefecture. Ethnic Turks and other
 Muslims in Thrace claim that they are hired only for lower-level, part-time work.
 The Government says lack of fluency in written and spoken Greek and the need for
 university degrees for high-level positions limits the number of Muslims eligible for
 government jobs.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 as needed. In the Komotini district in Thrace, where many ethnic Turks live, the
 office of the district governor ("nomarch) has Turkish-language interpreters avail-
 able.
 Claims of discriminatory denial of Muslim applications for a license to operate
 businesses, own a tractor, or construct property have diminished greatly in recent
 years. Two Muslims were allowed to open pharmacies in Komotini after overcoming
 a long series of hurdles imposed by the Government and Orthodox Christian coi-
 petitors. Basic services provided to Muslim-populated neighborhoods and villages
 (electricity, telephones, paved roads) in many cases continue to lag far behind those
 provided in non-Muslim areas.
 In May Turkish Minister of the Presidency Gildirim Aktuna was slightly injured
 during a visit to Thessaloniki when rightwing and pro-Kurdish demonstrators
 breached police security lines; one grabbed him by the neck. Demonstrators also
 broke a window on his bus, pelting it with rocks, eggs, and coins. Officials said that
 poor plice planning was responsible for the breaches of security. While acknowledg-
 ing the inadequate security, officials also complained that provocative statements
 made by Aktuna prior to this incident heightened the chances for such demonstra-
 tions against him. No arrests were made, and no police officials were demoted as
 a result of the incident. Turkish government officials visited Greece on several other
 occasions without incident.
 In December the Defense Minister reported that members of the Pomak Muslim
 minority would for the first time be allowed to advance to the rank of reserve offi-
 cers in the military. Members of the Muslim minority in Rhodes are much more in-
 tegrated into local society.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and subsequent legislation provide
 for the right of association. All workers, with the exception of the military and the
 police, have the right to form or join unions.
 Approximately 30 percent of workers (nearly 1 million persons) were organized in
 unions. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor organization,
 the Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions from employees
 and employers. Only the five most powerful public sector unions have dues-with-
 holding provisions in their contracts, in addition to receiving Workers' Hearth sub-
 sidies.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brella confederations, one for civil servants and one, the General Confederation of
 Greek Workers (GSEE), for private sector employees. Unions are highly politicized,
 and there are party-affiliated factions within the labor confederations, but day-to-
 day operations are not controlled by political parties or the Government. There are
 no restrictions on who may serve as a union official. Unions maintain a variety of
 international affiliations and are free to join international associations.
 Legal restrictions on strikes include a mandatory period of notice, which is 4 days
 for public utilities and 24 hours for the private sector. Legislation mandates a skele-
 ton staff during strikes affecting public services, such as electricity, transportation,
 communications, and banking. Public utility companies, state-owned banks, the
 postal service, Olympic Airways, and the railroads are also required to maintain a
 skeleton staff during strikes.
 The courts have the power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. Unions complain, however, that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. In 1995 the
 courts declared a majority of strikes illegal for a variety of reasons, but no striking
 workers were prosecuted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation passed in 1955
 and amended in 1990 ensured the right to organize and bargain collectively in the
 private sector and in public corporations. These rights are respected in practice.
 There are no restrictions on collective bargaining for private sector employees. The
 union of civil servants negotiates with the Office of the Minister to the Prime Min-
 ister.
 
 
 887
 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted in 1989 providing for mediation proce-
 dures, with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. The legislation establishing a
 national mediation, reconciliation, and arbitration organization went into effect in
 1992 and applies to the private sector and public corporations (the military and civil
 service excluded).
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspectorate or a court inves-
 tigates complaints of discrimination against union members or organizers. Court
 rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 Greece has three free-trade zones, operated according to European Union regula-
 tions. Greek labor laws apiply equally in these zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forcea or Compulsory Labor:-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and the Ministry of Justic enforces this prohibition. However,
 the Government may declare the "civil mobilization" of workers in the event of dan-
 ger to national security, life, property, or the social and economic life of the country.
 The International Labor Orgaization (ILO) Committee of Experts has criticized
 this power as violating the standards of ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 in the industrial sector is 15, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum
 age is 12 in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are en-
 forced by occasional Labor Inspectorate spot checks and are generally respected.
 However, families engaged in agriculture, food service, or merchandising often have
 younger family members assisting them, at least part-time. Education is free and
 compulsory for all children through the ninth grade.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the Employers' Association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all Greek workers. The current minimum wage of $24 daily and $529
 monthly (Dr 5,338/119,220), effective July 1, 1995, is sufficient for a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the
 private sector and 37  hours in the public sector. The law provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets
 limits on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterized health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charged that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, was inad-
 equate. In its most recent review of this issue in 1992, the GSEE cited statistics
 indicating a high number of job-related accidents over the past two decades. Inad-
 equate inspection, failure to enforce regulations, outdated industrial plant and
 equipment, and poor safety training of employees were cited as contributing to the
 accident rate. Workers do not have the legal right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions they believe endanger their health. They do have the right, however, to lodge
 a confidential complaint with the Labor Inspectorate. Inspectors have the right to
 close down machinery or a process for a period of up to 5 days if they see safety
 or health hazards which they believe represent an imminent danger to the workers.
