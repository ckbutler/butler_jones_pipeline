 GHANA
 Ghana is a constitutional republic dominated by a strong presidency. Flight Lieu-
 tenant (ret.) Jerry John Rawlings has ruled the country for 17 years. He became
 the first President of the Fourth Republic following controversial elections in 1992.
 This ended 11 years of authoritarian rule under Rawlings and his Provisional Na-
 tional Defense Council (PNDC), which had seized power from an elected government
 in 1981. The opposition fully contested the 1996 presidential and parliamentary
 elections, which were described as peaceful, free, and transparent by domestic and
 international observers. President Rawlings was reelected with 57 percent of the
 popular vote. Rawlings' National Democratic Congress (NDC) party won 133 of the
 Parliament's 200 seats, just short of the two-thirds majority required to amend the
 Constitution. The Constitution calls for a system of checks and balances, with an
 executive branch headed by the President, a unicameral parliament, an independent
 judiciary, and several autonomous commissions, such as the Commission for Human
 Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ). In reality this system of checks and
 balances is circumscribed by a parliament dominated by the President's party, a
 hesitant judicial service, and a system-wide lack of resources that hobbles the effec-
 tiveness of all three branches. The presence of a significant number of opposition
 parliamentarians has led to increased scrutiny of the Government's activities. In
 June in peaceful elections voters elected new district assembly representatives and,
 for the first time, unit committee members to complete the local government struc-
 ture outlined in the Constitution. The judiciary appears subject to executive influ-
 ence on occasion and lacks adequate resources.
 Several security organizations report to various government departments. The po-
 lice, unde the jurisdiction of an eight-member Police Council, are responsible for
 maintaining law and order. A separate department, the Bureau of National Inves-
 tigations (BNI), handles cases considered critical to state security and answers di-
 rectly to the executive branch. Although the security apparatus is controlled by and
 responsive to the Government, monitoring, supervision, and education of the police
 in particular remain poor. Police committed some serious human rights abuses.
 The economy suffered considerably in 1998 due in part to a prolonged power sup-
 ply problem. A drought over the past few years culminated in record low water lev-
 els in the Volta Lake, diminishing the electricity generated by the Akosombo dam-
 the main power source. The economy remains dependent on agriculture, with about
 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 60 percent of employment derived
 from this sector. Gold, cocoa, and timber are the traditional sources of export earn-
 ings, although cocoa production declined due to inadequate rainfall and mining con-
 tinued to slow due to the fall in gold prices. Tourism is the third largest foreign
 exchange earner. Service sector growth outpaced both agriculture and industry.
 Overall the economy grew at a rate of 4.6 percent, down from 5.1 percent in 1997.
 Inflation fell from 20.8 percent in 1997 to 15 percent. Per capita GDP increased to
 approximately $407.
 The Government attempted to improve human rights practices, but problems re-
 main in several areas. Police use of excessive force resulted in a number of
 extrajudicial killings as well as injuries. There were continued credible reports that
 members of the police beat prisoners and other citizens; arbitrarily arrested and de-
 tained persons; and infringed on citizens' rights to privacy. Prison conditions re-
 mained harsh, and prolonged pretrial detention remained a problem. Inadequate re-
 sources and a system vulnerable to political influence compromised the integrity of
 the overburdened judicial system. The Government sometimes infringed on citizens'
 privacy rights. The Government continued to pressure the media. In 1997 it resorted
 to a rarely used criminal libel law to prosecute three independent journalists. These
 trials were postponed repeatedly, and one of the cases was dropped when the de-
 fendant died. Three other independent journalists were jailed following legally
 flawed contempt-of-court cases, furthering the belief that the judiciary operates
 under the influence of the executive. The nongovernment press, nonetheless, contin-
 ued its vigorous and outspoken criticism of-various government policies. Traditional
 practices, including a localized form of slavery, still result in considerable discrimi-
 nation against and abuse of women and children, with violence against women a
 particular problem. Violent clashes between Muslim sects persisted. In May a mob
 attacked a charismatic Christian church. Some ethnic groups complain of discrimi-
 
 
 175
 nation. Child labor is a problem in the informal sector. Vigilante justice also is a
 problem. During the year, legislation intended to provide additional protection to
 women and children came into effect.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, poorly trained and ill-equipped police killed nine persons and in-
 jured six others in attempting to control crowds, quell riots, or make arrests. One
 person was beaten to death while in custody. The Government has acknowledged
 the need to improve the quality and professionalism of its police force; however, po-
 lice continued to commit serious abuses. In April the Inspector General of Police
 (IGP) announced efforts to discourage the use of live ammunition in riot control,
 while not excluding its use in situations such as ethnic and tribal wars and other
 cases where it is deemed necessary.
 On May 1, in Accra a police officer fatally shot a 21-year-old armed robbery sus-
 pect while trying to arrest him. A squad of police officers arrived at the suspect's
 house at midnight. The individual was asked to come out of his house. He allegedly
 resisted arrest, and was shot by an officer in the scuffle. According to his family
 and neighbors, the deceased was an apprentice tailor.
 On May 13, police killed three persons in Aflao, a border-crossing town on the
 main road to Togo. Officers stationed at the border intervened as a group of thieves
 robbed a traveler. When the officers attempted to return to the police station in a
 taxi, the thieves attacked the vehicle, beating one of the officers into unconscious-
 ness. Another officer then fired on the attackers, killing one. The thieves, along with
 approximately 80 supporters, later attacked the police station, breaking windows
 and ransacking the offices. Police fired on the mob, killing two persons. More than
 100 persons were arrested in connection with the clash. Following an inquiry into
 the incident, the police were found -to have acted legally.
 On May 31, a police bullet killed a bystander during a post-game melee involving
 soccer fans in Sekondi approximately 135 miles west of Accra. Incited by a con-
 troversial decision by the referee, angry fans sought to attack officials and members
 of the opposing team. The police initially attempted to control the crowd with tear
 gas and batons and then fired warning shots. One of the shots killed a man. The
 officer in charge and four armed police personnel on duty during the incident were
 initially detained and subsequently suspended from duty in connection with the
 shooting, pending results of forensic tests.
 On July 2, a police officer shot and killed a man during a demonstration over
 workers' wages at a timber company in the Brong Ahafo region. A bullet fired by
 a police officer struck the victim, an employee at the company. The demonstration
 turned violent following the death, resulting in extensive property damage. The re-
 gional police commander had instructed the police force to use rubber bullets and
 tear gas to control the crowd but police did not obey his orders. The police officer
 responsible for the shooting was placed in custody pending an investigation.
 On September 13, in Fiapre a pregnant woman was shot fatally during a clash
 between persons demonstrating against a Brong Ahafo region chief and security per-
 sonnel who were attempting to restore order. Both sides were armed, and it is dis-
 puted who fired the fatal shot.
 On October 7, police arrested a 43-year-old farmer from Pramkese, in Eastern re-
 gion who was involved in a land dispute. He allegedly resisted arrest, and the police
 reportedly responded by handcuffing him, taking him to the police station, and beat-
 ing him. Following the beating he was rushed to a hospital, where he was pro-
 nounced dead. The officers involved in the beating were transferred, and the case
 is before the Attorney General.
 On October 28, a policeman fatally shot an Accra man during an arrest attempt.
 According to the police, the man was a well-known criminal who attacked the police
 with a cutlass and iron bar beating one officer into unconsciousness and wounding
 another before he was shot by the police. Neighbors claimed- that a five-officer police
 squad dragged the victim brutally out of his bed and shot him in the street. They
 deny that he was a criminal. At year's end an inquiry was underway, and the in-
 spector and constables involved were suspended.
 On December 27, a police officer shot and killed a man reportedly attempting to
 stab another officer during an attack on a police station near Koforidua, capital of
 the Eastern region. The mob allegedly was attempting to free a taxi driver being
 held in connection with a fatal hit and run accident. The officer who shot the alleged
 attacker was transferred to another station while investigations continued.
 
 
 In November following news of an eighth individual shot and killed by police offi-
 cers during the year, the police established a special judicial tribunal to try officers
 suspected of unlawfiul and careless use of weapons. In each of the shooting cases,
 the officers involved in the shootings were suspended from duty and an investiga-
 tion was undertaken. The findings of such investigations are referred to the Attor-
 ney General's office for action. The IGP also announced a retraining course for 50
 officers to improve police skills and-heighten awareness of their responsibilities. In
 a statement at the opening of the course, the IGP stated that the rampant and care-
 less use of firearms by some police personnel was causing a lot of "embarrassment"
 to the police administration.
 During 1997 five citizens were killed and seven injured as a result of bullets fired
 by police as warning shots. In one case, the police would not take responsibility. In
 a case involving a customs officer, the shooting was found to be justified, and the
 officer was transferred to another post. In the other cases, the authorities have been
 either unable to identify officers responsible in the shootings or the officers have
 been suspended, awaiting the results of a police investigation or a decision from the
 Attorney General's office.
 In 1997 the authorities fied murder charges against two policemen and a police
 laborer in the unexplained death of a man in an Eastern region police cell in 1996.
 In 1998 the Government again refused to launch an independent inquiry into the
 deaths of four demonstrators during a protest against government tax policy in May
 1995 and finally closed its case inconclusively. (There was a police report on this
 case, which was never released to the public.)
 In April the Minister of Youth and Sports won a libel case that was filed against
 a privately owned newspaper that reported on his possible involvement in the 1995
 killings of four demonstrators, following a mention of the case in the 1995 U.S. Gov-
 ernment report on human rights practices in Ghana. The courts ordered the owners
 of the newspaper to pay $13,000 (30 million cedis) to the Minister. However, ques-
 tions surround the outcome of the case, as the publisher failed to mount a defense.
 The Government continued to refuse to investigate extrajudicial killings in the
 early years of PNDC rule.
 On November 24, villagers in Ablekuma on the outskirts of Accra killed two po-
 licemen (see Section 1.c.).
 Religious factional violence led to a number of deaths (see Section 5).
 The press reported numerous cases of vigilante-style "instant justice" conducted
 by angry citizens and mobs on suspected criminals and suspected witches that led
 to a number of deaths.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports -of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the dignity of all persons shall be inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from human dignity; however,
 there were continued credible reports that members of the police and customs offi-
 cials beat prisoners and other citizens. It is generally believed that severe beatings
 of suspects in police custody occur throughout the country but go largely unreported.
 In October a 43-year-old farmer from Pramkese, who was arrested following a land
 dispute with a landlord, died allegedly from beatings administered while in police
 custody. Police used excessive force in attempting to control crowds, at times result-
 ing in citizens' deaths (see Section L.a.).
 Police corruption is a problem. Police set up illegal barriers to elicit bribes from
 motorists (see Section 2.d.). There were credible reports that police abuse their au-
 thority by arresting citizens in exchange for bribes from detainees' business associ-
 ates (see Section 1.d.).
 On October 3, three men were wounded when a policeman allegedly fired warning
 shots at their vehicle at the Adenta barrier near Accra. The driver of the vehicle
 reportedly ignored the policeman's signal to stop at the barrier and nearly hit him.
 On November 2, two girls accidentally were shot and wounded during an arrest
 attempt at Kasoa, near Accra. A five-man police squad attempted to arrest a man,
 but met with resistance from his family. During the struggle, one shot allegedly was
 fired, accidentally wounding the two girls. The officers involved in the shooting were
 taken into custody, and subsequently were released on bail, pending an investiga-
 tion.
 On November 24, villagers reportedly killed two policemen in Ablekuma on the
 western outskirts of Accra. The two officers were marking off a parcel of land they
 had purchased. On December 3, approximately 300 officers in 50 vehicles came to
 the village to locate the missing officers. About 100 persons, almost the entire popu-
 lation of the village, were arrested and made to watch as police burned houses and
 shops. Police allegedly beat several villagers. After a night in jail, 60 of the villagers
 
 
 177
 were released, and on December 8, 13 of the remaining detainees were arraigned
 on charges relating to the disappearance of the two policemen, whose bodies subse-
 quently were found mutilated and buried near Ablekuma.
 On December 6, a 26-year-old mother was shot inadvertently during a bungled ar-
 rest attempt by a policeman and a soldier outside her home. The rounds passed
 through the walls of her home and struck her inside; it is unclear who fired the
 rounds.
 The International Foundation for Election Systems 1997 post-election public opin-
 ion report stated that 43 percent of the population has little or no faith in the police
 service. In 1996 a police task force burned three villages in the Western region as
 it searched for a suspected killer. Hundreds of persons lost their homes and prop-
 erty. In 1997 public suspicion of the police was such that, in at least nine incidents,
 citizens in remote villages attacked police who reportedly were attempting to enforce
 the law. Eight police stations were ransacked, forcing the officers to flee and aban-
 don their sites. Although the police may have been attempting to enforce the law,
 their unprofessional approach triggered the public reaction. Police presence was re-
 established in some areas by the end of 1997.
 In September the IGP called for a house cleaning of the police administration,
 stating that "the harassment of civilians, unauthorized motor-checks, unlawful de-
 tention of suspects, collection of monies before granting bail, shoddy investigation
 of criminal cases, and other undisciplined acts which dent the image of the service
 continue to be perpetrated."
 Reports continued of isolated incidents in which Accra Metropolitan Assembly
 (AMA) operatives known as the Chameleon Bombers, allegedly inflicted injury and
 destroyed property. However, the degree of violence decreased following media at-
 tention. The AMA dissolved the group in October following repeated public criticism.
 Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city, reportedly deployed a similar force called the
 Sanitation and Decongestion Tigers to eject unlicensed street vendors from city
 streets.
 In August police used water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets, and truncheons to
 disperse an unauthorized student protest, injuring several persons (see Section 2.b.).
 A police inspector who reportediy was responsible for human rights abuses was
 suspended from service by the police administration in January. The inspector, who
 hadworked in the headquarters office in Accra, allegediy had abused his authority
 and violated individuals' rights for several years. He is undergoing psychiatric r-
 view.
 "Machomen" and land guards, private security enforcers hired by citizens to settle
 private disputes and vendettas or to protect property under development from en-
 croachment, caused injury and property damage. The Machomen are not legally con-
 stituted, but organized privately and operate outside the law. None; however, have
 been arrested for any illegal action, and police, to some extent, appear intimidated
 by them.
 Prisons are in most cases very poorly maintained, and conditions are extremely
 harsh. In 1996 the CHRAJ published its long-anticipated report on prison condi-
 tions. It described prisons as unsanitary, overcrowded, and poorly ventilated. Pris-
 oners are malnourished (reports of the daily food allowance per prisoner vary. A pri-
 vate newspaper has reported the allowance at less than 4 cents a day (80 cedis)
 while the prison administration states that the daily allowance is 65 cents (1,500
 cedis)). Families still supplement prisoners' food and bribe prison guards for visita-
 tion rights. Prisoners also suffer from lack of medicine unless paid for or provided
 by the inmates or their families. The report concluded that prison conditions were
 "a flagrant violation of the individual's fundamental human rights." The CHRAJ's
 findings and recommendations generated much positive press coverage and some
 changes; however, although the Government concurred with the 1996 findings, it
 stated that lack of funding in 1997 prevented further improvements. In spite of a
 continued lack of funding, some improvements were made during the year: an in-
 crease in prisoners' food allowance and an amnesty to old and ill prisoners. Juve-
 niles now more frequently are separated from the adult prison population. The
 Ghana Prisons Service Council has formed an assessment team to inspect facilities.
 While the CHRAJ has access to monitor the prisons, the Government resisted
 granting access to the press. Two journalists reported what they had experienced
 and observed during their 30-day incarceration.
 NGO's are not given access to prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. The Constitution provides for protection against arbitrary arrest, detention, or
 exile and states that an individual detained shall be informed immediately, in a lan-
 guage that the detained person understands, of the reasons for the detention, and
 of the right to a lawyer and to an interpreter, at state expense. It also requires judi-
 
 
 178
 cial warrants for arrest and provides for arraignment within 48 hours. In practice,
 however, many abuses occur, including detention without charge for longer than 48
 hours and failure to obtain a warrant for arrest. Authorities do not routinely notify
 prisoners' families of their incarceration; such information is often obtained only by
 chance.
 The court has unlimited discretion to set bail, which can be prohibitively high.
 The court may refuse to release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without
 charge for an indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. It
 is common to remand a prisoner to investigative custody. However, the Constitution
 reuiesithat a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonabl  time be re-
 ther unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure that he ap-
 pears at a later date for court proceedings.
 Despite the provisions of the law, abuses occur. Persons sometimes are detained
 for trivial offenses or on unsubstantiated accusations. Approximately 30 percent of
 the prison population consist of pretrial detainees. The Government has not imple-
 mented any meaningful policy to reduce the numbers of pretrial detainees, although
 the independent press has called for reduction of harsh bail conditions for suspects
 who do not pose a threat to society. Many credible sources report that private citi-
 zens pay the police to arrest business associates in deals gone awry.
 The 1996 CHRAJ report on prison conditions recommended improvement in the
 administration of criminal justice, which currently denies many citizens their con-
 stitutional rights to be charged within 48 hours, to have bail posted within the same
 period, and to a speedy trial. The report concluded that the "penal system is unwit-
 tingly but inexorably punishing the innocent" In response the Attorney General in
 1997 asked the CHRAJ for a list of those detained for 6 years or more in order to
 investigate their cases and the CHRAJ provided such a list. However, at year's end
 a committee still was investigating how the remanded prisoners either could be
 brought to trial quickly or released. Remanded suspects routinely may languish in
 prison without trial for up to 9 years. The CHRAJ reported one case of a 16-year
 detention.
 Two policemen detained without charge for 27 days in 1997 after a theft at the
 Attorney General's residence were freed on bail and their trial is in progress. Also
 in 1997, the BNI paid $11,000 (25.3 million cedis) in damages to a detainee held
 72 hours in a case of mistaken identity. Others unlawfully detained were released
 as they were discovered.
 Lawyers for a former army sergeant accused in an alleged 1994 plot to overthrow
 the Government appealed an Accra High Court decision to retry him for treason.
 His original trial ended in 1996, but judgment was postponed because of the illness
 and subsequent death of one of the trial judges. The defendant has been in custody
 since 1994.
 The Government does not practice forced exile and encourages citizens, including
 dissidents, living abroad to return. Some former government and PNDC officials
 have returned and resumed careers and political activities. "
 Rural women can be punished with banishment by traditional village authorities
 for teenage pregnancy or suspected witchcraft. The press reported that hundreds of
 women accused of witchcraft were sent to penal villages in the Northern region by
 traditional authorities such as a shaman. In 1997, 2 villages contained 400 elderly
 women, and 1 village contained 2,000 women and family members, all sentenced by
 village authorities who claimed to have the power to divine witches. Although the
 women face no formal legal sanction if they leave, most fear that they would be
 beaten to death if caught outside the penal villages (see Section 5).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary appears to be subject on occasion to executive
 influence. The Constitution allows the Government to nominate up to 15 members
 of the Supreme Court; confirmation is the responsibility of a Parliament dominated
 by the President's party. Furthermore, the Chief Justice is empowered to impanel
 the justices of his choice to hear cases. These provisions, along with a debilitating
 lack of resources, have hindered the court's role as a balance to the power of the
 executive branch and contributed to the perception that the judiciary is occasionally
 subject to executive influence.
 This belief was furthered by the judiciary's crackdown on members of the pri-
 vately owned press during the year. In late July, the courts incarcerated two jour-
 nalists for 30 days and fined the publishers heavily following a contempt-of-court
 case widely viewed as legally flawed. Two other journalists, with criminal libel law-
 suits pending, had their passports seized under court order. An editor was jailed for
 9 days in another questionable contempt-of-court case in July. All the affected jour-
 nalists are known to be avowed opponents of the Government and aggressive in
 their highly personal criticism of the President and his family (see Section 2.a.).
 
 
 The integrity of the legal system is compromised by a severe lack of financial,
 human, and material resources. There were no official charges of judicial corruption.
 However, in August the BNI reportedly questioned a judge, the chairman of an
 Accra regional tribunal, about allegations that he and his staff accepted a $9,000
 bribe to grant bail for a Nigerian woman arrested for drug smuggling. He has not
 been charged. A 1997 survey revealed that 66 percent of citizens believe that money
 influences the judicial system.
 The Constitution establishes two basic levels of courts: superior and lower. The
 superior courts include the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court, the High Court, and
 regional tribunals. Parliament may establish lower courts or tribunals by decree.
 The CHRAJ provides a forum to which citizens with grievances against government
 agencies or private companies can bring cases for mediation and resettlement (see
 Section 4).
 The CHRAJ's charter provides for it to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights and take action to remedy proven violations. It continues to hold workshops
 to educate the public, traditional leaders, the police, and the military on human
 rights issues. It mediates and settles cases brought to it by individuals with griev-
 ances against government agencies or private companies.
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs power to me-
 diate local matters and enforce customary tribal laws dealing with such matters as
 divorce, child custody, and property disputes. However, a number of laws passed
 during the PNDC era (1981-92), as well as the 1992 Constitution, have eroded
 steadily the authority of traditional rulers and vested it in civil institutions, such
 as courts and district assemblies.
 Legal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defendants are presumed
 innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be present, to be rep-
 resented by an attorney (at public expense if necessary), and to cross-examine wit-
 nesses. In practice the authorities generally respect these safeguards.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The trial of five defendants for alleg-
 edly plotting to overthrow the Government in 1994 continued and a verdict is ex-
 pected in early 1999.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within the pri-
 vacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication; however, this article
 has yet to be tested in court, and in practice the Government sometimes infringed
 on these rights. Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not
 always obtain them in practice. Observers assumed that the Government continued
 surveillance of citizens engaged in activities that it deemed objectionable. In the
 past, this included monitoring of telephones and mail. Several political activists re-
 ported being followed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and in practice these provisions generally were respected, although
 the Government continued to pressure the media. Opposition political parties and
 others frequently criticize the Government, and the Government has allowed more
 control of print and electronic media to be transferred to the private sector. None-
 theless, the Government continued to pressure some journalists and media organiza-
 tions, sometimes directly (e.g., through telephone calls), and increasingly by filing
 libel suits when it found coverage to be offensive. At year's end, there were an esti-
 mated 100 libel suits before the courts. Two of the pending suits were criminal libel
 suits filed by the Government, and the rest were filed by government officials in
 their personal capacities or by private individuals.
 There are more than a dozen newspapers including two government-owned dai-
 lies, two government-owned weeklies, and several privately owned newspapers pub-
 lished weekly, biweekly, or triweekly. One of the government-owned dailies has na-
 tional circulation. However, most newspapers circulate only in regional capitals, and
 many of the smaller private newspapers are available only in the capital.
 Accra has one government-owned and seven private radio stations, and there are
 a growing number of private stations outside Accra. Most stations are independent
 and air a wide range of viewpoints. There are three television stations. One govern-
 ment-owned station broadcasts nationwide. The other two, which are partially
 owned by the Government, broadcast signals available only in Accra. There are
 three Internet service providers in the country.
 The Government-owned media occasionally reported charges of corruption or mis-
 management in government ministries and government-owned enterprises, but they
 never directly criticized the Government's policies or President Rawlings' activities.
 In the past, the Government occasionally disciplined or dismissed journalists work-
 
 
 ing in government-subsidized media for articles deemed unacceptable. The Govern-
 ment ended subsidies to the state-owned publishing conpanies, and the newspapers
 are published by profit-making printing companies-but these have not been
 privatized.
 Some privately owned newspapers were harshly critical of the Government's poli-
 cies and of President Rawlings, his wife, and his regime generally, and some report-
 ers and editors were alleged, at time, to have failed to abide by professional ethical
 guidelines. Parties affected by such lapses-most often Government officials-
 showed a tendency to go to court. The Government, government officials, and pri-
 vate individuals filed a record number of civil libel suits (over 100 before the courts
 at year's end), and two criminal libel suits remain in progress. The Government con-
 tinued to prosecute two independent journalists under a rarely used sedition law for
 allegedly libeling President Rawlings and his wife, and, through them, the State.
 The trials, repeatedly postponed, were seen by many observers to signal a renewal
 of press harassment, signals that were strengthened in July when two other jour-
 nalists were incarcerated for 30 days following a legally flawed contempt-of-court
 case (see Section i.e.).
 The Government readily granted accreditation to foreign journalists. Foreign peri-
 odicals were sold in Accra and other major cities and circulated freely even when
 they contained articles critical of the Government. Most citizens obtain their news
 from the electronic media, Cable News Network, the Voice of America, and the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation radio service. Ghana has one privately held cable serv-
 ice which offers international programming to subscribers  _oughout the country.
 The Government again refused to launch an independent inquiry into the deaths
 of four demonstrators during a protest a ainst government tax policy in May 1995
 and in 1997 finally closed its case inconclusively (see Section l.a.). Some of the pri-
 vately owned media renewed calls for a thorough investigation on the anniversary
 of the incident. In April the Minister of Youth and Sports won a libel case that was
 ffied against a private newspaper that reported on his possible involvement in the
 1995 killings of four demonstrators, following mention of the incident in the 1995
 U.S. Government report on hlman rights practices in Ghana. The courts ordered
 the owners of the newspaper to pay $13,000 (30 million cedis) to the Minister. Ques-
 tions surround the outcome of the case, however, as the publisher failed to mount
 a defense (see Section l.a.).
 There was no restriction of academicfreedom. Academics are allowed to publish
 and pursue research. The National Union of Ghanaian Students, one of the more
 vocal critics of the Government, is allowed to organize and hold meetings. However,
 in late 1997, following a serious student brawl, the public university in Accra im-
 osed a ban on campus demonstrations, which remained in effect at year's end. The
 Union obtained a waiver to demonstrate against proposed residential fees for uni-
 versity students in May. Police disrupted an unauthorized demonstration in August
 (see Section 2.b.). Parliament established a committee to address the issue of fees
 and facilitate communication between students and the Government. Although the
 student union eventually withdrew from the discussions of its own volition, the com-
 mittee made fee recommendations lower than originally proposed, which the Min-
 istry of Education accepted.
 b. Freedom of Peacefi Assembly and Asseciation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in
 practice. The Government does not require permits for demonstrations. Parliament
 passed a public order law in late 1994 requiring that all organizers of "special
 events" or "processions" inform the police of their intentions so that the police can
 institute precautionary measures. The law also provides for curfews and arrest
 without warrants in specified instances. The authorities did not abuse the provi-
 sions of the law during the year.
 The public university in Accra banned on-campus demonstrations. University stu-
 dents obtained a waiver and demonstrated peacefully against proposed fees in May.
 However, in August police used water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets, and trun-
 cheons to disrupt an unauthorized protest. Several injuries resulted. The dem-
 onstrating students stateciied ted that the ban oniy applied to the previous
 academic year.
 Journalists and human rights activists marched on the Supreme Court in support
 of freedom of speech following the jailing of two journalists for contempt of court
 (see Section 2.a.). The demonstrations, monitored by police, were peaceful. Another
 group called the "Friends of the Rule of Law," which was widely believed to be gov-
 enent-inspired, staged a peaceful counter-demonstration.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. NGO's are required to register with the Reg-
 istrar General's office, but this registration is routine.

 The Electoral Commission must accredit political parties. The parties must show
 evidence of a "national character," such as official representation in all 10 of the
 country's regions. The Electoral Commission evaluates whether the party has shown
 evidence of a viable national support base before granting accreditation and can
 annul the registration of a party that fails to meet the criteria for being a viable
 party.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advantage or disadvantage at-
 tached to membership in any particular sect or religion. Foreign missionary groups
 generally have operated throughout the country with a minimum of formal restric-
 tions.
 Violent confrontations between Muslim sects in January and August led to deaths
 and injuries. The authorities acted in an evenhanded manner to restore order (see
 Section 5).
 On May 31, a mob of about 40 persons attacked a charismatic Christian church
 service, injuring dozens of worshippers and causing massive property damage. The
 p olice dispersed the attackers without firing any shots. A subsequent call by the
 Minister of Interior for Christians to respect traditional practices by observing a tra-
 ditional ban on drumming provoked a strong reaction from some Christians who ob-
 jected to perceived restrictions on freedom of worship. No suspects were charged in
 firebombings of the same church in December 1996 and in March. Four days before
 the May attack, the Accra Metropolitan Assembly had bulldozed the wall around the
 church parking lot, alleging violations of the lease (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights as an aspect of the provision
 for personal liberty, and the Government generally respects these provisions in prac-
 tice.
 Citizens and foreigners are free to move throughout the country. Police check-
 points exist nationwide to prevent smuggling, but most are unmanned during day-
 light hours. There were numerous reports that police used checkpoints to solicit
 bribes. Citizen complaints about police harassment caused the Government to re-
 duce the number of checkpoints from 125 to 38 in 1997 and to 31 by the end of
 the year. Government roadblocks and car searches are a normal part of nighttime
 travel in larger cities. In 1997 taxi drivers in Tamale struck in protest against per-
 sistent harassment by the police. The police administration has admitted that the
 force has a problem with some members occasionally erecting illegal barriers to so-
 licit bribes from motorists. The Inspector General of Police stated publicly in Sep-
 tember, "unauthorized motor-checks-and other acts of indiscipline which dent the
 image of the service continue to be perpetrated." Citizens are generally free to travel
 internationally and to emigrate or to be repatriated from other countries.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, and
 the law conforms in all particulars to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Sta-
 tus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Ghana has a liberal policy of accepting refu-
 gees from other West African nations. The Government provides first asylum. It pro-
 vided first asylum in recent years to Togolese refugees, most of whom have been
 repatriated as part of the UNHCR's voluntary repatriation program.
 The country continued to provide first asylum to 1,050 Togolese, approximately
 12,952 Liberians, 758 Sierra Leoneans, 102 Sudanese, and 26 Nigerians.
 There were credible reports that agents of the Togo Government operating in
 Ghana and sometimes pretending to be refugees, repeatedly induced police to arrest
 Togolese refugees and deliver them to Togolese security forces at the border, without
 due process of law and reportedly without the knowledge of senior Ghanian security
 officials. Fifteen refugees reportedly were repatriated forcibly to Togo in this man-
 ner on December 31, 1997.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, and
 citizens exercised this right through a democratic process in presidential elections
 held in December 1996. The country continued its transition from a one-party state
 to a more established constitutional system. The political system includes recognized
 opposition parties, which express their views freely within Parliament.
 President Rawlings was reelected in 1996 for a final 4-year term with 57 percent
 of the popular vote. The NDC retained control of the 200-member Parliament with
 133 seats, while opposition parties took 67 seats. The NDC fell one seat short of
 commanding the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. Three
 
 
 seats were contested, including those of two opposition members and one NDC mem-
 ber. The courts found in favor of one of the opposition members in 1998, and the
 other two cases still were pending at year's end. Opposition members are frustrated
 by impediments that the executive branch imposes by its refusal to support opposi-
 tion amendments to proposed legislation. Parliament still is working to develop ef-
 fective oversight of the workings of the executive branch.
 In June citizens elected representatives to the district assemblies and, for the first
 time, unit committees, which form the basis of the local government structure.
 These elections were held on a nonpartisan basis, as called for in the 1992 Constitu-
 tion. However, opposition groups contend that the local government system is
 stacked in favor of the ruling party, which appoints approximately one-third of the
 district assembly and unit committee members.
 There are no legal obstacles to the participation of women in government; how-
 ever, they constitute a small minority in government and politics. There are 18 fe-
 male parliamentarians. Several ministers and Council of State members are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 NGO's interested in human rights continued to grow in strength, and there were
 17 NGO's in the field at year's end. These NGO's operated without government in-
 terference (see Section 2.b.). The Government appears to cooperate with and to be
 responsive to human rights NGO's. Prominent NGO's include the Red Cross, Am-
 nesty International, the International Federation of Woman Lawyers (FIDA),
 Women in Law and Development in Africa, and Ghanalert. The Government cooper-
 ates with international humanitarian organizations, including the International
 Committee of the Red Cross.
 Although not an NGO, the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative
 Justice's (CHRAJ) charter provides for it to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights and take action to remedy proven violations. It continues to hold workshops
 to educate the public, traditional leaders, the police, and the military on human
 rights issues. It mediates and settles cases brought to it by individuals with griev-
 ances against government agencies or private companies.
 Parliament established the CHRAJ in 1993. By 1996 the CHRAJ had received a
 total of 12,409 petitions in its offices around the country and completed action on
 over 8,775. Forty percent of the cases were resolved through mediation. On average,
 the CHRAJ receives between 4,000 and 5,000new petitions a year, steadily increas-
 ing each year. The majority of the complaints lodged with the Commission were
 from those who believed that they suffered injustice as a result of abuse of power,
 unfairness, and high handedness.
 In October 1996, the Commission concluded its lengthy corruption probe'of high
 government officials. The Commission's report, which detailed adverse findings
 against three public officials and exonerated a fourth, evoked an aggressive govern-
 ment rebuttal and a questioning of the scope of the CHRAJ's mandate that finally
 led the CHRAJ to request in 1996 a Supreme Court interpretation of its rights and
 responsibilities.
 In 1997 the Government issued a white paper rejecting some of the adverse find-
 ings against the three government officials in the CHRAJ report and recommended
 that the Attorney General investigate the CHRAJ's rights and responsibilities. The
 CHRAJ issued a rebuttal to the white paper. In August the Supreme Court decided
 in favor of the Commission concerning its right to investigate matters preceding the
 1992 Constitution; however, the Court ruled that the Commission did not have ju-
 risdiction to investigate property confiscated by the special courts or tribunals dur-
 ing the rule of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), the military force
 that staged President Rawlings' first coup, and during the PNDC. periods.
 The CHRAJ continues to investigate corruption allegations filed against public of-
 ficials. In 1997 the CHRAJ issued a report on its -investigations at the "witches"
 camps in the Northern region. The report detailed the living conditions of the
 women in the camps and proposed their reintegration into society, involving an edu-
 cational campaign in conjunction with the Center for National Culture and the
 House of Chiefs. The Commission also has provided periodic updates to various sec-
 tions of its report on prison conditions.
 The Commission operates with no interference from the Government. Its biggest
 obstacle is a lack of adequate funding. Low salaries and poor working conditions re-
 sult in the loss of many CHRAJ-trained personnel to other government agencies
 that are able to pay their employees more. In November the Commission submitted
 a petition on this matter to the Government and is awaiting a response.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status. The courts are empowered specifically to order en-
 forcement of these prohibitions, although enforcement by the authorities is generally
 inadequate, in part due to limited financial resources.
 Women.-Violence against women, including rape and domestic violence, remains
 a significant problem. These abuses usually go unreported and seldom come before
 the courts. The police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes. However, in June
 Parliament passed and the President signed legislation to double the mandatory
 sentence for rape (from 3 to 10 years to 5 to 25 years), marking a victory for lobby-
 ing efforts by women's groups. The media increasingly report cases of assault and
 rape. FIDA wrote a handbook and presented a works hop on domestic violence and
 provides free legal aid for poor women. However, FIDA believes that women's shel-
 ters must be built in order for legal intervention to be effective. In November the
 poice administration estabished a "wvomen and juvenle uniW' to handle cases in-
 volving domestic violence, child abuse and juvenile offenses. By year's end, the unit
 had received 78 cases. Located in Accra, the unit will work closely with the Depart-
 ment of Social Welfare, FIDA and the Legal Aid Board.
 In June Parliament passed amendments to the 1960 Criminal Code to provide ad-
 ditional protection for women and children. The legislation added new definitions
 of sexual offenses and strengthened punishments for others. The provisions of the
 bill ban the practice of "customary servitude'" (known as Trokosi), protect women ac-
 cused of witchcraft, double the mandatory sentence for rape, raise the age of crimi-
 nal responsibility from 7 years to 12, criminalize indecent assault and forced mar-
 riages, and raise punishments for defilement, incest, and prostitution involving chil-
 dren. The President signed the bill into law in September.
 Women continue to experience societal discrimination. Women in urban centers
 and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but resistance to
 women entering nontraditional fields persists. Few women enter college. Women, es-
 pecially in rural areas, remain subject to burdensome labor conditions and tradi-
 tional male dominance. Traditional practices and social norms often deny women in-
 heritances and property, a legally registered marriage (and with it, certain legal
 rights), and the maintenance and custody of children, all provided for by statute.
 Rural women can be punished with banishment. by traditional village authorities
 for teenage pregnancy or suspected witchcraft. The press reported that hundreds of
 women accused of witchcraft were sent to penal villages in the Northern Region by
 traditional authorities such as a shaman. In 1997, 2 villages contained 400 elderly
 women, and 1 village contained 2,000 women and family members, all sentenced by
 a village authority who claimed to have the power to divine witches. Although the
 women face no formal legal sanction if they leave, most fear that they would be
 beaten to death if caught outside the penal villages. Forced labor also occurs at the
 camps for women accused of witchcraft. Legislation effective during the year pro-
 vides some additional protection to women banned from their communities for al-
 leged witchcraft. The CHRAJ and human rights NGO's are mounting a campaign
 to end this traditional practice, which violates the victims' constitutional rights. The
 challenge lies not only in persuading custodians of the witches' homes to abolish the
 practice, but also in educating the community so the women will be allowed to re-
 turn safely to their homes. In September a national newspaper reported FIDA had
 persuaded custodians to abolish the Gambaga witches home in the Northern region,
 contingent on the performance of "exorcism" rites and payment of accommodation
 and discharge fees. However, a few months later, the newspaper reported an in-
 crease in the number of alleged witches banished to the home, largely due to the
 communities' belief that these women were responsible for an outbreak of cerebro-
 spinal meningitis which claimed many lives in the region. At the end of the year,
 communities in East and West Mamprusi districts of the Northern region also com-
 mitted to set alleged witches free from their camps following a workshop organized
 by women's NGO's.
 Women's rights groups are active in educational campaigns and in programs to
 provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to women. The Government
 also is active in educational programs, and the President and First Lady are among
 the most outspoken advocates of women's rights.
 Children.-Within the limits of its resources, the Government is committed to pro-
 tecting the rights and welfare of children. There is little or no discrimination
 against female children in education, but girls and women frequently drop out of
 school due to societal or economic pressures. The Government actively campaigns
 for girls' education. Although the percentages of girls enrolled in school increased
 from 1996, participation is still low. Statistics for 1995 (the most recent available)
 
 
 show that from grades 1 to 6, 46 percent of pupils are girls; from grades 7 to 9,
 this drops to 43 percent. In grades 10 to 12, girls drop to 36 percent of students;
 and at the university level to 23 percent Enrollment of girls at the university level
 has increased by 5 percent over the past 5 years.
 A 1997 country report by the Ghana National Commission on Children further
 substantiated the gap between enrollment of boys and girls, particularly at the high
 school level. In the eight districts examined, there were 22,418 boys and 14,318 girls
 enrolled at the high school level. In the report, officials attribute the lower female
 enrollment to the fact that many girls marry early or become pregnant.
 There are several tradition  discriminatory practices that are injurious to the
 health and development of young females. In particular, female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to
 both physical and psychological health, is a serious problem. According to one study,
 as many as 30 percent of women may have undergone this procedure. Most observ-
 ers believe 15percent to be more likely. FGM is practiced mostly in Muslim commu-
 nities in the far northeastern and northwestern parts of the country. As of 1994,
 FGM became a criminal act. Officials at all levels have spoken out against the prac-
 tice, and local NGO's are making some inroads through their educational campaigns
 to encourage abandonment of FGM and to retrain practitioners. Five persons report-
 edly were arrested during the year for practicing FGM. One woman was arrested
 for performing FGM on two teenage girls in the Upper East region. Another practi-
 tioner was jailed for performing FGM on three teenage girls. Two individuals were
 arrested in September for FGM involving five girls in the Upper East region. In an-
 other case a 60-year-old woman was arrested or eforming FGM on 8 girls. In al-
 most all of the cases, the victims actively sought out the practitioners, sometimes
 without their parents' knowledge, in a quest to become ready for marriage.
 Members of the legal community advocate legislation to close loopholes in the
 FGM law, including extending culpability to family members and others who aid in
 carrying out FGM and to Ghanaians who commit the crime outside the country's
 borders. Any person who conceals information about an instance of FGM would be
 liable. In addition, FGM would be banned no matter how medically safe the proce-
 dure is made--dispelling a belief by some that FGM is acceptable as long as the
 girls' health is protected.
 Although the Constitution prohibits slavery, it exists on a limited scale. Trokosi,
 a traditional practice found among the Ewe ethnic group and primarily in the Volta
 reion, is an especially severe abuse and a flagrant violation of children's and wom-
 en's rights. It is a system in which a young girl, usually under the age of 10, is
 made a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly committed by a member of the
 girl's family. The belief is that, if someone in that family has committed a crime,
 such as stealing, members of the family may begin to die in large numbers unless
 a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense. The girl be-
 comes the property of the fetish priest, must work on the priest's farm, and perform
 other labors for him. Because they are the sexual property of the priests, most
 trokosi slaves have children by them. Although the girls' families must provide for
 their needs, such as food; most are unable to do so. There are at least 3,800 girls
 and women bound to various shrines in the trokosi system, a figure that does not
 include the slaves' children. Even if released, generally without skills or hope of
 marriage, a trokosi woman has continued obligations to the shrine for the duration
 of her life. When the fetish slave dies, the family is expected to replace her with
 another young girl for the fetish shrine.
 In June Parliament passed and the President signed legislation to ban the prac-
 tice of trokosi in comprehensive legislation to protect women and children's rights.
 Human rights activists believe that the goal of eradicating the trokosi practice is
 achievable with the new law. NGO's, such as International Needs, and government
 agencies, like the CHRAJ, have been campaigning against trokosi for several years
 and are familiar with the locations of the fetish shrines and the numbers of women
 and children enslaved. Activists know the community leaders and fetish priests and,
 thus, know with whom to negotiate. The CHRAJ and International Needs have had
 some success in approaching village authorities and fetish priests at 15 of the 76
 shrines, winning the release of 900 trokosi slaves to date and retraining them for
 new professions. The organizations continue to work for additional releases. Includ-
 ing the achievements of other organizations, approximately 1,200 slaves had been
 released by year's end.
 Another traditional practice that violates the rights of children is forced childhood
 marriage, which would be made illegal under the children's bill, passed by Par-
 liament late in the year; however, the bill had not yet been signed into law by the
 President at year's end.
 Child prostitution, although illegal, also exists.
 
 
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution specifically provides for the rights of
 the disabled, including protection against exploitation and discrimination. In prac-
 tice the disabled are not discriminated against in any systematic or overt manner.
 The Constitution also states that "as far as practicable, every place to which the
 public has access shall have appropriate facilities for disabled persons." In practice,
 however, this provision has yet to be implemented.
 Religious Minorities.-On January 16, four persons were killed in a continuation
 of factional violence between two of Ghana's Muslim sects. Tijaniya and Al-Sunnah
 Muslims each were attempting to bury deceased members of their respective groups
 at a cemetery in Wenchi, 30 miles northeast of the Brong Ahafo regional capital of
 Sunyani. A dispute over burial rights resulted in a violent confrontation between
 the two sects. Four persons from the A1-Sunnahs were killed and 26 were injured
 when the Tijaniyas attacked with rifles and machetes. A joint army-police contin-
 gent dispatched the following day restored order and arrested 57 persons.
 In late August, clashes between the Ai-Sunnah and Tijaniya Muslim sects erupted
 in Kumasi when a member of the A1-Sunnah sect died after a protracted illness. The
 father of the deceased, who belonged to the Tijaniya sect, decided to perform the
 burial but relented after persistent requests from the A1-Sunnah sect. A group of
 Tijaniya sect members attacked the A1-Sunnah group as it was returning from the
 cemetery and five persons were injured in the clash. The Tijaniyas reportedly
 planned to burn a kiosk belonging to the Al-Surnah sect but police intervened. The
 police arrested more than 100 persons involved in the clashes.
 On May 31, a mob of about 40 persons attacked a charismatic Christian church
 in Accra during a service attended by about 800 persons, injuring dozens of church-
 goers and causing massive property damage. Police dispersed the attackers without
 any shots fired. The incident increased tensions between leaders of the Christian
 community and traditional authorities. The attack apparently was triggered by a
 combination of factors: The possibility that the church might defy the traditional au-
 thorities' 6-week ban on drumming, which precedes the Ga ethnic thanksgiving fes-
 tival; a land use dispute involving the church parking lot; tensions between support-
 ers of rival district assembly candidates; and ongoing intimidation by nearby resi-
 dents to force the church to relocate. No suspects were charged in firebombings of
 the church in December 1996 and in March. Four days before the May attack, the
 Accra Metropolitan Assembly had bulldozed the wall around the church parking lot,
 alleging violations of the lease. The Minister of Interior's subsequent call for Chris-
 tians to respect traditional practices by observing the ban on drumming provoked
 an outcry from some Christians who objected to perceived restrictions on freedom
 of worship.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government plays down the
 importance of ethnic differences, its opponents occasionally complain that it is domi-
 nated by the Ewe ethnic group from the eastern part of the country. The President
 and many of his close advisers are Ewe, but many ministers are of other ethnic ori-
 gins. In the 1997 International Foundation for Electoral Systems report on public
 opinion, 25 percent of the respondents said that they felt discrimination because of
 their tribal origins.
 There have been numerous violent confrontations between and within ethnic
 groups related to chieftaincy issues, particularly those of succession and land. Eight
 persons died in a chieftancy dispute in Kue, a farming village on the Togolese bor-
 der in the Volta region on New Year's night. Twelve others were injured and 4
 houses were burned during the melee.
 In 1994-95, an estimated several thousand citizens died in the north in a conflict
 driven by chieftancy and land issues dating from precolonial times. In late Novem-
 ber, a potential flare-up was averted following the murder of a member of one ethnic
 group by a member of another ethnic group.
 In 1995 the Government created a permanent negotiating team made up of reli-
 gious leaders, NGO representatives, Council of State members, and other interested
 parties to help resolve the continuing tensions between the Konkomba and other
 ethnic groups in the north. The Permanent Peace Negotiating Team (PPNT) is a fa-
 cilitative body whose primary purpose is to mediate disputes. In 1996 a series of
 highly publicized "peacemaking" ceremonies were held at which tribal leaders
 pledged to solve their differences through negotiations. In 1997 in response to re-
 ports of latent insecurity, the PPNT extended its activities to some northern parts
 of the Volta region in October and in December supervised a peace accord among
 all parties to the conflict there. In 1997 the PPNT organized seminars and work-
 shops designed to promote dialog between two feuding factions. The Government
 has a ban on firearms in the Northern region and northern part of the Volta region.
 Beyond pleas for peace by government officials, Members of Parliament, and other
 prominent opinion leaders, there has been little effective intervention.
 
 
 186
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, the Government has not interfered with the right of workers to associate
 in labor unions and has not refused to register any unions. About 9 percent of work-
 ers belong to unions, a figure that was expected to increase following the announce-
 ment in 1997 of a new federation called the Ghana Federation of Labor (GFL),
 which serves as an umbrella organization for several other labor unions which were
 either previously part of or not encompassed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC)
 the existing federation. However, the GFL has no formal structure or membership
 as yet. The Industrial Relations Act (IRA), initially enacted in 1958, and amended
 in 1965 and 1972, governs trade unions and their activities. Led by experienced
 union leaders, the TUC has been a vocal and constructive critic of the Governmenfs
 economic policies when it felt it necessary. Civil servants have their own union, the
 Civil Servants Association, which operates outside of the TUC umbrella.
 The law recognizes a right to strike, but there have been no legal strikes since
 independence. Under the IRA, the Government established a system of settling dis-
 putes, first through conciliation, then through arbitration. A union may call a legal
 strike if negotiations and mediation fail. However, no union has ever gone through
 the complete process. There were 46 strike actions during the year, none of which
 met the reqnirements for a legal strike detailed in the IRA. The IRA prohibits ret-
 ribution against strikers, and this law is enforced.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies. The TUC is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity headquartered in Accra and is
 also a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiunion discrimination.
 Trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits for both private
 and state-owned enterprises without government interference. In September the
 TUC announced that it would unionize all day laborers in the country to protect
 them from exploitation. However, the Government, labor, and employers negotiate
 together through a tripartite commission to set minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions. The law requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation to reinstate workers fired for union activities. No union leaders have been
 detained in recent years for union or other activities.
 There is legislation that authorizes export processing zones (EPZ's), and a few
 EPZ's are in operation. Existing labor law applies in any EPZ, including the right
 to Organize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery,
 and the law also prohibits forced or bonded labor, including that performed by chil-
 dren; however, at least 3,600 women and girls are bound to shrines through the lo-
 calized trokosi system (see Section 5). Forced labor also occurs at the camps in the
 north for women accused of witchcraft (see Section 5). Apart from the trokosi sys-
 tem, it is difficult to determine the extent to which forced or bonded labor by chil-
 dren is practiced. There have been newspaper reports of children being sold into
 slavery for either labor or sexual exploitation. The International Labor Organization
 (ILO) continues to urge the Government to revise various legal provisions that per-
 mit imprisonment with an obligation to perform labor for offenses that are not coun-
 tenanced under ILO Convention 105.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Labor leg-
 islation sets a minimum employment age of 15 years and prohibits night work and
 certain types of hazardous labor for those under 18 years of age. In practice child
 employment is widespread, and young children of school age often perform menial
 tasks during the day in the market or collect fares on local buses. An ILO survey
 conducted in three rural districts between 1992 and 1993 concluded that 11 percent
 of school age children were employed for wages and another 15 percent work with-
 out remuneration. According to a 1995 living standards survey, 7.8 percent of 7 to
 14 year olds and 31.5 percent of 15 to 19 years olds are economically active. Observ-
 ance of minimum age laws is eroded by local custom and economic circumstances
 that encourage children to work to help support their families.
 Late in the year, Parliament passed legislation to provide additional child labor
 protection and strengthen the punishment for violators under a comprehensive chil-
 dren's bill. The bill incorporates the existing labor legislation's minimum age for em-
 ployment and prohibitions on night work and hazardous labor. In addition, the leg-
 islation allows for children age 15 years and above to have an apprenticeship where-
 by the craftsmen/employers have the obligation to provide a safe and healthy work
 environment along with training and tools. Fines and imprisonment for violators are
 increased considerably.
 
 
 The law prohibits forced or bonded labor, including that performed by children;
 however, at least 3,800 women and girls are bound to shrines through the trokosi
 system (see Section 6.c.).
 Officials only occasionally punish violators of regulations that prohibit heavy labor
 and night work for children. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel-
 fare are responsible for enforcement of child labor regulations. They visit each work-
 place annually and make spot checks whenever they receive allegations of viola-
 tions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were set by a tripartite commission composed of representatives
 of the Government, labor, and employers. The daily minimum wage, revised in 1996,
 combines wages with customary benefits, such as a transportation allowance. The
 daily minimum wage of less than $1.00 (2,000 cedis) is insufficient for a single wage
 earner to support a family. Furthermore, there is widespread violation of the mini-
 mum wage law. In most cases, households have multiple wage earners, and family
 members engage in some family farming or other family-based commercial activi-
 ties.
 The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours, with one break of at least 36
 consecutive hours every 7 days. Through collective bargaining, however, the basic
 workweek for most unionized workers is 40 hours.
 In 1996 Spintex workers filed petitions with the CHRAJ, the Ministry of Employ-
 ment and Social Welfare, and the Department of Labor concerning working hours.
 They have withdrawn the case from administrative review and, instead, taken the
 case to court. Hearings were in process at the end of 1997 but no decision has been
 made. There were no known developments in this case during the year.
 Occupational safety and health regulations exist, and the Labor Department of
 the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare occasionally imposes sanctions on viola-
 tors. However, safety inspectors are few and poorly trained. They take action if mat-
 ters are called to their attention, but lack the resources to seek out violations. Work-
 ers have the right to withdraw themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment, although they rarely exercise this right.
