 MADAGASCAR
 Madagasca's 2-year transition from the 16-year authoritarian Socialist rule of
 Didier Ratsiraka officially ended in 1993 with the fair election of Albert Zafy as
 President in February and the selection by the new National Assembly in August
 of Francisque Ravony as Prime Minister. Under the 1992 Constitution, power is di-
 vided between the President, the Prime Minister and his Government, and the Na-
 tional Assembly. The year was dominated by the failure of the new leadership to
 agree on the pace and scope of a coherent economic reform (structural adjustment)
 program in order to come to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
 (IMF) and the World Bank. The Ravony Government's decision to devalue the Mala-
 gasy franc in May was an important step in the direction of an agreement. Absent
 appropriate accompanying measures, however, and with the printing of new money,
 the resulting inflation increased resistance to further structural adjustment meas-
 ures. An impasse between opponents and advocates of the structural adjustment
 program led in July to a vote on a motion of censure against the Government in
 the National Assembly. The motion failed, but provoked, nonetheless, a cabinet
 reshuffle in August, and at year's end the leadership had still not agreed upon a
 firm course of action.
 The Government further increased civilian control over the military. Under the
 new leadership, mixed commands of military, gendarmerie, and the National Police
 are responsible for internal security. The Government did not reduce the overall size
 of the security forces but did change some of the key personnel in the 1,800-man
 Presidential Security Guard, which had been loyal to Ratsiraka and responsible for
 violence aimed at upsetting the electoral process in 1992. The intelligence wing, the
 Directorate General of Internal and External Investigations and Documentation
 (DGIDIE), reports to the President. There were occasional reports of police brutality
 of detainees in 1994, and village-level law enforcement arrangements known as
 "dinea were also responsible for some abuses.

 Living standards remained extremely low. The decision to float the exchange rate,
 effectively devaluingthe Malagasy franc by 50 percent in May, and the excessive
 printing of money sharply reduced consumer buying power. The economy remains
 highly dependent on agriculture, and cash crops such as vanilla and coffee did rel-
 atively well. However, the major crop, rice, suffered a larger than usual shortfall
 because of extensive cyclone damage early in the year. Tourism, manufacturing,
 mining, and fishing hal respectable performances, but these activities, so far, play
 a less important role in the economy. The smuggling of national resources, such as
 vanilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle, continued to be a major concern. Unem-
 ployment and underemployment also remained serious problems, especially among
 the young (about 60 percent of the population is under age 25).
 The human rights situation generally improved in 1994 with the absence of vio-
 lence between "federalist" (pro-Ratsiraka) and "active forces" (pro-Zafy) militants
 that punctuated the previous several years. Citizens widely exercised freedoms of
 speech and assembly. The democratically elected National Assembly consolidated its
 new constitutional role and was a forum for public and wide-ranging debate. Over
 objections of the Government, the National Assembly voted in October to make the
 Ofice of the Mediator the official constitutional promoter and protector of human
 rights. Advances in press professionalism and in civic education also contributed to
 a wider awareness and public discussion of human rights issues.
 However, there continued to be human rights abuses, notably in the law enforce-
 ment and judicial systems. Traditional local law enforcement groups were respon-
 sible for at least two incidents of summary executions. In the overburdened formal
 court system, the accused continued to remain in prison for lengthy pretrial periods,
 often exceeding the maximum penalty for the alleged offense. Prison conditions are
 deplorable, and in some prisons women may experience physical abuse, including
 rape.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political or
 extrajudicial killings by government forces. However, to combat rising crime, tradi-
 tional law enforcement groups at the village level, known as dina, continued to mete
 out summary justice, including at least two summary executions (see Section i.e.).
 For example, in October in the village of Ambalakely (province of Fianarantsoa), a
 dina posse forcibly seized, and reportedly executed a known thief who was in police
 custody for his latest alleged offense. In response, the Government arrested six
 members of the posse on manslaughter charges. At the end of the year, the posse
 members were being held pending trial.
 There was speculation that the beating death of radio journalist Victor
 Randrianirina in August was linked to Randrianirina's reporting on sapphire smug-
 gling in Madagascar. The authorities continued to investigate but had not made any
 arrests by year's end.
 While ostensibly still pending, there has been no progress in the Government's in-
 vestigation into serious 1991, 1992, and 1993 incidents in which Government secu-
 rity forces killed or injured unarmed civilians. At year's end, the Government had
 not released any official report or made arrests in a case involving the deaths of
 more than 30 demonstrators who were killed by then p resident Ratsiraka's guards
 at the lavoloha palace on August 10, 1991. However, the Government namecra for-
 mal commission in September to investigate this incident, and public hearings were
 planned for early 1995. There was no progress on an investigation into the March
 31, 1992, shooting incident in which so diers klled six pro-Ratsiraka supporters at
 the National Forum (constitutional convention). The Government had also not
 brought to trial 14 soldiers arrested in April 1993 for alleged involvement in politi-
 cally motivated violence in Antiranana; however, the Prime Minister publicly an-
 nounced a trial was expected to start by April 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no permanent disappearances in 1994 and no ac-
 knowledged cases of unsolved abductions or disappearances. The government com-
 mission named in September to investigate the 1991 incident at Iavoloha palace
 was, by year's end, seeking testimony related to disappearances in connection with
 the incident.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person; however, there were
 occasional reports of police or other forces mistreating prisoners or detainees. There
 were also isolated instances of dina trials using torture or other forced means to so-
 licit confessions from criminal suspects. Suspected thieves are sometimes subject to
 summary mob retribution that occasionally results in severe injury or death.
 
 
 144
 Government officials acknowledge that conditions in Malagasy prisons are harsh
 and potentially life-threatening. The diet provided is inadequate, and family mem-
 bers must augment inmates' dail food rations. Prisoners without relatives nearby
 sometimes go for days without food. Each prisoner has on average less than 1
 square meter of space. The prison population estimated at 25,000, suffer a wide
 range of medical problems that are not routinely treated, including malnutrition, in-
 fections, malaria, and tuberculosis. These conditions have caused an unknown num-
 ber of deaths.
 Women in prison suffer abuses, as do the children who are sometimes confined
 with them. Gender segregation is not absolute, and there were some reported cases
 of rape. The Government permits prison visits by the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC), the Malagasy Red Cross, and religious and charitable organi-
 zations. The media also have access to prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi&e.-The Constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons, but in practice these rights are not always respected. Existing
 legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention are frequently not observed.
 According to the law, in a criminal case the detainee must be charged, bound
 over, or released within 3 days after arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but
 is not always required. According to the Penal Code, which provides for the right
 of a person to be informed of the charges against him, defendants in ordinary crimi-
 nal cases are to be charged formally within the specified time frame and, upon being
 charged, to be allowed to obtain an attorney. Court-appointed counsel is provided
 for indigents accused of crimes which carry a 5-year jail sentence.
 Bail may be requested by the accused or by his attorney immediately after arrest,
 after being formally charged, or during the appeal process, but it is rarely granted
 at any stage for violent crimes.
 Despite existing legal protections, the average pretrial detention time exceeds 1
 year, and 3 or 4 years of detention is common, even for crimes for which-the maxi-
 mum penalty may be 2 years or less. Prisoners may wait years in prison only to
 be found not guilty, with no recourse. Nearly 65 percent of Madagascar's prisoners
 (i.e., 16,000) are in pretrial detention. By law, persons suspected of activity against
 the State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite exten-
 sion if considered necessary by the Government; however, this provision is not used
 regularly.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution ado pted in 1992 provides for an
 independent judiciary, and the National Assembly was debating implementing legis-
 lation at year's end. Meanwhile, the judiciary remains under the aegis of the Min-
 istry of Justice; lack of internal controls and relatively low salariesfor magistrates
 encourage corruption. Excessive pretrial detention of the accused results in the de-
 nial of due process. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to an attorney,
 to be present at the trial, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence under the Penal Code.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for civil and criminal cases
 cartying limited fines and sentences; a Court of Appeals, which includes a criminal
 court far cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and a Supreme Court. The
 judiciary also has special courts desigedto handle specific kinds of cases (e.g., cat-
 tle rustling) under the jurisdiction of the higher courts. A ConstitutionalHigh
 Court, with a separate and autonomous status, is a body for review of laws, decrees,
 and ordinances, and for certifying election results.
 Traditional institutions, known as dina, handle civil matters within and between
 villages; in practice, the dina are increasingly being used in some criminal cases be-
 cause of the practical inadequacies of the formal police and judicial systems. Dina
 punishments can be severe, in some cases including capital punishment. In Novem-
 ber the National Assembly, formally recognizing the role of the dina in reducing
 crime and insecurity in the countryside, aeptediegislation giving dina verdicts the
 same weight as judgments handed down by lower courts and increasing fines and
 prison sentences to those refusing to abide by dina decisions. Decisions by dina are
 not subject to codified due process protections, but, according to the new legislation,
 they can be challenged at the appeals court level. Some cases have also been
 brought to the attention of the Office of the Mediator (Ombudsman) which inves-
 tigates and seeks redress from formal judicial authorities.
 Military courts have some jurisdiction over cases involving national security, such
 as acts constituting a threat to the nation and its political leaders, invasion by for-
 eign forces, and riots that could lead to overthrow of the Government. Military
 courts, like civilian courts, provide for an appeal, or cessation, process to reexamine
 interpretations of law rather than the facts of the case. They are presided over by
 a civilian magistrate who is joined on the bench by military officers.
 
 
 145
 Approximately 25 political prisoners convicted for their roles in federalist versus
 active forces troubles in Antsiranana in late 1992 and early 1993 are still serving
 out their sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene in the pri-
 vate aspects of the lives of the people. The law requires judicially issued warrants
 to search houses, but there were reportedly some instances in which private citizens
 used police acquaintances to intimidate others without proper warrants. Telephones
 and correspondence are not monitored.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, communication, and press and forbids press censorship; these provisions were
 largely respected. People generally speak freely, and debate in the National Assem-
 bly was open and lively. The print media openly criticized both the Government and
 the opposition. Opposition groups, trade unions, professional associations, and oth-
 ers have regular access to the press.
 There is still a legacy of self-censorship among certain journalists who fear repris-
 als from the Government or others for aggressive investigative reporting. Some jour-
 nalists seek to avoid identification in their bylines, and the names of private citizens
 are rarely cited. Journalists employ these tactics in part because Malagasy culture
 aspires to be nonconfrontationa, and in part because journalists cannot regularly
 count on effective backing by their editors and publishers. The situation improved
 somewhat, but many journalists lack professional training and experience, and re-
 source constraints limit the effectiveness of the press. There is also a persistent re-
 luctance by government officials and others to share information with the press.
 In May a court ordered the expulsion of a longtime resident, a French citizen,
 after she allegedly made slanderous public statements against the Malagasy people
 in an editorial letter published in a local newspaper. She appealed her expulsion to
 the official Ombudsman, was eventually expelled, despite having published a retrac-
 tion as ordered by the courts, but was quiet y allowed to return.
 State-owned radio-television (RTM), the most important means of reaching the
 public, continued to feature discussion programs and debates on topics of public pol-
 icy, although it rarely included editorial comment. Malagasy television broadcasts
 French network news via satellite each evening. Along with state radio, there are
 at least five private radio stations in the capital city, and private radio stations in
 Fianarantsoa and Tamatave. The private stations cover political subjects and are
 sometimes critical of the Government.
 Although a law dating from the previous republic requires Ministry of Interior ap-
 proval for films and videotapes shown in public, in practice this regulation is rarely
 enforced.
 There have been no reports of threats to academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacefld Assembly and Association.--Some legal restrictions remain
 on the right of assembly and association. Munici al    rmits, usually granted, are
 required before holding public meetings but may       enie  if government officials
 believe that the meeting poses a threat to the State, endangers national security,
 or significantly encumbers public thoroughfares. Officially established security zones
 are off-limits to demonstrators. The proliferation of political and nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) continues and is indicative of recent relaxations on free asso-
 ciation rights. There are more than 60 political parties and some 900 NGO's.
 c. Freedom of Religin _The Government does not infringe the constitutional
 right of freedom of religion. Missionaries and clergy are permitted to operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Mooement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is no formal restriction on travel within the country, however, do-
 mestic security concerns do effectively restrict travel in some places, especially at
 night. All Malagasy must obtain official approval for trips outside the country. All
 residents of Madagascar (Malagasy and foreign) require exit visas issued by the
 Ministry of Interior. There are approximately 70 Ethiopian refugees in Madagascar.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1993 Madagascar concluded more than 2 years of political transition which
 were initiated by largely peaceful mass demonstrations against the previous regime
 of Didier Ratsiraka in 1991. Generally free and fair elections, by direct universal
 suffrage and secret ballot, elected Albert Zafy President in early 1993 to a 5-year
 term, renewable once. The new President's primary constitutional responsibilities
 are national defense and foreign policy. A general election was held in June 1993
 for a 138-member National Assenibly whose term is for 4 years. For the first time
 
 
 146
 in Malagasy history, the National Assembly in July 1994 produced and voted on a
 motion of censure against a sitting government. In reaction, the 65 pro-Zafy active
 forces parliamentarians joined with defectors from the former majority alliance,
 known as the Group-of-6, to block the censure motion against the Government of
 Prime Minister Ravony.
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet, not the President, execute legislation. A
 Prime Minister is elected by each new National Assembly every 4 years, or upon
 vacancy. The President and the Government, provided they act in concert, may dis-
 solve the National Assembly. If the National Assembly passes a motion of censure,
 the Prime Minister and his Government are required to step down. The Constitu-
 tional High Court reviews the constitutionality of every law before it is promul-
 gated. The selection of the Senate must await the formation of local governments
 in 1995 since two-thirds of the Senate will be elected by local legislatures, and one-
 third appointed by the President, all for 4-year terms.
 There are no legal restrictions ag t women participating in politics, but in
 practice men dominate the political process. One cabinet position is held by a
 woman, and women hold only 6 percent of the legislative seats; in the judiciary they
 have significantly higher representation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 By law, human rights groups are considered to be political groups and must reg-
 ister with the Government. Some nongovernmental human rights groups exist and
 are increasingly active, for example in such issues as defending press freedoms.
 They have been joined by civic education organizations that have much the same
 agenda.
 The new Constitution provides for the establishment of an independent organiza-
 tion charged with promoting and protecting human rights. In October the National
 Assembly designated the Office of the Mediator-a kind of public ombudsman cre-
 ated by the transitional government before the institution of the Constitution-to
 assume that constitutional role. This action reversed an earlier decision by the
 Ravony government to abolish the Mediator on the grounds that it was redundant
 given the President's constitutional role as public arbiter vis-a-vis government ad-
 ministration. The power of the Office of the Mediator rests in moral suasion. The
 Office may publish its investigative findings but has yet to try to enlist public opin-
 ion in support of a particular cause.
 The Government did not penalize or repress anyone for criticizing its human
 rights record. While slow to carry out investigations of major cases of violence, nota-
 bly the August 1991 killings at Iavoloha palace, the Government was, at year's end,
 actively addressing this particular case (see Section L.a.).
 The Government is receptive to visits by international human rights  roups, just
 as it was to the presence of international election observation groups during the four
 nationwide elections in 1992 and 1993. The ICRC made periodic visits again in 1994
 and was regularly granted access to prisoners. United Nations organizations, includ-
 ing the International Labor Organization (ILO), operated freely and extensively in
 Madagascar.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and groups that advocate
 ethnic or religious segregation.
 Women.-There is societal discrimination against women, although less so in
 urban areas where women have an important, f secondary, role in the business and
 economic life of the country, with many of them managing or owning businesses or
 filling manament positions in state industries. However, women in rural areas
 face greater hardship, bearing the responsibilities of raising a family while also en-
 gaging in farm labor or other subsistence activities.
 Under the 1990 conjugal law, wives have an equal say in choosing where a mar-
 ried couple will reside, and they receive generally equitable distribution of marital
 property in instances of divorce. Widows inherit one-half of joint marital wealth. In
 practice, some parts of the island still observe a tradition known as "the customary
 third" whereby the wife has a right to only a third of a couple's joint holdings. How-
 ever, a widow receives a pension, and a widower does not.
 According to various sources, including magistrates, journalists, and women doc-
 tors, violence against women is not widespread. In the rare cases where physical
 abuse is detected, police and legal authorities do intervene, although there is no law
 dealing specifically with violence against women, except in cases of rape. Spouses
 
 
 147
 can be tried for nonrape abuses, but generally under civil law. Some women pris-
 oners have been victims of rape.
 Children.-There is no pattern of official or societal abuse against children. While
 official expenditures on children's welfare are relatively low, the Government has
 decided to maintain spending levels for the Ministries of Health and Education de-
 spite an overall climate of increasing budget austerity. These levels are insufficient,
 however, to halt the decline of public services in the high-inflation environment.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Madagascar is inhabited by over 12 million
 people. The Malagasy are of mixed Malayo-Indonesian and African origins and are
 made up of 18 distinct groups based on regional and ancestral affiliation. Although
 there are some linguistic differences among them, nearly all speak Malagasy, which
 is of Malayo-Polynesian origin. No one of these groups constitutes a majority of the
 population. Long-term historical processes of military conquest, ethnic domination,
 and political consolidation, however, have traditionay favored the political and eco-
 nomic status of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin over the coastal groups of
 more African descent. The centralized planned economy of the previous regime rein-
 forced the concentration of economic and political power in the highland, capital
 area. This situation has contributed to ethnic tensions between the two groups. Eth-
 nic or regional solidarity may also be a determining factor in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Paldstani community of about 20,000, primarily engaged in commerce,
 has been in Madagascar since the early part of this century. Few, however, have
 been able to obtain Malagasy citizenship, since it is customarily bestowed matrilin-
 eally through native Malagasy women. The Indo-Paskistanis are frequent targets of
 mistrust and criticism, and their shops have often been targets for violent attack
 during civil disturbances. In one such incident in the town of Antsirabe in January,
 mobs destroyed 10 Indo-Pakistani stores and a dozen residences. Three Malagasy
 died and several were wounded in the melee as police tried to restore order.
 People With Disabilities.-Physically disabled people are not subject to discrimina-
 tion in education and in the provision of other state services, but nor are they the
 beneficiaries of special enabling or protecting legislation. The Government has not
 enacted legislation or otherwise provided for accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Malagasy in both the public and private sectors
 have the right in law (the 1975 Labor Code and the 1992 Constitution) and in prac-
 tice to establish and join labor unions of their own choosing without prior authoriza-
 tion. However essential service workers, including police and military, may not
 form unions. Unions are required to register with the Government, and registration
 is routinely granted. About 80 percent of the labor force of 5 million is agrarian.
 Unionized labor accounts for only about 5 percent of wage labor.
 There are a number of trade union federations, and many are affiliated with polit-
 ical parties. In practice, however, formal public and private sector unions have not
 played a major role politically or economically in recent years. The Government ex-
 ercised very limited control over organized labor.
 The 1975 Labor Code and the new Constitution provide for the right to strike,
 even in export processing ("free trade) zones. Those providing essential services--
 police, fire fighters, hospital workers--have only a limited right to strike. In Novem-
 ber the National Assembly voted to adopt a controversial new Labor Code which
 could have the practical effect of discouraging strikes and limiting collective bar-
 gaining. At year's end, the Constitutional High Court had not approved the new
 There were occasional strikes in 1994, but none was officially declared illegal in-
 cluding a taxi strike which barricaded roads in the capital city. Most were resolved
 by negotiations or by informal arbitration by high government officials, including
 te President. Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers who ad-
 here to legal procedures for striking. Unions and workers were not directly targeted
 for human rights abuses, nor was there any apparent retribution against strikers
 and leaders.
 Unions may and do freely affiliate with and participate in international bodies
 and may form federations or confederations. The Government of Madagascar is
 party to the ILO Conventions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the 1975 Labor Code
 and the 1992 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The Code
 states that collective bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor
 at either party's behest. Collective bargaining agreements exist but are not common,
 and the Government is often involved in the bargaining process in part because of
 the large number of public sector employees in organized abor. he minimum wage
 is set by the Government. Other wages are set by the employers with individual em-
 
 
 ployees, sometimes below the minimum wage. When there is a failure to reach
 agreement, the Ministry of Labor convenes a Committee of Employment Inspectors
 who attempt to resolve the matter. If this process fails the Committee refers the
 matter to the Chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration. No such cases
 reached the Court of Appeals in 1994.
 The 1975 Labor Code formally prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. In the case of antiunion activity, the union
 or its members may file a petition in civil court challenging the employer. Labor
 laws appluniformly throu#hout the country, including in free trade zones. How-
 ever, the Government has difficulty effectively enforcing labor laws and regulations
 due to lack of basic resources. Ministry of Labor inspectors, who number only 27,
 visit industrial work sites with some regularity, but mostly in the capital region.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is explicitly prohib-
 ited by the 1975 Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1975 Labor Code describes a
 child as any person under the age of 18. The legal minimum age for employment
 is 14, and the use of child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is apparent
 and imminent danger. The Government tries to enforce these child labor laws in the
 small wage sector through inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social Secu-
 rity. However, in the large subsistence sector, many young children work with their
 parents on family farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in the urban areas many
 children earn money hawking parking spaces, newspapers or other wares, and by
 carrying" water and begging.
 e.Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1975 Labor Code and its enforcing legisla-
 tion prescribe the working conditions and wage scales for employees, which are en-
 forced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. The law distinguishes between
 agricultural and nongrcultural work.
 There are several a  istratively determined minimum-wage rates in Madagas-
 car, depending upon employment skils,~ starting with $17 a month (63,000 Mala-
 gasy francs) or unskilled workers. This wage is inadequate to ensure a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family, and workers must supplement their in-
 omes through suabsistence agriculture, petty trade, or reiance on the extended fam-
 ily structure. Given insufficient enforcement measures, official wage rates are some-
 times ignored as high unemployment and extreme poverty lead workers to accept
 salaries below the legal wage.
 There is a 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service industries. There are
 also provisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity leave, and insurance.
 The 1975 Labor Code has rules concerning building and operational safety, ma-
 chinery and moving engines, lifting weight limits, and sanitation standards. Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Security inspectors visit industrial work sites, and viola-
 tions of Labor Code rules are subject to inspection reports. Lack of resources effec-
 tively inhibit inspectors traveling regularly beyond the capital region. If cited viola-
 tions are not remedied within the specified time frame, the violators may be legally
 charged and subject to penalties. Nevertheless, in some sectors protective measures
 are lacking due to the expense of even minimal protective clothing and other protec-
 tive devices. To date, there have been no published reports on occupational health
 hazards and accidents, although there is clear evidence that these hazards exist.
 There is no explicit right allowing workers to remove themselves from dangerous
 work without jeopardizing their continued employment. The ILO has cited the Gov-
 ernment within the past year for failure to observe ILO conventions and standards
 in workplace safety and weight limits.
