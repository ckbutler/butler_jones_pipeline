 MOROCCO*
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a pluralistic
 political system, a parliamentary form of government, and an
 independent judiciary. In practice, however, ultimate
 authority rests with King Hassan II, who under the
 Constitution appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and
 cabinet members and may dissolve the Parliament (which has
 very limited authority) and rule by decree. Past elections to
 Parliament and municipal councils have not been totally free
 of government manipulation. Though the Constitution provides
 for an independent judiciary, the judiciary is generally
 considered susceptible to political pressure. Constitutional
 guarantees of due process are frequently ignored.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, operating within a
 framework of written legal provisions designed to maintain
 public order. The Surete Nationale, auxiliary forces, and
 judicial police are under the supervision of the Minister of
 the Interior, while the Gendarmerie Royale, though
 paramilitary, reports directly to the Palace.
 Privale property and free enterprise drive the economy. The
 country has been actively engaged in a program of economic
 restructuring and reform since the early 1980's. Urban growth
 has been rapid; nearly half the population now lives in cities
 and towns. Urban unemployment stands at about 16 percent of
 the work force, and the creation of new jobs still lags behind
 population growth. New entrants to the labor force number
 more than 200,000 annually, and full-time employment is
 difficult to find outside the unskilled, manual trades. Lack
 of fulltime employment also remains a problem for skilled
 workers and university graduates.
 The most notable development affecting human rights in 1990
 was the King's creation in May of a Royal Consultative Council
 on Human Rights (CCDH)-headed by the President of the Supreme
 Court and including members of the Cabinet, representatives of
 labor unions, professional associations, political parties,
 human rights organizations, and academicians. The creation of
 the Council came in the wake of international and domestic
 criticism of Morocco's human rights performance. The King
 instructed the Council to serve as a means Qf examining and
 remedying human rights abuses; its first tasks were to respond
 to Amnesty International's (AI) 1990 report on Morocco and to
 review two well-publicized human rights cases. In late
 December, the Council sent a report to the King recommending a
 number of changes in judicial procedures, including prolonged
 garde a vue Cincommunicado pretrial detentionl, which had
 concerned human rights groups. Also noteworthy was the
 drafting of a national human rights charter by all three human
 rights groups in collaboration. with the Bar Association and
 the Association of Judges.
 However, serious human rights problems remained. There were
 continuing credible reports of torture and police brutality
 but few known efforts by the Government to-punish the
 perpetrators.
 *A separate section on the Western'Sahara is appended to this
 report.

 MOROCCO
 Other problems included illegal detention, inhumane prison
 conditions, the lack of fair trial in political and security
 cases, and restrictions on freedoft of association and the
 right of citizens to change their government. The conduct of
 government security forces in the December riots in Fez and
 other cities raised new human rights questions. The security
 forces used gunfire in responding to violent rioters carrying
 knives, chains, metal bars, and rocks. The incidents left
 numerous dead and injured. Opposition groups claimed that the
 Government's casualty figures were far too low and the use of
 live fire unjustified. The Government and opposition later
 agreed to form a special commission of inquiry to determine
 the facts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were credible reports that three persons in police
 custody died as a result of police brutality. There were no
 known investigations into these cases by the end of the year.
 In the December riots in Fez and other cities, the King
 authorized security forces to.use firearms to restore order
 when he learned that violent rioters had killed at least one
 policeman. The riots resulted in at least 5 killed and 127
 wounded or injured. Two trade union federations and the
 nonpartisan Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (OMDH)
 charged that the number killed by the security forces far
 exceeded the Government's figures. OMDH further charged that
 the Government's use of force was unjustified. In late
 December a commission of inquiry, led by the Secretary General
 of the CCDH and composed of government and opposition figures,
 was established to ascertain the facts and the causes of the
 violence. No report had been issued by the end of the year.
 (See Section 6.a.Y
 b." Disappearance
 There have been few permanent disappearances in recent years,
 and none was reported in 1990.. Temporary "disappearances"
 continue'to result from the practice of holding persons in
 pretrial incommunicado detention, without notifying families
 or attorneys, for significantly longer than the legal limit of
 4 days (8 days-for state security offenses).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The number .of credible reports of torture and degrading
 treatment remains relatively high and involves both detainees
 suspected of politically related crimes and criminal
 offenses. Torture and other forms of cruel treatment occur
 most often during incommunicado detention following initial
 arrest in-order to extract confessions which are then used to
 convict the suspect. Methods of torture include beatings,
 sleep deprivation, keeping prisoners blindfolded and
 handcuffed for weeks on end, and keeping prisoners naked and
 alone in dark punishment cells. Harsh treatment continues
 after conviction, when prisoners are subjected to random
 violence by guards and deliberately deprived of family visits,
 sleep, baths, blankets, and wholesome food. Political
 
 
 1549
 MOROCCO
 prisoners issued several communiques in 1990 complaining that
 they have been denied prescribed medicines or access to
 doctors. Political prisoners in Safi staged recurring hunger
 strikes demanding better prison conditions and transfer to
 prisons closer to their families. As far as is known, their
 demands were not met. One of four hunger strikers from
 Kenitra Prison died in February. The Minister of Justice
 later in the year stated that "so-called" political prisoners
 in the Kenitra prison enjoy better conditions than criminal
 prisoners, claiming that they have access to books,
 television, fresh fruits and vegetables, and may send and
 receive mail. For criminal offenders, mistreatment often
 results from extreme overcrowding in decrepit prison
 facilities, although criminal offenders also suffer many of
 the hardships placed on political prisoners. In its 1990
 report, AI stated that conditions in a number of Moroccan
 prisons appeared to constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment. The Minister of Justice reported that 80 percent
 of his 1990 budget was dedicated to constructing new prisons
 to alleviate overcrowding.
 Again in 1990 there was increased press coverage of reports of
 torture and abuses of authority. There was no known publicity
 of investigation or corrective action in these cases, and no
 evidence that the Government took disciplinary action.
 Perpetrators of abuse are seldom disciplined. in one case a
 low-level Ministry of Interior official and his brother were
 sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for torturing a detainee,
 but it is unknown if these two are serving sentences. A
 criminal case was also brought against an officer of the
 Gendarmerie for alleged torture in 1990.
 There are credible reports that alleged participants in the
 1971 and 1972 coup attempts against King Hassan II continue to
 receive the most severe treatment. Of 57 military personnel
 convicted as coup plotters and detained in the remote military
 fortress of Tazmamart, 29 are known to have died and many of
 the 28 remaining prisoners are said to have serious health
 problems from lack of hygiene, exercise, medical care, and
 extremely poor nutrition. Throughout their detention most of
 the prisoners have been unable to send or receive mail, and
 the Government does not generally respond to inquiries by
 family members. Some of these prisoners have not been
 released even though they have completed their sentences.
 Moroccan authorities have never acknowledged their detention
 at Tazmamart.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government often ignores guarantees of procedural due
 process. Moroccan law requires bringing a detainee before a
 judge within 4 days of detention and informing the detainee of
 the charges. With written justification from the prosecutor,
 an extension of 4 days may be given by the court. For
 political crimes a detainee can be held 8 days prior to being
 charged; and the 8-day periods can be extended indefinitely.
 Most torture and inhuman treatment is credibly reported to
 occur during this incommunicado detention. According to AI,
 incorrect arrest dates are given in police statements to cover
 up the actual dates of detention. Despite the international
 attention generated by a special Al report issued in February,
 human rights activists have observed little improvement in the
 treatment of suspects during pretrial detention or a
 significant reduction in the incidence of illegally prolonged
 detention. On December 27, however, the CCDH recommended a
 
 
 1550
 MOROCCO
 number of changes in the garde a vue and preventive
 detentionprocedures widely criticized by human rights groups,
 including AI. The King had not acted on these recommendations.
 before the year ran out.
 Arrests usually take place in public view, but police
 sometimes refuse to identify themselves, and warrants are not
 always used-as required by law. Moroccan law permits a lawyer
 to be present only after the detainee's first appearance in
 court, but no such right exists prior to or during police
 custody. Morocco does not have an extensive system of bail,
 although defendants are sometimes released on their own
 recognizance. Moroccan law does not-provide for habeas corpus-
 or its equivalent. Under a separate code of military justice,
 military personnel have been detained without warrants or
 public trial. No such incidents were reported in 1990.
 A well-known case of arbitrary detention involves the family
 of General Oufkir (the purported leader of the 1972 coup
 attempt), which has been kept under house arrest since 1972
 and deprived of adequate nutrition and health care until 1988,
 although none of the family members were ever charged with any
 crimes and the Oufkir children were minors in 1972.
 There are no known instances of Moroccans being sentenced to
 exile. There are, nonetheless, a number of political
 activists who remain abroad, mostly in France and Belgium,
 rather than risk-arrest on their return to Morocco.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Morocco has a dual legal system: a secular system based in
 part on French legal tradition; and a parallel Islamic system
 which adjudicates family matters and inheritance law for
 Moroccan Muslims. The secular system includes courts of
 original jurisdiction, appellate courts, and a Supreme Court.
 Those accused of political and security offenses often do not
 enjoy the procedural safeguards needed to-ensure a fair trial.
 In general, cases are brought before an initial review
 court--the Court of First Instance-which can call for a
 hearing quickly to bring cases to trial. The detainee is
 informed of charges and questioned by the judge to decide if
 they have merit. If the infraction is minor, the judge may
 release the detainee or impose a light sentence. If a lengthy
 investigation is required, the judge may release detainees on
 their own recognizance. In cases of political crimes,
 detainees are often held for long periods before trial. There
 are credible reports of detainees convicted on the basis of
 forced confessions extracted under duress. The Moroccan
 judicial system is generally considered susceptible to
 political intervention and control when a case involves
 challenges-to royal authority or state policy. Human rights
 groups often provide legal counsel for defendants in such
 cases. In common law cases defendants often receive only
 cursory hearings, and judges depend on police reports to
 decide-cases. Although the State provides an attorney at
 public expense for serious crimes (when the alleged offense
 carries a sentence of over 5 years), appointed attorneys often
 provide inadequate representation. For lesser crimes, needy
 defendants usually are not represented by counsel.
 In December the OMDH charged that the Government's use of
 group arrests and group trials against alleged participants in
 the December riots violated legal codes against collective
 
 
 1551
 MOROCCO
 responsibility and might not result in fair trials. Some
 members of the CCDH publicly called on the Government to
 suspend the trials pending the completion of an investigation
 by the commission of inquiry, but the trials continued.
 Human rights groups claim that there are between 200 and 300
 political prisoners, but the Government denies having any
 political prisoners. Since the Government defines several
 categories of speech as criminal (see Section 2.a.), it
 regards political prisoners as common criminals. All. three
 human rights groups have called for a general amnesty for
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that
 no search or investigation may take place withQut a search
 warrant. This. stipulation is not always observed, however,
 and there are continued allegations of illegal searches of the
 homes and offices of suspected political activists. The
 Government's security services selectively monitor certain
 persons and organizations, including their telephones and
 mail. The university campuses are under close surveillance,
 and an extensive informant system exists, especially on the
 campuses and in the cities. The Government's razing of
 several shantytowns in 1990 without providing compensation or
 alternate housing led to violent clashes between police and
 residents.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression. The
 King, however, stated explicitly in a May 8 speech that there
 are three forbidden topics: the monarchy, Morocco's claim to
 the Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam. In addition,
 many Moroccans censor themselves when criticizing government
 policies, foreign and domestic, for fear of government
 reprisal.
 Press freedom is limited, though the limits are not clear. On
 the one hand, the publishers of Al-Usbu'a As-Sahafi and
 At-Tariq (weekly newspapers) were both tried for slander in
 1990 for reporting alleged judicial corruption. Their cases
 were dismissed by the Court of First Instance for procedural
 defects, but the prosecutor refiled the charges and they were
 convicted. Tariq's publisher had two appeal's pending at the
 end of the year, one from his 1990 conviction and one from a
 conviction based on an article in his first weekly paper,
 which was banned in 1989. Abdel Karim Ghallab, managing
 editor of the Istiqlal's party's daily Al-Alam, was charged
 with printing false information and undermining public order
 after he published an article charging security forces in Fez
 with responsibility for the violence surrounding the December
 14 general strike and riots (See Section 6.a.). The trial was
 postponed indefinitely at the end of the year. On the other
 hand, the Government tolerates stinging and often satirical
 editorials in the opposition parties' dailies. Both the above
 mentioned weeklies continue to attack government policies.
 The Government does not exercise piior restraint on
 newspapers, although the Minister of Interior and Information
 sometimes offers "guidance."
 
 
 1552
 
 MOROCCO
 None of the new- media are entirely independent of government
 control, which is exercised through government subsidies as
 well as directives from the.Ministry of Interior and
 Information. The Government owns the official press agency
 Maghreb Arab Press, the Arabic daily Al Anbaa, the only
 television station available nationwide, and one radio station.
 The Moroccan public has access to a wide variety of foreign
 newspapers and magazines, particularly from Europe and the
 United Straes, which reflect a broad spectrum of opinion.
 Occasionally, an issue will be-banned when it has an article
 about Morocco which authorities consider particularly
 offensive. An issue of the Economist that contained an
 article on the Islamic fundamentalist challenge to the King
 was banned in May. Gilles Perrault's highly critical book
 about King Hassan and Morocco, Notre Ami, le Roi, published in
 France in October, is not available in Morocco. Censors also
 prevented disotribution of the September 6 edition of
 L'Evenement du Jeudi, which contained extracts of the book.
 The Government stopped retransmitting TV-5 from France in
 November after it broadcast an interview with Gilles Perrault,
 and again in December after unsympathetic coverage of the
 Government's response to the riots in Fez. The Government
 also expelled a French television journalist who had attempted
 to cover the riots, and confiscated all foreign newspapers
 from airline passengers arriving from abroad the week
 following the riots. However, an issue of Jeune Afrique
 featuring a story on growing international concern for human
 rights abuses in Morocco was circulated freely.
 There is a limited degree of academic freedom. Although there
 are strictures against scholarly investigation of the monarchy
 and Islam, there continues to be limited research and
 publishing on Islam and Islamic fundamentalism. In September
 the Government sponsored a conference on Islam which was
 attended' by a wide range of Muslim participants, including
 Islamic fundamentalists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of assembly and
 association, but these rights are limited by two decrees
 dating from 1935 and 1939 which permit the Government to
 suppress even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings.
 Groups planning a demonstration or large meeting must apply to
 the Ministry of Interior for a permit. In June the
 nonpartisan Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (OMDH) was
 given a permit only 1'hour before the scheduled opening of a
 conference on human rights in Casablanca. When the three
 Moroccan human rights groups, the Bar Association, and the
 Association of Judges applied in January for a permit to meet
 to discuss their joint charter of human rights, they were also
 kept in suspense until just before the scheduled opening
 session. .However, the Government permitted the five groups to
 hold public sessions in Casablanca in October and in Rabat in
 December.
 The right to form' an organization is also limited. Persons
 wishing to create an organization must apply to the Ministry
 of Interior and wait for approval before holding meetings.
 The Islamist Justice and Charity Society ran afoul of the law
 by holding meetings without permission to form a group. In
 1990 the Government prosecuted 41 members of this organization
 from 5 cities on charges including forming an unauthorized
 organization, possessing banned literature, and disturbing the
 faith of Muslims. Thirty-five were convicted, and 13
 
 
 1553
 MOROCCO
 convictions were overturned on appeal. The largest
 unauthorized demonstration in Rabat for years was held in May
 by Justice and Charity Society members who came from all over
 Morocco to show support for their colleagues on the day of
 their appeal. Refused entry to the courtroom, several hundred
 Islamists sat peacefully across the street from the courthouse
 and were surrounded by police in riot gear. After several
 hours, the police dispersed the demonstrators and the huge
 crowd of onlookers with truncheons, injuring many. Several
 hundred people were arrested but released after questioning.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Morocco, 99 percent of
 Moroccans are Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title
 "Commander of the Faithful." The Moroccan Jewish community of
 approximately 10,000 is permitted to practice its faith, as
 are Christians. Although the Constitution provides for
 freedom of worship, in keeping with Islamic law and tradition
 only the practice of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is
 tolerated. In a speech in May, the King stated in accord with
 Islamic doctrine that there are three revealed religions
 (Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) and all other religions are
 heresies. The Baha'i community (150-20G people) has been
 forbidden to meet or hold communal activities since 1983.
 Attempting to convert a Moroccan to any faith other than Islam
 is punishable by imprisonment.
 The Government monitors the Friday sermons in the mosques and
 the curriculum of the Koranic schools to-insure that approved
 doctrines are taught. As noted earlier, fundamentalist
 Islamic activities are sometimes subjected to official
 crackdown.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Morocco is unrestricted. In the
 Western Sahara, which is administered by Morocco, movement is
 restricted in militarily sensitive areas. There are frequent
 allegations of corruption in the passport offices; applicants
 are reportedly forced to pay gratuities to obtain the
 application form and insure that the application is not lost
 in the bureaucratic labyrinth.
 Freedom to travel outside Morocco is controlled by the
 Ministry of Interior through the passport issuance process.
 That process was somewhat improved in 1990. Though delays are
 not uncommon, most Moroccans receive passports within I month
 of application. This is not true for certain political
 activists, former political prisoners, or for Moroccan raha'is.
 Women must have permission from either their fathers or
 husbands to obtain a passport. A divorced woman must have her
 father's permission to obtain a passport, and, if she has
 custody of children, she must have permission of the
 children's father for passports to be issued to the children.
 There were no reported instances of the Government depriving a
 citizen of Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life. Moroccans cannot renounce their Moroccan citizenship,
 though the King can revoke it--a little used practice. Tens
 of thousands of Moroccans hold dual nationality and travel on
 passports from two countries; while in Morocco they are
 
 
 1554
 
 MOROCCO
 regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government
 has sometimes refused to recognize the right of foreign
 embassies to act on-behalf of dual nationals or even to
 receive information concerning their arrest and imprisonment.
 Moroccan law encourages voluntary repatriation for Moroccan
 Jews who have emigrated; Moroccan Jewish emigres, including
 those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Morocco. It also
 encourages the return of Saharans who have opposed Morocco in
 the Western Sahara conflict. Returning former Polisario
 members who are deemed no threat to security are integrated
 into Moroccan life.
 Section 3 Respect For Political Rights: The Right of Citizen'
 to Change Their Government
 Moroccan citizens cannot change their Government; the King, as
 Head of State, appoints the Prime Minister, who is head of
 government, and the Parliament has little or no authority to
 effect change in the system of government. Moreover, the
 Constitution may not be amended without the approval of the
 King, who would be unlikely to abolish or modify the
 monarchy. Political reforms widely expected in the.spring
 failed to materialize by the end of the year.
 For the first time since the early 1960's, the Parliament was
 permitted in May to hold a vote of censure of the Council of
 Ministers. Although the motion failed, the televised debate
 in the Parliament and the editorials in the opposition press
 were unprecedented in Morocco. Two-thirds of the members of
 Parliament are elected directly by universal adult suffrage,
 while one-third is elected indirectly by various business,
 labor, and agricultural organizations. Six representatives
 are elected by overseas Moroccans. The Ministry of Interior
 appoints provincial governors, though municipal councils are
 elected.
 Elections are not generally regarded as fully free of
 Government manipulation. Opposition parties contend that the
 Government rigged the outcome of the last parliamentary
 elections in 1984 by interfering in the selection of
 candidates and the tallying of ballots, although one-third of
 the deputies elected were from opposition parties. In a
 number of cases, challenges were upheld in court. National
 elections were to have been held in 1990, but were postponed
 for 2 years by a referendum initiated by the Palace. The
 Government's stated reason for the delay was to allow time to
 resolve the status of the Western Sahara by a UN-organized
 referendum so that "all Moroccans" (i e., Saharans) could
 participate in the next elections. The referendum was
 approved by a-vote of 98 percent, with a reported 100-percent
 rate of participation.
 Section 4 .Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 International investigation of violations of human rights is
 not well tolerated in Morocco. In a televised interview in
 December 1989, the King invited AI to come to Morocco to meet
 with him and his ministers and discuss human rights. AI
 accepted the invitation, and in February, after their
 delegation's visit, published a report on torture of detainees
 during pretrial detention. In March another.delegation from
 AI arrived on an unscheduled visit as tourists and were
 expelled from the country. Two French doctors came to
 
 
 1555
 MOROCCO
 Marrakech in May to treat former political prisoners and were
 expelled. A journalist from the French weekly L'Evenement du
 Jeudi was expelled in September after meeting with a
 journalist from the Parti pour Progres et Socialisme
 (Communist) paper Al Bayane. Morocco's report to the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) was criticized by
 Moroccan human rights activists for glossing over serious
 rights abuses, for being submitted late, and for not being
 made public in Morocco. Inquiries about specific political
 prisoners, transmitted by diplomatic missions to the
 Government of Morocco, generally go unanswered.
 In May, in response to criticism of Morocco's human rights
 performance, the King created the Royal Consultative Council
 on Human Rights. In a televised speech the King called for
 perfecting the rule of law in Morocco, saying that Morocco did
 not need foreigners criticizing its human rights performance
 and that Morocco had all the means necessary to examine-and
 remedy abuses of human rights. The Council was charged with
 responding to AI's February 1990 report on torture during
 pretrial incommunicado detention as well as with reviewing the
 cases of the Oufkir family and Abraham Serfaty, who was
 imprisoned for criticizing Morocco's claim to the Western
 Sahara. At year's end, the Council had not yet completed all
 these tasks or issued a report, though in late December it did
 recommend to the King several changes regarding detention.
 The King also authorized the Minister of Justice to institute
 within 3 years a nationwide system of administrative law
 courts in which people could seek redress of abuses of
 authority by public servants, and Parliament approved the
 budget for these courts.
 Investigations by Moroccan human rights groups are conducted
 with neither government hindrance nor cooperation. There are
 three human rights groups in Morocco: two are affiliated with
 opposition political parties, while the third is nonpartisan.
 The Moroccan League for Human Rights (Istiqlal Party) and the
 Moroccan Association for the Defense of Human Rights
 (Socialist) have formed a coordinating committee and generally
 issue joint communiques. The League, however, chose to
 participate in the Royal Consultative Council, while the
 Association did not. The nonpartisan OMDH also chose to
 participate in the Council. All three groups joined forces
 with the Bar Association and the Association of Judges to
 write a national charter of human rights which was issued in
 final form during a plenary session in December. The charter
 defines common goals for human rights activists in Morocco and
 commits the signatory groups to work to bring about government
 compliance with these goals.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution affirms the legal equality of all Moroccans,
 and the Government does not discriminate based on ethnicity.
 Though there is no systematic discrimination, Moroccan blacks
 generally occupy the lower social strata, and few hold any
 high government positions. However, some Moroccan descendants
 of sub-Saharan African slaves suffer various forms of social
 discrimination arising out of racist attitudes of some Arabs
 and Berbers, the two major ethnic groups in Morocco.
 Under the criminal code, Moroccan women are accorded the same
 treatment as men. Women are not accorded equal treatment
 under Moroccan family and estate law, which is based on the
 
 
 1556
 MOROCCO
 Malikite school of Islamic law. In marriage, for example, a
 husband may repudiate his wife, but the wife cannot repudiate
 her husband. The situations under which a woman may sue for
 divorce are far fewer than those'permitted to men. Women.
 inherit only half as much as their male siblings.
 Well-educated Moroccan women often succeed professionally,
 particularly in the areas of law, medicine, education, and
 government service. There are, however, very few women in the
 top echelons of their professions, and there are no women
 ministers or Members of Parliament. Women compose
 approximately 24 percent of the work force, with the majority
 of them in the industrial, service, and teaching sectors.
 Women enjoy the right to vote and to run for office, and some-
 women have been elected to municipal councils  There are no
 women on the Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights. It
 is in the rural setting-where women suffer most from
 inequality. Women perform most hard physical labor; the rate
 of literacy in the countryside is much lower for women than
 men; and girls are much less likely to go to school than
 boys. Women who earn their secondary school diploma have
 equal access to university traininq.
 Moroccan law and social practices governing violence against
 women reflect Morocco's Islamic culture and the importance
 placed on the honor of the famiiy. The criminal code includes
 severe punishment for men who are convicted of raping or
 violating a woman or girl, and the defendant bears the burden
 of proving his innocence. However, sexual assaults often go
 unreported because of the stigma attached to not being a
 virgin. Rapists are sometimes offered the opportunity to
 marry their victims (even against the girl's will) in order to
 preserve honor.
 While there are no statistics on its extent, wife beating
 occurs in some Moroccan homes, and some Moroccans believe wife
 beating is sanctioned by Islamic tradition. Although a woman
 has the right to complain to the police, as a practical matter
 she would not generally do so unless she were prepared to file
 for divorce and leave her husband's home. Moroccan law
 excuses the murder or injury of a wife who is caught in the
 act of committing adultery. A woman would not be excused
 after committing violence against her husband under the same
 circumstances.
 The official language of Morocco is Arabic, and the languages
 of instruction and the news media are Arabic and French.
 There are some Berber spokesmen who believe that the Berber
 identity is not adequately maintained because Berber languages
 are not taught in schools and there are no Berber
 publications, though a few state-owned radio stations
 broadcast several hours daily in Berber languages. Berbers
 are well represented in the Government and the officer corps
 of the military, and constitute approximately half of
 Morocco's population. Berbers mostly reside in rural areas,
 while urban populations are largely Arab. Berber identity is
 rapidly losing significance in Morocco, and the Government's
 policy of Arabization is likely to accelerate this process.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize trade
 unions. Workers are free to form and join unions throughout
 the country. The right is exercised widely but not
 
 
 1557
 MOROCCO
 universally. On occasion, the selection of union officers and
 their ability to carry out their duties is subject to
 government pressure. Some 1 million of Morocco's 7.5 million
 workers belong to unions, including substantial numbers of
 workers in the public sector. Three of the 13 existing trade
 union federations dominate the labor scene; all are
 independent of the Government. They are the Union Marocain du
 Travail (UMT), the Confederation Democratique de Travail
 (CDT), and the Union Generale des Travailleurs Marocains
 (UGTM). Each has a democratically elected leadership. The
 UMT has no political affiliation, the CDT is linked to the
 Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), and the UGTM to the
 Istiqlal Party. Both the USFP and Istiqlal are currently
 opposition parties.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so occasionally. Most
 of the work stoppages are intended to advertise grievances and
 last 24 hours or less; however, strikes can be prolonged and
 arise not only from economic demands or those related to
 working conditions but also from union rivalry. There was
 only one major strike in 1990: in December the CDT and the
 UGTM led a general strike to highlight social and economic
 issues. Though the unions urged people to mark the event
 peacefully, violence erupted in Fez and other cities when
 crowds of rioters, mostly disaffected youths carrying knives,
 chains, bars, and rocks, attacked and burned buildings and
 vehicles (see Section l.a.).
 At least four union officials were arrested in the immediate
 aftermath of the disturbances that accompanied the general
 strike. Three were released without being charged. The UGTM
 regional secretary for the Fez area was charged and prosecuted
 for sedition and incitement to riot but acquitted of all
 charges in late December.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain
 ties with international trade secretariats. After a long
 absence, the UMT reaffiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions in 1990.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the- right to organize and
 bargain collectively. The multiplicity of trade union
 federations creates competition to organize workers. Any
 group of eight workers can organize, and it is easy for a
 worker to change trade union affiliation. Thus a single
 factory may contain several independent locals or locals
 affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In both the process of organizing and during collective
 bargaining, labor laws are honored most often in the
 industrial sector of the economy, where ad hoc government
 mediation and arbitration procedures to promote
 worker-employer negotiations are more easily applied. These
 procedures do not in practice infringe on the unions' freedom
 to bargain and to strike. In the informal and underground
 economies, especially the growing textile sector, and in the
 artisanal field (handicrafts), labor laws and regulations are
 less carefully observed and often ignored. Small employers,
 especially in the agricultural sector, are often ignorant of
 labor laws and regulations. To sone degree, the labor-surplus
 economy hinders protection of the organizing and collective
 bargaining process. Because of constitutional guarantees of
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, the principle

 MOROCCO
 of collective bargaining is implicit rather than explicit in
 the labor codes themselves. The wages of most unionized
 workers are established through practices that include
 discussions between employer and-worker representatives.
 Wages for the vast majority of workers are set unilaterally by
 the employer.
 Collective bargaining agreements are often invoked in legal
 disputes when a worker claims to have been reprimanded or
 dismissed for trade union activity. Employers usually cite
 work-related reasons for the dismissals. An employer
 intending to fire workers without replacing them must apply in
 advance to the provincial governor through the labor
 inspector's office. In the more usual cases where employers
 plan to replace fired workers, the labor inspector provides
 replacements and mediates the cases of workers who protest
 their dismissal. Any worker fired for a serious infraction,
 such as sabotage, is entitled by law to a court hearing which,
 despite the admitted government influence on the judiciary,
 generally provides greater satisfaction to worker
 complainants. 'An employer found to have dismissed a worker
 unjustly is liable for fines or even imprisonment. Moroccan
 labor law applies equally to the small Tangier Export Zone.
 The proportion of unionized workers there is about the same as
 in Morocco as a whole.
 Despite constitutional protection, unions complain regularly
 that employers suspend or dismiss their members for trade
 union activity without penalty. Under the law, Ministry of
 Labor inspectors serve as investigator, judge, and jury; they
 are often not very effective, however, because they are few in
 number, carry heavy workloads, and do not have the resources
 to investigate all possible cases of labor law violations.
 Workers have thus turned increasingly to the courts for the
 resolution of complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Morocco has ratified both ILO conventions against forced
 labor. The ILO's Committee of Experts (COE) in its report for
 1990 noted that there is no Moroccan legal or constitutional
 prohibition against forced or compulsory labor. If adopted as
 now drafted, the new labor code would prohibit forced or
 compulsory labor and provide penal sanctions. As far as is
 known, forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Morocco.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children cannot be legally employed or apprenticed before age
 12. Special regulations govern the employment of children
 between the ages of 12 and 16. In artisanal work, however,
 children are often apprenticed before age 12; the argument is
 made that they need to acquire skills, such as weaving or
 rug-makinq, at an earlier age. Five years of primary
 education is compulsory, starting at age 7, but enforcement in
 the countryside and poorer urban areas is lax.
 Safety and health conditions as well is salaries in
 enterprises employing children are often substandard. The
 rug-making and tanning industries have been cited as areas
 where the use of minors is common. Children are also employed
 informally as domestics and usually receive little or no
 wages. Abuses of the child labor laws often go undetected
 because many of them occur in the countryside or in private
 homes.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum industrial wage was raised in May 1990 by 10
 percent to about 63 cents an hour. Agricultural workers also
 received a 10 percent increase to about 41 cents per hour.
 Despite subsidies, a family cannot maintain a decent standard
 of living on the minimum wage of a single worker. In many
 cases, several members, some of them working in the informal
 economy, combine their income to support their family.
 The informal sector provides a safety net for those who would
 otherwise be unemployed or underemployed. Most industrial
 workers in the modern sector of the economy earn more than the
 minimum wage. Moreover, workers are customarily paid between
 13 and 16 months' salary for every 12-month year.
 Moroccan law provides a 48-hour maximum workweek (with not
 more than 10 hours for any single day), premium pay for
 overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and minimum
 conditions for health and safety, including the prohibition of
 night work for women and minors. As with other regulations
 and laws, these are observed unevenly and have little meaning
 in the informal sector. Labor inspectors endeavor to monitor
 working conditions, accidents, and labor disputes, but lack
 sufficient resources and authority to investigate many
 complaints and assure compliance with the law.
