 GRENADA
 Human rights in Grenada (population about 118,000) has
 continued to deteriorate since the March 1979 coup d'etat led
 by leaders of the New JEWEL Movement, a revolutionary group
 opposed to the former GoVernment of Sir Eric Gairy. The
 overthrow of the Gairy regime established Grenada as having the
 first nonconstitutional change of government in the
 commonwealth Caribbean--a condition which continues to prevail
 four years after the coup.
 Like other former British colonies in the Eastern Caribbean,
 Grenada had adopted a Westminster-style system of parliamentary
 democracy at the time of its independence in 1974. Gairy, the
 first prime minister, was accused by his opponents of personal
 corruption, of rigging the 1976 elections, and of intimidating
 the opposition by using his "police auxiliary" forces, the
 "Mongoose Gang," to perform acts of violence. As a result of
 these abuses, the extra-constitutional character of the New
 JEWEL Movement coup was initially excused by the populace and
 the new People's Revolutionary Government greeted with
 widespread acceptance.
 Despite promises by the new Government, led by Prime Minister
 Maurice Bishop, for an early return to the parliamentary
 system, to hold elections, and to uphold human rights, the
 Government, has not fulfilled these commitments. In 1981,
 Freedom House included Grenada among those countries which had
 registered "significant declines in freedom." In its 1982
 report Freedom House characterized Grenada as "Not Free."
 Shortly after taking power, the Government suspended the 1974
 constitution and imprisoned certain former government
 officials, leaders of rival opposition parties and other
 citizens considered a threat to the revolution; Although some
 55 political prisoners have since been released and a few have
 been charged and sentenced in court, as of the end of 1982
 there were more than 100 political prisoners in Government
 custody. Prime Minister Bishop has justified the continued
 detention of political prisoners by arguing that "every
 revolution creates dislocation." The Government has also
 curtailed press freedom by closing the only pre-coup
 independent newspaper as well as two other journals following
 the publication of their first issues. The Government has
 vowed to fight against and prevent the spread in Grenada of
 what it describes as US "cultural imperialism."
 Now more than any other time since the 1979 coup, Grenada
 appears further than ever away from the holding of democratic
 parliamentary elections. Indeed, Prime Minister Bishop
 declared at the November 1982 Caribbean Common Market heads of
 government meeting in Kingston, Jamaica that Grenada will never
 again see Westminster-style elections. Instead of elections,
 the Government speaks of some new form of democracy based on
 "responsibility, accountability, participation by the people at
 all levels, and right to benefits such as employment, education
 and health." The intention appears to be to introduce some
 form of consultation through mass organizations controlled by
 the New JEWEL Movement or the Government. Although the
 
 
 508
 Government has on several occasions stated its intention to
 establish a committee of experts to draw up a new proposal for
 a constitution which would then be subject to popular
 referendum, there has been no sign of progress in this regard.
 Opposition political activities and labor action have been
 discouraged and effectively curtailed by the Government.
 The Government has pledged to improve'the welfare of its
 citizens and has taken steps to meet the basic economic needs
 of the populace. These efforts have been adversely affected by
 production and marketing problems in the agricultural sector
 and declining tourist arrivals. Grenada's poor political
 climate has discouraged new investment and private initiative.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the'Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Unconfirmed reports indicate there may have been a few isolated
 incidents of politically-motivated murders of opponents of the
 new Government in the immediate aftermath of the 1979 coup.
 Since then, however, there have been no reports of political
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there continued to be infrequent reports of
 disappearances in 1982, none have been confirmed. Detentions
 are not always publicly announced, however, and no official
 list of detainees has been released by the Government since
 August 1980.
 c. Torture
 There have been some allegations by political prisoners of
 torture under the present Government. In October 1982, several
 prisoners on trial for conspiring to overthrow the Government
 and for terrorist acts charged that they had been tortured by
 government security forces following their arrest in June
 1980. According to reports by these persons, physical and
 mental abuse appears to have occurred in connection with their
 arrest and during initial interrogations rather than throughout
 the period of their detention. There is physical evidence that
 prisoners have been abused during detention. Physical scarring
 would appear to substantiate their claim of having been burned
 by cigarettes and tortured with electric cattle prods. There
 were no reports of torture among a group of 29 detainees
 released conditionally on November 16, 1982. However, an
 American citizen recently release from Grenadian custody has
 reported that during the eleven months of his incarceration he
 was beaten, forced to spend a good deal of time naked in a cold
 cell, and on one occasion received a threat against his life
 from prison guards. Grenadian authorities held the American
 citizen in prison from Dec. 17, 1981 until Nov. 29, 1982
 without notifying US authorities despite the prisoner's
 repeatedly informing the Grenadian police and prison guards of
 his US citizenship.

 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Released political detainees have complained about prison
 conditions, particularly about the inadequate quality and
 quantity of food. Prison diet is made up almost exclusively of
 rice and peas with fish and bananas as occasional supplements.
 Many of the prisoners reportedly suffer from gastro-intestinal
 problems. Some prisoners are permitted outside their cells for
 *no more than One hour each day. Visits by family members are
 only allowed sporadically, and there have been reports of
 arbitrary suspension of visits, particularly for political
 detainees. Harassment in the form of confiscation by prison
 authorities of food packages from relatives has also been
 reported. Grenada's Richmond Hill prison facility which houses
 the majority of the political prisoners has no hot water, no
 showers and no flush toilets. Frequently the prisoners have no
 water at all for hygenic purposes. The cells are reportedly
 infested by insects and vermin and are more cramped than those
 for regular (non-political) prisoners. It is commonly noted
 among the prisoner population that one is "better dead than a
 detainee."
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In suspending the Constitution in 1979, the government
 empowered itself to arrest persons without warrant for
 suspected counterrevolutionary activity. The Government has
 utilized this power to conduct periodic roundups of persons it
 accuses of anti-government activity. Few detainees have ever
 been charged, and those who eventually are released are
 apparently not informed of the reasons for their arrest. Such
 detention is for an indefinite term at the pleasure of the
 state. The right of habeas corpus does not exist. On December
 31, 1981, the Government released 24 political detainees,
 without explaining the reasons either for their detention or
 for their release. Again, on November 26, 1982, on the eve of
 the Caribbean Common Market heads of government conference, the
 Government released 29 political detainees, this time on the
 condition, however, that they turn in their passports and
 report to the authorities every two weeks. The names of 14 of
 the 29 released were previously unknown to outside observers,
 suggesting there may be many more about whom outsiders are
 presently unaware. There are unconfirmed reports that a third
 amnesty may have occurred just prior to Christmas 1982.
 According to a Caribbean News Agency file of Dec. 20, 1982, the
 Grenadian Government may have released a "new group" of
 political prisoners. The current estimate is that political
 detainees still number somewhat more than 100, though the
 Grenadian Government talks only of 18 or "less than 50."
 A 1980 law provided for the establishment of a three-member
 detention tribunal appointed by the Government. The law
 created a framework for the review of detentions by the
 tribunal as frequently as every two months. The tribunal
 announced that it would meet at six-month intervals, but has
 not kept that schedule, meeting only infrequently and
 sporadically. There are reliable reports that recommendations
 for release made in some cases have been rejected.
 
 
 510
 According to its 1982 report, "in December 1981, Amnesty
 International was investigating the cases of 77 detainees in
 Grenada."
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political detainees are held indefinitely and are not normally
 charged (the relevant law does not oblige the Government to
 press charges). The preventive detention tribunal system has
 the effect of removing political cases from the judicial system
 and denying affected citizens a fair public trial. Of the more
 than 100 political prisoners whose incarceration has been
 confi'rmed, at least 90 are said to be held under the preventive
 detention regulations: approximately 20 have been charged under
 the 1980 Terrorism Law. Some 12 others may or may not have
 been charged, and at least two others apparently have turned
 state's evidence but are still held. Thus far, the political
 detainees who have been brought to trial have been tried under
 the Terrorism Law promulgated by the Government in 1980 with
 unlimited retroactive effect. The Law suspends the
 constitutional right to jury and makes confessions to members
 of the Government's security forces admissible as evidence.
 The traditional legal system, based on British common law,
 continues to operate for ordinary criminal offenses, with the
 accused having the right to counsel and normal legal remedies.
 The independence of the judiciary still appears to be intact in
 civil and criminal cases. In its early days the Government
 appointed a three-man appeals court, composed of leading West
 Indian (but not Grenadian) jurists. This court has not
 functioned well due to the unavailability of its judges, who
 are not resident in Grenada. Several appeals have been
 delayed, during which time the appellants have remained in
 prison. The Government has taken steps to rectify the
 situation by recruiting new judges more readily available to
 hear cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Government has given the police force and the People's
 Revolutionary Army the power to make searches and arrests
 without warrant. There are many indications that searches made
 under the umbrella of "national security" have been used to
 stifle and harass opponents. Warrantless searches are usually
 carried out in conjunction with the arrests of presumed
 political opponents of the regime. Opponents also have had
 their homes and businesses placed under open surveillance by
 the Government and have had personal property confiscated and
 utilities disconnected.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government has continued to suppress these freedoms. An
 independent newspaper, the "Grenadian Voice," appeared in
 mid-June 1981, but was closed by the Government shortly before
 distribution of its second issue. A law was passed making it
 illegal to publish this newspaper as well as, for an indefinite
 
 
 511
 period, any other new journal. In July 1981, four persons
 linked with the "Grenadian Voice" were detained for alleged
 "CIA links." They are still being held.
 Harassment of Grenadian correspondents of Western news agencies
 continued in 1982. The executive committee of the American
 Press Association has condemned the Grenadian Government for
 "its repeated attacks on freedom of the press." There have
 been reliable reports of individuals being intimidated by
 government personnel after "talking" with Western visitors and
 correspondents.
 Regarding academic freedom, there apparently have been no
 attempts to prevent Grenadian students from enrolling in and
 attending off-island institutions of higher learning. However,
 students are strongly encouraged by the government to attend
 Cuban universities. Mail tampering is suspected as is
 electronic surveillance of open-voice communications lines.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There were no known instances of popular assembly in opposition
 to the Government. The futility and dangers of such activity
 were demonstrated by the breakup by Government supporters of
 the few such meetings held in 1979-80. Since coming to power
 the current regime has gradually gained influence over the
 local labor unions with the result that the independence of the
 unions has been seriously compromised. With the exception of
 one union, the Seamen and Waterfront Workers Union whose
 members include about 10 percent of the work force, all other
 unions are headed by Government sympathizers. Although Grenada
 on paper has a reasonably liberal labor code, the provisions of
 that code in reality have been modified since the Government
 reserves the right to declare any strike a political act and
 thus can take retaliatory action against any union.  Labor
 unions in Grenada have no international affiliations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Traditionally Grenada has been a predominantly Catholic and
 Anglican country. The current Government is actively
 attempting to de-emphasize religion. Proselytizilng is
 forbidden. There have been reports of Government efforts to
 promote atheism. Although there has been no consistent pattern
 of harassment against churches, the Government in early 1980
 closed a Catholic newspaper and accused the Catholic Church of
 being an instrument of "destabilization."
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, there is no restriction on freedom of travel within
 the country, except for entry into zones restricted on national
 security grounds. However, the Government has the power to
 restrict the movement of any individual to certain geographical
 areas, including restriction to the person's home (house
 arrest). Foreign travel is normally unrestricted. Several
 shareholders in the suppressed "Grenadian Voice" newspaper,
 however, were, prevented from leaving Grenada in mid-1981 on a
 variety of unspecified grounds. Reliable reports indicated
 
 
 512
 these persons were in some cases allowed to travel only after
 they pledged to the Government, sometimes publicly, no future
 involvement in such free press activities. Grenada's leading
 journalist was also denied permission to travel outside the
 country in 1981, a travel ban which was subsequently lifted.
 Thoughout 1982 applications for asylum filed by Grenadians
 seeking to remain in the U.S. were processed by the Immigration
 and Naturalization Service and the Department of State. The
 majority of the applicants based their requests for asylum upon
 fear of political persecution or imprisonment in Grenada as a
 result of their association or identification with the former
 Government of Sir Eric Gairy. There were no reported requests
 by Grenadians for refugee status during 1982.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Grenada is tightly controlled by a small group within the New
 JEWEL Movement. Very soon after the March 1979 coup which
 brought the present regime to power, Prime Minister Maurice
 Bishop declared there would no longer be a Westminster-style
 parliamentary system in Grenada. Since then, Government
 statements have indicated an increasing preference for
 establishing a form of "new democracy," based on consultation
 through "mass organizations." Individuals and opposition
 groups which have attempted to participate in the political
 process without Government authorization have been detained,
 harassed, or suppressed.
 Men and women have equal legal and political rights in the
 Grenadian political system. Women hold a number of high
 Government positions (one is currently a cabinet minister and
 another is assigned to Washington as the Grenadian Ambassador
 to the Organization of American States) although they remain
 underrepresented in both public and private sector jobs in
 terms of the overall proportion of the population. The
 Government has encouraged formation of officially-sponsored
 women's groups and through various means has aided their
 participation in political, propaganda, and development
 efforts. In August 1982 Prime Minister Bishop established the
 Ministry of Women's Affairs. The new ministry is mandated to
 "work toward the elimination of artificial barriers which have
 hindered the development of Grenadian women." Current programs
 include the enrollment of women in adult education programs,
 social education and leadership training, and the establishment
 of day-care centers and nursery schools. Racial discrimination
 is not condoned by the Government, though the cabinet is made
 up almost exclusively of black ministers with the one exception
 of a Guyanese of East Indian origin. All other key Government
 officials are black. There are, however, other races employed
 in lesser Government positions.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights.
 There has been in 1982 no significant improvement in the
 Government's attitude or response to outside expressions of
 concern over the human rights situation. Neighboring
 democratic leaders and regional media have become more openly
 
 
 513
 critical of the Government's repressive practices as evidenced
 most recently at the Caribbean Common Market heads of state
 meeting in November 1982. The release of 29 political
 detainees on the eve of the Caribbean Common Market summit
 suggests that the Bishop regime had some concern about the
 anticipated criticism of its human rights record and felt
 pressured to provide some evidence of the progress it was
 making in this area. Press and individual inquiries about
 specific political prisoners have not been answered. During
 the late summer of 1982, a political detainee who is a legal
 permanent resident of the United States and the spouse of a
 U.S. citizen escaped from Grenadian incarceration. He was
 recaptured and returned to prison in November. In response to
 an official Embassy inquiry regarding the prisoner's state of
 health and general well-being, a Grenadian Foreign Ministry
 spokesman expressed surprise at the US Government's interest in
 detainees and stated that, "detainees are an internal PRG
 matter and a by-product of the revolution."
 In January 1981 an Amnesty International mission went to
 Grenada to discuss the continued detention of persons without
 charge or trial and the alleged ill-treatment of detainees.
 Amnesty also took an interest in the trials of a number of
 political detainees in November 1982.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Grenada's economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.
 The three main cash crops are cocoa, bananas, and nutmeg. In
 recent years, tourism has become an important employer and
 source of foreign exchange. The Government increasingly relies
 on Cuba for economic assistance.
 The early 1970's were a period of slowly increasing prosperity
 for the Grenadian people. The annual per capita income has
 reached $850. Cultivation of the three cash crops provided the
 foundation for economic development. Private investors, both
 domestic and foreign, built tourist facilities geared
 especially to North American visitors and retirees. A start
 was also made toward attracting private investment, although
 poor planning by the Government and increasing official
 corruption limited advancement. Indicators show that basic
 human needs were met in this period at adequate if sometimes
 minimal levels. Infant mortality fell from 34 to 15.4 per
 thousand and life expectancy rose from 67 to 69 years.
 Nevertheless, in the 1970's, Grenadians increasingly believed
 that the Gairy Government was more interested in enriching
 itself than in developing the country. This was a primary
 factor in the widespread support the present Government
 initially received when it came to power.
 The present regime has created several new social welfare
 programs, concentrating on primary health care, education, and
 adult literacy. These programs, carried out with technical and
 financial assistance from abroad, have brought about some
 improvement. However, many factors have combined to limit
 progress.  Depressed markets for export crops and production
 problems have reduced foreign exchange earnings, which in turn
 have lowered national income and government revenue. Reduced
 revenues have also been caused by a lack of private sector
 
 
 514
 confidence and investment, occasioned by ambivalent government
 attitudes toward private business activity and by a fall in
 income from tourism resulting from a generally depressed
 Caribbean market and amplified by the negative reaction of
 American tourists to the Government's anti-US propaganda.
