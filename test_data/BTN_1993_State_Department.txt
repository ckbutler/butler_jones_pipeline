 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan is an absolute monarchy, ruled by the Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary
 monarchs since 1907. Located in the Himalayas between India and TibeL, the small
 Kingdom has been able to escape domination by any external power since the 10th
 century. There is no written constitution or bill of rights. King Jigme Sinhye
 Wangchuck, on the throne since 1972 has continued social and political reforms
 begvn by his father, but progss has been disrupted over the past half decade by
 civil strife involving ethnic Nepalese. Buddhists constitute betwcn one-half and
 "*Bhutan and the United States do not have diplomatic relations, and U.S. offiials travel
 there infrequently. Since few independent obsrvers have visited southern Bhutan. information
 on Bhutanese practices af'ect-ing human rights is often incomplete.

 two-thirds of the population; another third, mostly from the southern districts, is
 of Nepali Hindu ethnic origin.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, a force of about 5,000, assisted by the Royal Bhutan
 Army, with approximately 7,000 lightly armed men, and a militia of about 10,000,
 maintains internal security.
 An estimated 90 percent of Bhutan's 600,000 population are largely illiterate and
 live in rural areas on subsistence agriculture in a mainly barter economy. India is
 Bhutan's main trading partner and principal source of foreign exchange.
 Despite some positive actions, including the Government's authorization of peri-
 odic prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Crors (ICRC) and im-
 p lementation of certain legal reforms, there remained serious concern about the
 Government's human rights practices, including implementation of the 1985 Citizen-
 ship Act; related measures to strengthen Bhutanese culture; the failure to prosecute
 security force members who committed rape, torture, and other abuses in the name
 of enforcing citizenship laws; and the status of 85,000 ethnic Nepalese refugees from
 southern Bhutan currently in camps in eastern Nepal.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act targets the ethnic Nepalese minority, whose growing
 percentage of the population was perceived by the ruling Drupka Buddhists as a
 threat to their culture. Under the Act, tens of thousands were declared to be illegal
 immigrants and forcibly evicted from Bhutan. Others fled voluntarily in the face of
 officially sanctioned pressure, including arbitrary arrests, beatings, rape, robberies,
 and other forms of intimidation by police and the army. The Bhutan People's Party
 (BPP) and the Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP), organized by ethnic Nep-
 alese in exile, continued to press for democratic reforms and resist government poli-
 cies they argue would suppress their ethnic and cultural identity. The Government
 outlawed the BPP in 1990, accusing it of killing government officials, destroying
 government property, and kidnaping or attacking southerners who did not support
 its cause.
 Other human rights abuses included: denial of the right of citizens to change their
 government; limitations on the right to a fair trial; restrictions on peaceful associa-
 tion and assembly, and worker rights; and traditional cultural practices that result
 in some discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no independent con-
 fi-mations of such killings. A government report charged ethnic Nepalese dissident
 roups with responsibility for 17 murders between August 13, 1992, and June 5,
 993. Bhutan's government-controlled weekly newspaper described numerous inci-
 dents during 1992 and 1993 in which unidentified attackers killed and mutilated
 government officials and civilians living in the south. Among the victims were
 attaram Sharma, a former government official stabbed to death in August 1992,
 and Dil Maya Dungel, the daughter of a village headman who suffered gunshot
 wounds when armed men raided the family's home. A substantial but undetermined
 number of the attacks the Government has identified as incidents of terrorism ap-
 pear in fact to have been the work of armed robber gangs taking advantage of un-
 settled conditions on the Indo-Bhutan border.
 b. Disappearance.-Over the past 3 years, police and army forces have arrested
 thousands of ethnic Nepalis suspected of supporting the dissident movement, some
 of whom were held incommunicado and consequently were thought to have "dis-
 appeared." According to a 1993 government report, 1,592 accused 'antinationals"
 were subsequently released under official amnesties. Bhutanese human rights
 oups claim many other detainees outside the Thimphu area are still unaccounted
 Or and presume thespeople are being held without charge. They also charge that
 some may have been "disappeared" by  vernment security forces. The Government
 denied such disappearances ever took place and accused dissident groups of kidnap-
 ing over 200 people during the last 3 years, including 24 between August 13, 1992,
 and June 5, 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to human rights groups, there were continuing reports from ethnic Nepa-
 lese refugees in India and Nepal of hundreds of cases in which police or army forces
 had allegedly beaten, raped, and robbed suspected supporters of the dissident move-
 ment and their families. In a survey of 1,781 refugee families living in camps in
 Nepal conducted by the Human Rights Organization of Bhutan (HUROB), 204 re-
 spondents stated they had left Bhutan because a family member had been beaten
 or tortured. Twenty-one respondents claimed to have been raped, and 383 said they
 left Bhutan because they had been threatened with or feared rape. HUROB, the
 
 
 1333
 People's Forum for Human Rights Bhutan (PFHRB), and the South Asia Human
 Rights Documentation Center (SAHRDC) published dozens of affidavits from victims
 of rape and torture who fled to the refugee camps in Nepal. Several nongovern-
 mental organizations in Nepal are providing rehabilitation services to torture vic-
 tims among the ethnic Nepali refugees.
 In the aftermath of widespread arrests in 1990 and 1991, prison conditions were
 poor, with inadequate sanitation, unhealthy food, and endemic overcrowding. Sev-
 eral detainees were alleged to have succumbed to harsh prison conditions. Respond-
 ing to pressure from Amnesty International (A), the Government ended the use of
 shackles in 1992, and periodic ICRC prison visits beginning in 1993 also contributed
 to a marked improvement in conditions of detention.
 The abuses committed by government forces in southern Bhutan were a con-
 sequence of government policies intended to reduce the presence of ethnic Nepalese.
 These policies created a climate in which intimidation of ethnic Nepalese was en-
 couragd and physical abuse tacitly condoned. A 1993 survey of victims of violence
 in the refugee camps, prepared by a consultant to an international refugee agency,
 found that most alleged incidents of torture in southern Bhutan took place in 1990
 and 1991. This finding is consistent with reports that abuse by government forces
 peaked during the year following the September 1990 disturbances led by the BPP.
 The consultant found that reported rapes continued at a high rate into 1992; how-
 ever, there were few reported cases of rape and torture in 1993. The Government
 flatly denied such abuse ever occurred. Since October 1993, newly arriving refugees
 have reported incidents of intimidation and abuse which indicate another deteriora-
 tion of the situation in Bhutan. While the influx to camps has remained low, cases
 accepted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the grounds of
 persecution (as opposed to family reunion claims) have doubled to 66 percent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Bhutanese law contains no guarantees
 against arbitrary arrest. The Government said that 17 "confirmed terrorists" were
 arrested by the security forces between January 1, 1992, and May 21, 1993, and
 that another 55 "terrorists" were caught by village volunteers and handed over to
 police during the same period. The Government released no information about what
 hap ned to these detainees or when they might be tried. Past treatment of other
 such detainees suggest that their detention may be arbitrarily prolonged.
 The November 1992 session of Bhutan's National Assembly produced a new na-
 tional security law that eliminates the mandatory death penalty for treason. Gov-
 ernment officials previously cited the death penalty requirement, and their desire
 to avoid executions, as an excuse for delay in trying those held on charges related
 to the unrest in the south. In late 1992, judgments were handed down against 37
 eope charged with treason and various other "antinational" activities. Thirty-two
 dfnats were found guilty and given sentences ranging from 9 months to life in
 prison. As of late 1993, about 200 "antinationals" were still in detention pending
 trial on charges related to political unrest in southern Bhutan. Most were housed
 at a prison camp in Chemgang, a mountainous area outside Thimpu. Evidence sug-
 gests that incommunicado detention is no longer a problem.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system consists of district courts and
 a High Court in Thimpu. Minor offenses and administrative matters are adjudicated
 by village headmen. Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under a 17th-century legal code, revised in 1959, which applies to all Bhutanese re-
 gardless of ethnic origin. Judges appointed by and accountable to the King are re-
 sponsible for all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of charges, prosecu-
 tion, and judgment. After appeal to the High Court, a final appeal may be made
 to the King who traditionally delegates such matters to the Royal Advisory Council.
 The legal system does not provide for jury trials or the right to a court-appointed
 defense attorney.
 The Bhutanese legal system has no provision for lawyers or solicitors, although
 it does allow for the appointment of a jambi" (a person well-versed in the law) if
 the defendant so desires. Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and
 adoption, are resolved separately according to traditional Buddhist law for the ma-
 jority of Bhutanese and Hindu law in areas where persons of Nepalese extraction
 predominate.
 Tek Nath Rizal, an ethnic Nepali, former member of the Bhutan National Assem-
 bly and Royal Advisory Council, and founder of PFHRB, was held for over 3 years
 Rending trial. Rizal was abducted in November 1989 from eastern Nepal, where he
 ed after clashing with the King of Bhutan over ethnic Nepalese rights. The Gov-
 ernment accused Rizal of orchestrating an "antinational campaign" and on Decem-
 ber 29, 1992, formally charged him with conspiracy, sedition, and treason. Rizal
 waived his right to a jambi and defended himself at his trial. On November 16, Tek
 Nath Rizal was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment under the National
 
 
 1334
 Security Act of 1992. The Government found him guilty of violating the National
 Security Act by carrying out harmful activities against the Tsa Wa Sum (King,
 country, and people). Rizal was granted a conditional clemency on November 19
 which provides for his release as soon as the southern problem is resolved. Rizal
 is the only internationally recognized political prisoner in Rhutan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no written guarantees of privacy, but Bhutanese cultural traditions are highly
 respectful of personal privacy. These traditions were undermined by the Govern-
 ment's emphasis on promoting national intetionion. A royal decree issued in 1989
 made Drukpa national dress compulsory for all citizens. Anyone found violating the
 decree may be fined or sentenced to jail for a week. Although enforcement of the
 decree has become lax, it is still observed during business hours in southern towns
 like Phuntaholing and Geylegphug. According to human rights groups, police regu-
 larly conduct house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation
 or legal justification.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-With an adult literacy rate reliably estimated
 at around 30 percent, Rhutan's population is relatively unaffected by the print
 media. Kuensel-, the Government's weekly newspaper, with a circulation of 10,000,
 is the country's only regular publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers are
 available, but authorities confiscate and censor editions carring articles critical of
 the royal family or government policies. Bhutan has no television broadcast service.
 In 1989 the Government ordered the dismantling of about 20 television satellite
 dishes which were being used t                 a elevision transmissions from
 neighboring countries as well as through satellite technology. Many Rhutanese con-
 tinue to receive television transmissions from neighboring couintries as well as
 through satellite technology.
 The government radio station broadcasts each day in the four major national lan-
 guags (zonghathe language of the western highlands; Nepali; English; and
 cho)Indu    rect criticism of the King is permitted in the National Assembly and
 is sometimes covered in the Kuensel. Te Government banned the Nepalese lan-
 guage as a medium of instruction in Rhutanese schools at the end of 1990. Many
 schools in the south were closed in the aftermath of the 1990 disturbances or con-
 verted into army camps and detention centers. The Government reported that most
 had reopened by mid-1993, but outside observers are only able to confirm the re-
 opening of about half the schools. The ban on instruction in Nepali remains.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There ae no written guaran-
 tees of these freedoms. Bhutanese may engage in peaceful assembly and association
 only fouerposes approved by the Government. Although the Government allows
 civil andbusinesso anizations, there are no political parties. The BPP and BNDP,
 organized by ethnic mepalese exiles from Bhutan, have been labeled "terrorist and
 antinational" and according to the Government "have no standing inside the coun-
 try." Both parties advocate a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democ-
 racy and claim wide support in southern Bhutan.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the Kingdom's
 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation in the
 National Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an infuential voice on public
 policy.
 Citizens of other faiths, largely Hindus, enjoy freedom of worship but may not
 proselytize. Under hutaneselaw, conversions are illegal. The King has declared
 major Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the royal familyparticipates in
 them. Its i lleal for foreign missionaries to proselytize in the Kingdom, but inter-
 national Christian relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active as teachers and
 in other humanitarian activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Some Bhutanese enjoy onsiderable freedom of movement, but many re-
 ports indicate that ethnic Nepalis face substantial restrictions on their ability to
 travel inside lhuyan. For many years, Rhutanese seldom traveled inside or outside
 the Kingdom, but the construction of roads and the establishment of air links with
 neighboring countries have encouraged travel. Bhutan's southern border with India
 is open, and people residing in the immediate areas freely cross this border. Indians
 from other regions who enter Bhutan by airplane or stay in hotels must have visas
 and fall under the cap set by the Government limiting the admission of tourists to
 4,000 per year. By treaty, Bhutanese are free to reside and work in India.
 Since early 1988, Bhutan has sought to reduce the ethnic Nepalese population by
 implementing a 1985 act that significantly tightened the requirements for transmit-
 
 
 1335
 
 ting citizenship. Until 1985, citizenship was transmitted as long as the father was
 a Bhutanese citizen under the 1958 Nationality Law of Bhutan (which granted citi-
 zenship to all ethnic Nepalese adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for
 at least 10 years). The 1985 act raised this standard by requiring that both parents
 be Bhutanese citizens in order to transmit citizenship. Residents of Bhutan who
 could not satisfy this new requirement were retroactively declared illegal immi-
 grants.
 People losing their citizenship under the 1985 act may apply for naturalization
 but only after satisfyin a rigrous set of standards, including proficiency in the
 Dzongkha language and proofof residence in Bhutan during the previous 15 years.
 Exile political groups complain that the law makes unfair demands for documenta-
 tion on largely illiterate people in a country that has only recently adopted basic
 administrative procedures. They claim that many ethnic Nepalese whose families
 have been in Bhutan for generations were expelled because they were unable to doc-
 ument their claims to residence. The Government denies this and asserts, for exam-
 ple, that the word of village leaders is an acceptable substitute for written docu-
 mentation. Refugee groups dispute this statement and report that village elders are
 not present when citizenship interviews are carried out.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also provides for the revocation of citizenship of any nat-
 uralized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner what-
 soever to the King, country, and people of Bhutan." The Bhutanese Home Ministry,
 in a circular notification dated August 17, 1990, advised that "any Bhutanese na-
 tional leaving the country to assist and help the antinationals shall no longer be
 considered as a Bhutanese citizen . . . such people's family members living under
 the same household will also be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizenship."
 Human rits      ups charge this provision was widely used to revoke the citizen-
 ship of ethnic Nepalese who were subsequently exiled from southern Bhutan. In
 1993 growing numbers of refugees reported their citizenship was revoked under this
 provision.
 Arrivals of refugees from Bhutan in the eight camps run by the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its cooperating agencies in Nepal
 peaked during 1992. By mid-1993, arrivals had fallen to slightly more than 100 per
 month, reflecting tightened screening at the Nepalese border and an apparent re-
 duction in official pressure on the ethnic Nepalese. By September 1993, 85,000 were
 registered in the UNHCR camps, of whom about 66,000 arrived during 1992. Be-
 tween 5,000 and 15000 more are believed to have left Bhutan and settled with fam-
 ily members in India. The total outflow of approximately 100,000 people is equal
 to about 15 percent of Bhutan's population.
 Many refugees, especially those who arrived in Nepal during 1991 and 1992,
 claim to have been pressured to leave by local authorities. These pressures include
 the threat to confiscate property, denial of public services, and physical intimida-
 tion. For much of 1993, refugees reported leaving Bhutan because of increasing de-
 population in southern districts, feelings of apprehension and insecurity, the loss of
 their jobs after it was discovered that they had family members who had fled the
 country, and the wish to be reunited with relatives already living in the camps. As
 the year drew to a close, however, refugees increasingly reported incidents of perse-
 cution-including beatings, destruction of homes, and eviction at gunpoint-as the
 reason for fleeing. Expulsions appear to continue under the government circular de-
 scribed in Section 1.f. which provides for the exile of persons whose family members
 have joined the "antinational movement.
 The Government claims that those who were expelled are Nepalese or Indian citi-
 zens who came to Bhutan to work after the 1958 Nationality Law was issued. It
 also claims the majority of those arriving in Nepal have left voluntarily after selling
 their land andproperty. There are credible reports that these "voluntary emigrants
 were compelled to sign away their property by government officials. In July Nepal
 and Bhutan agreed to form a joint committee to settle the problem of the refugees.
 However, the King and other Bhutanese officials have repeatedly stated they will
 accept responsibility only for "bona ide Bhutanese nationals who have been forcibly
 evicted." Documentation requirements are to be determined by the joint committee.
 However, the Government of Bhutan has made clear that it plans to accept few re-
 patriates.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens of Bhutan do not have the right to change their government. Bhutan is
 an absolute monarchy, with sovereign power vested in the King. The Government
 has resisted democratic changes. Decisionmaking is centered in the Palace and in-
 volves only a small number of officials in the civil and eligious establishment. A]-
 
 
 1336
 though the present King and his father have made attempts to integrate women and
 some southerners (ethnic Nepalese) into the body politic, the system is still domi-
 nated by the male members of an aristocracy of  ahayana Buddist ancestr. Polit-
 ical parties do not exist, and the Government discourages their formation. The BPP,
 founded in June 1990, was outlawed the following September after widespread pro-
 tests by ethnic Nepalese in southern Bhutan. The Government claimed the BPP was
 a terrorist organization, responsible for murders, kidnapings, and destruction of gov-
 ernment property in the south. The Government also outlawed the Bhutan National
 Democratic Party (BNDP), founded in February 1992 by former government officials
 of ethnic Nepalese origin.
 The National Assembly, formed in 1953, is composed of 105 members elected by
 limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas, village headmen in Buddhist re-
 gions), 12 elected by the monastic establishment, and 33 high-level government offi-
 cials appointed by the King. Its principal functions are to enact laws, approve senior
 g overnment appointments, and advise the King on matters of national importance.
 It also provides a forum for presenting grievances and rectifying cases of maladmin-
 istration. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple majority needed to pass a meas-
 ure. The King cannot formally veto legislation, but he may return bills to the As-
 sembly for further consideration. The members occasionally have rejected the King's
 recommendations or delayed their implementation, but the King has always had
 enough influence to persuade the Assembly to approve legislation he considers es-
 sential or to withdraw proposals he opposes. Government officials may be ques-
 tioned by the Assembly, and ministers may be forced to resign by a two-thirds vote
 of no confidence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Just as it does not permit political parties, neither does the Government permit
 local human rights groups. At least three groups led by ethnic Nepalese exiles,
 HUROB, PFHRB, and the Association of Human Rights Activists - Bhutan
 (AHURA), monitor the human rights situation in southern Bhutan and collect depo-
 sitions from refugees in Nepal. These groups also campaign internationally to put
 pressure on the Bhutanese Government and conduct human rights education among
 the refugees in the camps. These groups report human rights violations by dissident
 groups but only rarely. The Government accuses HUROB, PFHRB, and AHURA of
 working for antinationals.
 The Government's attitude toward international human rights and humanitarian
 groups continued to show signs of improvement in 1993. ICRC representatives vis-
 ited prisons near Thimpu three times in 1993. The Government had an ongoing dia-
 log with Amnesty International (AI) focused on recommendations in an Al report
 issued in December 1992. These recommendations included the abolition of shackles
 establishment of a mechanism to hold security forces accountable for torture, and
 ratification of the Convention Against Torture. Although shackles appear to have
 been abandoned by government security forces, much more needs to be done. The
 Government continues to deny visas to international groups and individual inves-
 tigators.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Bhutan has developed neither a rigid caste system nor customs that se-
 quester or disenfranchise women. Family land is divided equally between sons and
 daughters, and dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic Nepalese Hindus. A Unit-
 ed Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF) study found that boys and girls in Bhutan
 receive equal treatment as regards nutrition and health care. This equality of treat-
 ment is reflected in data showing little difference between sexes in child mortality
 rates.
 Among urban Bhutanese    irls are given "equal or near equal opportunities* to
 pursue education, UNICE1   ound. This pattern of parents seeking education for
 their children, regardless of sex, appears to apply among both Hindu and Buddhist
 families. Nationwide, however, government data indicate that giris account for only
 about 40 percent of the school population. Although traditional cultural patterns
 place girls in a lower status than boys, girls are still cherished, since in Bhutanese
 society it is they who care for the parents when they reach old age.
 The sexes mix freely, and polygyny is sanctioned as long as the first wife gives
 her permission. Marriages may be arranged by partners themselves as well as by
 their parents, and divorce is common. Legislation has been enacted in recent years
 making marriage registration compulsory and favoring women in matters of ali-
 mony. About 10 percent of government employees are women. In rural areas, the
 
 
 1337
 division of labor follows strict gender lines, and women in unskilled jobs are gen-
 erally paid slightly less than men.
 Rape was made a criminal offense in Bhutan in 1953, but that law had weak pen-
 alties and was poorly enforced. The National Assembly in its July 1993 session
 adopted a revised Rape Act with clear definitions of criminal sexual assault and en-
 hanced penalties. In cases of rape involving minors (which reportedly is a growing
 problem in Bhutan), sentences range from 5 to 17 years. In extreme cases, a rapist
 may be imprisoned for life.
 The National Women's Association of Bhutan was formed by the National Assem-
 bly in 1981 to promote improvements in the socioeconomic status of women. It now
 functions as an independent nongovernmental organization.
 Children.--Children enjoy a privileged position in Bhutanes society and benefit
 from international development programs focused on maternal and child welfare.
 The Government's 1992 -year p an estimates the primary school enrollment rate
 at 66.9 percent in 1990 based on an estimated population of 104,000 children be-
 tween the ages of 6 and 12. Bhutan's health care system combines internationally
 funded medicine with traditional spiritual and ritual remedies. The child mortality
 rate in 1984 was 21.1 percent. In 1990, 84 percent of Bhutanese children had re-
 ceived required immunizations.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese first came to Bhutan in
 large numbers at the turn of the century. These migrants were granted Bhutanese
 citizenship for the first time under the Citizenship Law of 1958 (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government contends there was large-scale illegal immigration which went un-
 detected by the Government until the census carried out in 1988. The discovery that
 ethnic Nepalese were on the verge of becoming a majority prompted the Govern-
 ment to launch an aggressive campaign to reassert Bhutanese (Drupka) culture and
 tighten immigration. If no action was taken the ruling elite feared, Bhutan's Bud-
 dhist society would be overwhelmed by the hindu ethnic Nepalese, as happened in
 neighboring Sikkim (which was annexed by India in 1974).
 Early eforts at halting the unfavorable demographic trends focused on limiting
 immigration and attempting to assimilate the existing ethnic Nepalese. Attempts at
 assimilation included financial incentives for intermarriage, education for some stu-
 dents in regions other than their own, and direction of economic development funds
 to the south. By 1989 assimilation gave way to policies aimed at "Bhutanization."
 Measures intended to preserve a national identity required the wearing of Bhuta-
 nese dress, made the teaching of Dzongkha compulsory, and banned instruction in
 Nepalese. Under the 1985 Citizenship Act, tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalese
 were declared to be illegal immigrants and forcibly evicted from the country. Still
 more fled the country in the face of officially sanctioned pressure (see Sections. 1.c.
 and 2.d.).
 International pressure on Bhutan increased during 1992, as concern spread about
 the ballooning refugee population in Nepal. In response, the Government tried to
 stem the outlow of migrants from southern Bhutan. A royal decree was issued mak-
 ing it a criminal offense to forcibly evict any citizen, and three government officials
 were convicted on charges related to intimidation of ethnic Nepalese. Ethnic Nepa-
 lese also were excluded from paying rural taxes and contributing labor for develop-
 ment projects in 1992. By that time, however, the exodus had gained momentum;
 thousands of ethnic Nepalese with unquestioned claims to Bhutanese citizenship
 moved to India or the refugee camps in Nepal to be reunited with family members
 and escape a climate of fear and uncertainty in southern Bhutan.
 By law southerners may own land and establish business in the north, and north-
 erners have the same right in the south. Nonetheless, it is reportedly still difficult
 for ethnic Nepalese (except government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 Ethnic Nepalese have been required to produce "No Objection Certificates" issued
 by the police for admission to schools and for jobs. For example, a November 6 ad-
 vertisement in the national newspaper requires students seeking to enter a driving
 school to produce a "No Objection Certificate." Admission to a course for a post-
 graduate certificate in education requires a "No Objection Certificate." These certifi-
 cates continue to be required despite claims by the Government that they would be
 abandoned. In fact, these certificates are used to prevent ethnic Nepalese citizens
 from taking jobs or educational slots in many districts of Bhutan.
 Exile student groups accuse the Government of revoking the scholarships of Nepa-
 lese students who were accused of supporting the dissident movement. Government
 critics claimed families with ties to the Palace and senior levels of the Government
 are strongly favored in their access to government employment and state scholar-
 ships for foreign education. The Government contends that it has made a serious
 effort to send qualified minority candidates for education overseas. To defend its hir-
 ing practices, it cites data on government employment showing that as of 1991 near-
 
 
 1338
 1 half of the civil service was filled by ethnic Nepalese. Of 213 students sent to
 Idia for study between 1985 and 1991, it says, 127 were southern Bhutanese.
 People with Disabilities.-Bhutan has not passed legislation mandating accessibil-
 ity for the disabled. There is no evidence of official discrimination against people
 with disabilities, but neither is there evidence of official efforts to assist the dis-
 abled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Ri'ht of Association.-Trade unionism is not permitted, and Bhutan has
 no labor unions. There is no right to strike. Bhutan is not a member of the Inter-
 national Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing or legis lation addressing labor-related issues pertaining to industry, which ac-
 counts for about 25 percent of the gross domestic product but only a minute fraction
 of the total work force. The Government affects wages in the manufacturing sector
 through its control over parastatal wages.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government uses a system of
 compulsory labor taxes to compensate for its low financial tax base. Under various
 development schemes, a typical urban or rural family of 8.5 persons could be liable
 for up to 40-person days of labor each year.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There are no laws governing the
 employment of children. Children are not employed in the industrial sector, but
 many assist their families in the traditional economy. In roadbuilding, for instance,
 eligibility for employment is by height, not age. Although most workers are at least
 15 years of age, a UNICEF study suggested children as young as 11 are sometimes
 put to work with roadbuilding teams.
 e. Acceptable Conditions ofWork.-As noted above, there is no legislation address-
 ing labor issues. There is no legislated minimum wage, standard workweek, or
 health and safety standards. Labor markets are highly segmented by region, and
