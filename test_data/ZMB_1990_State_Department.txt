 ZAMBIA
 For most of 1990 Zambia remained a constitutionally
 prescribed one-party state. However, in December it
 officially became a multiparty state. The clause in the
 constitution allowing the existence of only one party, the
 United National Independence Party (UNIP), was repealed, and
 plans have been announced to hold multiparty competitive
 elections by October 1991. President Kaunda exercises
 predominant executive authority. He is advised by a Central
 Committee of party leaders and governs through a cabinet and
 parliament. All candidates for political office at any level
 were required to be members of UNIP and were screened by its
 Central Committee in advance. Under a State of Emergency
 (SOE) in effect for the past 26 years, the President has broad
 discretion to detain or restrict the movements of people, and
 law enforcement personnel have extraordinary powers to detain
 suspects and search homes.
 An active movement to promote multiparty democracy and repeal
 the State of Emergency sprang up during 1990. The Government
 initially resisted any challenge to the single party system,
 but in September, under increasing pressure, President Kaunda
 agreed to take the necessary steps to legalize political
 parties other than UNIP and to hold general elections in
 1991. In June the deteriorating economic situation and an
 increase of over 100 percent in the price of corn meal, the
 staple of the Zambian diet, led to student demonstrations,
 food riots, and looting in Lusaka and an attempted coup by a
 low-ranking officer. In reacting to these events, police,
 shopkeeper vigilante groups, and the army killed 27 people, in
 some instances through the use of excessive force.
 In response to the unrest, President Kaunda issued a July
 pardon to all political prisoners. The pardon included all
 those convicted of coup plotting or treason over the last 20
 years and over 1,000 people arrested for involvement in the
 riots, looting, and student demonstrations.
 The Zambian Police, operating under the Ministry of Home
 Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order. Divided into regular and paramilitary units, the
 Police also supervise a volunteer vigilante force. The
 Zambian Intelligence and Security Service is charged with
 intelligence and counterespionage responsibilities, while the
 armed services are used for internal security, especially at
 checkpoints and roadblocks. Abuses can be and sometimes are
 challenged in court and abusers found guilty are punished, but
 the Government only infrequently takes the initiative to
 investigate reports of abuses.
 In 1990 Zambia began the first year of a structural adjustment
 program monitored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 While the program is designed to lower inflation and boost
 incomes over the longer term, its austerity measures have the
 short-term effect of hitting the poorest hardest. Although
 donors are supporting efforts to create a social safety net,
 the poor are battered by rising prices, low incomes, and an
 inadequate social welfare infrastructure.
 The popular ferment for political and economic change resulted
 in unprecedented parliamentary and public debate, passage of
 the December legislation allowing multiple political parties,
 and the potential for a much more open political system.
 Nevertheless, abuses still occurred in the areas of torture
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 and other mistreatment of detainees, including excessively
 long detentions, the use of State of Emergency provisions in
 security cases, restrictions on freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and the right of citizens to change
 their government, and discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 A vigilante antirobbery squad affiliated with the police was
 widely believed to be responsible for the shooting deaths of
 suspected criminals and the deaths of some victims of the
 civil unrest in June. There were no government investigations
 of these activities.
 During food riots, looting, and student demonstrations in
 June, which led to the closing of the University, at least 27
 persons were killed, due to excessive use of force by the
 police and the army to quell disturbances.
 In November 1989, Ishmael Zimba, an alleged security agent of
 the Malawi Government, died in police custody. He reportedly
 had been tortured prior to his death. The authorities said a
 judicial inquiry would be made, but there was no indication
 this was ever carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of government-inspired disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there continued to be
 credible reports that police and military personnel resorted
 to excessive force when interrogating detainees-or prisoners.
 In August the chairman of the Law Association of Zambia urged
 the Government to set up an independent tribunal to
 investigate mysterious deaths of suspects in police cells and
 prisons, but the Government had taken no action by the end of
 the year.
 There were credible reports that 8 of the 34 university
 students arrested after June demonstrations were tortured
 during questioning. However, following President Kaunda's
 general amnesty for the students and others arrested during
 the unrest, no student filed a formal complaint against the
 authorities. People who are ill-treated by authorities can
 and sometimes do appeal to the judicial system for redress
 when they are aware of their rights.
 In 1990 Zambian courts tried several cases charging police or
 prison officers with mistreatment of prisoners. In June a
 Livingstone High Court judge sentenced two officers to prison
 for 3 years for a beating that caused the death of a suspect
 in police custody. In another case, two soldiers were given
 15-year jail terms for faking a road block and robbing
 motorists. In general, there are more abuses involving police
 than soldiers, and most incidents involved the use of firearms
 on civilians.
 
 
 462
 ZAMBIA
 Party militants, commonly called "vigilantes," are tasked with
 assisting the police in combating crime, black marketeering
 and smuggling. These units are frequently overzealous, and,
 in February during the.registration of party voters for ward
 elections, there were many citizen complaints of harassment
 and harsh treatment. One vigilante was fined for assault.
 Conditions in Zambian prisons are harsh, with limited medical
 facilities. In the past, foreigners imprisoned for brief
 periods have reported substandard food, overcrowding, and the
 absence of beds. These conditions have not changed and have
 resulted in a number of deaths. In May, following the deaths
 from tuberculosis of two suspects in custody, a Livingstone
 High Court judge ordered a medical doctor to visit the central
 prison to check inmates. In July a doctor confirmed that
 tuberculosis, anemia, high blood pressure, and chest
 infections were rampant in two prisons due to overcrowding,
 low protein diets, lack of water, and poor sanitation.
 According to press reports, a Member of Parliament visiting an
 open air prison in Kabwe found prisoners nearly naked or
 dressed in old sacks. An appeal was made to the Government to
 provide additional funding to prisons. By year's end,
 additional prisoners' uniforms had been issued, but available
 funds for prison reform remained severely limited, and the
 overall prison situation did not improve during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Various security laws provide broad powers of detention, and
 in practice administrative detentions are widespread. In
 regular criminal cases, a detainee must be charged and brought
 before a magistrate within 24 hours. This deadline is
 frequently missed due to police inefficiency or lack of
 transportation to bring a suspect before a magistrate. A
 January report by the Copperbelt Human Rights Committee of the
 Law Association of Zambia criticized magistrates and judges
 for failing to attend quickly to habeas corpus cases and bail
 applications, and it stated that police consistently keep
 suspects in cells for long periods before taking them to court.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PSA) gives the
 President broad discretion during a State of Emergency, in
 effect since 1964, to detain or restrict the movements of
 persons and to order that persons be arrested and detained for
 indeterminate periods. Presidential detainees are entitled to
 formal notification of the reasons for their detention within
 14 days of arrest; publication of their detention in the
 government gazette; access to counsel; frequent visitation by
 family and colleagues; immediate right to petition the
 detaining authority for release; and the right
 to seek judicial review of the detention order by an
 independent and impartial tribunal after 1 year. Although the
 tribunals meet in public, their recommendations are secret.
 The President is not legally bound to accept a tribunal's
 recommendation of release if he still believes that the
 detainee poses a threat to national security.
 In practice, detainees have been released if the judicial
 tribunal so recommended, but it is not known how commonly this
 occurs. Some detainees have been held for years without
 coming to trial. In March Prime Minister Malimba Masheke
 advised Parliament that 684 people had been detained under the
 Act between January 1975 and October 1989, of whom 72 had been
 detained for more than 2 years without appearing in courts of
 law. In 106 cases brought before courts of law, 51 were
 
 
 46
 ZAMBIA
 convicted and 55 acquitted. Another 543 were released, and 4
 died in prison of natural causes. The disposition of the
 remaining 31 cases is unknown. President Kaunda's July pardon
 of political prisoners included all of the students, looters,
 and rioters accused of inciting or participating in the June
 riots in Lusaka.
 In 1990 five persons were detained under the PSA; their
 detention was possibly related to Mozambique National
 Resistance Movement (RENAMO) cross-border attacks inside
 Zambia. Three detainees remained in prison for a 1989 attack
 on Malawian dissidents in which Mkwapatira Mhango, an exiled
 opposition leader, and nine other members of the same family
 were killed.
 The 26-year SOE gives law officers and defense personnel
 extraordinary powers. Police officers of assistant inspector
 rank and above may arrest without a warrant and detain a
 person for up to 28 days if the officer has reason to believe
 that grounds exist to justify a presidential detention order.
 In theory, police must provide the detainee with reasons for
 his detention within 14 days of arrest.
 Calls for lifting the SOE increased in 1990. In July both
 multiparty activists and Catholic bishops called for the
 lifting of the SOE prior to holding a free and fair referendum
 on whether to adopt a multiparty political system. The call
 was repeated in an August report by a special select committee
 of Parliament in its recommendations on ways to reform the
 party and the Government. However, at the end of the year,
 the Government maintained that threats to Zambia's security,
 particularly cross-border attacks on civilians by RENAMO,
 necessitated continuation of the SOE.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system consists of the Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts, of which the
 High Court is the most important. Although presidential
 detainees are not guaranteed public trial, such trials are
 usually public in the few instances when they occur. In most
 cases, presidential detainees are eventually released without
 having been tried.
 In ordinary cases, the law provides a number of protections
 for defendants, including during the conduct of
 interrogations. It provides for the right to legal
 representation at one's own expense or through legal aid; the
 right to give evidence under oath in criminal procedures; the
 right to give an unsworn statement; and the right to remain
 silent. In security cases, accused persons enjoy few of these
 protections. The President has the power to appoint and
 transfer judges, and some attorneys maintain that this fact
 sways court decisions in cases in which the executive branch
 has a particular interest. However, the Zambian judiciary has
 demonstrated some independence. In December, for example, the
 High Court ruled against the Government to affirm the
 opposition's right to hold an organizing convention.
 In a September 24 speech, President Kaunda announced Zambia's
 intention to codify the separation of the executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches in a new constitution and
 to create a new court to interpret the Constitution, but he*
 gave no timetable for doing so.
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 In July President Kaunda pardoned all political prisoners
 convicted of attempting coups in 1970, 1980, 1988, and 1990.
 Best known of the pardoned prisoners was Lt. Gen. Christian
 Tembo, former commander of the army and ambassador to Bonn
 who, with three other military officers, was charged in 1988
 with coup plotting. Another beneficiary of the presidential
 pardon was former High Court Commissioner Edward Shamwana,
 arrested in 1980 for coup plotting.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is provided for in law and is
 generally respected, except in cases relating to the SOE or to
 roundups of suspected illegal aliens and black marketeers. In
 such cases, security forces have broad powers and often enter
 the homes of suspects without search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While still subject to restrictions, the freedoms of speech
 and press were increasingly exercised in 1990. Direct
 negative comments concerning, the Head of State or the national
 philosophy ("Humanism") still may not legally be expressed in
 public, the Parliament, or the media. However, as a result of
 popular pressure and the ensuing nationwide debate on
 democratic pluralism, there was unprecedented criticism of the
 one-party system of government and its leaders, including the
 President. UNIP officials frequently responded to that
 criticism with verbal threats against multiparty advocates.
 In July, before the decision to cancel the referendum and
 legalize the opposition parties, the President threatened to
 "unleash UNIP" against multiparty advocates, whom he labeled
 "power hungry, malcontents and drug users".
 From June through September 24, multiparty advocates were
 permitted to hold mass rallies and meetings under the
 authority of a commission formed to regulate a referendum on
 whether Zambia would become a multiparty state. When the
 President announced on September 24 that a multiparty election
 would be held without a referendum, the commission was
 abolished and with it the right of opposition parties to
 assemble, since under the Constitution, UNIP was still the
 only legal political party. The section of the Constitution
 outlawing other parties was rescinded in December. It is now
 legal for the opposition to hold rallies and public meetings,
 provided a police permit is obtained. Police permits are not
 required when government officials hold similar campaign
 meetings or rallies.
 Parliament debates a wide range of political, economic, and
 social issues. A special parliamentary select committee
 recently presented the Government with a report on ways to
 make the party more responsive to the people. Although
 divergent opinions on most issues are allowed in Parliament,
 UNIP leadership tried to exclude from their ranks Members of
 Parliament who advocated a multiparty system. In November the
 High Court issued a restraining order preventing the party
 from ousting Members of Parliament who are multiparty
 sympathizers.
 Since the beginning of 1989, the two national dailies have
 been owned by a public corporation, the National Media
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 Corporation, headed by an adviser to the President.
 Television and radio are also state owned under the Zambia
 National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). In spite of its
 quasi-governmental ownership, the press generally carries a
 substantial amount of commentary critical of party and
 government performance. The print media have given
 substantial coverage to both sides of the single-party versus
 multiparty debate within the broad parameters of dissent
 tolerated by the Government. However, under ZNBC, the
 television and radio have been decidedly biased in favor of
 the Government. Opposition groups complained that they were
 unable to obtain air time to promote voter registration during
 the referendum campaign. When they are permitted, mass
 multiparty rallies in the capital and other cities receive
 scant mention in ZNBC news programs, but paid political
 announcements are aired.
 In November President Kaunda responded to what he considered
 excessive press criticism by threatening to issue new terms of
 reference regulating what could be reported about opposition
 statements and activities by the two daily newspapers
 controlled by the party and the Government. Kaunda also
 replaced both editors-in-chief. The papers continued to cover
 opposition press releases and court challenges to the
 Government. On December 17, President Kaunda publicly ordered
 the two dailies to support the party and the Government and
 oppose the opposition. The President has also ordered
 government corporations to avoid advertising in the
 church-owned Daily Mirror on the grounds that it prints lies.
 Members of the opposition Movement for Multiparty Democracy
 (MMD) have reported that government agents intimidated or
 harassed private printers who accepted contracts to print the
 MMD's newspaper The Multiparty News. The paper continued to
 appear.
 Academic freedom is respected in Zambian society, and
 educators are outspoken in their opposition to political
 influence on the educational system. However, university
 teachers and researchers are subject to the same broad
 restrictions on criticism of the President and his philosophy
 that apply to other Zambians.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 With the exception of the brief period of the referendum
 campaign, the police refused to issue permits for peaceful
 multiparty rallies on the grounds that opposition rallies were
 illegal until the Constitution was amended. The multiparty
 movement tested the government ban on rallies by attempting to
 hold an organizing convention in October. The police blocked
 the meeting. Also in October, trade union leader and
 multiparty advocate Fred Chiluba and eight others were
 arrested for unlawful assembly and belonging to an illegal
 society because they attempted to hold an MMD meeting in
 Choma. The trial has been adjourned until early in 1991.
 On December 17, President Kaunda signed a constitutional
 amendment legalizing other parties in Zambia. As 1990 ended,
 three new political parties had applied for registration.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Some religious organizations have
 publicly taken a stand on the social and political issues of
 
 
 466
 ZAMBIA
 the day. For example, the Catholic bishops issued a pastoral
 statement in July regarding Zambia's economic problems and the
 political debate in Zambia. Without directly supporting the
 reintroduction of multiparty politics, the bishops questioned
 the accountability of the single party to the population and
 endorsed a referendum as a way of bringing the people back
 into the political process.
 Zambia has no state religion, and adherence to a particular
 faith does not confer either advantage or disadvantage. The
 Government has prohibited the Jehovah's Witnesses from
 proselytizing. Nevertheless, they function openly, and their
 freedom to refrain from participating in various secular
 activities such as voting, singing the national anthem, and
 saluting the flag has been upheld in the courts and supported
 by senior party leaders. Christian missionaries from a wide
 variety of faiths operate in the country. Lay associations
 and religious youth groups operate independently of party
 control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Police roadblocks are common, and vehicles are commonly
 searched for illegal immigrants and evidence of stolen
 vehicles, poaching, and other crimes. Such activity increased
 in the wake of riots, looting, and the failed coup attempt in
 Lusaka in June. In addition, a dusk to dawn curfew was in
 effect for 4 weeks.
 The Government withholds or withdraws passports to prevent
 foreign travel by persons whose activities are considered
 inimical to Zambian interests. In a June press conference,
 President Kaunda said that possession of a passport is a
 privilege, not a right. He called several Zambians demanding
 the return of their confiscated passports "drug dealers."
 When Bishop John Mambo, national overseer of the Church of
 God, took an early stand in favor of a multiparty system and
 publicly criticized presidential advisers, he received death
 threats, was deprived of his citizenship, and was prohibited
 from traveling to the United States.
 While the majority of Zambians are subsistence farmers, about
 47 percent of the people live in urban areas, and migration to
 cities is increasing. In 1990 the President rescinded a 1989
 announcement that unemployed urban Zambians would have until
 June 30, 1990, to return voluntarily to work the land in rural
 areas before being forcibly resettled.
 Zambia hosts a large refugee and asylum seeker population,
 particularly from Angola and Mozambique. The United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there
 are approximately 133,500 refugees and asylum-seekers in
 Zambia. The largest groups of refugees are from Angola and
 Mozambique, with others from Zaire, South Africa, and
 Namibia. Those from Namibia are mainly students completing
 their education before returning home.
 .Some former members of South African liberation groups have
 been subjected to harassment by the organizations they left.
 The Government has cooperated with the UNHCR, which has been
 active in intervening to provide protection and resettlement
 for them on a case-by-case basis. However, there are reliable
 reports that the African National Congress has imprisoned
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 defectors and detainees. The Government routinely denies that
 this problem exists.
 In May Zambia received an influx of Zairian student refugees
 fleeing security forces at the University of Lubumbashi.
 Again the Government worked closely with the UNHCR to improve
 security at the refugee camp given student fears of abduction
 and forcible repatriation of the students by Zairian security
 forces.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 At the close of 1990, Zambian citizens did not yet have the
 ability to change their form of government. Under the
 Constitution, UNIP was the sole, legal political party until
 December 17. The Government initially resisted popular
 agitation for economic and political change. However, in
 September President Kaunda announced that Zambia would become
 a multiparty state. In December the Parliament passed and the
 President signed the constitutional amendment legalizing
 opposition political parties. Multiparty presidential and
 parliamentary elections are planned to be held before October
 1991.
 Power is still concentrated in the hands of the President as
 leader of the ruling party and Head of State. He plays a
 dominant role in determining the membership of Zambia's top
 executive institutions, including the party Central Committee
 and the Cabinet, which traditionally contain a general
 regional and tribal balance. This is also the case with the
 heads of the economically dominant state-owned corporations.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the party and are subject to close examination by the
 Central Committee. In practice, the political system has been
 open to persons of somewhat divergent views provided they have
 been willing to work within'the one-party structure and not
 challenge the President's preeminence.
 Earlier in the year, the President had called for a
 referendum on the merits of a multiparty political system (see
 Section 2.a.). In October members of a constitutional
 commission, appointed by the President, began hearings to
 establish a system of political pluralism; the commission's
 recommendations are due in early 1991. The two multiparty
 advocates, who were appointed by the President to the
 22-member commission, declined to participate on the grounds
 that the commission was biased in favor of UNIP.
 Theoretically, the National Assembly is equal to the President
 in power and importance. However, following the October 1988
 general election, the President moved to curb the independence
 of the newly elected National Assembly. In a break with
 tradition, members were sworn in by the President at the State
 House instead of by the Speaker at the National Assembly
 buildings, as had been the practice. At the ceremony, the
 President stated that unwarranted criticism would not be
 tolerated and stressed that the National Assembly's principal
 purpose is to implement party policy through the drafting of
 legislation. -Despite these efforts, there was extensive
 criticism of party and government policies in the Parliament
 in 1990, and a special parliamentary select committee prepared
 a report aimed at limiting some of the powers of the President
 and the party, while enhancing the powers of the Parliament.
 
 
 468
 ZAMBIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or
 visits by human rights organizations. However, the President
 and the Prime Minister on several occasions rejected
 multiparty advocates' calls for international observers to
 monitor the referendum campaign and voting procedures. The
 Zambian Law Association's Citizen Advice Bureau and the
 African Bar Association seek to address grievances of a human
 rights nature.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of almost 8 million comprises more than 70
 Bantu-speaking tribal groupings. Economic and social needs
 are met on a generally nondiscriminatory basis.
 By law, women are entitled to full equality with men. In
 practice, while they participate increasingly in Zambia's
 social, economic, and political life and are gaining
 representation in the professions and higher education, they
 remain in a subordinate position in many ways. Zambian women
 are a major component of the rural work force. Customary law
 and practice, in contradiction to Zambia's Constitution and
 codified laws, place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage.
 Under traditional customs, all rights to inherit property
 rested with the deceased man's family. The widow and her
 children were entitled to nothing. The Intestate Succession
 Act, passed in 1989, guarantees widows a 20-percent share and
 children a 50-percent share in the inheritance of a deceased
 man's property. Despite this legal provision, the
 Investigator General declared in April that ignorance, apathy,
 and fear render the provisions of this law ineffective.
 According to the 1980 census, the percentage of literacy among
 Zambians above the age of 15 is 75.4 percent for males and
 53.1 percent for females. In employment, Zambian men and
 women receive equal pay for equal work. However, there is no
 legal redress for women who are refused employment on the
 basis of their sex. Before July unmarried women and all men
 had housing benefits that were denied in practice to married
 women. In July the Government extended this right to married
 women. However, shortly thereafter, this benefit was again
 withdrawn from married women and is now a matter of dispute
 between unions and the Government.
 Divorce laws are applied to men and women equally. There are
 no reliable statistics on the extent to which violence against
 women, including wife beating, occurs. Domestic assault is a
 criminal offense, but in practice police are often reluctant
 to pursue reports of wife beating or other forms of abuse.
 According to women's rights advocates, nondomestic violence
 against women is not generally tolerated by traditional or
 civil authorities. Victims usually report attacks, and legal
 action is taken. In crimes against women where rape, serious
 injury, or death occurs, men--including husbands--can receive
 sentences up to. and including, the death penalty.
 
 
 'ZAMBIA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of the copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 large national unions, organized by
 industry or profession (only one union per industry is legal),
 are all members of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU),
 the sole legal confederation under the Industrial Relations
 Act. At year's end, the President was expected to sign the
 new Industrial Relations. Act of 1990. When it becomes law,
 all unions will cease to be members of the ZCTU. All future
 affiliat.ons-by existing unions or new unions to the ZCTU,
 which under the new Act will remain the sole legal
 confederation, must be made by a two-thirds majority vote of
 union members.
 The ZCTU is democratic and regularly conducts open elections
 to select its leadership. It is not controlled by the party
 or the Government, and union leaders frequently criticize
 government policy on such subjects as wages, economic policy,
 conditions of service, and labor representation in party and
 government organs.
 Since December 1989, the ZCTU has spoken in favor of the
 reintroduction of multiparty politics, and some union leaders
 are also leaders of the multiparty movement. The Secretary
 General of UNIP and the Prime Minister publicly accused the
 ZCTU of using workers' money to support reintroduction of the
 multiparty system. The officials threatened to cancel the
 automatic union dues deduction system in retaliation.
 Multiparty-minded attorneys responded by calling for the
 arrest of the two officials for harassment and intimidation of
 their clients, a breach of referendum regulations. In
 September President Kaunda announced plans to allow multiple
 unions per industry and break up the monopoly of the ZCTU.
 Deteriorating economic conditions and sharp increases in the
 cost of living led to widespread labor unrest in 1990.
 Throughout the year, teachers, bank workers, motor trade
 workers, brewers, millers, and miners were among the groups
 that mounted boycotts, "go-slows," and strikes. Under
 existing legislation, strikes are permitted only after all
 other recourse has been exhausted. In practice, virtually all
 strikes are illegal, since they almost always commence before
 the mandatory process of mediation has run its course. The
 Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once they have begun. Most strikes
 have terminated with increased wage settlements and without
 government action against the unions. The ZCTU is a member of
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The ZCTU's right to organize and bargain collectively with
 employers is codified under regulations in the Industrial
 Relations Act (IRA). These rights are respected in practice.
 The IRA provides a mechanism for initiating and settling
 worker-employer disputes and establishes the Industrial
 Relations Court. Union rights against management interference
 or discrimination have been readily upheld by the Court.
 In November, in the 1991 budget speech, the Minister of
 Finance announced that customs free zones would be instituted
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 in Zambia in 1991. At the end of 1990, there was no
 information available on how labor laws or rights to organize
 and bargain collectively will apply to the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor are
 prohibited by the Constitution. Generally, these prohibitions
 are observed. However, committees of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) have noted for a number of years that
 various legislative provisions are incompatible with ILO
 Convention 105 on forced labor. The provisions in question
 include those that impose imprisonment, involving forced
 labor, for expressing certain political views or for engaging
 in political activities outside UNIP as a means of labor
 discipline or as a punishment for having participated in
 strikes. In 1989 an ILO direct contacts mission to Zambia
 took place to help it bring its legislation into conformity
 with the Convention. Most of the legislative changes
 recommended by the ILO were enacted in 1990.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age is 15. This and other age restrictions
 apply to the industrial sector, where, because of adult
 unemployment, there are few employees under age 15. The Labor
 Commissioner effectively enforces the law in industry. There
 is, however, little enforcement for the vast majority of
 Zambians who work in the subsistence agricultural and domestic
 service sectors, where persons under age 14 are often
 employed. In May the Labor Commissioner confirmed that the
 number of children working has grown since independence due to
 Zambia's poor economic situation.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In August the Government set the minimum monthly wage rate for
 all employees except professionals at approximately $28. All
 employees are also entitled to a housing allowance of not less
 than 25 percent of the basic wage, about $2 per month lunch
 allowance, and a $6 minimum transport allowance. However,
 each industry can also set its own minimum wage rates above
 the legal floor through collective bargaining. In industries
 where collective bargaining is not effective, the Minister of
 Labor and Social Services sets the minimum wage rate for
 employees in positions such as delivery assistants, general
 workers, and office orderlies. A minimum wage for sales
 representatives is about $38.75 per month.
 These "minimums" are insufficient to provide an adequate
 standard of living. Most Zambian workers must supplement
 their incomes through second jobs, some subsistence farming,
 or reliance on the extended family. The normal workweek is 40
 hours, but this is not a legal maximum. The legal maximum
 workweek for nonunionized workers is 48 hours. The minimum
 for full time employment is 40 hours. Maximum limits for
 'unionized workers vary. For example, the legal maximum for
 unionized guards is 72 hours per week. There are legal
 requirements for annual leave (2 days per month of service)
 and maternity leave (90 days). However, the Women's Rights
 Committee has noted that this particular provision is flouted
 by employers, including the Government, who either allow fewer
 days of maternity leave or deduct it from annual accrued
 leave. The Committee also noted that women tend to be
 discriminated against regarding payment of the housing

 allowance, with employers often illegally linking it to
 women's marital status. Women are legally excluded from night
 work and a variety of hazardous occupations.
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards in
 any industrial undertaking. In January the ZCTU expressed
 concern over the Government's silence about the failure of
 employers to observe industrial health regulations. The
 Office of the Investigator General exists to redress the
 excessive use or abuse of power by government officials
 against their subordinates. This Office's effectiveness is
 limited by understaffing, but it is not involved in enforcing
 industrial safety. Mine safety is handled by the Department
 of Mines;. factory safety is handled by the Inspector of
 Factories under the Minister of Labor. Staffing problems
 chronically limit enforcement effectiveness.
