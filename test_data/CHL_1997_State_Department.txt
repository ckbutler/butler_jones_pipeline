 CHILE
 Chile is a multiparty democracy with a constitution that provides for a strong ex-
 ecutive, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Approved by referen-
 dum in 1980 and amended in 1989, the Constitution was written under the former
 military government and establishes institutional limits on popular rule. President
 Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat, began his 6-year term in 1994. The National
 Congress comprises 120 deputies and 47 senators. The government coalition of six
 parties holds a majority in the lower house. An opposition coalition, together with
 several independent and eight appointed senators, controls the upper chamber.
 Under the Constitution, former president General Augusto Pinochet must retire
 from the army by March 11, 1998. He mad then assume his lifetime seat in the Sen-
 ate, which he has announced he would do. General Pinochet's appointees continue
 to influence the constitutionally independent judicial branch. However, turnover in
 the courts has led to a significant diminution of that influence.
 The armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the President through an ap-
 d Minister of Defense but enjoy a large degree of legal autonomy. Most nota-
 h  President must have the concurrence of the National Secuit      Council,
 which comprises military and civilian officials, to remove service chiefs. The
 Carabineros (the uniformed national police) have primary responsibility for public
 order and snfety and border security. The civilian Investigations Police are respon-
 sible for criminal investigations and immigration contro. Both organations-al-
 though formally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense, which determines
 their budgets-are under operational control of the Ministry of Interior. Some al-
 leged perpetrators of human rights abuses during the military regime remain on ac-
 tive duty in the army. The security forces committed a number of human rights
 abuses.
 The export-led, free-market economy experienced its 14th consecutive year of ex-
 pansion. The most important export remained copper; salmon, forestry products,
 fresh fruit, fish meal, and manufactured goods were also significant sources of for-
 eign exchange. Gross domestic -product grew at a 7.2 percent rate, unemployment
 increased slightly to 6.5 percent, and inflation fell to 6.6 percent. From 1987 to
 1997, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line decreased from
 45 to 23 percent, according to a government study released in July. Annual per cap-
 ita gross domestic product rose to $5,000 in 1996.
 The Government generally respected its citizens' human rights. However, there
 continued to be some problem areas. The most serious cases involved allegations of
 torture, brutality, and use of excessive force by the police. There continued to be re-
 ports of physical abuse in jails and prisons. Discrimination and violence against
 women and violence against children are problems. Many indigenous people remain
 marginalized.
 Almost all other human rights concerns are related to abuses during the former
 military government, primarily between 1973 and 1978. Efforts to bring abusers to
 justice in cases dating back to the early years of the military government are lim-
 ited by the conflicting demands for justice and for national reconciliation. Military
 authorities continued t resist disclosing abuses from the past. In particular, the
 courts continued to struggle with the application of the 1978 Amnesty Law to cases
 that occurred during the first 5 years of military rule. Over the past 3 years, the
 Government and opposition parties debated various proposals that would effectively
 close all cases covered by th~e Amnesty Law that are still under judicial investiga-
 
 
 tion. These efforts have largely stalled, and the judicial system continues to inves-
 tigate and close pending human rights cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 On Chiloe-Island, the authorities suspended two Carabineros from duty pending
 a determination of their role in the September 14 beating death of Ramon Ruiz
 Mansilla.
 Pedro Soto Tapia, a 19-year-old military conscript, disappeared from his regiment
 at San Felipe on December 15, 1996, after having repeatedly written letters to his
 family describing mistreatment at the hands of his superior officers. On March 15,
 his remains were found in a cave in San Felipe, accompanied by what was purport-
 edly a suicide note. The Valparaiso Court of Appeals closed the case on Au st 18
 without the cause or circumstances of Sato's death having been established. In Sep-
 tember Soto's mother succeeded in having the case reopened; the family's attorneys,
 assisted by the Committee for the Defense of People's Rights (CODEPU), seek to
 prove that Soto's death was a homicide.
 The Government is seeking the extradition from Switzerland of a terrorist who
 escaped from prison in December 1996; he was convicted of killing a police officer
 (see Section 1.c.)
 In January the family of Carmelo Soria Espinoza, a Spanish employee of the Unit-
 ed Nations who was kidnaped and murdered in 1976, announced its intention to
 pursue a denial of justice claim before the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR). (Other denial of justice claims involving execution cases also are
 pending (see Section 1.b.) The Chilean Supreme Court had suspended the Soria
 murder case in June 1996 by invoking Chile's amnesty law; subsequent impeach-
 ment motions against four Supreme Court justices failed in the lower house of Con-
 gress. Proceedings against General Augusto Pinochet continue to move forward in
 a Spanish court for his alleged responsibility in Soria's death as well as those of
 the priests Joan Alsina and Antonio Llido. In November President Frei decided not
 to approve the promotion to brigadier general of former intelligence officer Jaime
 Lepe Orellana, who was reportedly involved in the murder of Soria.
 During the year, a Spanish court began collecting witnesses' statements and docu-
 mentary evidence attesting to other human rights violations committed by Chilean
 officials against Spanish citizens between 1973 and 1990, including crimes allegedly
 ordered by then-President Pinochet. Regardless of whether a person benefits from
 amnesty provisions in Chile, the court seeks to try in Spsin those former officials
 who are suspected of having murdered, tortured, or to be responsible for the dis-
 appearance of Spanish citizens. However, Chile does not extradite its nationals.
 Former Chilean intelligence- agent Enrique Arancibia Clavel continued to be de-
 tained in Argentina for his alleged involvement in the 1974 assassination in Buenos
 Aires of former Chilean army chief Carlos Prats and his wife Sofia Cuthbert. Prats
 was the army commander under President Salvador Allende and was succeeded by
 General Pinochet in August 1973. Prats left Chile for Argentina several days after
 the coup against Allende. The case was reopened in 1992 as a result of a petition
 filed by the Prats family containing new evidence. The Government of Chile has
 agreed to be a coplaintiff in the Argentine trial of Arancibia.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The major human rights controversy involved past disappearances and efforts by
 political forces and the Government to reinterpret the 1978 Amnesty Law in such
 a way as to achieve both justice and national reconciliation. As interpreted under
 the so-called Aylwin Doctrine (named after former president Patricio Aylwin), the
 courts should not close a case involving a disappearance until either the body is
 found or credible evidence is provided to indicate that an individual is dead. This
 could affect up to 542 cases, which cover about 1,100 persons still classified as "de-
 tained or missing" from the early years of the military regime. However, application
 of the Aylwin Doctrine has been uneven, as some courts continue the previous prac-
 tice of applying the 1978 amnesty to disappearances without conducting an inves-
 tigation to identify the perpetrators. According to an Amnesty International report
 released in June, civilian and military courts closed 21 disappearance cases in 1996.
 During the first half of 1997, the courts closed 8 cases through application of the
 Amnesty Law; kept more than 150 cases active; and temporarily closed approxi-
 mately 350 cases, subject to being-reopened.
 In July Amnesty International reported death threats the previous month against
 Mariana Guzman Nunez, Sola Sierra, and Viviana Diaz Caro of the nongovern-
 
 
 mental human rights group Association of Relatives of Disappeared Prisoners; Ms.
 Sierra is the Association's President.
 The Social Aid Foundation of Christian Churches (FASIC), the CODEPU, and
 other human rights organizations have a total of 31 denial of justice cases pending
 before the IACIR regarding previously closed disappearance and execution cases.
 Eight cases have been filed before  e  nited Nations Committee on Human Rights.
 InMarch the IACHR ruled that four previously closed disappearance cases that had
 been appealed to the Commission should be reopened.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradinq, Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids "the use of illegal pressure, on detainees, but CODEPU
 has received reports of instances of mistreatment and abuse by both the
 Carabineros and the Investigations Police. When requested by other human rights
 organizations or family members, CODEPU lawyers visit detainees during their in-
 terrogation (see Section 1.d.) and represent many suspected terrorists in court. The
 CODEPU continues to investigate alleged use of excessive force against detainees.
 The Minister of Interior normally asks the courts to conduct independent investiga-
 tions of credible complaints of police abuse, but such investigations rarely result in
 arrests, due in part to the reluctance of judges to pursue the issue vigorously. The
 courts convicted and sentenced only four police officials for committing acts of vio-
 lence against detainees.
 According to a report released by Amnesty International in June, governmental
 organizations notified the national police of more than 20 cases of torture and mal-
 treatment by the police in 1996.
 According to a special 1996 United Nations report, while considerable progress
 had been made since the return to civilian rule in 1990, acts of torture still con-
 tinue. A 1996 study by Diego Portales University indicated that 71 percent of de-
 tainees interrogated had suffered some form of mistreatment. U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on Torture Nigel Rodley concluded that, although abuses are not sys-
 termc, the Government has taken insufficient action to ensure that the activities of
 the national police are in accord with the law. He recommended that the national
 police be entirely subordinated to the Ministry of Interior.
 In August attorneys for Carmen Gloria Quintana appealed efforts by the Govern-
 ment to set aside an award of approximately $600,000 in compensation that the
 IACHR had recommended for Quintana in 1988. Army Captain Pedro Fernandez
 Dittus set fire to Quintana and her com panion Rodrigo Rojas Denegri while they
 were participating in a protest against the military regime in 1986. Rojas died 4
 days later, while Quintana survived with severe and disfiguring injuries.
 Prisons are overcrowded and antiquated, but the conditions are not life threaten-
 ing. Food meets minimal nutritional needs, and prisoners may supplement the diet
 by buying food. Those with sufficient funds can often rent space in a better wing
 of the prison. Prison guards have been accused of using excessive force to stop at-
 tempted prison breaks. Although most reports state that the guards generally be-
 have responsibly and do not mistreat prisoners, several prisoners have complained
 of beatings. There are about 300 minors in adult prisons (see Section 5).
 The maximum security prison houses approximately 75 prisoners, most of them
 charged with or convicted of terrorism. Prisoners continue to complain that strict
 security measures, prohibition of visitors, hidden cameras, and rigid regulations vio-
 late their rights. In 1996 the president of the Santiago Court of Appeals confirmed
 the existence of listening devices in prison cells. In response, the Minister of Justice
 confirmed that microphones were present but said that they were never used.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution allows civilian and mili-
 tary courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arraignment and to extend
 the detention of suspected terrorists for up to 10 days. The law affords detainees
 30 minutes of immediate and subsequent daily access to a lawyer (in the presence
 of a prison guard) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. The law does
 not permit a judge to deny such access; police authorities generally observe these
 requirements.
 As of September, 5 percent of the general prison population of approximately
 24,000 were under investigation but not charged with a crime; 44 percent were
 charged with an offense and were awaiting trial or had been convicted and were
 awaiting sentencing; and 51 percent were serving sentences.
 The police have the authority to make arrests based on suspicion, which is applied
 particularly to youths in high crime areas late at night. In practice, many detainees
 are not promptly advised of charges against them, nor are they granted a speedy
 hearing eore a judge. The Constitution provides for the right to legal counsel, but
 this is a reality only for those who can afford to pay. The poor, who account for the
 majority of cases, may be represented by law students doing practical training (who
 
 
 are often overworked) or on occasion by a court-appointed lawyer. Arrest procedures
 do not require police to allow detainees to telephone relatives or a lawyer. The Con-
 stitution allows judges to set bail.
 Law enforcement authorities more frequently informed foreign embassies when
 their nationals were arrested, but occasional lapses still occurred.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for a judicial system inde-
 pendent of the other branches of government. Although the judiciary, and particu-
 larly the Supreme Court, has been dominated by appointees of the former military
 -regime, the passage of time is changing this legacy.
 Cases decided in the lower courts can be referred to appeals courts and ultimately
 to the Supreme Court. Criminal court judges are appointed for life; the President
 makes appointments to the Supreme Court and the appeals courts from lists pre-
 pared by the Supreme Court. Of the 16 justices on the Supreme Court, 7 have been
 appointed since the end of the military regime. The Supreme Court continues to
 work with the other branches of government on brad judicial reform.
 In September President Frei signed the Judicial Reform  Law, creating an Attor-
 ney General and related ministry that are expected to be in full operation by 2003.
 The new law provides that national and regional prosecutors investigate crimes and
 formulate charges, leaving judges and magistrates the narrower function of judging
 the merits of evidence presented before them.
 The jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to cases involving military person-
 nel. If formal charges are filed in civilian courts against a member of the military,
 including the national police, the military prosecutor asks for, and the Supreme
 Court normally grants, military jurisdiction. This is of particular consequence in the
 human rights cases dating from 1973 to 1978, the period covered by the 1978 Am-
 nesty Law. In addition, military courts have the authority to charge and try civil-
 ians for defamation of military personnel and for sedition, but their rulings can be
 appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Based on the Napoleonic Code, the judicial system does not provide for trial by
 jury, nor does it assume innocence until proven otherwise. Criminal proceedings are
 inquisitorial rather than adversarial. The Constitution provides for the right to legal
 counsel, but the poor do not always get effective legal representation (see Section
 1.d.).
 Four ringleaders of the terrorist Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR) broke
 out of Santiago's maximum-security prison on December 30, 1996, in an elaborately
 orchestrated escape via helicopter. In early September, one of the escapees, Patricio
 Ortiz Montenegro, requested political asylum in Switzerland, claiming he could not
 obtain justice in Chile. (In June 1995, a military court convicted Ortiz of the 1991
 murder of a police officer and sentenced him to a 10-year prison term.) Chilean au-
 thorities are seeking Ortiz' extradition from Switzerland, where he was detained at
 year's end.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although among the approximately
 75 inmates in Santiago's maximum-security prison, those who have been convicted
 of terrorist acts routinely claim to be political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions. A 1995 pri-
 vacy law bars obtaining information by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts,
 and other surreptitious means, as well as the dissemination of such information, ex-
 cept by judicial order in narcotics-related cases.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. The
 press maintains its independence, criticizes the Government, and covers issues sen-
 sitive to the military, including human rights.
 The print and electronic media are largely independent of government control.
 The State is majority owner of La Nacion newspaper, but it is editorially independ-
 ent. However, La Nacion's editorial policy rarely disagrees with government policy.
 The Television Nacional network is state-owned but not under direct government
 control. It receives no government subsidy and is self-financing through commercial
 advertising. It is editorially independent and is governed by a board of directors
 that, although politically appointed, encourages the expression of varied opinions
 over the network.
 It is a criminal offense to besmirch the honor of state institutions and symbols,
 such as the Congress, the military services, the flag, and the President. Military
 
 
 courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for defamation of military per-
 sonnel and for sedition, but their rulings can be appealed to the Supreme Court.
 In December 1996, Congress passed a privacy law that set penalties for those who
 infringe on the private and public life of individuals and their families. At the time
 of the laws passage, journalists argued vigorously that applying it to media report-
 ing would have a chilling effect on freedom of the press. To date, this privacy law
 has not been applied to the media, although there have been unsuccessful attempts
 to incorporate similar language and penalties into a draft press law. The proposed
 legislation was first introduced to Congress by the Aylwin government in July 1993.
 As introduced, the bill's intent was to codify media rights and to replace the out-
 moded 1968 Abuses of Publicity Law still in force.
 The 1980 Constitution established a Film Classification Council (CCC), with the
 power of prior censorship. The Council has banned 52 films and nearly 700 videos.
 In November 1996, the Council lifted its 1989 ban on the film "The Last Temptation
 of Christ." However, Chile's Future, a conservative organization supported by the
 Catholic Church, challenged the CCC decision in a court of appeals and obtained
 a temporary restraining order prohibiting the film's showing. In June the Supreme
 Court upheld the ban. The authorities subsequently arrested three people in Punta
 Arenas for organizing a public viewing of the film. The Government expressed dis-
 appointment at the Supreme Court's ruling and is attempting to abolish the CCC
 through constitutional reform.
 The National Television Council (CNT), created by legislation in 1989 and sup-
 ported with government funding, is charged with assuring that television program-
 ming "respects the moral and cultural values of the nation." The CNT's principal
 role is to regulate both broadcast and cable television programming content based
 on violence and sexual explicitness. Films and other programs judged by the CNT
 to be excessively violent or to have obscene language or sexually explicit scenes can
 be shown only after 10 p.m. when the "family viewing hours" end. In practice, the
 ever-increasing volume of programming makes the CNT's job all but impossible. The
 CNT issues occasional warnings to networks and sometimes obliges them to post-
 pone the showing of certain films until after 10 p.m. Debate continues over the
 CNT's role.
 The courts rarely prohibit media coverage of cases in progress. In June lower
 court judge Beatriz Pedrals imposed a 3-month restraining order against media re-
 porting on the investigation of official protection and money laundering against Car-
 os Mario Leiva. However, the Court of Appeals overturned the restraining order,
 ruling that the Constitution's protection of freedom of speech superseded the 1968
 Abuses of Publicity Law under which the ban was invoked.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All denominations practice their faiths
 without restriction. Although church and State are officially separate, the Roman
 Catholic Church receives official preferential treatment. Chile's 1-2 million Protes-
 tants assert that the Government discriminates against them, based upon differing
 legal status afforded to non-Catholics. They cite the absence of Protestant armed
 forces chaplains, difficulties for pastors to visit military hospitals, and the predomi-
 nantly Catholic religious education in public schools. To remedy this situation, the
 lower house of Congress unanimously approved a bill to afford greater legal equality
 among all churches, but a Senate committee postponed further discussion on it until
 the new Congress convenes in March 1998. A 1995 Santiago municipal ordinance
 making it illegal to cause disturbances in the streets has been interpreted by some
 evangelical groups as designed to prevent them from proselytizing and preaching in
 public; however, there were no known cases of the law being enforced in this man-
 ner.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. For minor children to leave the country, either
 alone or with only one of their parents, they must have notarized permission from
 both parents.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of the
 provision of first asylum has not arisen. There were no reports of forced return of
 persons to a country where they feared persecution.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens have the right to change their
 government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens 18
 years of age and over. The Government still operates under some political restraints
 that were imposed by the previous regime. Under the 1980 Constitution various na-
 tional institutions-including the President, the Supreme Court, and the armed
 forces-dominated National Security Council-appoint an additional nine senators
 (beyond those elcted) to 8-year ternis. The terms of these Senators, appointed by
 then-President Pinochet, expired in 1997. Nine newly appointed institutional sen-
 ators are to take their seats in March 1998, as will former President Pinochet. The
 legislative branch, with the exception of the institutional senators, is freely elected
 and independent from the executive branch.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after losing a referendum on whether General Pinochet should sta
 in office as president. It provides for a strong presidency and a legislative branch
 with limited powers. In addition, it includes provisions designed to protect the inter-
 ests of the military and the rightwing political Opposition. These provisions include
 limitations on the President's right to remove military service chiefs, including chief
 of the army (the position General Pinochet can hold until March 11, 1998); an elec-
 toral system that gives the second-place party (or coalition) in each district dis-
 proportionate representation in Congress; and the provision for nonelected institu-
 tional senators. The Government has pledged to amend these provisions, which it
 sees as "authoritarian enclaves" left over from the previous regime; the opposition
 has pledged to fight to retain what it views as important checks and balances in
 the system of government.
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1934 and in na-
 tional elections since 1949 and are active in political life at the grassroots level.
 Women make up a majority of registered voters and of those who actually cast bal-
 lots, but few women are in leadership positions. Fourteen women serve among the
 120 deputies, 2 women were in the 46-seat Senate (including one of the appointed
 Senators) and 3 of 21 cabinet ministers are women. The level of female participation
 in government is not increasing marked]y.
 The over 1 million indigenous people have the legal right to participate freely in
 the political process, although relatively few are politically active. Only one member
 of Congress is of indigenous descent. The National Corporation for Indigenous De-
 velopment was created in 1994, and indigenous people directly elected representa-
 tives to this body in 1995. It advises and directs government programs that assist
 the economic development of indigenous people.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Chilean Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization (NGO),
 is affiliated with the International League of Human Rights and gathers evidence
 of police abuses. The CODEPU provides legal counsel to those accused of politically
 related crimes and to victims of human rights abuses. Local NGO's say that the
 Government cooperates with their efforts to investigate accusations of-human rights
 violations. Many international NGO's also closely follow human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law, but it does not specifically
 ban discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or social status.
 Wonen.-The public is only beginning to appreciate the extent of physical abuse
 of women. The National Women's Service (SENAM), created in 1991 to combat dis-
 crimination against women, found in a 1996 study of more than 12,000 reports of
 domestic violence that 3 years after the Law on Intra-Family Violence went into ef-
 fect, only one in five accusations resulted in judicial action. The study indicated that
 spouses or domestic partners were responsible for 88 percent of family violence and
 that 63 percent of the reports represented physical attacks. The study showed that
 in nearly three-quarters of reported cases of domestic violence, the accusation led
 to a positive change in the domestic situation regardless of the judicial outcome.
 SENAM also conduted courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of
 domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities.
 The courts may order counseling for those involve in intrafamily violence. In 1996
 there were 57,939 civil court cases of domestic violence. In 1994 (latest data avail-
 able) there were 2,281 reported cases of rape. A 100-year-old law states that if a
 rapist ask the rape victim to marry him and she accepts, he will not be sentenced
 
 
 for the crime, although it remains on his criminal record. SERNAM is working to
 have this law abolished.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a 1989 decision to give
 precedence over national laws to treaties to which Chile is a party. The law permits
 legal separation but not divorce, so those who wish to remarry must seek annul-
 ments. Since annulment implies that a marriage never existed under the law,
 former spouses are left with little recourse for financial support. Although a recent
 law created conjugal property as an option in a marriage, some women saw this as
 a step backward, since the law on separate property (which still exists) gives women
 the right to one-half their husbands' assets but gives husbands no right to assets
 of a wife. In the face of heavy opposition from the Catholic Church, the Chamber
 of Deputies approved a divorce bill in September;, the bill was awaiting action in
 the Senate at year's end.
 Another SERNAM study found that the average earnings of female heads of
 household are only 71 percent of those of male heads of household. Women with no
 schooling averaged a salary that was 87 percent of that of their male counterparts
 without schooling, while female heads of household with university training aver-
 aged only 57 percent as much as their male contemporaries. The SERNAM has a
 pilotprogram providing occupational training and child care in an effort to alleviate
 this disparity.
 Children.-The Government provides free education through high school; edu-
 cation is compulsory from first to eighth grade. A 1996 survey by the National Mi-
 nors Service indicated that sexual abuse of minors occurs but that few cases are re-
 ported. A September 1996 United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) report stated
 that 34 percent of children under 12 years of age experience serious physical vio-
 lence, although only 3.2 percent of the victims of intra-family violence reported to
 the national police family affairs unit were below the age of 18. A 1994 Law on
 Intra-Family Violence was designed in part to deal with this problem. According to
 UNICEF, some form of corporal punishment is used by one or both parents in 62
 percent of households. UNICEF estimates that approximately 107,000 children be-
 tween the ages of 12 and 19 are in the work force (see Section 6.d.).
 Investigations of child abuse within Colonia Dignidad, a secretive German-speak-
 ing settlement 400 kilometers south of Santiago, received widespread publicity
 throughout the year. The 34,000-acre enclave inhabited by 350- colonists is domi-
 nated by 76-year-old Paul Sehafer, who immigrated from Germany in 1961 with 300
 followers. After allegations by a number of local teenage boys of sexual abuse at the
 hands of Schafer, police armed with a search warrant as well as a warrant for
 Schafer's arrest raided the compound in June, but at year's end had not been able
 to apprehend him despite continued efforts.
 By law juvenile offenders (i.e., those under the age of 18) are segregated from
 adult prisoners. The Government has reduced the number of minors in adult prisons
 from 6,630 in 1992 to around 300 in 1996.       i
 People With Disabilities.--Congress passed a law in 1994 to promote the integra-
 tion of people with disabilities into society, and the National Fund for the Handi-
 capped (FONDIS) has a $1.5 million budget. The 1992 census found that 288,000
 citizens said that they had some form of disability, but FONDIS estimates that the
 actual number is closer to 1 million About 400,000 citizens are considered mentally
 disabled. The disabled still suffer some forms of legal discrimination; for example,
 blind people cannot become teachers or tutors. Although the law requires that new
 public buildings provide access for the disabled, the public transportation system
 oes not make provision for wheelchair access, and a new subway line in the
 Santiago metropolitan area provides no- facilitated access for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Less than 10 percent of the population is classified as indige-
 nous. The Mapuches from the south comprise over 90 percent of the indigenous pop-
 ulation, but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche, Rapa Nui, and
 Kawaskhar populations in other parts of the country. A committee composed of rep-
 rsentatives of indigenous grqups participated in drafting the 1993 law that recog-
 nizes the ethnic diversity of the indigenous population and gives indigenous people
 a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions. It provides for
 eventual bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations, replacing a
 statute that emphasized assimilation of indigenous people. However, out of the pop-
 ulation that identifies itself as indigenous (nearly 1 million, according to the 1992
 census), about half remain separated from the rest of society, largely because of his-
 torical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. In practice, the ability of in-
 digenous people to participate in governmental decisions affecting their lands, cul-
 tures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources is marginal. Indigenous
 people also experience some societal discrimination.
 
 
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Chile assimilated a major European migra-
 tion in the last century and a major Middle Eastern and Croatian migration in the
 early part of this century. Smaller racial and ethnic minority groups (Chileans of
 Asian descent and African-Chileans) experience some societal intolerance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have a right to form unions without prior
 authorization and to join existing unions; 13 percent of the employed work force is
 organized. A 1995 law provides government-employee associations with the same
 rights as trade unions. However, this right is not enjoyed by police or military per-
 sonnel nor by employees of state-owned companies attached to the Ministry of e-
 fense. Members of unions are free to withdraw from union membership.
 The 1992 Labor Code permits nationwide labor centrals, and the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT), the largest and most representative of these, legalized its status in
 April 1992. Labor unions are effectively independent of the Government, but union
 leaders are usually elected from lists based on party affiliation and often receive di-
 rection from parties' headquarters. There are no restrictions on the political activi-
 ties or affiliations of unions or union officials. Registering a union is a simple proc-
 ess.
 Reforms to the Labor Code in 1990 removed many restrictions on the right to
 strike, although some remain. Employees in the private sector have the right to
 strike, and the Government regulates this right. However, the law proscribes em-
 ployees of some 30 companies-largely providers of essential services (e.g., water
 and electricity)-from striking; it stipulates compulsory arbitration to resolve poten-
 tial strikes in these companies. Public officials do not enjoy this right, although gov-
 ernment -teachers, municipal and health workers have struck in the recent past.
 There is no provision for compulsory arbitration in the public sector.
 Employers must pay severance benefits to striking workers and must show cause
 to fire workers. Employees who believe that they have been unfairly dismissed or
 dismissed because of their trade union activities fie complaints with the Ministry
 of Labor. If the claim is approved, the employer must make special and additional
 compensatory-payments. Congress approved legislation that took effect in March
 and places the burden of proof on the employer in cases in which employees allege
 illegal antiunion activity.
 The CUT and many other labor confederations and federations maintain ties to
 international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Despite legal provisions for
 collective bargaining, most workers negotiate individual contracts. Eimployers say
 that thiis s due to the workers' preference, distrust of union leaders, and loyalty to
 companies. Union leaders counter that the Labor Code-which among other things
 does not allow union shops-prevents successful organization in many sectors. Em-
 ployers may also include a clause in individual employment contracts that bars
 some classes f employees from collective bargaining, although this applies only to
 supervisory personnel. Employees may object to the inclusion of such clauses in
 their contracts and may appeal to the Ministry of Labor for their excision.
 The Ministry of  bor arbitrates about one-half of the complaints it receives.
 Workers may take unarbitrated cases to the courts. If complainants succeed in prov-
 ing they ere fired unjustly, the employer must pay discharged employees twice
 their normal severance payment. Ther ae ano statistics available concerning the
 disposition of complaints of antiunion behavior. There are allegations that employ-
 ers fire workers for union activity and attempt to avoid a complaint by immediately
 payng them some multiple of the normal severance pay.
 Temporary workers-defined in the Labor Code as those in agriculture and con-
 struction, as well as prt workers and entertainers-may form unions, but their
 right to collective bargaining remains dependent on employers agreeing to negotiate
 with unions of temporary workers. Likewise, inter-company unions enjoy the right
 of collective bargaining only if the employer agrees to negotiate with such a union.
 Labor Code sanctions against unfair bargaining practices protect workers from dis-
 missal only during the bargaining process. Labor leaders complain that companies
 invoke the law's needs-of-the-company clause to fire workers after a union has
 signed a new- ontract, particularly when negotiations result in a prolonged strike.
 Labor laws apply in the duty-free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. While the
 Labor Code does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, there
 were no reports of such practices.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 allows children between the ages of 15 and 18 to work with the express permission
 
 
 of their parents or guardians. Children 14 years of age may also work legally with
 such permission, but they must have completed their elementary education, and the
 work involved may not be physically strenuous or unhealthy. Additional provisions
 in the law protect workers under 18 years of age by restricting the types of work
 open to them (for example, they may not work in nightclubs) and by establishing
 special conditions of work (they may not work more than 8 hours in one day). Labor
 inspectors enforce these regulations and compliance is good in the formal economy.
 The Labor Code does not specifically prohibit forced andbonded labor by children,
 but such practices were not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). Many children are em-
 ployed in the informal economy. A government study estimates that there are
 15,000 children between the ages of 6 and 11 and 32,000 children between the ages
 of 12 and 14 were in the work force, The majority of these were males from single-
 parent households headed by women; among these were children who worked more
 than 40 hours per week and did not attend school. The Ministry of Labor convenes
 regular meetings of a tripartite group (business-labor-government) to monitor
 progress in eradicating child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, hours of work,
 and occupational safety and, health standards. The legal workweek is 48 hours,
 which can be worked in either 5 or 6 days. The maximum workday length is 10
 hours, but positions such as caretakers and domestic servants are exempted. All
 workers enjoy at least one 24-hour rest period during the workweek, except for
 workers at high altitudes who voluntarily exchange a work-free day each week for
 several consecutive work-free days every 2 weeks.
 The minimum wage is adjusted annually. This wage is designed to serve as the
 starting wage for an unskilled single worker entering the labor force and does not
 provide a family with an acceptab e standard of living. Only 11 percent of salaried
 workers earn the minimum wage. A tripartite committee comprising government,
 employer, and labor representatives normally suggests a minimum wage based on
 projected inflation and increases in productivity. In May the Senate approved the
 Government's proposal with little dissent, setting the minimum monthly wage at
 about $173 (71,400 pesos), effective in July.
 Occupational health and safety are protected under the law and administered by
 the both the Ministries of Health and of Labor. The Government has increased re-
 sources for inspections by over 60 percent since 1990 and targeted industries guilty
 of the worst abuses. As a result, enforcement is improving, and voluntary compli-
 ance is fairly good. A law that became effective in December 1996 increased the
 number of annual occupational health and safety inspections and provided that they
 be carried out by an expanded labor inspection service in the Ministry of Labor. In-
 surance mutual funds provide workmen's compensation and occupational safety
 training for the private and public sectors. They reported a 24-percent decline in oc-
 cupational injuries over the past 5 years, although 11 percent of the work force still
 submitted claims. Workers who remove themselves from situations that endanger
 their health and safety have their employment protected if a real danger to their
 health or safety exists. The Ministry of Labor recently promulgated a general stand-
 ard for safety in the forestry sector, where accident rates have greatly exceeded the
 national average.
