 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy. It has a Constitution which
 gives the Kino broad powers. Governments are formed and
 dissolved at his command, and he remains the ultimate arbiter
 of policy. The Constitution also provides for a Council of
 Ministers (Cabinet) appointed by the King and an independent
 judiciary. It provides for a National Assembly consistino of
 an appointed 30-member Council of Notables (Senate) and a
 60-member Council of Deputies (Parliament) elected to
 four-year terms. Both chambers, however, are overshadowed by
 the King and his Cabinet.
 The modern state of Jordan emerged from the British mandate
 following the First World War. As a result of the 1948 war
 which established the State of Israel, and the 1967 war which
 ended in Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Jordan became
 the home of a larqe number of Palestinian refugees. Tensions
 between Palestinians and native Jordanians boiled over into
 civil war in 1970. The Government reestablished its control,
 with difficulty, and since then has maintained internal
 security through use of a strong military, public security
 force (police), and general intelligence directorate.
 Internal security is also pursued through general oversight of
 the media and surveillance of activities which the Government
 believes could pose security risks. A state of martial law,
 in effect since 1967, gives the Government authority to detain
 individuals without charge. Despite occasional tensions
 between Palestinian-Jordanians and the East Bank
 Trans-Jordanians, relations between the two communities are
 generally good.
 In theory, the members of Parliament are elected from both the
 East and West Banks of the Jordan River. Parliament may
 propose laws and amend and reject laws submitted to it by the
 Prime Minister as it pleases. The Senate, however, has
 authority only to approve or reject bills sent to it. The
 1967 war made elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
 impossible. The King dissolved Parliament in 1976, but called
 it back in January 1984. By-elections were held in March to
 fill seats vacated during the previous eiqht years. Since
 elections on the West Bank are still not feasible, the
 Constitution was amended to permit vacant seats for West Bank
 districts to be filled by vote of the other members of
 Parliament.
 The current state of martial law qualifies the protections of
 the integrity of the person affirmed in the Constitution.
 Invasion of the home is prohibited eycept by court-issued
 warrant. Limited use is made of the power under martial law
 to detain persons without trial or charge for indefinite
 periods. Martial law courts provide the same guarantees as
 the civil courts, but in practice do not grant hail. The
 civil and military courts provide for public trial and appeal.
 Political parties have been banned since 1957. Candidates for
 Parliament, for example, run as independents. Municipal
 elections continue to take place regularly.
 Jordan has an essentially free enterprise economy with limited
 but growing government participation in some sectors, largely
 in basic industries. The country has very few natural
 resources and relies on foreign assistance and remittances
 from workers abroad for the greater part of its foreign
 exchange needs. Although Jordan is a developing country with
 limited natural resources, it has enjoyed healthy growth for
 
 
 1285
 JORDAN
 the past decade and, partly due to the large number of
 Jordanians working abroad, recently has had little
 unemployment.
 Economic stability and development have been enhanced by the
 fact that Palestinian refugees have been given Jordanian
 citizenship and participate fully in Jordan's economic and
 social life. Because of Jordan's dependence on outside
 funding, the foundations of the economy are fraoile. Owing to
 declining foreign assistance and a weak world economy,
 economic growth leveled off in 1984.
 Although Jordan is constitutionally an Islamic state, freedom
 of religion is afforded by law and enjoyed in practice. The
 King's support for religious tolerance plays an important role
 in assuring religious harmony.
 Jordanian law treats men and women equally, except in matters
 such as marriage and inheritance. Under Islamic law, women's
 rights are not equal to those of Tien. Middle Eastern
 traditions, in some instances, further constrain women's
 freedoms.
 There was a general trend of increased public participation in
 Jordan's political life throughout 1984. Public debate in the
 press increased, Parliament reopened, and the first
 parliamentary elections in 17 years took place in a free and
 open atmosphere. At the same time, martial law, a lack of
 habeas corpus, and broad police powers serve to limit
 criticism of those qovernment policies considered essential to
 the national interest. In sum, the human rights situation in
 Jordan improved marginally in 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Intearity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings have been recorded in 1984.
 There have been a very few attempted or actual killings for
 political purposes, the last occurring prior to 1983.
 Summary executions do not occur in Jordan. Jordanian law
 provides for trial in absentia of Arabs who sell West Bank
 property to the "enemy" (defined as an Israeli citizen,
 resident of Israel, or Israeli corporation) or who participate
 in the "village leagues" on the West Bank. The maximum
 penalty for this crime is death. Althouqh such trials have
 occurred, and the death penalty has been pronounced in some
 cases, there is no record that it has ever been implemented.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances reported in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Deqrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The law which requlates the treatment of nrisoners guarantees
 that they receive medical treatment and provides for
 inspection of nrisons to insure healthful conditions in them.
 No accusations of torture are known to have been made in 1984
 other than the comment in Freedom House's 1983-84 report that
 
 
 1286
 JORDAN
 "There are ... instances of torture." There is no evidence
 that the Government condones or practices torture.
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners.
 While spartan, prison conditions are not designed to be
 intentionally degrading. A modern complex is currently under
 construction to replace Amman's old and cramped Mahatta
 Prison. There appears to be no discrimination according to
 reliqion or social class in the treatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Martial law was imposed in 1967, and reaffirmed in 1973.
 Under martial law, the executive authority has the power to
 detain persons indefinitely without trial. The security
 forces use this power to detain individuals suspected of
 cross-border infiltration or security offenses. A detained
 person may take his case to the High Court of Justice (an
 administrative tribunal) to argue that his detention on
 security grounds is not justified. Martial law does not
 provide for habeas corpus. Government authorities are not
 under legal obligation to notify the family members of those
 detained.
 While exact statistics are unavailable, it appears that
 several dozen people were detained in 1984 for periods ranging
 from a few days to several months. Detainees are held in
 conditions similar to those of common criminals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most criminal cases in Jordan are tried in civilian courts,
 under civil law approved by Parliament and ratified by the
 King. Military courts apply military regulations promulgated
 by the Defense Ministry pursuant to relevant laws. In
 addition, separate martial law courts are established under
 the provisions of martial law. The martial law court is
 responsible for crimes such as espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black
 marketeering, and security offenses. The civil courts retain
 jurisdiction for most other crimes. Military courts prosecute
 military personnel for all categories of offenses, and may
 prosecute civilians in certain cases.
 Although the martial law court is not bound to observe normal
 rules of evidence or procedure, generally accepted legal
 practices are observed. Accordingly, defendants before this
 court are represented by legal counsel and may cross-examine
 witnesses. Sentences of the martial law court may not be
 appealed, but they must he ratified by the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as martial law governor. The Prime Minister has
 the authority to increase, reduce, or annul any martial law
 sentence. In practice, cases are reviewed for fairness by his
 legal advisor or the Justice Minister before the Prime
 Minister makes a decision. Individuals charged in martial law
 trials are generally handled more expeditiously than in
 civilian trials.
 Under the civilian court system, cases must be reviewed by the
 public prosecutor's office within 24 hours of an arrest. The
 prosecutor must determine that sufficient evidence exists to
 warrant prosecution. The prosecutor then turns the case over
 to the Attorney General's office, which prepares a bill of
 indictment if satisfied that enough evidence exists to warrant
 prosecution.
 
 
 1287
 JORDAN
 The accused is entitled to be represented by legal counsel.
 However, many defendants are unaware of this right and fail to
 exercise it. The Law of Criminal Procedure specifies court
 appointment of lawyers for defendants who cannot obtain their
 own lawyers if the potential sentence is execution or life
 imprisonment.
 Judges are selected by a board composed of the chief
 prosecutor, two members of the courts of Amman, Jerusalem, and
 Irbid, the Inspector General of the Royal Courts, and the
 Undersecretary of the Justice Ministry. Candidates for
 judgeships must prove competence in the law through a written
 examination. Judges may be removed from office only on
 grounds of specific transgression of the law and after a
 hearing before a disciplinary board.
 In addition to martial and civil law, Muslim religious law
 (Shari'a) plays an important role in Jordanian life. Rights
 of inheritance, child custody, conduct between neighbors, and
 women's personal status are largely adjudicated according to
 Shari'a law. A separate Sharila court system exists to
 resolve disputes between Muslim parties in cases dealing with
 subjects such as divorce, alimony, and inheritances.
 Christian religious courts handle similar cases between
 Christians. Cases between individuals of differing religions
 are handled by the civil court system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by the authorities is against
 the law, and no such incidents were reported in 1984. Search
 and arrest require warrants except in cases of hot pursuit.
 Although there is a strong cultural tradition of respect for
 the privacy of the home and individuals, there is also a
 general popular belief that the Government is engaged in
 surveillance and tampering of the mails.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees the freedoms of speech
 and press, martial law is permitted and pursuant thereto a
 limited censorship is currently in effect on newspapers,
 pamphlets, books, and broadcasts in matters affecting public
 safety or national defense.
 The Government owns and operates the radio and television
 networks. Private newspapers and periodicals (which are all
 under government influence) practice a form of self-
 censorship. The media generally reflect the Government's
 position on key foreign policy and security issues, although
 the Government this year has tolerated public debate in the
 media of most national issues. Since the recall of Parliament
 and the installation of the new Cabinet in January, the press
 has exploited this tolerance and has examined internal and
 foreign policies with a somewhat more critical eye. The
 frequent meetings between editors and the Information
 Minister, which the Government used the previous year to make
 its views known to the press, were virtually eliminated in
 1984. Journalists are required to register with the
 Information Ministry and to become members of the Journalists
 Association. Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely
 available, though they are subject to infrequent censorship.
 Pornographic materials are banned.

 JORDAN
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations must obtain government approval prior to
 their establishment. Persons who demonstrate without first
 obtaining a permit are liable to be dispersed or detained by
 the police; permits are rarely granted. Formally organized
 associations are subject to the laws of their establishment.
 Political parties are not permitted, and charters of other
 organizations may not include political objectives.
 Government surveillance of public meetings, university
 activities, and organization gatherings is routine.
 Jordanians may join labor unions and professional
 organizations. Such associations reauire government licenge,
 but this is granted routinely. Unions and associations are
 permitted to defend the interests of their members, and their
 officers are elected by the membership. Strikes are legal;
 however, the Labor Ministry must be notified in advance (14
 days for small firms, 28 days for large firms). During this
 period, the Ministry attempts to arbitrate. If these efforts
 fail, employees may strike and have done so.
 Only 20 percent of Jordanian labor is unionized; the low
 proportion is due primarily to the population's lack of
 familiarity with unions rather than government or business
 efforts to suppress unions. The unions maintain that the
 proportion of the work force they represent is growing.
 Unions have virtually no political role. Professional
 associations among doctors, engineers, lawyers, pharmacists,
 and similar professional groups operate freely. Unions and
 professional associations may and do maintain contact with
 international organizations in their fields. Unions routinely
 participate in international organizations such as the
 International Labor Organization and the Arab Labor
 Organization and take part in their conferences.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is followed by the great majority
 of Jordanians. The Constitution guarantees freedom of
 worship. Persecution or harassment of Christians (about
 5 percent of the population) or other minorities is against
 the law as well as government policy. The only restraint on
 non-Muslims is a prohibition against proselytizing Muslims.
 Christians are represented in the Government and military
 roughly in proportion to their share of the population,
 although the most senior positions are traditionally reserved
 for Muslims.
 There appears to be little difference between adherents of the
 religions in social or economic status. Nevertheless, some
 tensions exist between the Islamic and Christian communities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country (with the exception of certain
 military zones) is unobstructed. With a few exceptions, the
 Government does not restrict emigration or travel abroad by
 its nationals.
 Women and minor children are required to have the written
 consent of their husband, father, or oldest male relative to
 obtain a passport. Such persons traveling alone generally are
 presumed by the authorities to have permission to travel.
 
 
 1289
 JORDAN
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influxes
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967
 Arab-Israeli wars. According to the most recent United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) statistics,
 Palestinian refugees and their descendants on the East Bank
 now total approximately 1 million. Of these, approximately
 203,000 now live in refugee camps. This total does not
 include a large but undetermined number of other persons from
 the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or Israel who have settled in
 Jordan since 1948. All of these people have been granted
 Jordanian citizenship and have the unrestricted right to live,
 work, and own property.
 There are no restrictions on these or any other citizens who
 might wish to return to Jordan after a period spent abroad.
 Jordanians who have traveled or studied abroad, especially in
 Communist countries, often have their passports taken by the
 general intelligence directorate upon their return. Passports
 are returned after the travelers answer questions on security
 matters, espionage, and contacts with Communists.
 Jordan allows the movement of peoples between the East Bank
 and Israeli-occupied territories, reminding critics that such
 travel is humanitarian, helps maintain West Bank-Arab ties,
 and is economically advantageous to the inhabitants of the
 occupied territories.
 Jordan recognizes the right of asylum even in cases which have
 resulted in strained relations with neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Organized political parties are not permitted. The Communist
 Party is prohibited by law. There is an appointed Senate and
 a Parliament elected by universal suffrage and secret ballot.
 Parliament was dissolved in 1976 after having become moribund
 in the wake of the 1967 war with Israel. From 1976 to 1984,
 the King ruled with the advice of the National Consultative
 Council, an appointive body he established for the purpose.
 On January 5, 1984, the King restored the Parliament. A
 flurry of campaigning followed as almost 200 candidates vied
 for the 8 seats which had become vacant through attrition.
 Elections were held in March and the campaign was generally
 accepted as fair and open.
 Parliament is still composed largely of members elected in the
 last national election of 1967. Since that time, general
 elections have been impossible because of the Israeli
 occupation of the West Bank. The country is still seeking a
 formula which will provide adequate parliamentary
 representation for the West Bank in lieu of
 Jordanian-sponsored elections there.
 The councils of most cities and towns are elected by popular
 vote. King Hussein has taken steps to increase the
 participation of women in the political process, appointing
 the first female cabinet minister in Jordan's history in 1979.
 A certificate of good conduct is required for government
 employment and for work or study abroad. It may be reauested
 by any employer. The certificate is provided or refused by
 the General Intelligence Directorate based on review of the
 
 
 1290
 JORDAN
 candidate's record and, at times, following an interview with
 the individual concerned.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Jordan has attracted little attention from private or
 international human rights organizations. The Jordanian
 lawyers' professional association has formed a human rights
 committee, but it is not active. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross maintains an office in Amman. Its
 representative visits all prisons and detention facilities
 regularly. He is allowed access to all prisoners and
 detainees, and the Government is responsive to his
 recommendations. Amnesty International has made inquiries
 about specific cases from time to time, focusing on detention
 without trial and on the death penalty, but it did not cite
 Jordan in its 1984 report. Noting that Jordan has held
 important by-elections and reconvened its long absent
 Parliament, Freedom House rates Jordan 'partly free,' an
 improvement over its previous rating of 'not free.'
 The Government has played an active role in the International
 Labor Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Commission. The
 Crown Prince is a cofounder of the Independent Commission on
 International Humanitarian issues.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 From 1967 through 1981, Jordan's economy grew at an average
 annual real rate of over 9 percent. Since 1981, growth has
 slowed, dropping to about 5.4 percent in 1983. The latest
 World Bank statistics show per capita gross national product
 (GNP) as $1,344.10 in 1982. According to the Central Bank of
 Jordan, per capita GNP in 1983 rose to approximately $2,036,
 up from tl,700 in 1982. Some 17 percent of the rural
 population and 14 percent of the urban is considered to
 receive income below the absolute poverty level, according to
 World Bank figures for 1979. Services, including government,
 contributed some 61 percent of the total national output,
 followed by the industrial and construction sectors (25
 percent), agriculture (7.5 percent), and mining (4 percent).
 Jordan remains heavily dependent on external aid with 51
 percent of its budgetary resources coming from external
 sources. Inflation in 1983 stood at 5 percent.
 Most unemployment in Jordan is structural. The domestic work
 force of nearly 450,000 is close to full employment.
 Significant numbers of foreign workers, estimated at over
 120,000, have entered the country in recent years, primarily
 from Egypt. While some 320,000 Jordanians continue to work
 abroad, principally in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf
 countries, these states have reduced the number of foreigners
 admitted to work in the past few years. Women are steadily
 increasing their numbers in the work place. Women now
 comprise 20 percent of the total labor force, compared to
 4 percent in 1975. They participate broadly in the
 professional, clerical, and managerial sectors.
 Jordan has a heavy trade deficit (imports exceeded exports by
 a factor of 5 to 2 in 1983), offset by remittances from
 Jordanians working abroad and by foreign aid, mostly from
 friendly Arab states. Rapidly rising remittances and foreign
 
 
 1291
 JORDAN
 aid permitted a 28 percent annual rate of increase in imports
 during 1975-1981. More recently, remittances have leveled
 off, primarily because of adverse economic conditions in the
 Gulf states where most expatriate Jordanians work.
 Remittances were about $1.1 billion in both 1982 and 1983.
 Direct aid from the Arab countries has also declined sharply
 from its peak level of $1.2 billion in 1981 to less than $800
 million in 1983. As a result, imports increased by only 2.2
 percent in 1982 and declined by 6.3 percent in 1983. This
 shrinkage of imports both reflected and contributed to further
 economic slowdown.
 Jordan's population is 2,689,000, with an annual growth rate
 of 3.80 percent. Of this, about 60 percent live in the city
 but another 20 percent live in suburban and semiurban areas,
 making Jordan a highly urbanized society. Approximately 10
 percent of the population are Palestinian refugees who still
 live in shelters supervised by the United Nations Relief and
 Works Agency. The population below the age of 15 is 51.8
 percent, resulting in a high dependency ratio. Life
 expectancy at birth is currently 59.8 years for males and 63.6
 years for females (the World Bank 1984 figure is 63.76
 years.) Infant mortality is estimated to be 69 per 1,000 -live
 births. (The World Bank estimate of infant mortality rate for
 1984 is 53.30 per 1,000.)
 Health tacilities in Jordan are widely distributed, but uneven
 in quality. Facilities range from the most modern in the
 cities to rural village clinics which have a doctor in
 attendance only infrequently. At present there is one doctor
 for each 960 Jordanians residing on the East Bank. By 1986
 there is expected to be one doctor for each 568 residents. In
 1981 there were 16.7 hospital beds for each 10,000
 inhabitants, but a planned increase should raise this number
 to 25.8 per 10,000 by 1986.
 Although education is free and compulsory through the ninth
 grade, primary school (1-6) enrollment rates which are close
 to 100 percent drop to about 52 percent in preparatory (7-9)
 and 74 percent in secondary (10-12) schools. The latest World
 Bank figures available are for 1981, when the primary school
 enrollment ratio was 89.93 percent for males and 86.74 percent
 for females. Adult literacy has increased dramatically over
 the past 20 years. At present, some 65 percent of all those
 above tne ages of 15 are literate, with males at 71 percent
 and females at over 55 percent.
 While chlorination and treatment of some water is carried out
 in Jordan, water is not always safe and incidents of
 contamination are common. The latest World Bank statistics,
 for 1982, estimate that 80 percent of the population then had
 access to safe water.
 Jordanian citizens are accorded equal treatment in social
 services sucn as health, education, and some subsidized
 toodstuffs. Despite limited natural resources and a rapidly
 growing population, the standard of living has risen during
 tne past decade.
 Jordan's essentially free enterprise economy has created many
 opportunities for its people regardless of religious, ethnic,
 
 
 1292
 JORDAN
 or tribal background. There is no evidence of government-
 encouraged discrimination. Women in Jordan, as in other
 states of the region, are traditionally disfavored
 economically and, to a lesser extent, educationally. The
 status of women is heavily influenced by traditional social
 values which fix women in the role of housewife and mother.
 For example, women are still required to have the written
 permission of the family's eldest male in order to travel.
 This pattern, however, is changing. The Government encourages
 more female participation in the labor force. Women work in
 managerial, professional, and clerical positions in the public
 sector, the military, and the police, albeit in much lower
 numbers and at a generally lower level than men. Women are
 steadily increasing their numbers in the work place. Women
 now comprise 20 percent of the total labor force, compared to
 4 percent in 1975. Women have the right to initiate divorce
 under limited circumstances; they have the right to own and
 inherit property; and they have priority "rule of first right"
 for the custody of minor children.
