 BURMA
 Burma continued to be ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime widely
 condemned for its serious human rights abuses. The Military Government, the State
 Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), headed by the armed forces com-
 mander and composed of top military officers, seized power in September 1988 after
 harshly suppressing massive prodemocracy demonstrations. Retired dictator Gen-
 eral Ne Win, whose idiosyncratic policies had isolated Burma and driven the coun-
 try into deep economic decline, is believed by many to continue to wield considerable
 influence.
 The SLORC permitted a relatively free election in 1990, but it failed to honor the
 results--which were an overwhelming rejection of military rule-or to cede power
 to the victorious prodemocracy forces. Instead, the SLORC attacked the coalition of
 winning parties and their leaders through intimidation, detention, and house arrest.
 Since April 1992, the SLORC has taken some modest steps to lessen its harsh rule.
 Universities were reopened, many political prisoners were released, and steps were
 taken to reform the economy. But in January 1993 the SLORC established the "Na-
 tional Convention," a body ostensibly tasked with working out a new Constitution.
 Overwhelmingly made up of delegates handpicked by the military, the SLORC has
 carefully stage-managed the Convention's proceedings and ignored even limited op-
 position views. Despite having no mandate from the people, the SLORC seems di-
 
 
 540
 termined to draft a Constitution that will guarantee a dominant role for the military
 in the country's future political structure.
 The Government reinforces its rule via a pervasive security apparatus led by mili-
 tary intelligence, the Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI). Control is
 buttressed by selective restrictions on contact with foreigners, surveillance of gov-
 ernment employees and private citizens, harassment of political activists, intimida-
 tion, arrest, detention, and physical abuse. The Government justifies its security
 measures as necessary to maintain order and national unity, although many long-
 standing insurgent groups have reached accommodations with the SLORC in recent
 years and the others pose little threat to major population centers.
 Burma is primarily an agricultural country, although it also has substantial min-
 eral, fishing, and timber resources. Since 1988, the Government has slowly opened
 up the economy to permit expansion of the private sector, and to attract foreign in-
 vestment. Some economic improvement has ensued, but major obstacles to economic
 reform persist. These include restrictions on private commerce; constantly changing
 rules and regulations; over centralized decisionmaking; a bloated bureaucracy; a
 greatly overvalued currency; poor infrastructure; and grossly disproportionate mili-
 tary spending.
 Despite an appearance of greater normalcy fostered by increased economic activ-
 ity, in fact the Government's unacceptable record on human rights changed little in
 1994. Out of sight of most visitors, Burmese citizens continued to live subject at any
 time and without appeal to the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the mili-
 tary. There continued to be credible reports, particularly from ethnic minority-domi-
 nated areas, that soldiers committed serious human rights abuses, including
 extrajudicial killings and rape. The use of porters by the army-with all the attend-
 ant maltreatment, illness, and even death for those compelled to serve-remained
 a standard practice and probably even increased. The Burmese military forced hun-
 dreds of thousands, if not millions, of ordinary Burmese (including women and chil-
 dren) to "contribute" their labor, often under harsh working conditions, to construc-
 tion projects throughout the country. The forced resettlement of civilians also con-
 tinued.
 Four hundred or more political prisoners remained in detention, including ap-
 proximately 40 parliamentarians elected in 1990. Although she has yet to be
 charged with any crime, Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi began her sixth year
 of house arrest in July. In extending her arrest, the SLORC circumvented its own
 amended statute limiting house arrest to 5 years and ignored repeated U.N. General
 Assembly and U.N. Human Rights Commission resolutions calling for her release
 and that of all other prisoners of conscience.
 The SLORC continued to restrict severely basic rights to free speech, association,
 and assembly. In July and August the authorities arrested five persons for trying
 to smuggle out information on conditions in Burma to the outside world. Through
 use of pressure and outright threats, the Government gathered 4 million Burmese
 at political rallies in January to endorse its political agenda. The authorities contin-
 ued to control discussion at the national convention.
 More than 100,000 Rohingyas (Burmese Muslims from Arakan State) remained
 in refugee camps in Bangladesh, pending repatriation under an ongoing program
 overseen by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A few thousand
 students and dissidents continued in exile in Thailand, while at year's end roughly
 70,000 Burmese were residing in ethnic minority camps near the border in Thai-
 land.
 Several positive developments occurred, including the February decision to allow
 a nonfamiry member to visit Aung San Suu Kyi. Also, after years of refusing to ac-
 knowledge her status as the leader of Burma s prodemocracy forces, in September
 SLORC Chairman Than Shwe and DDSI Chief Khin Nyunt met with Aung San Suu
 Kyi for the first time since she was placed under house arrest.
 An unknown number of political prisoners was released, including prominent po-
 litical satirist Zargana, although the number of public announcements of such re-
 leases declined compared to 1993. By midyear, the Government agreed to study a
 draft Memorandum of Understanding to govern visits by the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to Burmese prisons. The Government permitted the
 UNHCR to open an office in Rangoon and to work in the Rohingya refugee process-
 ing area. A limited number of international nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 were allowed to set up operations or expand existing ones.
 Despite these positive moves, there was by year's end no clear sign that the
 SLORC was yet ready to take the kind of decisive action needed to break with its
 past, reach a political settlement with the country's democratic forces, and restore
 the basic human and political rights once enjoyed by the people of Burma.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Exrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of an explicit
 or systematic government policy encouraging summary killings. However, there con-
 tinued to be credible reports of instanoe-of bratality and kiings of civilians by the
 military, particularly in minority-dominated areas and among those impressed as
 porters. The Government did not take any action against military personnel respon-
 sible for extrajudicial killings or other abuses. The Government did not carry out
 the death sentences imposed after a summary trial of four civilians charged with
 killing a student in Rangoon in January.
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, private citizens and political activists
 continued to TWdisappea  temporarily for several hours to several days. DDSI offi-
 cials usually picked up individuals for questioning without the knowledge of their
 family members and in most cases released them soon afterward. However, many
 people continued to be conscripted by the military for porterage or other duties with-
 out the knowledge of their family members. The whereabouts of those conscripted,
 as well as of prisoners transferred for labor or porterage duties, remained difficult
 to trace (see Sections 1.g. and 6.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Again in 1994, political detainees were held incommunicado for long periods. These
 detainees were routinely subjected to harsh interrogation techniques designed to in-
 timidate and disorient. The most common forms of maltreatment were sleep and
 food deprivation coupled with round-the-clock questioning. There were also reliable
 indications that authorities sometimes physically abused prisoners and pretrial de-
 tainees. In recent years, there have been credible reports of beatings and of pris-
 oners being forced to squat or assume unnatural positions for lengthy periods. In
 the past, there have also been reports of practices such as electrical shocks to the
 gnitals, suffocation, and cigarette burns, but there were no known instances of
 ese techniques being employed in 1994.
 The regimen at Insein prison near Rangoon remained unacceptably harsh, includ-
 ing permanent solitary confinement for 250 of the approximately 4,000 inmates, lit-
 tle or no exercise, no reading or writing materials for all but a tiny minority of pris-
 oners, poor nutrition, and inadequate medical care. A few prominent political pris-
 oners, such as former National League for Democracy (NLD) Chairmen Tin Oo and
 Kyi Maung, continued to be provided limited reading material and bungalow accom-
 modations. Most prisoners were permitted to receive medicine as wen as supple-
 mental food brought by their families during the 15-minute visits permitted every
 2 weeks. Conditions were reliably reported to be much worse at some upcountry lo-
 cations, particularly Thayet and Thayawaddy prisons, to which scores of-Insein's po-
 litical prisoners were transferred in June
 In February US. Congressman Bill Richardson was able to meet with Nobel Lau-
 reate Aung San Suu Kyi and fou o    r political prisoners, writer Ma Thida, former
 NL   cent~al committee member Win     , former Aung San Sun Kyi administrative
 aide Win Htein, and former student leader Mi Ko N     . The health of Min Ko
 Naing whom t e Congressman had met the previous year at Insein prison, ap-
 peared to have improved somewhat but he continued to show signs of mental and
 physical suffering from his 5 years of solitary confinement.
 The Government continued to bar the ICRC from visiting detainees or convicted
 prisoners of any kind, but its discussions with the Government concerning such ac-
 Beyond its harsh treatment of prison inmates there continued to be credible re-
 ports that security forces subjected ordinary citizens to harassment and physical
 abuse. The military routinely seized villages to confiscate property and food, and
 used abusive recruitment methods to procure porters. Those forced into porterage
 or other duties faced extremely difficult conditions and maltreatment th~at some-
 times resulted in death (see Section 1.g.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Endle.-The SLORC routinely practiced arbitrary
 arrest and incommunicado detention. Prior to being charged, detainees do not have
 access to legal counsel or their families. There is no provision in Burmese law for
 judicial determination of the legality of detention, and plitical detainees have no
 opportunity to obtain release onbail.
 Becuse of the high level of intimidation discouraging overt political activity, de-
 tentions for public antigovernment activities were less frequent in 1994 than in the
 early 1990's. Nonetheless, in the course of the year scores of political activists were
 detained for lw-evel political protests, such as handing out opposition flyers or at-
 tempting to organize demonstrations. Such detentions often coincided with various
 politica anniversaries. For example, in July a group of high school students was de-
 
 
 542
 tained in Rangoon for participating in protest activities to mark the anniversary of
 Ne Win's destruction of the Rangoon University Student Union building. Most of
 these cases ended with eventual release of the detainees.
 However, in July Khin Zaw Win, a former local contract employee of the U.N.
 Children's Fund (UNICEF), was detained at Rangoon airport, questioned secretly
 and ch aged in late August with trying to smuggle antigovernment materials and
 confidential government information out of the country. As a result of Khin Zaw
 Win's arrest, four others, including the writer San San Nwe and her daughter Myat
 Mo Mo Tun, together with two NLD winners in the 1990 election, Khin Maung Swe
 and Sein I1a Oo, were also picked up and accused of abetting the effort to got infor-
 mation on Burma to the outside world, including to the U.N. Human Rights Com-
 mission's Special Rapporteur on Burma, Professor Yozo Yokota. All five were found
 guilty in OcUtober and received sentences ranging from 7 to 15 years for "spreading
 false information injurious to the State" and other minor offenses.
 In January the military informed former NLD General Secretary and Nobel Peace
 Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi that her house arrest had been extended for another
 year. This was done despite the fact that in 1994 she reached the 5-year legal limit
 of detention without charge or trial. In February the authorities announced, appar-
 ently for the first time, that the initial year of the former NLD leader's house arrest
 had been pursuant to a decision of the previously unknown "Central Body" and that
 the 5-year clock began to run only aitr that time.
 Streetaide guard posts were removed from in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's house
 in January, but the conditions of her detention did not change. She continued to re-
 ceive visits from her immediate family. In mid-February the authorities also per-
 mitted U S. Congressman Bill Richardson, along with an official from the United
 Nations and a New York Times reporter, to meet with the former NLD leader, the
 first such visit by outsiders other than family members since her house arrest
 began. In August a Buddhist monk resident in the United Kingdom was likewise
 pe rmitted to see Aung San Suu Kyi prior to the SLORC's meeting with her in Sep.
 tember.
 e. Denial of Fair Public ral.-Thrughout 1994 the Government continued to
 rule by decree and was not bound by any constitutional prvisions guaranteeing fair
 public trials or any other rights. Although remnants of the British-era legal system
 were formally in place, the court system and its operation remained seriously
 flawed. Many observers believe there has been an improvement in judicial proce-
 dures, at least m the handling of nonpolitical cases. But ongoing unprofessional be-
 havior by some court offcials,pervasive bribe taking, the misuse of overly bread
 laws, and the manipulation of the courts for political ends continued to deprive the
 country of the right to a fair trial and th e of law. The judiciary is not independ-
 ent of the executive.
 Some basic due process rights, inciuding the right to a p ublic trial and to be rep-
 resented by a defense attorney, were generally re   oste  However, the Supreme
 Court appoints judges with the approval of the SBRC (which also names justices
 to the Supreme Court).
 Defense attorneys are permitted to call and crossexamine witnesses, but their
 primary purpose is to bargain with the judge to obtain the shortest possible sen-
 tene for their clients. Most court proceedinga are open to the pubic. However, in
 political cases, almost all trnials are held in courtrooms on prison compounds and are
 not opn to the public. In these instances, defense counselappears to serve no pur-
 pose other than to provide moral support, since reliable reports indicate verdicts are
 dictated by higher authorities. In an effort to head off student unrest, in January
 the authorities apprehended, charged, tried, and sentenced to death four persons ac-
 cused of involvement in the murder of a student from the Rangoon Institute of Eco-
 nomics-all within the space of 2 days. The stentes, however, appear not to have
 been carried out.
 The Government continued to release political prisoners in 1994 although the
 exact numbers could not be verified. Approximately 400 political prisoners remained
 in jail at year's end, including at least 40 parliamentarians elected in 1990. Both
 prominent political satirist Zargana and Mp.-elect Nai Tun Thein were freed during
 the year.
 Political prisoners were held not only in Rangoon's Insein prison but also in some
 of the country's more than 20 upcountry prisons. For example, the monk who led
 the 1990 movement to withhold spiritual services from the military, Ye Wa Da, re-
 portedly remained in Mandalay prison, while two other prominent monks, Da Ma
 W a Ya and Wi Thu Ta, were believed to still be in custody in Myitkyina. Among
 the many well-known prisoners of conscience who continued to be held either at
 Insein or elsewher    e former NLD leaders Tin uo and K  Mang, former Na-
 tional Convention delegate Dr. Aung Kbin Sit, the writer Ma Thi Da, and lawyer
 
 
 543
 U Nay Min, who was reportedly transferred in the course of the year from Insein
 to the infamous Thayet prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 military rules unchecked by any outside authority and the State continued to inter-
 fere extensively and arbitrarily into the lives of private citizens. Through its exten-
 sive intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel, where-
 abouts, and activities of many citizens, particularly those known to be politically ac-
 tive. Security personnel selectively screened private correspondence and telephone
 calls and conducted warrantless searches of private premises. Government employ-
 ees were required to obtain advance permission before meeting with foreigners.
 The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to peripheral new town settle-
 ments throughout the country, albeit on a smaller scale than in past years. While
 facilities in some of these areas have improved over time, residents targeted for dis-
 placement continued to be given no option but to move, usually on short notice. The
 military also continued to forcibly relocate villages in rural areas, especially those
 with large ethnic minority populations.
 Also, those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject to arbi-
 trary seizure of their property. Many residents of Mandalay were compelled early
 in the year to cede large parcels of prime downtown real estate to the authorities
 for road-widening projects decided upon without any public consultation or endorse-
 ment. Widespread reports indicate the Mandalay city government threatened to
 charge demolition costs to those in affected areas who wavered in tearing down their
 own homes. Beyond these seizures for public purposes there were consistent reports
 of pressure being applied to force individuals to cede parts of their property to gov-
 ernment or military officials, in some cases for these officials' personal use. Auto-
 mobiles and other movable property also remained vulnerable to arbitrary seizure.
 In rural areas, military personnel confiscated livestock and food supplies during
 periodic sweeps to procure porters.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-For more than 4 decades the Burmese Army has battled diverse ethnic
 insurgencies. These ethnic minority insurgent groups have sought to gain greater
 autonomy from the dominant ethnic Burman majority. For most of the year the
 SLORC continued to pursue efforts to engage insurgent groups in cease-fire talks
 and refrained from launching major military offensives. However, in late December,
 fighting between the Burmese Army and the Karen National Union (KNU) and the
 All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) broke out when Burmese forces
 sought to take advantage of an internal dispute among the Karen. In general, com-
 bat and attendant human rights abuses remained at a persistent but low level in
 areas controlled by those ethnic insurgent groups.
 In November the Government allowed the ICRC to conduct a course in Rangoon
 on humanitarian law during armed conflict.
 In conjunction with the military's campaign against drug trafficker Khun Sa and
 his Shan United Army, as many as several thousand civilians were press-ganged
 into working as porters in jungle areas in or near combat zones. According to reli-
 able reports, Burmese military sweeps for porters reached such urban areas as Ran-
 goon, Mandalay, and Moulmein. Military authorities commonly demanded as much
 as $230 (10 times the minimum monthly wage) to avoid service. It was also credibly
 reported that some members of the military used sham threats of impressment to
 extort money. There were numerous credible reports that soldiers abused porters;
 when wounded, ill or unable to work, they were sometimes left unattended in harsh
 conditions to die. here were also continuing reports of rape, particularly of ethnic
 minority women by soldiers.
 Antigovernment insurgent groups were also responsible for violence, causing both
 civilian and military deaths. There were also credible reports that members of these
 grups committed serious human rights violations. The narcotics-trafficking Shan
 United Army is reported to have brutalized villagers and impressed porters in the
 course of fighting against the Burmese army and to have extorted protection fees
 from local merchants. In early May, insurgents from the Rohingya Solidarity Orga-
 nization (RSO) detonated a series of bombs in towns and villages near the western
 border of Arakan State resulting in several deaths and injuries.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Severe restrictions on freedom of speech and the
 press persisted throughout 1994. The security services continued to clamp down on
 those who expressed opposition political views or attempted to provide outsiders
 with information at variance with the government-approved image of the country
 (see Section 1.d.). Many more have refrained from speaking out Tor fear of arrest
 and interrogation by police or military intelligence.
 
 
 The Government-monopoly television, radio, and newspaper media remained prop-
 aganda instruments. With the exception of coverage of some limited aspects of the
 national convention, these official media did not report opposing views. Editors re-
 mained answerable to military authorities. While the English--anguage daily New
 Light of Myanmar continued to include many international wire service reports on
 foreign news, domestic news hewed strictly to and reinforced government policy.
 Practically all forms of media were officially controlled and censored. This strict
 control in turn encouraged self-censorship on the part of writers and publishers. Pri-
 vate citizens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publications.
 Some international newsmagazines and a sizable number of new private publica-
 tions on nozpolitical issues were available to the public at large, but censors occa-
 sionally banned issues or deleted articles deenmd unwelcome by the Government.
 Foreign journalists, including television crews, were granted increased access to
 the country, but their movements and contacts were closely monitored. Despite gov-
 ernment hostility to them, foreign radio broadcasts such as those of the British
 Broadcasting Corporation, Voice of America, and Democratic Voice of Norway re-
 mained prime sources of uncensored information. The Government also allowed the
 U.S. Information Service to conduct a wide range of programs. Foreign television re-
 mained in limbo. After its imposed September 1993 registration deadline for sat-
 ellite dishes, the Government ailed to approve additional licenses or clarify who in
 the future would be allowed to have foreign television. Late in the year, the Govern-
 ment cracked down on video rental shops in Rangoon, forcing the withdrawal from
 circulation of most foreign language videos.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, plitical activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 to discuss politics while at work; and strictures against joining or suporting politi-
 cal parties, engaging in political activity, or meeting foreign oficials. eachers con-
 tinued to be held respnsible for maintaining discipline among their students and
 preventing them from engaging in any unauthorized political activity.
 The universities, closed for severalyears after the 1988 disturbances, were open
 for most of 1994. However, the university midyear break was extended until August
 18, presumably to lessen the chance of unwanted student activities in conjunction
 with various sensitive political anniversaries falling in July and early AugnSt.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 spect these rights. In January the Government organized a series of 26 stage-man-
 aged mass rallies thrughout the country which were attended by approximately 4
 million people. The meetings'of this government-initiated group, the Union Solidar-
 ity and Development Association (USDA), were orchestrate~ b  government authori-
 ties as a mass demonstration of support for the SLORC's political objectives. With
 few exceptions, attendance was coerced, with explicit threats of penalties to those
 who contemplated staying away. Multiple reports indicate that at one rally in Pyay,
 a few peple were trampled to death when attendees ran from rally monitors at-
 tempting to seize those in the crowd who had called out dissenting views.
 For others, the Government prohibition on unauthorized outdoor assemblies of
 more than five people remained in effect, albeit unevenly enforced. Political dem-
 onstrations were strictly banned, but even religious gups sometimes encountered
 problems holding outdoor gatherings. Legal political parties were required to re-
 quest permission from the authorities even to hold internal meetings of their own
 membership.
 The right of association existed only for organizations, including trade associa-
 tions and professional bodies, permitted by law and duly registered with the Gov-
 ernment. Only a handful continued to exist, and even those were subject to direct
 government intervention or took special care to act in line with government policy.
 This included such benign gups as the Myanmar Red Cross and the Myanmar
 Medical Association. Only 10 political parties, out of an original 75 in 1992, re-
 mained legal at the end of 1994, but even the few which remained legal were vir-
 tually immobilized.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all religions duly registered with the au-
 thorities generally enjoyed freedom to worship as they chose, although Buddhists
 continued to enjoy a privileged position. In recent years, the Government has made
 special efforts to link itself with Buddhism as a means of asserting its own popular
 legitimacy. For example, during the year the military contributed an elaborate pray-
 er hall which was dedicated at the foot of the revered Shwedagon pagoda in Ran-
 goon This campaign has led to increased government support for Buddhism in
 keeping with the Government's strong nationalistic views.
 The Government monitors the activities of members of all religions in part be-
 cause they have in the past become politically active. Security services demanded
 
 
 545
 that religious groups seek prior authorization to conduct services out of doors. These
 regulations were also in effect in and around Buddhist monasteries and pagodas.
 The SLORC has been largely successful in halting political activism among the Bud-
 dhist clergy, and by yea s end, many, though not all, monks arrested earlier had
 been released and most quietly resumed their religious duties.
 Religious publications, like secular ones, remained subject to control and censor-
 ship. Christian Bibles translated into indigenous languages could not be imported.
 Religious groups were able to establish links with coreligionists in other countries,
 although these activities were reportedly monitored by the Government. Foreign re-
 ligious representatives were usualy only allowed visas for short stays, but in some
 cases were permitted to preach to Burmese congregations. Permanent foreign mis-
 sionary establishments have not been permitted since the 1960's but a few forewgn
 Catholic nuns, and at least one priest resident in Burma since independence, contin-
 ued to reside upcountry
 It has proven extremely diicult for Christian and Muslim groups to obtain per.
 mission to build new churches and mosques. For example, although there are mere
 than 5,000 mosques in Br       the newest reportedly dates to 1975. There were iso-
 lated incidents in wch the Gove    et destroYed placsof worship as a result of
 infrastructure projects. Also, the Governmen  ntinued to remove cemeteries from
 urban areas, even though many non-Buddhist religions consider these to be sacred
 ground. In March four trustees of a Muslim cemetery in Mandalay were taken into
 custody in the course of protests by Muslims over destruction of an historic grave-
 yard and religious bulding.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foregn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pat riatione-AIthough citizens have the legal right to ive anywhere in the country,
 beth urban and rural residents were subject to arbitrary relocation (see Section 1.f.).
 Except for limitations in areas of insurgent activity, citizens could travel freely with-
 in the country but must notify local authorities of their whereabouts. Those resi-
 dents unable to meet the restrictive provisions of the citizens hip law, (e.g. Chinese,
 Arakaese Muslims, etc.) had to obtain prior prmission to travel
 Though travel strictures continued to ease, the Government maintained tight con-
 trols over travel abroad. The Government bard that reviewed passport applications
 denied passports in some cases apparently on political grounds. Emigrants were re-
 quired to reimburse the Government for "educational expenses" before receiving exit
 permits and were severely limited in whst they could take with them. Burmese citi-
 zens who left legally were generally allowed to return to visit relatives, and those
 wishing to extend their stays usually had ittle difficulty obtaining permission to do
 so. Some who had lived abroad illegally and acquired fore# citizenship found it
 easier to return. In most instances it was impossible for Ch stian groups to obtain
 permission for their would-be clergy to travel abroad to pursue religious studies.
 The Government continued to ease restrictions on foreign travelers. However, se-
 lect categories such as human rights advocates and political figures continued to be
 denied entry visas unless traveling under the aegis of a sponsor acceptable to the
 Government. Although large areas of the country remained off-limits to foreigners
 for security reasons, the authorities did open up a number of new domestic destina-
 tions. Except during clashes with the Shan United Army, foreigners continued to
 be able to travel from northern Thailand into Tachilek and Kentung in easternmost
 Shan state.
 The pace of the repatriation of Muslims from Bangladesh accelerated. By years
 end mere than 130,000 of those who fled the country had returned. The UNHCR
 indicated cooperation with the authorities had been good and that it had not de-
 tected any signs of renewed action against the Rohingyas.
 The Government does not allow refugees or displaced persons to resettle or seek
 safe haven.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the overwhelming desire the Burmese people demonstrated in the 1990
 elections for a return to democracy, they continued to be denied the right to change
 their government. Since 1988 active duty military officers have occupied an increas-
 ingnumber of important positions throughout the bureaucracy, particularly at the
 policymaking level. Despite the appointment of several civilians to the Ca inet in
 1992, the process of placing military or recently retired military officers in most key
 senior level positions once -held by technocrats in the economic ministries has accel-
 erated.
 Following the NLD's victory in the 1990 elections, the SLORC set aside the elec-
 tion results and disqualified, detained, arrested, or drove into exile many successful
 candidates. By the end of the year, 198 of the 485 deputies elected had either been
 
 
 546
 disqualified, resigned under pressure gone into exile, been detained, or died. Ap-
 proximately 40 successful candidates rom the election remain in prison.
 Rather than accept the will of the citizenry, the SLORC convened a National Con-
 vention in January 1993 to draw up principles for a new Constitution. The SLORC
 handpicked delegates, and proceedings have been carefully stage-managed; even
 limited opposition views have been ignored. Despite having no mandate from the
 people, the SLORC tasked the Convention with drafting a new constitution that will
 guarantee a dominant role for the military in the country's future political struc-
 ture. Although the SLORC leadership met with detained prodemocracy leader Aung
 San Suu Kyi on two occasions, at year's end it remained unclear whether the Mili-
 tary Government is prepared to begin a genuine dialog with its opponents to achieve
 a peaceful political settlement.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow internal human rights organizations to exist, and
 it remained generally hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record (see Sec-
 tion 1.d. and 2.d.). However, in July Burmese Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw agreed
 in principle to hold consultations with the U.N. Secretary General regarding the
 human rights situation. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw met with-U.N.
 Undersecretary for Political Affairs Marrack Goulding during the U.N. General As-
 sembly and in Rangoon in November with Rafeeudin Ahmed, Deputy Head of the
 United Nations Development Program. At year's end both sides had agreed to con-
 tinue their discussions.
 In keepig with his mandate, in November the Government allowed U.N. Special
 Rapporteur Yozo Yokota to travel to Burma. However, in its written response to the
 Rapporteur's interim report, the Government denied allegations of extrajudicial
 killings, torture, and rape, and indicated that instances of arbitrary arrest and de-
 tention and forced labor were undertaken in "accordance with the law.'
 NGO representatives previously denied visas were able to travel to remote areas
 of the country and several others began negotiations with the Government to estab-
 lish humanitarian programs. In May ICRC representatives met with top govern-
 ment officials, and the SLORC agreed to accept a draft memorandum of understand-
 ing regarding prison visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-In general, women in Burma have traditionally enjoyed a high status,
 exercising most of the same basic rights as men and taking an active role in busi-
 ness. Consistent with traditional culture, they keep their own names after marriage
 and often control family finances. However, women remained under represented in
 most traditional male occupations, and a few professions continued to be entirely
 barred to women.
 Women did not consistently receive equal pay for equal work. There are no wom-
 en's rights organizations in Burma or any government agencies specifically devoted
 to safeguarding women's interests.
 There were reliable reports that many women and children in border areas, where
 the Government's control is limited, were forced or lured into working as prostitutes
 in Thailand. It is unknown how many young women have been duped into working
 as prostitutes, but a common practice is to lure young women to Thailand wit
 promises of employment as a waitress or domestic (See Thailand Report.). Also, the
 BuRMse military continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and
 there was a steady pattern of reports of rape of ethnic minority women by Burmese
 soldiers.
 Children.-Despite the establishment of various child welfare programs, the Gov-
 ernment allocated few resources for programs relevant to children, and cut the
 share of the national budget for education to 16 percent, with a mere 0.4 percent
 allocated to social welfare services (versus almost 38 percent for the military).
 Many families allowed their young daughters to travel to Thailand to work as
 prostitutes. The rising incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection
 h as increased demand for younger prostitutes.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Burma's myriad ethnic minorities have long
 resented the dominance of the country's Burman majority. The minorities have been
 under represented in the Government and largely excluded from the military leader-
 ship. Over the last few years and continuing in 1994, the SLORC, in the name of
 national solidarity, has sought to pacify these ethnic groups by means of negotiated
 cease-fires, grants of limited autonomy, and promises of development asslstance.
 The Government included a large number of ethnic minority representatives in the
 
 
 547
 National Convention and permitted extended debate on the issue of minority auton-
 omy. However, the ethnic minority populations complain that their concerns have
 not been addressed adequately by the Government.
 Government investment in the border areas in road, hospital, and school construc-
 tion has been modest at best and economic development among minorities has con-
 tinued to lag, leaving many living at barely subsistence levels. Since the focus of
 the hostilities against armed insurgencies has been in the border areas where most
 minorities are concentrated, those populations have been disproportionately victim-
 ized by the general brutalization associated with the militarys activities.
 Since only people who can prove long familial links to Bua are accorded full
 citizenship, ethmic populations, such as Muslims, Indians, and Chinese, continued
 to be demed full citizenship and to be excluded from government positions. People
 without full citizenship are not free to travel domestically and are barred from cer-
 tain advaned university programs in medicine and technological fields (iee Section
 2.d.). Anti-Chinese sentiment continued to increase.
 People With Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to government facilities.
 While there are several small-scale organizations to assist the disabled, most must
 rely on traditional family structures to provide for their welfare. Since 1986 Bur-
 mese authorities have permitted representatives of the ICRC to upgade provision
 of orthopedic prostheses. Because of landmines and train accidents, Burma has one
 of the highest rates of amputee injuries in the world.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There continued to be no functioning trade unions.
 Workers were not free to form such groups, and leaders of unofficia labor associa-
 tions remained subject to arrest. Workers continued to be unable to strike, and
 there were no reported instances of attempts to do so.
 In July 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade conces-
 sions under the Generalized System of Preferences Program, pending steps to afford
 its labor force internationally recognized worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to set wages and benefits. The Govern-
 ment's Central Arbitration Board, which theoretically provides a means for settling
 major labor disputes, continued to exist on paper but in practice was dormant.
 Township-level labor supervisory committees remained in place to address various
 low-level labor concerns.
 The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private sector,
 wages are set by market forces. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay
 salaries greater than those of ministers or other high-level employees. Joint ven-
 tures circumvent this with supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in for-
 eign exchange certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other
 fringe benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private
 sector but follow the example of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and
 benefits.
 No special export processing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law does. not contain provi-
 sions prohibiting forced labor. As the military stepped up its program of road, rail,
 dam, and other infrastructure projects, its recourse to forced labor also increased.
 It was conservatively estimated that many hundreds of thousands-if not more-
 of ordinary citizens were compelled to contribute labor to these public works, under-
 takings unsanctioned by any democratically elected authority. Two very large
 projects using forced labor drew international attention. From April to July, almost
 the entire adult population of Mandalay city was forced, along with thousands from
 outlying areas, to contribute labor or money to rehabilitate the moat around the
 Mandalay palace compound in preparation for the "Visit Myanmar Year." In south-
 ern Burma, tens of thousands of villagers were dragooned into clearing terrain and
 building embankments in harsh conditions along the route of the new Ye-Tavoy rail-
 w   *Minimurm Age for Employment of Children.-Although the law sets a minimum
 age for the employment of children, in practice the law is not enforced. Working
 cdren are highly visible in cities, mostly working for small or family enterprises.
 Children are hired at lower pay rates than adults for the same kind of work, and
 economic pressure forces them to work not only for their survival but also to support
 their families. Arts and crafts is the only sector producing for the export market
 which employs a significant number of children. Despite a compulsory education
 law, almost 40 percent of children never enroll in school, and only a quarter com-
 plete the basic education course.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Surplus labor conditions and lack of protection
 by government authorities continue to dictate substandard conditions for workers,
 despite recent annual economic grwth of at least 5 percent. The Law on Fundamen-
 tal Workers Rights of 1964 an? the Factories Act of 1951 regulate working condi-
 tions. There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the
 public sector and a 6-ay, 44-hour workweek for private and paxastatal sector em-
 ployees, with overtime paid for additional work. The law also allows for a 24-hour
 rest period per week and workers have 21 paid holidays a year. Such provisions ac-
 tually affect only a small portion of the country's labor force.
 Only government employees and employees of a few traditional industries are cov-
 ered by minimum wage prvisions. The minimum monthly wage for public employ-
 ees (based on the market exchange rate) is $6.00 (600 kyat), but this sum is supple-
 mented by various subsidies and allowances. The general daily minimum wage is
 $0.20 (20 kyats). These wage rates apply to the lowest level of government workers
 and some manual laborers; workers m the private sector are much better paid. The
 actual average wage rate for casual laborers in Rangoon rose slightly in 1994 to
 about three times the official minimum, still well below subsistence levels. Wage in-
 creases continued to lag far behind inflation.
 Numerous health and safety regulations exist on the books, but in practice the
 Government has not made the necessary resources available to those charged with
 their enforcement. By 1994 an International Labor Organization-supported training
 program for members of factory safety committees had reached about 400 personsd
 out of an estimated 2.43 million workers employed in registered and unregistere
 enterprises.
