 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic, with an active democratic multiparty
 system, energetic information media, strong unions, and an
 ardent commitment to democracy.
 Venezuela has enjoyed 27 years of democracy with power passing
 peacefully back and forth between the two major political
 parties. President Jaime Lusinchi and his Accion Democratica
 Party took the reins of government in February 1984 from the
 Social Christian COPEI party, defeated in the December 1983
 presidential elections.
 Venezuela has a mixed economy, with a large public sector.
 The state-owned petroleum industry accounts for some 20
 percent of the gross national product, more than any other
 industry. During the last few years, Venezuela has
 experienced economic problems resulting from a worldwide
 decrease in the demand for petroleum, a large foreign debt,
 and high government spending. Social benefits and supportive
 extended families have somewhat cushioned the impact of
 unemployment.
 Human rights violations, when they occur, tend to be well
 publicized and investigated. Venezuela is an active
 participant in international human rights forums and is noted
 within the hemisphere as a proponent of civil liberties and
 democratic rule. The principal focus of human rights
 discussion within Venezuela is on deficiencies in the
 country's judicial system. Delays in the trials of detainees
 are frequent, and there have been allegations of improper
 influence in the courts. Revisions of civil and criminal law
 procedures and codes are slowly proceeding.
 Inadequate prison conditions have been the subject of official
 reports, which focus on overcrowding. The prison population
 is reportedly double the capacity of the penal system's
 physical plant.
 Guerrilla activity has not been a major problem since the late
 1960s. There are occasional reports of small guerrilla groups
 in remote frontier areas, but they do not constitute a threat
 to Venezuela's security.
 There was little change in the overall human rights situation
 in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Authorities do not permit or engage in unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives. There have been instances of
 police and security forces shooting and killing criminal
 suspects on sight. Although not condoning these occurrences,
 the authorities have not acted effectively to stop them.
 b. Disappearance
 Police authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 people in clandestine confinement. The authorities have
 resorted to the use of checkpoints to induct young men who
 
 
 703
 VENEZUELA
 have evaded obligatory military service. The inductees are at
 times held incommunicado for a month with no word to family or
 friends as to their whereabouts or physical condition.
 There are occasional kidnappings for ransom, especially on
 Venezuela's border with Colombia. Some of these may be
 attributable to small guerrilla groups crossing the border.
 c.    Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Venezuelan law prohibits the torture of prisoners; this
 prohibition is respected in practice. Guarantees for the
 integrity of the individual embodied in the Constitution are
 enforced.
 Laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are generally respected. Some infractions occur,
 however, because of excesses on the part of local law
 enforcement officials or inadequate supervision of prison
 guards. Prison conditions are spartan, at times very poor;
 many prisons are seriously overcrowded, discipline is
 sometimes inadequate, and violence does occur, especially in
 the more crowded prisons. Those responsible for such violence
 are not known to be punished. A contributing  factor is the
 low educational level and limited training of many prison
 guards.
 d.    Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus is a right guaranteed by law and is respected.
 Arrested persons legally cannot be held more than eight days
 without formal charges. The limits are frequently exceeded,
 however, usually because of inefficiencies in the legal
 system.
 According to the Attorney General's 1984 report, approximately
 75 percent of the 24,000 persons in prison have not yet been
 brought to trial.
 The case of four individuals charged with the bombing of a
 Cuban airliner and detained since 1976 still has not been
 resolved. Following a ruling finding the earlier charges
 defective, the case is now being retried.
 The detention of undocumented foreign workers, mainly from
 Colombia, may have diminished as illegal immigration has
 declined. Once in police custody, undocumented foreign
 nationals are frequently held incommunicado for three to six
 months without trial before being deported.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor; unremunerated labor is
 prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and usually observed in
 practice. The accused is presumed innocent until guilt is
 proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Civilians charged with
 armed subversion are tried by military courts.
 The civilian judiciary is independent but in practice is not
 immune from influence by the political parties. In response
 to the current administration's campaign against corruption,
 there has been increased public sensitivity to the
 
 
 704
 VENEZUELA
 qualificatons of judges, the quality of their work and their
 susceptibility to outside influence. The Judicial Council, an
 independent body responsible for the training, nomination and
 disciplining of judges, actively investigates allegations of
 inappropriate conduct, and has taken severe disciplinary
 action in a number of cases. The administration is aware that
 further efforts are required.
 There are periodic press reports regarding alleged political
 prisoners in Venezuela. These persons--numbering several
 dozens--are considered insurgents by the Government and
 prosecuted by the military courts where the state is under no
 enforceable time limit in adjudicating the cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and laws provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safeguards are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Venezuela boasts a free and vigorous daily press, three
 nationwide television networks, a regional television station,
 about 156 radio stations, and numerous magazines; they are
 frequently highly critical of the authorities. The Government
 owns and operates two of the four television networks and two
 of the radio stations. Venezuela's print media are privately
 owned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held frequently, without interference. In the interest of
 public safety, permits are required for protest marches.
 An object of "special protection" under the Constitution,
 labor unions are free, independent, and powerful. They have
 the right to strike and to bargain collectively. Unions
 associate with the recognized public and private international
 bodies in their fields. The Confederacion de Trabajadores de
 Venezuela, an International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 affiliate, dominates organized labor in Venezuela, and has
 close ties to the ruling AD party. Other confederations
 occupy a lesser role on the labor scene, including two which
 are of Christian Democratic orientation and which are
 affiliated with the Latin American Confederation of Workers
 and have ties to the World Confederation of Labor.
 Professional and academic associations flourish without
 interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Most
 religious groups enjoy freedom of'worship and are allowed to
 proselytize actively. A number of Protestant evangelical
 groups in remote areas of Venezuela are performing
 humanitarian as well as missionary work among the local
 population.

 VENEZUELA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens of Venezuela generally have freedom of movement to
 travel within the country and abroad and to return. The one
 exception pertains to travel in the Amazon Region of the
 country, which requires a special permit for security
 reasons.
 Venezuelans may emigrate without restriction. Citizenship can
 be renounced. The Constitution provides for the revocation of
 citizenship for naturalized citizens on specific and limited
 legal grounds. Recovery of nationality requires a residence
 period of two years for Venezuelan-born repatriates.
 Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for refugees and
 displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. As Venezuela does not recognize a "refugee status"
 for entry, refugees are given normal residence status and once
 within the country are expelled only for criminal activities.
 A special "family reunification program" exists for-Cuban
 refugees living in Venezuela.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected. As a multiparty democracy,
 the political process is open to all; opposition views are
 freely expressed and persons from the entire political
 spectrum contend for positions ranging from municipal council
 seats to the nation's presidency.
 Some of the minor parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations, and they currently hold about seven percent of
 the seats in the national legislature. Their participation in
 the political process is encouraged and supported by the two
 major centrist parties, Social Christian and Social Democrat,
 reflecting a widespread desire to have radical elements
 participate in the electoral process rather than engage in
 armed insurrection. These minor, mainly leftist, parties have
 been unable to win the electoral sympathies of voters and, as
 a consequence, they currently appear to be incapable of
 increasing their percentage of representatives in the national
 legislature.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Venezuela is a frequent and vocal critic of non-democratic
 governments in Latin America and elsewhere that commit or
 tolerate widespread human rights violations. It supports
 international human rights organizations. An.Amnesty
 International office and the Latin American Foundation for
 Human Rights and Social Development operate freely in
 Caracas. Venezuela in 1985 was the site of several
 international forums dealing with the issue of human rights.
 Venezuela is a member of the UN Human Rights Commission.
 Freedom House describes Venezuela as "free." Amnesty
 International's 1985 report expresses concern about the
 prolonged detention without judgment of civilians held under
 the military justice system.

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1985, the population was 17,317,000 with a growth rate of
 2.7 percent. The per capita GNP was $3840 (1983 figure).
 Venezuela continued to experience economic difficulties in
 1985 that required retrenchment of public sector spending and
 an upward adjustment of prices to reflect real costs. There
 was an estimated unemployment rate of 15 percent, an increase
 in business bankruptcies, and a considerable decrease in
 general purchasing power. Although the Government has sought
 to cushion the social effects, the poorest stratum of the
 population lives a marginal existence worsened by these
 adverse economic conditions. Despite austerity, the
 Government continues efforts to improve education, housing,
 and public health services for poorer Venezuelans. It has
 adopted a series of compensatory measures to offset the impact
 of decreased buying power on poorer workers and is actively
 seeking to create new jobs and combat inflation.
 Life expectancy at birth is 68.5 years and the infant
 mortality rate is 37.3 per 1,000 live births. The ratio of
 caloric supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 101.6 percent in 1981. The
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio was 102 per cent in
 1981 and the adult literacy rate was 85 percent in 1985.
 The law sets a minmum age of 14 for employment, and then with
 certain restrictions applying. The Government establishes a
 minimum wage. There is an eight hour workday and a 48 hour
 workweek for workers over age 16. The law provides for health
 and safety regulation and inspection of the workplace.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex
 and accords women and children "special protection" in the
 workplace. Women workers receive extensive maternity leave
 benefits, and laws limit their amount of involuntary overtime.
 Women are heavily represented in many of the professions but
 continue to be underrepresented in the political and economic
 sectors and differences still exist in wage and employment
 opportunities. Overall there is a firm trend toward greater
 equality for women. Recent reforms in Venezuelan laws have
 been designed to promote greater economic rights for women.
 Women are increasingly active in all political parties,
 professions, public administration, and the judiciary. About
 a dozen are members of the Chamber of Deputies, including one
 who is the assistant leader of the AD parliamentary faction
 and another who is a vice president of a permanent committee.
 Both major political parties have women members on the
 national executive committees.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion or
 social status do not exist, but there are some restrictions on
 ownership of business property based on nationality.
