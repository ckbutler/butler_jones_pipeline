 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy and a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen is
 recognized as Head-of State and is represented in the Bahamas
 by an appointed Governor General. The Progressive Liberal
 Party (PLP) has governed since 1967 under Prime Minister Sir
 Lynden 0. Pindling, and was last returned to power in the June
 1987ogeneral elections.
 Thepolice and a small defense force are answerable to
 civilian authority and generally respect laws protecting human
 rights. However, there have been credible reports that police
 physically..abuse detainees, both Bahamian citizens and Haitian
 illegal migrants.
 Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for
 approximately half of the Bahamas' gross national product,
 while financial services, especially offshore banking,
 represent the second most important economic sector.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental
 human rights and freedom from discrimination on the basis of
 sex, race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.
 The principal areas of human rights concerns were, as in past
 years, police abuse of detainees and the appalling condition
 of the prison system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politically motivated killings are not known to occur, but
 there are occasional instances of killings of detainees in
 official custody. On July 31 a 23 year-old man, Dwayne
 Bannister, was allegedly beaten to death while in police
 custody. Police claim that he "resisted violently" during the
 course of his arrest. The Minister of National Security,
 responsible for the police and the Royal Bahamas Defense Force
 (RBDF) ordered an investigation. No results had been
 announced by year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention during 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or
 degrading treatment or punishment. The police generally
 respect the constitutional safeguards prohibiting such
 practices, but there were credible charges that in some cases
 the investigative branches resorted to coercion and physical
 abuse of detainees. The two most publicized cases of this
 type involved the beating of five young men while in police
 custody in Alice Town, Bimini in July and the reported fatal
 beating of a detainee by the police in late July (see Section
 l.a.). Both cases were under investigation at year's end.
 The Grand Bahama Human Rights Association has at least 8 cases
 of alleged police brutality under investigation.

 THE BAHAMAS
 Reportedly, Haitians in jail and prison are abused more
 frequently than are Bahamians. Haitians in the Bahamas
 illegally are repatriated by the hundreds, and while in the
 country are subject to pressures and harassment related to
 their status.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, the Bahamas' sole prison facility,
 remain harsh. The maximum security facility is severely
 understaffed and overcrowded. As many as five male prisoners
 are housed in 6-foot by 8-foot cells designed for no more than
 two. Sanitation facilities in the prison are primitive,
 consisting basically of a bucket or open trench. Many
 prisoners sleep on thin pads on the bare floor. The
 Government completed plans in 1990 to begin the construction
 of a $6 million prison facility at Fox Hill.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Detainees must be charged within 48 hours, and arrested
 persons are generally allowed access to an attorney of their
 own choosing. The right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention is respected. The Government is
 obligated to provide legal representation to those who cannot
 afford it only in cases of capital crimes. Illegal migrants,
 mostly Haitians and a small number of Cubans, have the right
 to retain legal representation but are generally held at Fox
 Hill prison pending deportation unless they can arrange
 private means for their own repatriation. As a result,
 illegal migrants may be held at Fox Hill for weeks or months
 while transportation is arranged.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Bahamian legal system is based on English Common Law but
 shares some features of the U.S. legal system. The judiciary
 is independent, appointed by the executive branch on the
 advice of a Judicial and Legal Services Commission, and
 conducts fair and public trials. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and lawyers are permitted free access
 to their clients. Legal representation at public expense is
 provided only for capital cases.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interefere in the private lives of its
 citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search,
 or seizure and requires a court order for the entry into and
 search of private property. Aside from restrictions on prison
 mail, the Government neither censors mail nor restricts
 receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for the right of free expression, a
 right that is respected in practice. The political opposition
 freely criticizes the Government. Three daily and two weekly
 newspapers are privately owned and express a variety of views
 on matters of public interest; they are frequently critical of
 the Government and its policies. There is, however, a tendency
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 THE BAHAMAS
 toward self-censorship when it comes to identifying by name
 government officials or private individuals who may be
 involved in controversial issues. The threat of libel suits
 under laws unchanged since the 19th century results in
 cautious treatment of stories about fraud, corruption, or
 moral turpitude.
 The Government holds a monopoly on local radio and television
 broadcasting, and opposition initiatives to secure private
 ownership of radio stations have been thwarted by the
 Government's majority in Parliament. The radio and television
 network covers the views of the Government and the activities
 of government Ministers quite extensively; opposing viewpoints
 and opposition activities are generally given little
 attention'. However, a "gentlemen's agreement," struck in
 July, permitted greater access to broadcast time for
 opposition politicians. Throughout the remainder of the year
 the opposition leader in Parliament, Hubert Ingraham, was
 heard regularly on the radio network ZNS. The Government does
 not restrict the ownership of satellite antennas, and many
 Bahamians have access to international news programs on
 satellite television, as well as to direct reception of radio
 and television from southern Florida. U.S. publications enter
 the country freely. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights to free assembly and
 association. These rights are respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion in the Bahamas. There is no
 favored or official state religion, but most church members
 belong to Protestant denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, EMmigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within the Bahamas, and citizens
 may travel freely abroad. Large groups of Haitians fleeing
 their homeland for political and economic reasons continued to
 enter the Bahamas. Although The Bahamas is signatory to the
 U.N. Protocol of 1967 relating to refugees, Cuban asylum
 seekers were treated as- illegal immigrants and jailed for
 varying periods until some other country, usually the United
 States, arranged to admit them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty
 political system, governed by an elected Prime Minister and
 Parliament. The political process is open to all elements of
 society, and citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible
 to register and vote.
 The two principal political parties are the governing PLP and
 the opposition Free National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the
 country for 6 1/2 years of internal self-government from
 January 1967 until independence in July 1973, and has held
 power under Prime Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling since then.
 The PLP currently holds 32 of 49 seats in Parliament's House
 of Assembly; the FNM holds the other 17. The last general
 election in June 1987 returned the PLP to power with
 
 
 502
 THE BAHAMAS
 its clear parliamentary majority. Challenges by the
 opposition based on charges of electoral violations produced
 no changes in the results. The next general elections must-
 take place by June 1992.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are three local human rights groups, The Grand Bahama
 Human Rights Organization, the New Providence Human Rights
 Organization, and the Abaco Human Rights Organization. The
 Government placed no restrictions on their activities during
 1990. No international human rights organization visited the
 Bahamas to investigate human rights conditions during 1990.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 The Constitution protects individual rights and freedoms
 regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion, creed
 or sex of the individual. However, the Bahamian Constitution
 does distinguish between the sexes when it prevents Bahamian
 women from bestowing citizenship upon their foreign-born
 spouses. Women participate fully in Bahamian society and are
 well represented in the business and professional sectors, as
 well as in the judiciary and in government. There does not
 appear to be a significant wage gap between men and women.
 Domestic violence against women has become an issue of intense
 concern in the Bahamas with independent women's support groups
 reporting that about 100 women per month seek shelter at the
 Women's Crisis Center in Nassau. Women may have their cases
 heard in a closed domestic court and may seek a restraining
 order against an abusive spouse or male companion. Women's
 rights groups speak freely on ways to improve the condition of
 women and children, and helped draft a bill introduced in 1989
 to strengthen measures against spousal abuse by criminalizing
 spousal rape, incest, and sexual harassment in the workplace.
 The bill was under consideration in committee, and both
 government and opposition MP's stated that passage was likely
 during the 1990-91 legislative session.
 Many Haitians in the Bahamas are illegal immigrants and face
 economic and social deprivation, and sometimes mistreatment by
 police and members of the defense forces. In July 1990, a
 Haitian citizen who is a legal permanent resident of the
 United States was picked up by a Bahamian immigration officer
 while visiting Nassau. He charged that he was not allowed to
 produce his U.S.resident identity card and was treated roughly
 by immigration officials. The Minister of Immigration and
 Employment responded personally to U.S. Embassy inquiries and
 gave assurances that the allegations would be investigated.
 By year's end the Embassy had not received the results of the
 investigation.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides the rights of free assembly and
 association, specifically mentioning labor unions. Unions
 operate without restriction or governmental control and are
 guaranteed the right to maintain affiliations with
 international trade union organizations, and to strike. The
 
 
 THE BAHAMAS
 labor force is highly organized, with some 36 unions. The
 Commonwealth of the Bahamas Trade Union Congress (TUC) is
 comprised of 10 unions, some headquartered in Freeport and
 some in Nassau, and is a member of the International'
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Caribbean
 Confederation of Labor. TUC-affiliated unions represent
 30,000 employees in the public and private sectors, according
 to the TUC Secretary General..
 There were no formal strikes during 1990, but the &,000-member
 Bahamas Hotel Catering and Allied Workers Union (BHCAWU), the
 country's largest, did initiate a series of labor actions to
 press demands for increased wages and benefits. Slowdowns and
 walkouts were called at major resorts and casinos between
 January and July. The union and the Bahamas Hotel Employers
 Association finally reached agreement on a new contract in
 August.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to organize and collective bargaining is
 extensive for the 30 percent of the work force which is
 unionized. However, employers have attempted to discourage
 the organization of retail and restaurant employees.
 The Department of Labor is responsible for mediating disputes
 and did provide mediation and arbitration services during the
 course of the hotel dispute (see Section 6-a.). The
 protracted conflict between the hotel workers and their
 employers prompted the Government to introduce legislation to
 set up an industrial court system and to strengthen existing
 laws on arbitration and conciliation.
 The Industrial Relations Act mandates that employers recognize
 trade unions. The Industrial Relations Board within the
 Department of Labor performs conciliation between individual
 employees or unions and their employers.
 Labor laws and regulations are enforced uniformly throughout
 The Bahamas. There are two small and not particularly active
 free trade zones; labor law and practice are the same in them
 as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no legal minimum age for employment of children, but
 compulsory education for children up to the age of 14 years
 effectively discourages child employment.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regular workweek to 48
 hours. The Labor Department of the Ministry of Employment and
 Immigration is responsible for enforcing labor laws and has a
 team of 3 or 4 inspectors to enforce occupational health and
 safety standards. Employers generally cooperate with
 inspections in implementing safety standards. The Fair Labor
 Standards Act has minimum wage provisions, but there are no
 legislated minimum wage levels. Wage levels in the
 tourist-oriented economy provide a decent standard of living
 for workers.
