 URUGUAY
 Uruguay has been ruled since 1973 by a collegiate military
 government composed of the President, currently a retired army
 general, and the three service chiefs. Major decisions are
 made by the military's general officers. Active or retired
 military officers head many of Uruguay's 19 departments
 (states) and hold nigh positions in some ministries. However,
 with the Transition Accord reached on August 3 between
 political parties and the Armed Forces, general elections
 successfully realized in November, and a civilian government
 to be inaugurated on.March 1, 1985, Uruguay has begun a
 process of broad political participation and is returning to
 its democratic traditions.
 Though continuing to suffer a serious recession, Uruguay
 remains one of the more advanced developing countries. Its
 economy is largely one of free enterprise capitalism, with the
 Government regulating monopolies in key sectors and
 controlling many basic-prices. Uruguay has had advanced
 social welfare programs and limits on the political role of
 the church since early in this century.
 In the late 1960's Uruguay entered a period of economic and
 political malaise that culminated in the breakdown of social
 institutions and the appearance of urban terrorism by the
 Marxist oriented Tupamaros. In 1972, the elected civilian
 Government enacted a national security law which limited
 individual liberties and expanded police and military powers.
 In 1973, differences between the Armed Forces and the Congress
 over the conduct of the anti-terrorist campaign led to the
 closure of the legislature and a shift to military rule. From
 the beginning, however, the Armed Forces declared their
 intention to restore democratic institutions. In 1980,
 following rejection in a plebiscite of a government-sponsored
 draft amending the 1967 Constitution, the Armed Forces
 established a timetable calling for internal political party
 elections in 1982, general elections in 1984, and the
 inauguration of an elected government in March 1985.
 This timetable has thus far been adhered to, and the human
 rights situation in Uruguay improved dramatically in 1984.
 Although the Government maintained tight control early tn the
 year by closing publications, prohibiting demonstrations, and
 regulating other activities it considered inimical to the
 public welfare, the environment gradually improved. Following
 renewed transition discussions in July between political
 parties and the Armed Forces, the Government lifted press
 censorship, revoked institutional acts prohibiting political
 activities and gatherings, rehabilitated the Socialist and
 Christian Democratic Parties, and "deproscribed" over 7000
 politicians of the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist
 parties. The Government also restored political rights to
 active members of the Armed Forces and police which had been
 suspended since 1976. The Government permitted major
 demonstrations by labor unions on May 1, and by the political
 parties during the election campaign.
 More than 400 "national security" prisoners were released
 during the year, the majority freed under the Government's
 early release program that began in August, with the
 possibility that more prisoners, except those convicted of
 violent crimes, would De released prior to March 1, 1985. The
 
 
 688
 URUGUAY
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) made three
 visits to national security prisoners in 1984 and a third was
 scheduled in November. The total number of "national
 security" prisoners dropped from 843 in October 1983, to 369
 as of December 31, 1984.
 The Government has maintained its ban on the Communist Party
 and other political groups associated with the Tupamaro
 violence of the last decade. Liber Seregni, the Broad Front's
 leader and 1971 presidential candidate, was released from
 prison in March but was banned from being a political
 candidate for two years.
 Exiled Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira Aldunate, and his
 son, Juan Raul, were arrested upon their return to Uruguay
 from self-exile on June 16 and charged with crimes based
 mainly on their actions abroad in opposing the military
 regime. Juan Raul Ferreira was released in August, and became
 a successful candidate for the Senate. His father was not
 released until November 30, after the Supreme Court nullified
 the two principal charges against him and five days after the
 election, in which the Blanco Party ran a substitute
 candidate. Ferreira has resumed leadership of the Blanco
 Party while free on bail awaiting action on a lesser charge.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 While there is no indication of any government-instigated
 Killings for political reasons in 1984, an Uruguayan physician
 died as a result of physical abuse while undergoing
 interrogation in a military unit (See below).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearances in Uruguay in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In April, an Uruguayan physician of Russian descent was
 arrested for suspected subversive activities and subsequently
 died while undergoing interrogation in military custody. An
 autopsy revealed he had suffered massive damage to his
 internal organs. Following an investigation, the Government
 relieved two army officers, charging them with responsibility
 in the doctor's death. Two youths, who were among others
 arrested in June 1983 on charges of being communist activists,
 were releaseb this year and reported that they had been
 tortured during initial interrogation at police intelligence
 headquarters. The New York Academy of Sciences mission to
 Uruguay in March 1984 found medical evidence in support of
 torture allegations during interviews with several prison
 inmates. Other released prisoners have recounted similar
 experiences from years past.
 Human rights groups and prisoners' relatives have protested
 what they consider to be unduly harsh conditions in Uruguay's
 two national security prisons. For example, there were
 reports of prison personnel, during winter, dousing prisoners
 
 
 .689
 URUGUAY
 in unheated-cells with buckets of cold water. An Uruguayan
 human rights group, the Peace and Justice Service (SERPAJ),
 issued a medical alert in August charging that health and
 living conditions in the prisons had deteriorated, and that
 medical treatment received by ill prisoners was inadequate.
 According to the Government, although treatment of prisoners
 is strict, inmates receive the same quality of medical care as
 is provided to members of the Armed Forces. Human rights
 groups and political party representatives recommended special
 consideration be given to freeing seriously ill prisoners
 under the Government's early release program.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Before the August 3 Transition Accord, there were several
 incidents in which small groups of demonstrators were arrested
 and then quickly released. In March, a melee occurred at the
 end of a Carnival parade when youths shouting anti-government
 slogans threw rocks and bottles at police. Sixty were
 arrested, then released the next day. A similar scenario
 occurred on June 3 when police broke up a demonstration in
 downtown Montevideo, detaining several youths for a few
 hours. Journalists were also detained for writing articles
 considered offensive to the Government but were usually
 released within a few days. Some demonstrators, who entered
 the Foreign Ministry and City Hall protesting the imprisonment
 of Blanco Party leader Wilson Ferreira, were arrested or
 required to report to the local police for an identity check,
 but all were released without incident. In June, Blanco Party
 leader Carlos Julio Pereyra was taken into protective custody
 for a few hours because of an alleged threat against him.
 Political leaders denounced the action as an attempt to
 intimidate opposition figures.
 Individuals arrested under the civilian penal code are
 normally brought before a civilian judge within 48 hours and
 allowed access to a defense attorney at that time. 'National
 security' prisoners, however, are subject to trial under the
 military justice system, which is closed to public scrutiny.
 Prisoners can legally be detained for weeks without being
 charged or allowed access to legal counsel. One prisoner, who
 completed her sentence in June 1983, was held in a military
 unit until her release in July 1984. Others, like some of the
 youths arrested in June 1983, have been released before legal
 proceedings are completed. In a key provision of the
 Transition Accord, the Armed Forces and political parties
 agreed that after the installation of a civilian government in
 March 1985, military justice will apply to civilians only in a
 state of war or insurrection.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Independence of the judiciary was formally restored in 1981,
 but the full independence of the civilian judiciary has not
 been reestablished. Under Uruguay's legal tradition, both the
 civilian and military court systems use written procedures
 which are usually closed to the public. Juries are not used
 and the judge makes a decision based on written summaries.
 The defendant in a civilian or military court may employ a
 lawyer of his or her own choosing or use a lawyer provided by
 the Government.
 A person accused of subversive activities is subject to trial
 under the military justice system. Human rights organizations
 
 
 690
 URUGUAY
 have charged that the system is'often arbitrary, and fails to
 guarantee due process and adequate protection of the
 defendant. Military tribunals often impose restrictions on
 the defense attorney's access to the complete case file,
 limiting the ability to mount an effective defense of the
 accused.
 On December 31, the number of national security prisoners
 stood at 369, down from 843 in October 1983. Uruguay's
 highest military judicial body, the Supreme Military Tribunal,
 will meet in two review sessions before March 1985 to consider
 for early release the remaining prisoners who are not
 convicted of violent crimes and have completed over half the
 sentence against them.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home are respected in
 non-security cases but are suspended under the interim
 security measures for persons suspected of terrorism,
 subversion, or other national security violations. It is
 widely assumed the authorities tap the telephones of some
 political leaders and perhaps other persons. The Government,
 as a rule, does not otherwise interfere with the private lives
 of its citizens.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 1984 witnessed the end to most restrictions on the information
 media in Uruguay. Early in the year, the authorities
 continued past practices of taking punitive, arbitrary actions
 against news organs that published articles considered to be
 overly critical of the Government. Journalists were often
 warned to avoid criticism of the Armed Forces and to avoid
 references to proscribed politicians. In June, and again in
 September, several journalists were briefly detained for
 writing articles referring to the Armed Forces' involvement in
 torture.   The Government's press and public relations office
 (DINARP), run by military officers, monitored compliance with
 guidelines that were not made public. Prior to August's
 Transition Accord, the Government closed nine papers, four
 permanently, for publishing stories about the Broad Front, the
 return of Wilson Ferreira, or demonstrations in defiance of
 the Government's ban. The authorities also closed a
 television station for three days for broadcasting an
 interview with a proscribed politician. However, for every
 paper closed, a new one, sometimes produced by the same staff,
 arose, focusing on the same issues as before.
 Following the signing of the August 3 transition document, the
 Government revoked its August 1983 decree which prohibited
 reporting on political activity. This action along with the
 discontinuance in February of 'prior censorship* of political
 party weeklies, has freed Uruguay's information media to
 report political developments as they occur. Recently, the
 growth of publications has been constrained primarily by
 economic factors. Occasionally the Government has preempted
 scheduled television programming to broadcast warnings about
 the resurgence of communist influence, and sometimes it
 requires the dailies to publish inserts alerting the
 
 
 691
 URUGUAY
 populace. While many foreign publications circulate freely in
 Uruguay, issues with articles critical of the Government or
 the Armed Forces have sometimes been prohibited from entering
 the country. The Government prohibits sale of books authored
 by alleged Marxists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association expanded significantly in
 1984, primarily as a consequence of the Transition Accord.
 The Government rehabilitated the Christian Democratic and
 Socialist Parties and other noncommunist groups within the
 Broad Front coalition. Although the Communist Party and
 political entities associated with the Tupamaro movement
 remained proscribed, (i.e., unable to field candidates), they
 regained the right to vote and were otherwise active in the
 electoral campaign. Early in the year, the Government banned
 a march commemorating International Women's Day and prohibited
 all gatherings without a police permit. Since July, however,
 there have been no restrictions on political gatherings or
 rallies, and the requirement for the police permit is no
 longer enforced. As elections approached, many political,
 social, and student groups gathered peacefully without
 incident. There were no remaining restrictions on national
 election campaign rallies. Office seekers appeared at rallies
 in Montevideo and in the interior, and also in televised
 debates. In such appearances, candidates were uninhibited in
 their remarks or criticisms of the Government and its
 policies. The Government also allowed daily afternoon
 demonstrations by followers of Blanco leader Wilson Ferreira,
 who was at that time imprisoned. It briefly detained those
 participants who caused disorder by entering government
 buildings.
 Uruguayan law permits the formation of unions, federations,
 and confederations. In practice, the Government generally has
 allowed only the formation of provisional worker associations
 which function as unions but are not legally recognized as
 such. The Interunion Workers Assembly (PIT) successfully
 organized a general strike in January, the first in Uruguay in
 more than a decade; a May 1 labor rally; and a nationwide work
 stoppage on June 27. Though officially banned, the PIT is the
 dominant labor organization in Uruguay and is actively
 participating with political, labor, and social groups
 organizing in preparation for the return to civilian
 government in 1985. The PIT and several other de facto
 confederations maintain contacts with international bodies,
 including the International Labor Organization.
 The Uruguayan Government has cooperated with the ILO in
 drafting and revising legislation governing trade union
 organizations, indicating a measure of progress in conforming
 with the Convention on Freedom of Association and Protection
 of the Right to Organize. However the ILO found in the first
 half of 1984 that despite partial progress, the practical
 application of new legislation remained a matter of serious
 concern, particularly regarding the right of association of
 public officials, the exercise of the right to strike, the
 legal recognition of union organizations, and the freeing of
 detained union leaders. Since the ILO findings in early 1984,
 there has been considerable improvement in the labor area.
 The Cultural and Education Association of Students of Public
 Education (ASCEEP) has become increasingly active at the
 
 
 692
 URUGUAY
 university and secondary level as students have started to
 organize and express themselves politically. In June, the
 ASCEEP held its first national conference, symbolically
 linking itself to the outlawed University Student Federation
 (FEUU) that existed at the National University until the 1973
 government takeover. On August 27 the Government ended its
 eleven-year intervention in the administration of the National
 University and announced a schedule of elections for student
 and faculty bodies to oversee the autonomous management of the
 institution.
 The many private, especially professional, associations in
 Uruguay, operate with few restrictions and generally do not
 participate in political activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and respected
 in Uruguay.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on internal travel, although
 recently released national security prisoners are required to
 report to local authorities every 15 days. The Government
 sometimes delays or denies passports or passport renewals to
 individuals with radical political affiliations or those
 suspected of national security offenses. Since March,
 increasing numbers of Uruguayan expatriates have been
 returning--with some discovering on arrival that they are on
 the Government's wanted list, leading to their exclusion or
 temporary detention. Human rights groups as well as political
 leaders have urged the Government to publish the wanted list
 and provide it to Uruguayan embassies and consulates, so that
 returnees will know what to expect when they come back. Many
 Broad Front leaders returned after years in exile and actively
 participated in the electoral campaign. A high percentage of
 the population, estimated at over ten percent, has emigrated
 in the last decade, primarily for economic reasons.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change their Government
 The Armed Forces have governed in Uruguay since 1973.
 Executive power is vested in the President, a retired General,
 and in the three service Commanders-in-Chief. An appointed
 Council of State, or legislative body, participates in decison
 making; however, its influence is limited. Democratic
 elections for constitutional government were held November 25,
 1984.
 Since assuming power, the Armed Forces have declared
 themselves to be a transitional government. In 1981, they
 established a timetable for a return to democracy, including
 internal political party elections in November 1982; a general
 election in November 1984; and inauguation of an elected
 government in March 1985. Military spokemen repeatedly have
 reiterated tneir commitment to that timetable and so far have
 adhered to it. In July, the Government "deproscribed" over
 7000 Broad Front politicians and rehabilitated the Christian
 Democratic and Socialist Parties. Together, these parties,
 plus the Blancos, Colorados, and Civic Union, fielded over
 1000 lists of national and local candidates in the general
 
 
 693
 URUGUAY
 election on November 25. All political parties denounced the
 Government's treatment of Wilson Ferreira as a political
 maneuver designed to prevent him from participating in the
 elections. In turn the Blanco Party refused to participate in
 transition negotiations with the military in protest over
 Ferreira's continuing detention in prison. In spite of Blanco
 Party resistance, Wilson Ferreira withdrew his candidacy for
 President, and the Blancos nominated a substitute candidate,
 Alberto Zumaran, who campaigned on a platform calling for new
 elections without prohibitions on parties or persons.
 The Colorado Party's presidential candidate, Julio
 Sanguinetti, won the election with 41 percent of the vote,
 with the Blancos winning 35 percent, and the Broad Front 22
 percent. While the Communist Party and small or leftist
 splinter groups were prevented from running candidates for
 election, their members were allowed to vote. Uruguay does
 not exclude ethnic minorities or women from electoral
 participation. Voting is obligatory.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The human rights situation in Uruguay continues to be of
 concern to various international and non-governmental
 organizations. In February, the Government received a special
 representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for a week of
 confidential discussions on human rights issues. The
 Government permitted a delegation sponsored by the New York
 Academy of Sciences to visit selected national security
 prisoners in March and July, the first non-governmental group
 to receive such permission in recent years. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross continued its visits, which resumed
 in 1983, conducting private interviews with and medical
 examinations of national security prisoners in March and July.
 In August senior government officials met with representatives
 of the Washington Office on Latin America, which later
 sponsored an observation mission for the elections.
 The Government criticizes Amnesty International for being
 consistently hostile and demonstrating partiality to the
 extreme left. The authorities are also reluctant to invite
 groups such as the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to
 visit, feeling they have already reached negative
 conclusions. However, few non-governmental investigators are
 prohibited from entering the country and meeting with private
 citizens, including opposition leaders.
 Local human rights groups include the Peace and Justice
 Service (SERPAJ), the Uruguayan Human Rights Commission, and
 human rights committees of the various political parties. In
 August, the Uruguayan Bar Association announced that a group
 of distinguished attorneys was willing to handle cases of
 national security prisoners. SERPAJ, though officially
 proscribed in August 1983, continues to function, publishing
 reports urging prisoner releases and improved prison
 conditions. Local human rights groups joined the media in
 pressing for an investigation into the details surrounding the
 death in April of the Uruguayan physician held in military
 custody. They have had little success, however, in effecting
 any prisoner releases. Amnesty International in its 1984
 report (covering the year 1983) expressed concern about the
 large number and mistreatment of national security prisoners;
 
 
 694
 URUGUAY
 tne continuing practice of unacknowledged detention; the
 administrative detention of prisoners who had completed their
 sentences; the use of torture; and inhumane prison
 conditions. The New York Academy of Science reported similar
 concerns, as well as allegations of the involvement of medical
 professionals in the use of torture. Freedom House in 1984,
 rated Uruguay "partly free' but with expected imminent change
 toward freedom.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Uruguay's 1983 per capita gross domestic product of U.S.
 $3,282 was lower than in the previous two years. The
 incidence of extreme poverty is low, although it has increased
 over the past year.   The vast majority of the population
 enjoys an adequate diet and at least a minimal standard of
 living. Uruguay had a population of 2.9 million in 1984 and
 an annual population growth rate of 0.3 percent. In 1984,
 life expectancy at birth was 73 years and infant mortality was
 27 per 1,000 live births. In 1975, 84 percent of the
 population had access to safe water. Health care is free to
 the poor and available at nominal cost to others. The caloric
 supply available for consumption in 1977 in Uruguary was 104.7
 percent of nutritional requirements.
 Uruguay had a 94 percent literacy rate in 1975, and virtually
 all children receive a primary school education. The adjusted
 primary school enrollment ratio was 123.7 in 1981. Secondary
 school attendance is relatively high, and university education
 is free. Male students outnumber females in higher education
 by a small margin.
 Women in Uruguay are accorded equality before the law. They
 attend the National University and pursue professional careers
 in large numbers. A woman serves on the Supreme Court of
 Justice and two women were named as ambassadors in 1984.
 Though women hold few important positions in the political
 parties, some ran as Senate and Deputy candidates. The
 Vice-Presidential candidate of a minority faction of the
 Blanco Party was a woman. Barriers to equality still exist,
 however, stemming from traditional social patterns and
 restricted employment opportunities. Pay is not always equal
 for women and men, especially for ordinary workers in the
 private sector.
 For half a century, social welfare and wider income
 distribution were prime objectives of economic policy. Income
 in the postwar period was as evenly spread in Uruguay as in
 western Europe. However, output stagnated in the period
 1955-74 while inflation soared. After 1974, under new
 policies and a more favorable international market, the
 economy grew significantly until 1981. Then, during 1982, the
 economy shrank 9.7 percent, and declined 4.7 percent in 1983.
 Altnougn inflation fell to 20 percent in 1982, it rose to 52
 percent in 1983 and was expected to top 60 percent in 1984.
 Unemployment has increased from less than six percent in 1981
 to an officially estimated 14 percent currently. The index of
 real wages is currently about 50 percent below what it was ten
 years ago.
