 INDONESIA
 Indonesia is a very large, populous, developing country whose people come from
 hundreds of different ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. With the largest
 Muslim population in the world, it is a secular state which advocates religious toler-
 ance and strives to balance the need for stability and development with respect and
 tolerance for the diversity of its people. The Government requires allegiance to five
 broad, guiding principles of national life known as "Pancasla: belief in one su-
 preme God, a just and civilized humanity, Indonesian national unity, democracy,
 and social justice. The Government's authoritarian rule restricts basic human
 rights.
 Under the Constitution, the highest authority of the State is the 1,000-member
 people's Consultative Assembly (MPR), which meets every 5 years to elect the Presi-
 ent and Vice President and set the broad outlines of state policy. In theory, the
 President is subordinate to the Assembly; in fact, President Soeharto and the armed
 forces (ABRI) wield predominant political power, with 20 percent of the DPR, or
 Parliament, appointed from the ranks of ABRI. The Parliament is constitutionally
 responsible for making laws but has not used its power to initiate legislation in the
 27 years of Soeharto's Government. It remains essentially passive in its dealings
 with the executive branch. Quinquennial parliamentary elections are tightly con-
 trolled by the Government and the military. The de facto government party,
 GOLKAR, won 68 percent of the vote in the most recent elections m June 1992.
 The armed forces which include the military services and the rlice number
 445,000. The army constitutes about half of the armed forces and ocuses mainly
 on internal security. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which
 the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis,
 
 
 569
 were $1.51 billion. Given the relatively modest size of the military forces and their
 budget, there are no indications that efforts will be made to reduce these expendi-
 tures in the near future. Under a 'dual functions concept, many military ofircers
 serve in the civilian bureaucracy at all levels and in Parliament. Public discussion
 about reducing the military's role in national affairs increased during the year. Se-
 curity forces continued operations against separatist groups in Aceh, Irian Jaya, and
 East Timor in 1992. On occasion, police in Jakarta and Medan employed excessive
 force in subduing suspected criminals.
 Indonesia has a largely free market economy characterized by large oil revenues
 and government attempts to encourage nonoil exports and revenues. The economy
 continued to expand in 1992, growing approximately 6 percent despite government
 efforts to contain inflation. Although there were substantial increases in real in-
 comes and in the standard of living of most Ind1nesians in the past 20 years, the
 country remains poor, with sig   cant unemployment and wide disparities in
 wealth. Corruption and influence peddling are endemic and distort growth and eco-
 nomic opportunity.
 The most important human rights developments during the year concernedgov-
 ement efforts to cope with the aftermath of army troops killing of unarmed dem-
 onstratrs on November 12, 1991, in East Timor. At the recommendation of a mili-
 tary investigating body formed on President Seharto's orders, unprecedented dis-
 ciplinary action was taken against 6 senior officers and 10 officers and enlisted men
 involved in the incident. Thirteen Timorese civilians were convicted in connection
 with the incident. Most of the latter received extremely harsh sentences. Members
 of the security forces involved in the shootings were charged ony with relatively
 minor offenses. While the civilians' trials were open and generally conducted in ac-
 cordance with Indonesian law, they failed to meet all internationalstandard of fair-
 ness. Subversion trials in North Sumatra and Aceh also failed to meet international
 standards.
 In addition to extrajudicial killings and unfair trials, other serious human rights
 problems continued. They include torture and other mistreatment of prisoners and
 detainees, arbitrary arrest and detention, arbitrary interference with privacy, sig-
 nificant restrictions on freedom of speech and press, assembly and association, and
 on freedom of movement, and the inability of citizens to change their government.
 Other problem areas include harassment of human rights monitors, discrimination
 and violence against women, and restrictions on worker rights.
 In other human rights areas, foreign travel requirements were eased. The June
 9 elections were free from violence and interene from security forces, and, while
 minor irregularities occurred, the actual balloting was considered fair. The Govern-
 ment continued its generous policy toward Indchinese refugees and its cooperation
 with the Intrnationsa Committee of the Red Cress (ICRC) on the repastriation of
 Irianese who had fled to Papua New Guinea because of separatist violence. But offi-
 cial and informal discrimination against ethnic Chinese persisted. The Government
 accepted a chairman's statement at the U.N. Human Rights Commission which com-
 mits it to respond to recommendations on preventing torture and to allowing greater
 access by human rights groups to East Timor. However, the Government has as yet
 made no response on the recommendations, nor has it allowed greater access to East
 Timor.
 RESPECT FOR HUM AN iGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra jicial Kihing.-The number of redible reports of
 politically related civilian deaths has declined substantially since 1991, owing pri-
 marily to the fact that military operations in Aceh, Irian Jays, and East Timor de-
 clined. In Aceh in particular, the egregious abuses of the civilian population eased
 considerably compared to 1991, as security forces, having eliminated all but a hand-
 ful of Aceh Merdeka (Free Aceh) armed separatists, turned to civic action projects.
 The security situation in Irian Jayas w also generally calm, th   ew, if any, civil-
 ian deaths reported due to actions by the military.
 In East Timor, tightened security and revised military procedures put into place
 following the November 12, 1991, shooting incident in Dii appeared to have led to
 a substantial reduction in civilian deaths attributable to security forces. The exact
 number and circumstances of the deaths of several Fretiin guerrllas reported killed
 could not be confirmed. Althouh the Government did take action against those in-
 volved in the November 1991oin        s in in East Timor, the Government made only
 minor efforts in 1992 to try and punish appropriately those responsible for killings,
 torture, and other abuses committed in previous years in Aceh and other areas.
 
 
 570
 In Baucau, East Timor, two East Timorese were shot on October 5. One was killed
 outright by ABRI forces. A credible source believes the other who was taken to a
 military hospital, was beaten to death while in the hands of ABRI.
 The Government continued to deal with the November 12, 1991, shooting of civil-
 ians in East Timor. A military 'Honorary Council" appointed by President eharto
 in December 1991 to investigate the conduct of security force in the incident an-
 nounced its results in February, findinq that some members of the security forces
 had been negligent, had failed to anticipate problems adequately, or had violated
 military ethics and discipline. As a result of this finding, 4 officers and 6 enlisted
 members of the security forces were court-martialed in May and June, one on
 charges of assault and 9others on charges of exceeding or failing to obey official
 orders. No charges were brought against ABRI personnel for actually killing civil-
 ians during the incident in which 50 to 100 people are thought to have died as a
 result of military action. All of the soldiers were convicted in sessions open to diplo-
 matic observers and the press and received sentences ra    from 6 to 18 months
 in prison. Six senior officers were disciplined; three, including the brigadier general
 who commanded security forces in East Timor at the time of the incident, were dis-
 charged. Five other officers were investigated further, one of whom was to be retired
 early because of his alleged failure to act decisively during the incident.
 Little progress was made in locating those demonstrators still missing after the
 incident. The national investigatory commission refuted earlier military claims that
 only 19 peple died on November 12 by stating in December 1991 that "about 50"
 were killed. The Commander of the Armed Forces reported to President Soeharto
 in July that 66 people remained missing. But despite more than 6 months of inves-
 tigation, the military claimed it had been unable to find any additional bodies be-
 yond the 19 originally accounted for. Although official accounts suggested that some
 of the 66 were still in hiding, credible sources believed most, if not all, of them were
 dead.
 Police continue to use excessive lethal force in efforts to apprehend suspected
 criminals. According to press accounts, police in Jakarta in 1991 shot 75 criminal
 suspects who were reportedly fleeing or resisting arrest, of whom 38 died. In 1992
 up to August, 40 suspects had been shot, 20 of whom died. These shootings came
 against a background of a declining overall crime rate, but an increase in violent
 crimes.
 In Medan; the capital of North Sumatra, where the crime rate was also falling,
 police announced in 1992 that 182 suspects had been shot in 1991, of whom 2 died.
 In North Sumatra as a whole 220 suspects were shot. Through early December
 1992, 93 suspects had been shot in North Sumatra, many of them 4 and 5 times.
 Two died of their wounds. Authorities maintained those shot had been fleeing and
 were given warnings, or were resisting arrest. They also denied they were pursuing
 a systematic policy aimed at discouraging crime. But human rights groups reported
 that at least some of those shot claimed they had been caught first, handcuffed, and
 then shot, sometimes at the police station.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1992. Government efforts to account for those still missing from the November 12,
 1991 shooting incident were ineffective (see Section L.a.).
 c. Ioiture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Indonesian Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP) contains a number of provi-
 sions aimed at protecting the accused. Statements from suspects or witnesses, for
 example, are supposed to be extracted without pressure of any kind, and pretrial
 procedures give suspects or their families the right to challenge the legality of their
 arrest or detention. In practice, however, torture and mistreatment of criminal sue-
 s, detainees, and prisoners are common, and the legal protections are violated
 by he Government.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Torture stated in his January report that, based
 on his November 1991 visit to Indonesia, he had concluded that "torture occurs in
 Indonesia, in particular in cases which are considered to endanger the security of
 the state." The Special Rapporteur continued that in areas such as Aceh Irian Jaya,
 and East Timor which "are deemed to be unstable * * * torture is said to be prac-
 ticed rather routinely." In 1992 Aceh continued to be the area of greatest concern,
 although various credible observers noted a general improvement in the treatment
 of detainees and prisoners, perhaps related to the overall reduction in tensions
 there.
 Police often resort to physical abuse even in minor incidents, and prison condi-
 tions in Indonesia tend to be harsh. Oificials have publicly condemned police brutal-
 ity and harsh prison conditions and occasionally instigate disciplinary action, includ-
 ing transfer, dismissal, trial, and sentencing to prison terms. In 1992 several police-
 men were court-martialed for mistreating or beating prisoners. In one case, as re-
 
 
 ported in the press, the convicted policeman continued to beat a suspect even
 though the suspect had already confessed. The suspect died shortly thereafter. This
 policeman was dismissed from seivice and sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment. In
 Aceh, a military tribunal in January sentenced three policemen to between 2Y2 and
 3 months in prison for beating a prisoner. A Medan military court in July sentenced
 a police sergeant to 14 months in prison for beating a suspect to death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-KUHAP contains protections against ar-
 bitrary arrest and detention and specifies the right of prisoners to notification of
 family. Wsrrants must be produced during an arrest except under specified condi-
 tions, such as when a suspect is caught in the act of committing a crime. Warrants
 are issued by police investigators to assist in their investigations or if sufficient evi-
 dence exists that a crime has been committed. Defendants have the right to legal
 counsel of their choice at every phase of an investigation and trial, and also have
 the right to know in detail the charges against them. Defendants are presumed in-
 nocent and may be granted bail. They or their families may also challenge the legal-
 ity of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing and are entitled to sue for
 compensation if wrongfully detained. KUHAP also contains specific limits on periods
 of pretrial detention and specifies when the courts must get involved to approve ex-
 tensions.
 In practice, these safeguards are often violated. Bail is rarely granted, especially
 in political cases. The authorities frequently interfere with access to defense counsel
 Extensions of periods of detention are routinely approved. Pretrial proceedings are
 rarely initiated. In addition, suspects charged under the 1963 Antisubversion Law
 are subject to special procedures outside of KUHAP that allow, for example, the At-
 torney General on his own authority to hold a suspect for up to a year before trial.
 This 1-year period is renewable without limit. Special laws on corruption, economic
 crimes, and narcotics are similarly exempt from KUHAP's protections. The Agency
 for Coordination  of Assistance for the Consolidation    of National Security
 (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside KUHAP and has wide discretion to detain and
 interrogate persons thought to threaten national security.
 National estimates on the number of arbitrary arrests or detentions without trial
 are not available. In Aceh 180 people accused of being members of Aceh Merdeka
 (Free Aceh) were released in 1992 after varying periods of detention, often incom-
 municado and without trial. The authorities released a total of 653 detainees in
 1991, yielding a total of at least 833 persons detained without trial for various peri-
 ods in connection with the Aceh insurgency. Many of those released were required
 to report back to the authorities at regular intervals. At least 50 more Acehnese
 were believed to be awaiting trial at year's end, many without clear knowledge of
 the charges against them. (See Section i.e. for a discussion of those Acehnese who
 received trials.)
 In East Timor military authorities continued the practice of detaining people
 without charges for short periods and then requiring them to report daily or weekly
 opolice after their release. There were credible reports of scores of people being
 detainedwithout charges at various times during the year for enforced lvocational
 training. This occurred during periods of potential unrest, such as the February
 visit toEast Timor of the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy, Amos Wako, and
 the March approach of the Portuguese car ferry, the Lusitania Expresso. Arrests,
 other temporary detentions, intrusive searches and some beatings also occurred just
 before the anniversary of the November 12 shootings and in the aftermath of the
 November 20 arrest of Fretilin leader Jose "Xanana" Gusmao. There have been
 credible reports that Timorese detainees have been mistreated. In addition, 24
 Timorese arrested in the aftermath of the November 12 incident were officially "re-
 leased" on March 2 when the Attorney General decided only 8 detainees in East
 Timor would be tried. But the military commander of East Timor continued to hold
 the 24 in military camps around East Timor for most of the remainder of 1992 for
 intensive instruction on Indonesian civics. Although they were allowed visits by
 family members, and 10 were seen by the ICRC, their continued detention in mili-
 tary facilities without charges was a clear violation of KUHAP.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious,
 military, and administrative courts exists below the Supreme Court. The right of ap-
 peal from district court to high court to Supreme Court exists in all four systems
 of justice. The Supreme Court, with a current backlog variously estimated at 13,000
 to 17,000 cases, does not consider factual aspects ofa case, only the lower courts'
 application of law. Initial judgments are rarely reversed in the appeals process, al-
 though sentences are sometimes increased or reduced. A three-judge panel conducts
 trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears evidence, decides guilt or in-
 nooence, and assesses punishment.
 
 
 572
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses. An exception is allowed in cases
 where distance or expense are deemed excessive for transporting witnesses to court,
 in which case sworn affidavits may be introduced. In at least one case in 1992, this
 practice had the effect of preventing cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.
 The use in trials of forced confessions and limitations on the presentation of de-
 fense evidence are common. Defendants do not have the right to remain silent and
 in several cases in 1992 were compelled to testify in their own trials and in related
 trials running simultaneously. In capital cases and those involving a prison sentence
 of 15 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed. In cases involving potential sen-
 tences of 5 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed if the accused desires an at-
 torney but is indigent. Destitute defendants can obtain private legal help, such as
 that provided by the Legal Aid Institute (LBH).
 The judiciary in Indonesia is not independent. The Supreme Court does not have
 the right of judicial review over laws passed by Parliament. Although the Supreme
 Court has since 1985 had the power to review ministerial decrees and regulations,
 the Court has not yet used this power, Chief Justice Purwoto Gandasubrata, how-
 ever, took a case dealing with a ministerial decree controlling newspaper publishing
 permits under advisement in November. While judges receive guidance from the Su-
 preme Court on legal matters, they are civil servants employed by the executive
 branch. They are subject to considerable pressure from military and other govern-
 mental authorities. In addition, corruption permeates the Indonesian legal system.
 In civil and criminal cases, the payment of bribes can influence prosecution, convic-
 tion, and sentencing. The Minister of Justice said in August that while proving judi-
 cial corruption was often difficult 266 judges had been prosecuted since 1980. In
 September the newly appointed dhief Justice of the Supreme Court, who pledged
 to combat judicial impropriety, recommended the dismissal of two administrative
 court justices who allegedly accepted bribes. The final decision, however, rested with
 the Minister of Justice and the President, who at year's end had not acted on the
 matter. The Supreme Court engaged in a nationwide effort to improve the quality
 of district court judges, but public respect for the legal system remained low.
 The 1963 Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty of death, was
 attacked in several 1992 subversion trials as outmoded, unfair, and excessively
 harsh. The law makes it a crime to engage in acts that could distort, undermine
 or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines of state policy, or which could
 disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility, disturbances, or anxiety among
 the population. The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Torture recommended in his Janu-
 ary report that the law be repealed. He noted that the law's definitions are "very
 broad and loose," and that no requirement exists to prove that allegedly subversive
 acts actually endangered the security of the State, only that the. could have. The
 vagueness of the law makes a successful defense virtually impossible; only two per-
 sons have ever been acquitted of subversion charges. Other statutes that are part
 of the Indonesian Criminal Code and therefore subject to KUHAP protections make
 it a felony to insult or sow hatred against the Government or to seek the separation
 of one area from the rest of the country. Defense attorneys also attacked these laws
 as holdovers from the Dutch colonial period and as unwarranted restraints on free
 speech.
 More than two dozen subversion trials were conducted in 1992. As in 1991, the
 majority of these cases were in Sumatra where as of August 19 people had been
 tried and convicted of subversion in connection with the Aceh Merdeka insurgency,
 including four members of the armed forces. According to credible observers,
 KUHAP provisions were widely violated in the conduct of these trials, with lack of
 access to attorneys and pretrial mistreatment of the accused the most frequently
 cited problems.
 Four Timorese were convicted of subversion in 1992 in trials in Dili and Jakarta.
 The four were part of a group of 13 Timorese charged in connection with either a
 November 12, 1991, demonstration in Dili that preceded the shooting incident, or
 a November 19, 1991, demonstration in Jakarta that protested the shootings. The
 other 9 were tried on felony hate-sowing or sedition charges. These trials were at-
 tended by international observers, including representatives of the International
 Commission of Jurists, the Indonesian and foreign press, and the U.S. and other
 embassies. In general, the trials were substantially fairer than the Aceh proceed-
 ings. But in the Dili trials in particular, they did not meet international standards
 for fair trial. For example, access to legal counsel was obstructed to the extent that
 the defendants in several cases met their chosen attorneys only on the day their
 trials began. Even then, the Dili District Court barred attorneys in the subversion
 cases from representing the accused on technical grounds until the Supreme Court
 intervened. All 13 accused Timorese were convicted. One received a 6-month sen-
 tence and was released immediately. Seven received sentences of 10 years or more,
 
 
 573
 and one received a life sentence, which is unusually harsh even in a subversion
 case. There is reason to believe that these harsh sentences were intended specifi-
 callyto deter future such anti-integration activity. Security personnel responsible
 for the shootings were charged with relatively minor offenses.
 The Government does not make available statistics on the number of people cur-
 rently serving subversion sentences or sentences under the felony "hate-sowing" or
 sedition laws. But informed sources indicated some 300 persons were servingsen-
 tences for subversion in 1992, including members of the banned Communist Party
 of Indonesia (PKI) Muslim extremists, and those convicted of subversion in Irian
 Jaya, Aeh, and East Timor. Scores mere were believed to be serving sentences
 under the hate-sowing or sedition laws. At least some of these persons advocated
 or employed violence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.- -Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by security
 agencies occurs regularly. Security agencies intimidate by conducting surveillance of
 persons and residences, and they are believed to monitor selectively local and inter-
 national telephone calls without legal restraint. Government security officials mon-
 itor the movements and activities of former members of the PKI and its front orga-
 nizations, especially persons the Government believes were involved in the abortive
 1965 Communist-backed coup. The Government stated in late 1990 that this latter
 group then totaled 1,410,333 people. These persons and their relatives sometimes
 are subject to surveillance, required check-ins, and arbitrary actions by officials, in-
 cluding removal from government employment and threats of removal from such
 employment.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Significant restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press exist. Government agencies exercise broad discretionary authority in ap-
 plying laws concerning the rights of expression, and effective judicial review is lack-
 ing. Public statements or publications which criticize the Government or are per-
 ceived as critical of Pancasila, top leaders, their families, or particular religious and
 ethnic groups are often harshly punished. Two students were arrested prior to the
 June 9 elections for criticizing the election process and advocating the casting of
 blank ballots or staying away from the polls. They were released in late June, al-
 though the charges were not dropped. Five Timorese were convicted of sowing ha-
 tred against the Government following a November 19, 1991, peaceful demonstra-
 tion in Jakarta (two of these were also convicted of subversion.) (See Section i.e.).
 The leader of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization was prevented by the au-
 thorities from speaking in Surabaya in April.
 The Government operates the nationwide television network. Private television
 companies broadcasting in Jakarta and Surabaya expanded to other areas, and a
 private educational channel began operating nationally. Some 550 private radio
 broadcasting companies exist in Indonesia in addition to the Government's national
 radio network. Private television and radio stations, which have considerable pro-
 gramming latitude, are nonetheless subject to official scrutiny and required to use
 government-provided news programs. Private radio stations frequently supplement
 such news programs with their own reports. Foreign television and radio broadcasts
 are readilv accessible to those who can afford the technology.
 The print media, including the nation's 273 daily newspapers, are largely pri-
 vately owned. Officials state that the press is "free" but also responsible." It is ex-
 pectd to support national development and stability, be educational, and uphold
 professional standards. The Government limits the number of newspaper licenses
 the amount of advertising, and the number of pages, and exercises strong control
 over the press through its control of publishing permits. Journalists have protested
 in the past that the Department of Information has revoked these permits without
 giving the offending publications an adequate chance to defend themselves. The
 Government occasionally censors domestic and foreign _publications and, in a prac-
 tice known locally as "telephone culture," telephones editors to suppress stories. In
 May a provincial official in South Sumatra ordered the removal of an article dealing
 with the June election from the editing tables of the daily newspaper, the Sriwijaya
 Post. His actions were criticized by Home Affairs Minister Rudini, who said that
 press censorship should be reduced to a minimum. Although the risk of official sanc-
 tions and informal government instructions generally lead editors to exercise consid-
 erable self-censorship in disseminating views of government critics, the domestic
 print media continued to press the limits of official tolerance in coverage of election
 issues, East Timor, and social problems. Cartoons often pointedly critical of top gov-
 ernment officials appeared routinely in several newspapers.
 
 
 574
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia, and particularly to certain
 areas of Indonesia, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents and occasiona
 reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. Although
 an American reporter was ordered to leave East Timor in February, other journal
 ists were allowed to visit in May and November.
 The importation of foreign publications and video tapes which must be reviewed
 by government censors, requires a permit. Importers avoid foreign materials critical
 of the Government or dealing with topics considered sensitive, such as human
 rights. Foreign publications, from Time magazine to the Asian Wall Street Journal,
 are normally available although several issues were delayed or embargoed in 1992
 when they carried sensitive stories or, in one case, an advertisement some found of-
 fensive to the President. In each instance the decision to halt distribution was at-
 tributed to the private distributor, although government pressure is assumed to
 have triggered that decision.
 While academic freedom is provided for in law, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. They sometimes refrain from producing materials which they believe
 might provoke government displeasure. Publishers are often unwilling to accept
 manuscripts dealing with controversial issues, and those that do sometimes find
 works banned long after they have been published. Two academic works were
 among the four books banned by the Attorney General in 1992. Another work
 banned was the report by the Legal Aid Institute (LBH) on violations of KUHAP
 during the 1991 Aceh subversion trials. The Attorney General said he banned the
 report because it could mislead the public and damage national unity.
 b.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assaciation.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation are recognized in Article 28 of the Constitution. Nonetheless, significant con-
 trols are placed on citizens who attempt to exercise this freedom. All organizations
 must have government permission to hold regional and national meetings. Local ju-
 risdictions often require prior approval for smaller $atherings as well. While obtain-
 ing such approval is fairly automatic, the authorities occasionally withhold permis-
 sion. Two gatherings of the discussion group Democratic Forum were ordered ended
 by police in February and April because they lacked a police permit, even though
 organizers argued they were holding informal discussions rather than a formal
 meeting. A May gathering of the All Indonesia Association of Muslim Intellectuals
 to discuss human rights was also ended prematurely because it lacked the appro-
 riate permit. Regulations were issued in connection with the June elections that
 anned a wide variety of mass meetings around election day. Student gatherings
 have often been the target of disapprovals, and ostensible political activity at uni-
 versities remained forbidden.The Government also banned political campaigning
 from university campuses in connection with the 1992 parliamentary elections.
 The 1985 Social Organizations Law (ORMAS) requires all organizations, including
 recognized religions and associations, to adhere to Pancasila. This provision, which
 limits political activity, is widely understood as being designed to inhibit the activi-
 ties of groups which seek to make Indonesia an Islamic state. The law empowers
 the Government to disband any organization it believes to be acting against
 Pancasila and requires prior government approval for any organization's acceptance
 of funds from foreign donors.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom and belief
 in one supreme God. The Government recognizes Islam, Christianity, Buddhism,
 and Hinduism, and permits practice of the mystical, traditional beliefs of "Aliran
 Kepercayaan.* Although the population is overwhelmingly Muslim, the practice and
 teachings of the other recognized faiths are respected. Various restrictions on cer-
 tain types of religious activity exist. According to official statistics, nearly 400 "mis-
 leading religious cults" are banned, including Jehovah's Witnesses and Baha'i. Be-
 cause the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme being, atheism is forbidden.
 The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious and secular
 organizations. The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advocate es-
 tablishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic law, both of which are
 outlawed.
 There is no legal bar to conversion between faiths, and conversions occur. How-
 ever, proselytizing between the recognized religions or in areas heavily dominated
 by one reco gnized religion or another is considered potentially disruptive and is dis-
 couraged. Foreign missionary activities are relatively unimpeded. In recent years,
 some foreign missionaries have had difficulty renewing visas or residence permits-
 a few on unspecified "security grounds." Laws and decrees from the 1970's do not
 allow foreign missionaries to spend more than 10 consecutive years in Indonesia,
 with some extensions granted in remote areas like Irian Jaya. Enforcement of this
 policy does not discriminate by sect or nationality. Foreign missionary work is sub-
 ject to the funding stipulations of the ORMAS Law (see Section 2.b.).
 
 
 575
 Indonesians practicing the recognized religions maintain active links with coreli-
 gionists inside and outside Indonesia and travel abroad for religious gatherings.
 The Government organizes the annual haj pilgrimage, and more than 100,000 In-
 donesians made it in 1992.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreiqn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Restrictions on freedom of movement exist. The Government maintains
 an unpublished blacklist of Indonesians who are forbidden to leave the country, in-
 cluding various prominent human rights monitors, and foreigners who are forbidden
 to enter, especially certain foreign journalists. (The Government announced in early
 January 1993 that the number of persons currentl affected by the travel ban was
 8,897.) Reportedly 14 journalists were removed rom the list in July, but their
 names were not made public. The DPR passed new legislation in 1992 affecting the
 travel ban which elevated it to the status of law and required the Government to
 notify people when they have been added to the list. Previously, people discovered
 their status only when they tried to enter or leave. As a result of the new legisla-
 tion, the Government also eliminated the requirement of obtaining an exit permit.
 But the new legislation added a provision that will allow the Government to ban
 Indonesian citizens whose return would pose problems for national security. This
 provision was opposed by human rights groups and certain legislators but strongly
 supported by theDPR's military faction.
 Restrict ions exist on movement by Indonesian and foreign citizens to and within
 parts of Indonesia. Permits to seek work in a new location are required in certain
 areas, primarily to control further population movement to crowded cities. Special
 permits are required to visit certai n  ps  o a  Jaya. Security chocks affecting
 transportation and travel to and within East Timlr occurred sporadically in 1992,
 and curfews in connection with military operations were occasionally imposed.
 Former political detainees, including those associated with the abortive 1965 coup,
 must notify authorities of their movements and may not change their place of resi-
 denc without official permission.
 Indonesia continued its generous attitude regarding Indochinese asylum seekers
 in 1992. It has granted first asylum to over 123,000 Indochinese asylum seekers
 since 1975 and continued to operate a refugee facility on Galang Island. Cambodian
 asylum seekers, whom the Government considers illegal immigrants, have been al-
 lowed to remain in Indonesia pending repatriation. Indonesia also continued its co-
 operation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the ICRC
 on the return of residents of Irihn Jays who had fled to Papua New Guinea during
 separatist violence in the eastern portion of the province. A new wave of several
 hundred Irianese fled to Papua New Guinearin 1992 following border clashes be-
 tween OPM insurgents and security forces, bringing the total of rianese in Papua
 New Guinea's East Awin refugee camp to approximately 3,700. More than 100
 Acehnese who fled to Malaysia during the height of separatist violence in 1990-1991
 returned to Aceh. Others continued to seek asylum in Malaysia, including a group
 of 43 who entered the UNHCR compound in Kuala Lumpur in June claiming their
 lives would be threatened if they returned to Indonesia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right o Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Whatever their theoretical rights under the Constitution, citizens do not in fact
 have the ability to change the Government through democratic means. President
 Soeharto and a small group of active-duty and retired military officers and civilian
 officials exercise governmntal authority. The military, under a "dual function" doc-
 trine, is assigned a role in bth security and sociopolitical affairs. Members of the
 military are allotted 20 percent of the seats in national, provincial, and district par-
 liaments, and occupy numerous key positions in the administration. The other 80
 percent of national and local parliamentary seats are illed through elections held
 ever 5 years.
 Alleadult citizens arle igible to vote, except active-duty members of the armed
 forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences, and some 36,000 former PKI
 members. Voters may choose by secret ballot between the three government-ap-
 proved political organizations, which field candidate lists in each electoral district.
 Those lists must be screened by BAKORSTANAS (see Section 1.d.), which deter-
 mines whether candidates were involved in the abortive 1965 Communist coup or
 pose other broadly defined security risks. Critics charge these screenings are uncon-
 stitutional, since there is no way to appeal the results, and note that they can be
 used to eliminate government critics from Parliament. Strict rules establish the
 length of the political campsign access to electronic media, schedules for public ap-
 pearances, and the political symbls that can be used.
 
 
 576
 GOLKAR, a government-sponsored organization of diverse functional groups, won
 68 percent of the seats in the June 9 elections. Two small political parties, the Unit-
 ed Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), split the remain-
 ing vote. By law all three political organizations must embrace Pancasila. They are
 not considered opposition parties and seldom espouse policies much different from
 those of the Government although the PDI raised several controversial issues dur-
 ing the 1992 campaign. he leaders of all these organizations are approved, if not
 chosen, by the Government, and their activities are closely scrutinized and often
 guided by government authorities. GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with
 the armed forces and KORPRI, the nonunion association to which all civil servants
 automatically belong. Civil servants may join any of the political parties with official
 permission, but most are members of GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and
 some other banned parties may not run for office or be active politically. Although
 numerous irregularities were reported during the June polling, most observers be-
 lieved they were not widespread or systematic. The Government initiated criminal
 proceedings against some of those accused of campaign violations.
 The 500 members of the national DPR-100 appointed military and 400 elected-
 consider bills presented to them by government departments and agencies but do
 not draft laws on their own, although they have the constitutional right to do so.
 The DPR makes technical and occasionally substantive alterations to bills it re-
 views. It remains clearly subordinate to the executive branch. The People's Consult-
 ative Assembly (MPR), made up of the 500 DPR members and 500 other members
 appointed by the Government and political organizations, meets every 5 years to de-
 vise the broad outlines of state policy and to elect the President and Vice President.
 A new MPR, which began meeting on October 1, will hold Presidential elections in
 March 1993. Under the Constitution, the President is subordinate and responsible
 to the MPR. In practice, President Soeharto and the military dominate the political
 system, and the MPR's selection of President Soeharto to repeated terms has been
 pro forma.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally ignores calls by domestic human rights groups and ac-
 tivists for investigations of alleged human rights incidents, with the notable excep-
 tion of the various investigations ordered by President Seharto into the November
 12, 1991, shooting incident in East Timor (see Section l.a.). While various domestic
 organizations and persons interested in human rights operate energetically, the
 Government discourages public human rights activities. Some human rights mon-
 itors face government harassment such as frequent visits by police or agents from
 military intelligence, interrogations at police stations, cancellations of private meet-
 ings (see Section 2.b.), or restrictions on foreign travel (see Section 2.d.). The Gov-
 ernment considers outside investigations of alleged human rights violations to be in-
 terference in its internal affairs. It expanded on this concept in 1992, emphasizing
 its belief that linking foreign assistance to human rights observance was unaccept-
 able. This belief was part of its March decision to reject Dutch foreign assistance,
 a decision which also led to the cutoff of funds from Dutch nongovernmental organi-
 zations (NGO's) that receive Dutch government money. Several Indonesian human
 rights organizations received funding from the affected Dutch NGO's. The Govern-
 ment continued to ban the entry of high-profile human rights groups such as Am-
 nesty International and refused in April a request by two US. Senators to visit East
 Timor.
 Nonetheless, the ICRC continued to operate in East Timor, Irian Java, and Aceh
 and to visit prisoners convicted of participation in the abortive, Communist-backed
 coup in 1965 as well as convicted Muslim extremists. A special envoy of the U.N.
 Secretary General, Amos Wako, was allowed to visit Jakarta and East Timor in Feb-
 ruary. Indonesia also accepted a chairman's statement on East Timor during the
 1992 session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. That statement noted serious
 concerns with the human rights situation in East Timor, strongly deplored the No-
 vember 12, 1991, shooting incident, and welcomed government actions to cope with
 it. It also called on the Government to facilitate access to East Timor by humani-
 tarian and human rights organizations. Finally, it looked forward to a report from
 the Government on progress in implementing recommendations from the U.N. Spe-
 cial Rapporteur on Torture based on his 1991 trip to Indonesia. (See Section 1.c.)
 Thus far the Government has neither responded to the recommendations nor eased
 access to East Timor. In 1992 the ICRC also experienced increasing difficulty gain-
 ing access to East Timorese prisoners under conditions defined in its operating
 agreement with the Government. The ICRC highlighted these difficulties after the
 arrest November 20 of Fretilin leader Jose "Xanana" Gusmao, to whom the ICRC
 
 
 577
 finally gained access on December 7. The ICRC continued to press for access to
 other Timorese arrested since November 1.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Indonesians exhibit considerable tolerance for ethnic, racial, and major religious
 differences, with the important exception of official and informal discrimination
 against ethnic Chinese. Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the
 rigtto run businesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of all-
 Cinese schools for ethnic Chinese citizens, formation of exclusively Chinese cul-
 tural groups or trade associations, and public dislay of Chinese characters. Chi-
 nese-language publications, with the exception of one officially sanctioned daily
 newspaper, may neither be imported nor produced domestically. Jakarta city offi-
 cials burned thousands of cassettes, compact discs, and books in Mandarin Chinese
 in March. Private instruction in Chinese is discouraged but takes place to a limited
 extent. No laws prohibit speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy stress
 on the learning and use of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia.
 Many people of Chinese ancestry have nonetheless been successful in business
 and the professions, and the enforcement of restrictions is often haphazard. Some
 ethnic Chinese have enjoyed particular government favor. Social and religious
 groups exist which are, in effect all-Chinese and not proscribed.
 Under the law and as President Soeharto and other officials periodically affirm,
 women are equal to and have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as
 men. Some Indonesian women enjoy a high degree of economic and social freedom
 and occupy important mid-level positions in the civil service, educational institu-
 tions, labor organizations, the military, the professions, and private business. Al-
 though women constitute one-quarter of the civil service, they occupy only a small
 fraction of the service's top posts. Women make up about 40 percent of the overall
 work force, with the majority in the rural sector. Despite legal guarantees of equal
 treatment, women seldom receive equal pay for eqal work and disproportionately
 experience illiteracy, poor health, and nutrition.  ditional attitudes which limit
 women's aspirations, activities, and status undercut state policy in some areas. Sev-
 eral voluntary, private groups work actively to advance women a legal, economic, so-
 cial, and political rights and claim some success in gaining official cognizance of
 their concerns.
 In 1992 there were increasing reports of violence against women, including rape
 and other violence against female domestic servants. Human rights and women's
 rights groups believed that the police, prosecutors, and courts were slow to react in
 many cases, and many women who were the victims of sexual crimes were reluctant
 to report them to poBe. This lack of confidence in the willingness or ability of au-
 thorities to take effective action to combat crime is not limited to violence against
 women but is part of the overall low esteem in which the criminal justice system
 is held. The Government has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in In-
 donesian society, which some say has been aggravated by recent social changes
 brought about by rapid urbanization. The Government provides some counseling,
 and several private organizations exist to assist women. Nonetheless, most observ-
 ers agree the problem of violence against women remains poorly documented.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers, including those in export
 processing zones, are free to form or join unions without prior authorization. How-
 ever, in order to bargain on behalf of employees or to represent workers in the De-
 partment of Manpower's labor courts, a union must register as a mass organization
 with the Department of Home Affairs under the ORMAS Law (see Section 2.b.) and
 meet the requirements for recognition by the Department of Manpower. union of-
 fices in at least 20 of the country's 27 provinces, branch offices in at least 100 dis-
 tricts, and 1,000 plant level units.
 While there are no formal constraints on the establishment of unions, the recogni-
 tion requirements are a high legal barrier to recognition and the right to engage
 in collective bargaining. In de facto terms, there is a single union system, and it
 is the Government's stated policy to seek to improve the effectiveness of the one rec-
 ognized union rather than ease the process for the formation of alternative organiza-
 tions. The one union recognized by the Department of Manpower is the All Indo-
 nesia Workers Union (Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia, SPSI). Two other labor
 groups, Setia Kawan (Solidarity), also known as Serikat Buruh Merdeka (SMB, Free
 Trade Union), and Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (SBSI, Indonesian Workers
 Welfare Union), are attempting to satisfy the Department of Manpower require-
 ments. In existence for 2 years, Setia Kawan is essentially moribund while the
 
 
 578
 SBSI, created in 1992, continues to attempt to form the necessary branches prior
 to applying for recognition.
 The SPSI has 9,071 units out of roughly 26,000 organizable work sites. It has a
 membership of about 1 million dues-paying members, about 1.4 percent of the total
 work force. However, if agricultural workers and others in categories such as self-
 employed and family workers who are not normally union members are excluded,
 the _perentage of union members rises to approximately 6 percent.
 Minister of Manpower Decision 1109/men/1986, which defines the procedures for
 establishing an SPSI factory unit enjoins workers to consult with the employer dur-
 ing the prooess of settin up an PSI branch. In practice this often means obtaining
 the employer's consent or the establishment of a unit. There are numerous reports
 that employers will agree to the organization of SPSI units only if they are allowed
 to select the units' officials. Employers justify this action under the terms of Min-
 isterial Decision 1109 which also specifies the requirements for union officials which
 include "high educational background" and possession of "certain qualities: reliable,
 highly disciplined  *." Employers argue that they are in the best position to
 know which employees possess these characteristics.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRI, a
 nonunion association whose Central Development Council is chaired by the Minister
 of Home Affairs. Teachers must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While
 technically classed as a union (its status was changed from an association similar
 to KORPRI in April 1990), PGRI has continued to function more as a welfare orga-
 nization and does not appear to have engaged in trade union activities. State enter-
 prise employees, defined to include those enterprises in which the state has a 5-per-
 cent holding or greater, usually are required to join KORPRI, but there are some
 state enterprises which have SPSI units.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI, the
 head of the SPSI is a senior member of GOLKAR, two senior SPSI officials are
 Members of Parliament representing GOLKAR, and the Minister of Manpower is a
 member of the SPSI's Consultative Counil. According to credible reports, the Gov-
 ernment interferes in the selection of SPSI officers, especially the placing of retired
 military officers in mid-level SPSI positions.
 Under the Criminal Code police approval is needed for all meetings outside of-
 fices or normal work sites. Tis prevision also applies to union meetings. Permission
 is routinely given to the SPSI. In October police and the military halted an SBSI
 meeting, for which a permit had not been requested, and briefly detained its orga-
 nizers or questioning. A union may be dissolved if the Government believes it is
 acting against Pancasila, but there are no laws or regulations specifying the proce-
 dures for union dissolution. There have been no actual cases of dissolution.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts, but is not affiliated with any inter-
 national trade union organizations except the Association of Southeast Asian Na-
 tions (ASEAN) Trade Union Council. Some elements of the SPSI, such as the sea-
 farers, maintain links with international trade union secretariats. The SPSI has an
 application for membership with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions pending. While Pancasila principles call for labor-management differences to
 be settled by consensus, all organized workers, with the exception of civil servants,
 have the right to strike. In practice, state enterprise employees and teachers rarely
 exercise this right. Before a strike can occur in the private sector, the law requires
 intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the intent
 to strike. However, no approval is required.
 In practice, dispute settlement procedures are not followed fully, and formal notice
 of the intent to strike is rarely given. The Department of Manpower procedures are
 time consuming and decisions are handed down usually only after a prolonged pe-
 riod has elapsed. These processes have little credibility with workers and are mostly
 ignored. Strikes, therefore, tend to be sudden, the result of longstanding grievances
 or recognition that legally mandated benefits or rights are not being given. While
 strike leaders are not arrested for illegal strikes, they often lose their jobs. The
 number of strikes has continued to increase over the last several years, some of
 them in support of fired union officials but most of them over failure of companies
 to pay legally mandated minimum wages. In 1991 there were 112 "illegal" strikes
 officially recorded by the Department of Manpower, although the actual number
 most likely was larger. When the figures for 1992 are tallied, it is probable they
 will show another increase.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Colective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, but only recognized trade unions may engage in it. The Depart-
 ment of Manpower promotes collective bargaining as an instrument of industrial re-
 lations in the context of the national ideology ofPancasila. The majority of the col-
 
 
 579
 lective bargaining agreements between the SPSI and employers are negotiated bilat-
 erally.
 Once notified that 25 employees have joined a registered union, an employer is
 obligated to bargain with them. As a transitional stage to encourage collective bar-
 gaining, regulations require that every company with 25 or mere employees issue
 company regulations defining the terms and conditions of employment. Before a
 company can register or renew its company regulations it must demonstrate that
 it consulted with the union or in its absence a committee consisting of employer and
 employee representatives.
 Only about half of the SPSI units have collective bargaining agreements. The de-
 gree to which these agreements are freely negotiated between unions and manage-
 ment without government interference varies. By regulation negotiations are to be
 concluded within 30 days. If not, the matter is submitted to the Department of Man-
 power for mediation and conciliation or arbitration. Most negotiations are concluded
 within the 30-day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can be extended for 1
 more year.
 Regulations expressly forbid employers from discriminating or harassing employ-
 ees because of union membership. There are credible reports from union officials,
 however, of employer retribution against union organizers, and the SPSI claims that
 some employers discriminate against its members and workers who desire to form
 SPSI units.
 Charges of antiunion discrimination are aiudicated by administrative tribunals.
 However, many union members believe the tribunals generally side with employers.
 Because of this perceived partiality, many workers reject or avoid the process and
 present their grievances directly to Parliament and other agencies. Administrative
 decisions in favor of fired workers tend to be monetary awards; workers are rarely
 reinstated.
 Workers can organize without restriction in a private enterprise, even ff it is des-
 ignated vital by the Government. If the State has a partial interest, the enterprise
 is considered to be in the public service domain, but this does not always legally
 limit organizing. There are a number of government/private joint ventures which
 have SPSI units and which bargain collectively.
 The military or police have been involved in a number of labor disputes. Workers
 have charged that members of the security forces have attempted to intimidate
 union organizers and have beaten strike leaders. Police and military in a number
 of instances have been present in significant numbers during strikes, even when
 there has been no destruction of property or violence. Military officials occasionally
 have been reported present during negotiations between workers and management.
 Their presence has b een described-as intimidating by plant level union officials.
 Labor law applies equally in export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition o Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is strictly forbidden
 and enforcement is generally adequate. There were, however, credible reports in
 1990 of forced labor by logging companies among the Asmat tribe in Irian Jaya.
 There have been documented reports of girls being sold as domestic servants or to
 brothels, and of men being sold as agricultural workers. The Government has thus
 far failed to follow through on its promise of an investigation into these reports.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor continues to be a seri-
 ous problem in industrial areas. The Government acknowledges that there is a class
 of children who must work for socioeconomic reasons and in 1987 the Minister of
 Manpower issued Regulation PER-OL/Men/1987 "On P'rotection of Children Forced
 to Work" to regulate this situation. This regulation legalizes the employment of chil-
 dren under the ag of 14 who must work to contribute to the income of their fami-
 lies. It requires parental consent, prohibits dangerous or difficult work, limits hours
 to 4 hours daily, and requires employer to report the number of children working
 under its provisions. It does not set a minimum a for children in this category,
 effectively superseding the government Ordinance of December 17, 1925, on Meas-
 ures Limitinq Child Labour and Nightwork of Women, which is still the current law
 governing child labor. It sets a a minimum age of 12 for employment. However, the
 1987 regulation is not enforced; no employers have been taken to court for violating
 it, and no reports are collected from establishments employing children. Act No.
 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, including provisions
 on child labor which would replace those of the 1925 legislation. However, imple-
 menting regulations for the child labor provisions have never been issued. Thus the
 child labor provisions in the 1951 Act have no validity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of a national minimum wage,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the National Wage Council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions. This is a quadripartite body consisting of rep-
 resentatives from labor, management, government, and universities. It also estag-
 
 
 lishes a basic-needs figure for each province-a monetary amount considered suffi-
 cient to enable a single worker or family to meet the basic needs of nutrition, cloth-
 ing, and shelter. The minimum wage rates constantly lag behind the basic needs
 figures and fall short of providing a decent standard of living. Labor law and min-
 isterial regulations provide workers with a variety of other benefits, such as social
 security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive health benefits and
 free meals.
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks, with one 30-minute
 rest period for each 4 hours of work. The daily overtime rate is 11/a times the normal
 hourly rate for the first hour, and twice the hourly rate for additional overtime. Reg-
 ulations allow employers to deviate from the normal work hours upon request to the
 Minister of Manpower with the agreement of the employee.
 Observance of minimum wage and other laws regulating benefits and labor stand-
 ards varies from sector to sector and region to region. Employer violations of legal
 requirements are fairly common and often result in strikes and employee protests.
 The Minister of Manpower has publicly urged employers to comply with the law and
 sternly warned one group of foreign investors in the sports shoe industry about com-
 pliance with minimum wage regulations and their culturally insensitive industrial
 relations practices. However, in general, government enforcement and supervision
 of labor standards is weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In the largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health programs func-
 tion reasonably well. In the country's 100,000 larger, registered companies in the
 nonoil sector, the quality of occupational health and safety programs varies greatly.
 The enforcement of health and safety standards is severely hampered by the limited
 number of qualified Department of Man   wer inspectors as well as the lack of em-
 ployee appreciation for sound health and safety practices. Allegations of corruption
 on the part of inspectors are not uncommon. Workers are obligated to report hazard-
 ous working conditions, and while employers are prevented by law from retaliating
 against those who d, such retaliation does occur, since the law is not effectively
 enforced.
