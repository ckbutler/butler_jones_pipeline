 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 The 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina
 (the Dayn Accords), signed after 3 years of war, provided for the continuity of
 Bosnia-Herze vma, on   nally one of the constituent Republics of Yugoslavia, as a
 single state, Bosnia andiHerzegovina, with two constituent entities, the Federation
 of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS). The
 Federation, which incorporates the areas with a Bosniak (Muslim) and Croat major-
 ity, occupies 51% of the territoiy the ES populated mostly by Bosnian Serbs, occu-
 p    is 49%. The Dayton Accors established  a constitution  for Bosnia and
 Herzegovina that includes a central government with a bicameral legislature, a
 three-member presidency comprised of a representative of each major ethnic grup,
 a council of ministers, a constitutional court, and a central bank. Defense remains
 under the control of the respective entities.
 In a significant step toward implementing the Dayton Accords, elections for
 central, entity-level, and, within the Federation, cantonal offices were held on Sep-
 tember 14. Alija Izetbegovic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and Kresimir Zubak were elected
 to the presidency representing respectively Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats. Izetbegovic,
 who received a plurality of the votes, was named Chair in accordance with the new
 Constitution. Although the preelection period was marked by widespread limitations
 on the ability of opposition parties to campaign effectively and significant restric-
 tions on freedom ofinterentity movement, the balloting was orderly and calm. The
 large turnout demonstrated that citizens were committed to the voting process.
 Before and after the elections, the main political parties continued to exercise sig-
 nificant political power at all levels. These were the Party of Democratic Action
 (SDA) in predominantly Bosniak areas, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) in the RS,
 and the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ) in Croat
 areas.
 One of the two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established in March 1994 and transformed the inter-
 nal structure of the Bosnian territories under Bosniak and Croat control. It is a
 mixed system with a president and a parliament that must approve the president's
 choice of Prime Minister. Federation structures have been implemented only gradu-
 ally. Major steps were the creation of provincial structures in the form of cantons,
 the unification of Sarajevo under Federation control, and September elections to a
 Federation Parliament. In these elections, the mainly Muslim SDA and Croat HDZ
 won 59% and 22% of the votes, respectively. Widespread abuses of citizens on an
 ethnic basis in the Sarajevo suburbs that occurred during and after the transfer of
 authority there in March and inconclusive efforts to integrate separate Bosniak and
 Croat administrations in the ethnically bifurcated city of Mostar highlighted the
 willingness of political leaders of both Bosniaks and Croats to manipulate ethnic fac-
 tors for political gain.
 In most respects Federation authority did not extend effectively outside the areas
 in which Bosniaks constituted a majority. The self-proclaimed "Croat Republic of
 Herceg-Bosna" was a rival claimant to Croat-held territory in Bosnia and
 Herzegovina until March 1994. Although its official dissolution was called for under
 a separate agreement reached in Dayton, security and administrative structures as-
 sociated with Herceg-Bosna persisted and remained closely associated with the mili-
 tary structure of the Croat Defense Council (HVO) and the political party structure
 of the HDZ. This relationship included close military ties, and along with the fact
 that Bosnian Croats had dual citizenship with Croatia and were able to vote in Cro-
 atian elections, brought into question the degree of the HDZ's independence from
 Croatia.
 The Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the other entity. Its de facto
 capital is the town of Pale, near Sarajevo, although Banja Luka is the seat of the
 RSParliament and other entity ministries. A president and two vice presidents are
 directly elected for 4-year terms. Until July 18 Radovan Karadizic acted as the
 president of Republika Srpska, despite his indictment for war crimes. The legislative
 branch, the National Assembly, is elected on the basis of proportional representa-
 tion. Real control, however, was exercised by the dominant political party, the SDS.
 The party ensured conformity among local authorities in many areas and used its
 authority to ensure adherence to nationalistic positions. In the September elections
 the SDS won 66% of the vote. Then-acting ES President, Biljana Plavsic, was elect-
 ed President for a full term.
 The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex 4 of the Dayton Accords)
 made the Federation and ES responsible for maintaining civilian law enforcement
 agencies operating in accordance with internationally recognized standards. Law en-
 
 
 865
 forcement bodies of both entities have on many occasions violated these standards,
 giving preferential treatment on the basis of political, ethnic, and religious criteria.
 olice  rsonnel and in some instances special military police were involved, but
 with the end of active hostilities, local police structures assumed a much greater
 role in people's daily lives throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina However, the exist-
 ence of special or secret police in all three ethnic areas, a throwback to the Com-
 munist herige, poses another problem. They are not in the normal police chain
 of command but are directly responsive to the senior leadership. The police in
 Bosniak-controlled areas of the Federation are locally recruited anc organized. They
 have been guilty of widespread human rights abuses.
 A Federation army was created by agreement of the Croat and Bosniak leaders
 in October, to be comprised of five corps and two independent divisions. Four corps
 and the two independent divsions are mostly Muslim and one corps is Croat. A
 joint command is expected to develop into a unified organization in 3 years.
 For most of 1996, the Bosnian Army (ABiH) was the military arm of the majority
 Muslim portion of the Federation. During the war it developed from a citizen militia
 into an army. It is in principle, and to some extent in reality, a multiethnic fighting
 force, comprised predominantly of Bosnian Muslims, but also of Croats, Serbs, and
 Bosnians of mixed ethnicity. During the year the influence of non-Muslims among
 the military command diminished, primarily as a result of the grwing influence
 and ethnic orientation of the ruling Party of Democratic Action. The Bosnian Army
 generally respected citizens' human rights, although it did commit some violations.
 The one Croat corps of the newly formed Federation army operated separately as
 the Croat Defense Council and appeared to remain under the effective control of the
 Croatian army. Police remained monoethnic, and those in predominantly Croat
 areas were outside the control of Federation officials. They were generally respon-
 sive to the direction of higher officials and the HDZ party, although they appeared
 somewhat less disciplined than police in the RS. Police in Croat areas committed
 numerous human rights abuses.
 The Bosnian Serb Army is the military arm of the RS. It was amalgamated in
 1992 from Serb paramilitary bands, local rural militias, and elements of the Yugo-
 slav National Army (JNA). Its commander, Ratko Miadic, was indicted for war
 crimes and replaced in November. There were no reports of human rights violations
 by Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) units during the year, but individual soldiers or per-
 sons dressed in BSA uniforms were reported to have committed human rights viola-
 tions. Serb police forces consist of locally recruited municipal forces and a special
 force responsible to the Ministry of the Interior. Both forces respond to central direc-
 tion. Both were responsible for widespread human rights abuses.
 The NATO-led Implementation Force (SFOR/IFOR) continued its mission to im-
 plement the military aspects of the Dayton Accords and create a more secure envi-
 ronment to facilitate implementation of the nonmilitary aspects of the settlement,
 such as civilian reconstruction, the return of refugees and displace persons, elec-
 tions, and freedom of movement of the civilian population.
 In addition to the human suffering, the war had a destructive impact on the econ-
 omy and infrastructure. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have con-
 tracted by three-quarters with income losses of up to 85 percent in the Bosniak ma-
 jority areas. Croat-controlled territory fared relatively well, with GDP contraction
 estimated at around 15 percent. The economy in Serb-controlled areas appear to
 have performed somewhere between the two. Since the Dayton Accords, there are
 signs of increased trade in the Croat-majority areas and significant growth (from a
 very low base) in the Bosniak parts of the country. Reconstruction programs initi-
 ated by the international community have financed physical construction of infra-
 structure and provided loans to the manufacturing sector, which is expected to in-
 crease employment.
 Economic assistance is expected to lay the groundwork for a revival of the econ-
 omy. The actual distribution of assistance to particular entities or areas continues
 to be conditioned on the parties' compliance with their Dayton obligations, including
 the turnover of persons indicted for war crimes to the International Criminal Tribu-
 nal for the Former Yugoslavia.
 Unemployment was a major problem. The military demobilization on all sides
 subsequent to the Dayton Accords, the large number of displaced persons, and the
 destruction of a significant part of housing, have further contributed to economic
 and social insecurity. There are an estimated 650,000 unemployed persons in the
 Federation. In addition 40 percent of the estimated 1.2 million refugees would need
 work should they return.
 The year 1996 was a period of transition in which the international community
 sought, through implementation of the Dayton Accords, to promote political rec-
 onciliation after more than 3 years of war during which more than 250,000 people
 
 
 866
 were killed and some 3 million were uprooted and dispersed. The most egregious
 abuses of the war period-murder, rape, and widespread disappearances and dis-
 placements--largely ended. However, to varying degrees the authorities in both RS
 and the Federation continued to commit abuses, and the human rights situation re-
 mained precarious nearly a year after the signing of the peace agreement.
 Members of the security forces physicaly mistreated citizens and made wide-
 spread use of arbitrary arrest and detention. Prison conditions are poor. Judicial in-
 stitutions throughout the country did not effectively try cases of human rights
 abuses; even in cases where fair judgment was reached, local official refused to im-
 plement court decisions. Authorities in all areas infringed on citizens' right to pri-
 vacy and home, and as a rule the right of refugees and displaced persons to return
 to their homes was not respected. Restrictions on freedom of movement, destruction
 of homes, and the displacement of large numbers of people for reasons of ethnicity
 constituted a serious problem, with the most serious such abuses committed by the
 RS. Members of all security forces harassed and intimidated refugees. The authori-
 ties on the Bosniak side exerted control over the media; in the RS the authorities
 dominated the media. Both sides constrained academic freedom and freedom of as-
 sembly and association.
 Abuses based on ethnicity constituted a major problem, and interethnic dif-
 ferences were further complicated by religious differences. The large numbers of ref-
 ugees and displaced persons, themselves often embittered victims of ethnic conflict,
 combined with greatly reduced housing resulting from the war, posed serious prob-
 lems for interethnic relations.
 Abuse of such human rights as privacy, freedom of movement, security of the per-
 son, and ethnic nondiscrimination were so frequent as to be almost routine, espe-
 cially in the Croat and Serb areas. In the Muslim areas the situation was somewhat
 better, but when important interests of the political and administrative elite were
 at stake, for example, in the efforts of non-DA partisans to return to Bihac and
 neighboring areas, the transfer of authority of the Sarajevo suburbs from RS to Fed-
 eration control, and efforts to unify Mostar, the actions of Bosniak police did not
 differ greatly from those of their ethnic counterparts. In many instances, police rein-
 forced the insecurity of ethnic minorities by failing to assist them when they were
 victimized by popular animosities on the part of the majority.
 Bosniak police were responsible for the harassment of other ethnic groups and the
 mistreatment of detainees and prisoners although some improvement has been
 noted by the International Police Task Force (IPTF). The Army of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was reportedly responsible for the widespread mistreatment of return-
 ees from the Kupljenska refugee camp in Croatia.
 The leaders of the dominant political parties failed to demonstrate a commitment
 to ethnic nondiscrimination. The leaders of the SDS, who effectively ruled the RS,
 single-mindedly pursued policies of ethnic exclusivity, including ethnic cleansing,
 against Muslims and Croats and intimidated ethnic Serbs who opposed such poli-
 cie. Leaders of the HDZ continued, in such places as Mostar, to place the interests
 of Croats above the ethnic integration to which they committed themselves in the
 Dayton Accords. The most conspicuous examples of discrimination in this connection
 related to the return of refugees and displaced persons to their former places of resi-
 dence and the security of individuals from repressive measures designed to induce
 them to move, which represented continuing, if less massive and brutal, manifesta-
 tions of ethnic cleansing characteristic of the war period.
 The international presence throughout the country helped deter additional human
 rights abuses.
 Nationwide elections on September 14 marked a significant milestone in the cre-
 ation of a state based on democracy and the rule of law. The preelection period was
 marked by the unwillingness of important leadership elements in all three of the
 dominant parties to tolerate political opposition even from members of their own
 communities.
 Although the Bosniak side of the Federation has surrendered persons indicted by
 the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, authorities in the
 Croat-controlled parts of the Federation and the RS continued their failure to appre-
 hend and deliver indicted persons to the Tribunal. The International Criminal Tri-
 bunal for the Former Yugoslavia handed down its first verdict in November, sen-
 tencing a Bosnian Serb soldier to 10 years' imprisonment for war crimes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was only one report of politi-
 cal or other extrajudicial killing by police under the effective control of the Federa-
 
 
 tion. International organizations reported that two Croat special police officers were
 identified as the perpetrators of the murder of a Bosniak driving between Zenica
 and Zepce. After intervention by international officials, the two suspects were
 brought before a court in Vitez, in the Croat controlled area, and convicted of their
 crime.
 In the RS, human rights officials from the Organization for Security and Coopera-
 tion in Europe (OSCE) reported a case in Banja Luka in which a Bosniak died due
 to physical abuse while in police custody. Arrested for alleged possession of illegal
 weapons, he suffered massive internal injuries produced by a blunt instrument. An-
 other Bosniak man was found beaten to death in Doboj. Police involvement is sus-
 pected, but noncooperation by RS authorities with the investigation made respon-
 sibility difficult to confirm.
 Extensive killings and other brutal acts committed in earlier years remained
 unpunished. Although all parties bore some esponsibility for some of the killings,
 the RS was responsible for the most massive, egregious, and well-oganized killings
 targeted on members of an etbnic group. These include, since 1995, aout 7,000 per-
 sons missingand presumed killed by the Bosnian Serb Army after the fall of
 Srbrenica, the worst incident of mass killing in Europe since World War II, and
 another 1,500-5,000 missing and presumed killed as a result of "ethnic cleansing"
 in Northern Bosnia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
 by year's end had indicted 75 individuals on charges of war crimes and genocide in
 connection with these and other occurrences. Only the Bosniak side of the Federa-
 tion has been willing to surrender persons under indictment. At year's end only
 seven of the accused were in austody. The Tribunal banded down its first verdict
 in November, sentencing a Bosnian Serb soldier to 10 years' imprisonment for war
 crimes. Authorities in both the Croat-cntrolled parts of the Federation and the RS3
 have failed to apprebend and surrender indicted persons to the Tribunal. Those in-
 dicted include former S  President and SDS Chairman, Radovan Karadzic, and
 former Bosnian Serb Army Commander Ratko Mladic. Karadzic retained his posi-
 tions in the  long after the indictment was handed down, before being removed
 from office in July.
 b. Disa ppearanc.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Despite delays there was some progress in solving canler disappearances. With
 the cooperation of the ES, international and Bosniak experts began to exhume the
 bodies buried around Srebrenica. Several sites have been excavated and hundreds
 of bodies found, but many moer esons are still missing from Srebronica and Zepa.
 In addition to those believed killed in Srebrenica and Zepa, the International
 Committee of the Red Cross reported in December that a total of 17,689 family
 members from the war years had requested assistance in tracing missing persons;
 999 individuals have been found. Several hundred people expelled from Banja Luka,
 Prijedor, Bosanki Novi, and Bosanska Dubica may also have been killed. Local
 Bosnian officials in Buojno have yet to provide satisfactory information on the
 whereabouts of 26 prominent Crsts who disppeared when the Bosnian Army took
 the town in late 1993. Nor was there any resolution of the longstanding case involv-
 ing the disappearance of approximately 180 Bosniak men       dsadaici in June
 1992.
 In September the International Commission on Missing persons in Former Yugo-
 slavia was formed under the Chairmanship of former U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus
 Vance. Comprised of distinguished international public servants, the Commission is
 working to get the Bosnian parties, Serbia and Montenegro, and Croatia to provide
 a full and timely accounting of the missing.
 c. Torture and Othier Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhu-
 man treatment or punishment. No reliable reports emerged that any of those in au-
 thority in Bosnia and Herzegovina employed torture as an instrument of stato. How-
 ever, in all areas of the coentry authorities, police, and prison officials were respon-
 sible for numerous instances of physical mistreatment.
 For example, the IPTF reported in November that a Bosnial man and his family
 were forcibly expelled from their house in Dubica in the RS by local police. The man
 was arrested, beaten, and detained without charge for 3 days.
 According to the IPC, a Bosniak man was beaten in a restaurant in Teslic by
 two RS policemen in November after being asked for his identification papers. The
 man was arrested without being carti  ed and released a week later.
 The Human Rights od ton t nter of the Office of the High Representative
 for Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHR) re-
 ported the complaint of a Serb woman in the town of Hadzici (Federation) who said
 that local police refused to investigate an incident in November in which a group
 
 
 of men in uniform entered her house, beat her husband at gunpoint, and tried to
 forcibly evict them.
 In December the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
 Mostar reported that an old Bosniak woman living in the Croat sector of the divided
 town was evicted from her residence. The woman reportedly died during the expul-
 sion from heart problems.
 Also in December a group of six Bosniak policemen severely beat and robbed a
 Croat driving through the Bosniak sector of Mostar. The victim was taken to the
 Bosniak poie headuarts where he was beaten again. The victim suffered a frac-
 tured jaw and severa broken teeth. There have been no arrests or reprimands.
 Conditions in Federation prisons are poor and well below minimum international
 standards. There are accounts of beatings and mistreatment by officials in govern-
 ment detention enters. Conditions in Pprisons also remained poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention continue
 to be widely practiced in beth the Federation and the ES. In some cases people are
 released atr 2 or 3 days, although international organizations have reported sev-
 eral cases that remained unresolved for months. The victims are frequently mem-
 bers of ethnic minorities in their areas. Local officials are in many instances able
 to act in an entirely arbitrary manner with absolute impunity.
 According to the OHR, three persons were arrested in February in Kiseljak, a pre-
 dominantly Croat town and transferred into HVO custody in Mostar. They were
 kept in detention without being charged, and there was no evidence that judicial
 proceedings were under way. It appears that the detaining authority hoped to ex-
 change them for Croats who were serving criminal sentences elsewhere in Federa-
 tion territory. They were eventually released in September; however, others remain
 in detention.
 Of major concern were prisoners held before the Dayton Accords came into effect
 who have not been registered and are unknown to monitors. OUR reports that in
 adparticularly egregious and well-known case, a Croat priest from Prijedor, Tomisav
 atanovic, andois parents have been detained in the ES since September 1995. ES
 authorities acknowledged that the priest is being held in private detention and have
 pledged that he will be released.
 There wconcern   reprts that forced exile was practied as a juridical devie. How-
 ever, authorities in all areas of the country and at all levels undertook to drive out
 individuals, especially members of minority groups, as a means of consolidating eth-
 nic and political control. Moreover, police often failed to provide protection to indi-
 viduals being mistreated by elements of the population or nongovernmental organi-
 zations, with the same end in mind. In the iFederation, during the transfer of au-
 thority of the suburbs of Sarajevo, local authorities did little to prevent the exodus
 of non-Bosniaks, and there was no determination to forestall or stop acts by Bosniak
 displaced persons intended to drive them out. Similar practices were apparent in
 some piarts of majority Croat areas within the Federation.
 In the ES there were continuing expulsions, notably in Teslie and Urbanja. In the
 ES a joint fact-finding mission conducted by the OUR, the pSCEo  adthe Unge. Cen-
 ter for Human Rights uncovered evidence of significant numbers of expulsions of
 non-Serbs from the greater Teslic region. Bosnian Serbs intimidated or expelled doz-
 ens of families, mostly Bosniaks, during May and June. The principal perpetrators
 appeared to be displaced persons and Serb thugs from nearby villages.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, extends the judiciary's independence to the investigative division of the crimi-
 nal justice system, and establishes a judicial police force that reports directly to the
 courts. However, these urovisions have not yet been imlemented, and the executive
 a        to exercise aut h ority over the judiciary. Yugosav and wartime practices in
 wh the executive and the leading political parties exerted considerable influence
 over the judicial system persisted in all areas. Party affiliation and political connec-
 tions appeared to weigh heavily on the appointment process, and the ruling parties
 attempted to stack the courts with party loyalists.
 The existing judicial hierarchy in the Federation is based on munici al courts,
 which have original jurisdiction in most civil and criminal cases, and  cantonal
 courts, which have appellate jurisdiction over the cantn's municipalities, as well as
 three federal courts (Constitutional, Supreme, and Human Rights). The Constitution
 provides for the appointment of dges until the age of 70 and for internal adminis-
 tration of the judicial branch. The Constitution also provides for open and public
 trials, and the accused has the right to legal counsel.
 The Bosnian Serbs reportedly use a modified form of the old Yugoslav Republic
 of Bosnia's criminal code.
 Human rights ombudsmen reported that judicial institutions in both entities,
 whose work was controlled by the ruling parties, were neither capable nor willing
 
 
 869
 
 to try cases of human rights abuse referred to them, and that even when the courts
 rendered a fair judgment, local officials refused to implement their decision.
 There have been no credible reports that the Bosnian Government holds political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides for the right to "private and family
 life home, and correspondence." These rights were generally better observed in the
 Federation than the .RS, but neither entity brought property law into conformity
 with international norms, and implementation of the laws that did exist was often
 guided by considerations of ethnic or political advantage.
 In the Federation, the authorities sporadically used their power over possession
 of property, including housing, in a manner that effectively dispossessed ethnic mi-
 norities (see Section 5). RS authorities tried to obstruct the reintegration of Sarajevo
 by forcing Serb to leave the area and dismantling or destroying housing, industrial
 facilities, essential utilities, and other infrastructure. OSCE monitors reported that
 evictions of Muslims continued in Prijedor and Doboj, and in the latter town a Serb
 woman from the local Red Cross was repoitediy interrogated and beaten by local
 police when she tried to help a Muslim woman who was being evicted. Bosnian
 Serb who left the Sarajevo suburbs, in some cases because of intimidation by RS
 police and SDS party activists, were forced to resettle in Brcko, Pale, Sokolac,
 Srebrenica, Viser, Zvornik, and other areas previously purged of non-Serbs. In-
 timidation was 0so used to prevent Bosniak and Bosnian Croat refugees from re-
 turning to their homes in RS territory, as well as to influence the arbitration deci-
 sion on the future of Brcko. Approximately 10,000 Serbs of an original population
 of 70,000 remained in the Sarajevo suburbs transferred to Federation control,
 Local authorities responsible to the RS continued to expel Bosniaks. Several fami-
 lies that were expelled from the village of Vrbanja near Banja Luka in June and
 returned had to be evacuated for their physical safety by the United Nations. Fol-
 lowing the evacuation, only 40 Muslims remained in this village, once inhabited by
 4,500. However, RS authorities were not alone in seeking the ethnic purity of this
 region as the HVO evacuated ethnic Croats from RS territory to Croat-controlled
 territory (see Section 1.g.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The performance of Federation military and police forces did not indicate a
 policy of reliance upon force to achieve ethnic or other goals in the Bosnia-wide set-
 ting. However, excessive force was used with sufficient frequency in localized situa-
 tions to suggest that such behavior was tolerated. In the region around Bihac, the
 Bosnian Army V Corps and the Bosniak police frequently harassed and intimidated
 refugees returning from Kuplensko Refugee Camp in Croatia. Representatives of the
 IFOR reported 56 such cases in January, and some refugees fled back to Croatia.
 The OHR indicates that such occurrences were considered a "rite of passage" by vic-
 tims and authorities alike. It was unclear whether they represented an organized
 campaign against the returnees. In the transition to Federation rule of the Sarajevo
 suburbs, Federation police were reliably accused of mistreating ethnic Serbs or not
 intervening when others did so (See Section 5).
 The Catholic Press Agency reported the protest of Catholic Bishop Komarica of
 Banja Luka over the forced repatriation by the HVO to "Herceg-Bosna" of 500 resi-
 dents of his Diocese from the town of Majdan in the RS, despite their wish to re-
 main in their ancestral homes. This village was designated by the Dayton Accords
 as part of RS. The Croats had lived in this village since before the war, experiencing
 no problems with their non-Croat neighbors.
 Serb police often employed excessive force to prevent Bosniak former residents
 from returning to, or staying in, territory designated as RS territory by the Dayton
 Accords, to force ethnic Serbs living in other parts of Bosnia to move to RS territory,
 and to intimidate ethnic Serbs from registering as voters in territory other than that
 of the US. Local Serb police apparently took no action against the perpetrators of
 severe harassment. The UNHCR described the expulsions as ethnic cleansing.
 Bosnian Serb police obstructed IPTF investigations through noncooperation and re-
 strictions on movement by means of checkpoints.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. This right was partially respected in the territory under effective con-
 trol of the Bosniak Muslims; authorities in the RS and Croat-controlled areas of the
 Federation respected it to a considerably lesser extent, although some progress was
 made in establishing alternative print media in the RS.
 The dominant political parties continued to exercise strong control over the most
 influential media outlets. However, in the Federation, a number of independent pub-
 
 
 870
 lications have consolidated their positions in terms of readership and influence, if
 not financial health. They include the leading daily Oslobodjenja and the weeklies
 Dani and Slobodna Bosna. In the Bosniak-controlled portions of the Federation
 there was a strong tendency to favor the positions of the governing SDA. Party in-
 fluence was particularly notable in the State-run television outlets, the principal
 source of information in all areas. The OHR reported that on TV Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, announcers continued to use inflammatory generalizations to describe
 persons from the RS. In general the media of the RS and the Croat-controlled por-
 tions of the Federation were unremittingly biased in favor of the positions of their
 ruling parties.
 Complying with commitments made in connection with the Dayton Accords, the
 authorities permitted other political parties limited access to television in advance
 of the September national elections. However the content of many broadcasts contin-
 ued to reflect the views of nationalist hardliners.
 In the Federation many private radio stations broadcast locally; a smaller number
 of private television stations served local markets in Sarajevo, Zenica, and Tuzla.
 In central Bosnia SDA officials appeared to be using their influence over govern-
 ment frequency allocation to restrict the further establishment of broadcast media
 outlets. After overcoming great resistance from Federation authorities, a Western-
 sponsored Independent Open Broadcast Network was established by broadcasting
 material through some of these independent television stations. The purpose was to
 create a strong independent television sector in all parts of Bosnia, drawing talent
 from among all ethnic communities. Despite a number of ongoing logistical and re-
 source problems, its signal could be received in most major population centers.
 The development of independent media was constrained by a number of structural
 factors including limited circulations, a lack of locally produced material with a wide
 appeal, poor advertizing revenues, and high operating costs. Few of the media were
 commercially viable; some survived through the sponsorship of private organiza-
 tions, cultural societies, and political parties, others with help from Western aid or-
 ganizations.
 In Croat-controlled Federation territory, broadcast transmissions from neighbor-
 ing Croatia, as well as local Croatian-nationalist broadcast entities, captured the
 majority of audiences, while few alternative or nonnationalist news sources were
 available. In the ES most media are a propaganda tool of the ruling SDS party.
 Srpska Radio-Televizija broadcasts from ES engage in negative ethnic stereotyping.
 The party uses its own information resources, an information ministry, and tight
 control of most media outlets to dominate most outlets. Nonetheless, some independ-
 ent media were established. In Banja Luka an independent newspaper, Nezavisne
 Novine, began publication, as did a monthly and a weekly not under the control of
 the SDS. In some areas RS authorities have exerted considerable pressure against
 independent publications, forbidding local businesses to advertise in them, local
 presses to print them, and local kiosks to sell them.
 Foreign journalists representing recognized media were generally free to report
 from all areas of the country, although loal authorities occasionally reacted with
 force to prevent efforts to fim incidents involving violence. The absence of telephone
 and fax links between the entities complicated journalists work.
 Academic freedom was constrained. In the Federation, Serbs and Croats com-
 plained that SDA party favorites were more likely to get promoted or obtain senior
 managerial positions. In Serb-controlled areas, the authorities' general lack of toler-
 ance or dissent led to total control of the educational media. The curriculum in
 Serb-controlled areas has been revamped to teach solely Serb history, art, literature,
 etc.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association. However, none of the parties fully re-
 spected these rights in practice. A wide range of social, cultural, and political orga-
 nizations functioned without interference, but there were serious exceptions relating
 to efforts of certain opposition political parties to stage rallies and campaign in the
 September national elections (see section 3).
 In the RS, control over security and police by the SDS imposed severe limitations
 on the right to assembly. There was a clear attitude of intolerance toward opposition
 parties. For example, the OHR reported the disruption in March of a Socialist Party
 of RS (SPRS) public meeting in Blatnica by a members of a local paramilitary group.
 Although freedom of association is not directly limited, indirect pressure con-
 strains the exercise of this right. While political membership is not forced, member-
 ship in the ruling SDA and HDZ parties in Federation territory was increasingly
 viewed as a way to obtain and keep housing and high-level jobs in the state-owned
 sector of the economy.
 
 
 871
 The OHR reported that in Croat-held areas, particularly West Mostar, opposition
 parties were reluctant to organize openly because of fear of retaliation by HDZ sup-
 porters.
 Human rights groups in the RS pointed to a number of physical attacks on activ-
 ists of the Alliance for Peace and Progress (SMP), a party opposing the ruling SDS.
 The atmosphere of intimidation was apparent in an incident in Kalesija, near Tuzla
 where, according to the OHR, 159 people were called in for informational interviews
 by the military police because they were accused of having heckled the Mayor of
 the municipality during a public appearance in April.
 c. Freedom ofReligion-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ingprivate and public worship, and in the Federation the authorities rarely inter-
 fered. In general, individuals in their ethnic majority areas, who constitute the great
 majority of the population, enjoyed unfettered freedom of religion. However, there
 were some incidents that resulted in damage to religious edifices. Some of these in-
 cidents resulted from actions by the authorities; others were due to societal religious
 violence (see Section 5).
 In the RS, whose core ethnic group is traditionally Serb Orthodox, authorities de-
 molished property at the site of the Ferhadija mosque in Banja Luka without con-
 sultation with religious leaders. Authorities repeatedly rejected efforts of Muslims
 to revisit religious sites and graveyards in their previous areas of residence, and
 international representatives had to negotiate on a case-by-case basis with the RS
 authorities for the few such visits that did take place. Muslim members of the RS
 Parliament, who were elected in October, were initially required to take an oath re-
 ferring to the Christian Scriptures when they sought to take their seats in the open-
 ing session. They declined to do so and were barred from participation in parliamen-
 tary work until the legal commission of the assembly ruled that they were not re-
 quired to take the oath. While now participating in parliamentary discussions, they
 remain isolated from the committees, where the substantive work is done.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for "the right to iberty of movement and res-
 idence. Within the Federation checkpoints between areas controlled by Bosniaks
 and those controlled by Croats have been largely dismantled. Travel across the
 Interentity Boundary Line (JEBL) separating the two entities within Bosnia, impos-
 sible during the war, has become possible in certain limited circumstances. Inter-
 entity bus connections were reestablished in certain areas and generally operated
 without interference. Thousands of people crossed the IEBL each day.
 Nonetheless, the extent of travel between the entities remains far less than might
 normally be exp   ed. Fears engendered by the 3-year onflict, reinforced by fre-
 quent polie checks of vehicles, are in part responsib~le. There were also some exam-
 ples of more forceful constraints: The road leading to the Federation town of
 Corazde was under threat by Serb nationalists who threw stones at vehicles during
 most of the year. OSCE human rights reporting indicated that the 'road was at-
 tacked 13 times in less than a 2-day period in July and August. The persistence
 of roadblocks along the IEBL also frequently appeared designed to impede the free-
 dom of individuals to travel to and from areas in which they were part of an ethnic
 minority.
 There were credible reports that Bosnian Muslims restricted Croat freedom of
 movement in the Vares region. For much of the year beth Croats and Muslims re-
 stricted freedom of movement between the divided communities in Mostar. Only
 continual prodding by representatives of the international community permitted
 some halting progress in permtining the return of refugees to the towns of Jajce,
 Bugjno, Stolac, and Travnik, as spelled out in the Dayton Displaced Persons Agree-
 ment.
 A major aspect of freedom of movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the ability
 of refugees and displaced persons to return to their places of residence, a right es-
 tablished in the Dayton Accords. Some progress was made in this regard. By Octo-
 ber between 220,000 and 240,000 individuals had returned, albeit primarily to areas
 in which they were part of the ethnic majority. This number must be evaluated,
 however, against an estimated total of 2.4 million refugees and displaced persons.
 A number of policies and measures served to discourage the return of persons to
 their former homes. In both the Federation and the RS, property laws were manipu-
 lated both to prevent individuals who fled as a result of the war from returning,
 or to force others to flee. The parties have failed to implement adequate amnesty
 laws, which the OHR indicates is a substantial obstacle to freedom of movement and
 return of refugees and displaced persons.
 In certain strategic or sensitive areas, such as Mostar, the suburbs of Sarajevo,
 and the Brcko region, population movement-including pressure for resettlement of
 some groups and restrictions on the movement away of others-strongly suggested
 
 
 872
 
 policies adopted at the highest levels by the leadership of all three ethnic groups.
 In the Federation, with the possible exception of the specific areas described above,
 local authorities or popular sentiment more often appeared to be responsible for the
 violations, but Federation-level authorities often took little action to prevent or undo
 them. In general the pattern of violations in the RS suggested a systematic policy
 of attempting to achieve ethnic homogeneity.
 The Federation Parliament adopted an amnesty law, described by the UNHCR as
 inadequate, on June 12. One of the intended effects of this law was to permit indi-
 viduals who fled during the war and were subsequently charged with a variety of
 offenses to return. The UNHCR states that the law has not been fully respected,
 citing the arrests of returnees from the Kuplensko camp in Croatia on war crimes
 allegations and the reported initiation of criminal proceedings in Sarajevo courts
 against some 83 Bosnian Serb Army soldiers.
 The RS Parliament adopted an amnesty law, flawed in certain respects, in July.
 Non-Serbs in the Banja Luka region were subjected to continuing pressure, includ-
 ing eviction or threats of eviction from their homes. Expulsions during the war
 greatly reduced the population of non-Serbs, who once numbered 250,000. They now
 number fewer than 4,000.
 A few hundred Muslims have returned to areas of their former residence in Jusici,
 Mahala, and Dugi Dio on RS territory in the zone of separation between the enti-
 ties. Press reports described RS efforts to prevent Muslims from returning to the
 town of Mahala: Serb Interior Ministry police beat 10 persons before NATO soldiers
 gained control of the situation. Efforts of Muslims to return to towns in the northern
 RS continued, however. Local Serbs who might be favorably disposed toward the re-
 turnees appeared to be afraid of the reaction of Serb authorities.
 The Government _grants asylum and refugee status in accordance with inter-
 national standards. It cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organi-
 zations in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise
 in 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dayton Accords commit the parties to "ensure that conditions exist for the
 organization of free and fair elections, in particular a politically neutral environ-
 ment," and to the right to "vote in secret without fear or intimidation." Observance
 of these rights was first tested on the national, entity, and, in the case of the Fed-
 eration, at the provincial level, in elections held on September 14. Alija Izetbegovic,
 Momdilo Krajisnik, and Kresimir Zubak were elected to the Presidency representing
 respectively Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats. Izetbegovic, who received a plurality of the
 votes, was named Chair in accordance with the new Constitution. Voters throughout
 Bosnia and Herzegovina (and refugees abroad) also elected national and entity-level
 Assemblies.
 Some human rights organizations charged that the elections were unfair because
 of the obstacles placed in the way of campaigns by political parties other than the
 three dominant nationalist parties, which have ruled in their respective ethnic
 areas. They also declared them undemocratic because of alleged fraud in the voting
 and counting of ballots. The Coordinator for International Monitoring concluded
 that the elections, "although characterized by imperfections, took place in such a
 way that they provide a first and cautious step toward the democratic functioning
 of the governing structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina." The Bosnian Provisional
 Election Commission "certified" them as valid. The three nationalist parties won
 large majorities in thcir respective areas. However, in both the Federation and the
 RS other parties garnered sufficient votes to win representation in Bosnia and
 Herzegovina's House of Representatives. The Dayton Accords specified that voters
 who had been forced to flee because of the war could return to the localities where
 they lived earlier in order to vote. The High Representative reported that there were
 no serious restrictions on freedom of movement in this connection, although fewer
 than expected chose to exercise this option.
 In the Bosniak areas of the Federation, opponents of the governing SDA endured
 acts of hooliganism. Former Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, running for President
 for the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH), was attacked prior to a campaign
 rally by local supporters of the dominant SDA. In July OSCE human rights mon-
 itors reported several other instances of personal intimidation and interruption of
 political meetings suffered by minority parties, to such an extent that it became ef-
 fectively impossible for opposition parties to operate in some areas. There was a con-
 certed campaign of harassment and intimidation of opposition party representatives
 and their supporters in Cazin and Velika Kladusa, including bombing and grenade
 attacks, assaults, and arbitrary arrests.
 
 
 873
 In Croat-controlled areas of the Federation few incidents were reported. Few op-
 position candidates and parties conducted large-scal activities during the campaign
 period, probably as a result of fear occasioned by earlier violence.
 Although persons in the RS have a theoretical right to change their government,
 SDS control of the media and security apparatus precluded true citizen participation
 without intimidation. The SDS was intolerant of opposition political activity. In the
 period leading up  the polls, pressure on the opposition took various forms, both
 subtle and overt, including firing on party offices, disruptions of meetings, and har-
 assment of party members.
 The Dayton Accords also provided that local elections be held throughout Bosnia
 and Herzegovina if feasible. They were scheduled to take place at the same time
 as the national and provincial elections. However, logistical and political difficulties,
 including massive manipulation of Serb voter registration, resulted in their post-
 pnement.
 Women are generally underrepresented in government and politics, although a
 few women occupy prominent positions. For example, a Serb woman, Bitjana
 Plavsi was ap pointed, and in September elected,   the Presidency of the RS. In
 the three legislatures, women are woefully underrepresented, particularly in RS and
 Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 Section 4. Govern vnctal Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Aeged Violations of Human Rights
 In general, the authorities permitted outside investigations of alleged human
 rights violations. International and local NGO's involved in human rights appear to
 operate fairly freely. The 011R reports that human rights monitors, beth those asso-
 ciated with government and N   S, were able to travel without restriction in all
 areas of the country, although there were some threats directed at the Federation
 Ombudsmen. The International Police Task Force was given widespread access to
 detention fes and prisoners in the RS as well as in the Federation. However,
 monitors experienced difficulties, espeidally in the RS, in obtaining relevant laws
 and procedural rules as well as documents pertaining to individual cases.
 While monitors enjoyed relative freedom to investigate human rights abuses, they
 were less successful in persuading the authorities in all regions to respond to their
 decisions or interventions, often meeting with delays or outright refu.sa. In the Fed-
 eration, for example, Ombudsmen tried without success to seek equitable resolution
 to hundreds of property cases. In other cases, interventions by international mon-
 itors to win the release of persons arbitrarily detained were met with frank ac-
 knowedgment of the unfounded nature of the detention, and offers to exchange the
 detainee for others who were allegedly wrongfully detained by another side (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.). The Federation Ombudsmen accused local Federation authorities of refus-
 ing to cooperate with them.
 There     few reports of threats or harassment of international monitors, with the
 notable exception of the Mostar area. In one case, the O  R reports that in April
 an Italian European Union officer was shot in the neck by an off duty Croat police-
 man who reportedly demanded that the officer turn over two Bosniak policemen
 riding in his car.
 oonration with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
 (ICTY) in the Hague is a key factor in the implementation of the Dayton Accords,
 the establishment of respect for human rights and the elimination of impunity for
 those responsible. While the Bosniak side of the Federation became the first party
 to surrender persons under indictment of their own dominant ethnicity to the Hague
 (two Bosniaks were transferred to the Tribunal after a decision of the Supreme
 Court in June), the RS continued its policy of defiance of the Tribunal and the Day-
 ton Accords by allowing persons indicted for war c.imes to remain in high political
 and military office for part of 1996. Karadzic was removed from political office in
 July and Mladic from the military command in November.
 On November 29, the ICTY handed down its first verdict, sentencing a former sol-
 dier of the Bosnian Serb Army to 10 years' imprisonment for his role in the mas-
 sacre of Muslim civilians in 1995 near Srebrenica. The soldier is appealing the ver-
 dict.
 The parties have cooperated on several joint exhumations through a process facili-
 tated by international organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In the Dayton Accords the parties agreed to reject discrimination on such grounds
 as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
 
 
 874
 
 origin, or association with a national minority. There were nevertheless many cases
 of discrimination.
 Women.-Physical abuse of women has greatly diminished as a result of the end
 of the war, when rape was one of the most frequently used tools of ethnic cleansing
 by the Bosnian Serbs.
 Although accurate statistics are not available, there appears to be little legal or
 social discrimination against women. Women hold some of the most responsible po-
 sitions in society, including judges, doctors, and professors. A woman is President
 of the RS. A Bosnian woman heads Bosniak radio and television. Women are enti-
 tled to 12 months' maternity leave and required to work no more than 4 hours per
 day until a child is 3 years old. A woman with underage children may not be forced
 to do shift work.
 Children.-The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is incorporated by ref-
 erence in the Dayton Accords and has the effect of law in both entities. The end
 of the fighting has brought a major improvement in the human rights of children.
 During the war nearly 17,000 children were killed, 35,000 wounded, and over 1,800
 permanently disabled.
 The domination by ethnic majorities adversely affects children of minorities, who
 must attend schools in which the educational content is skewed toward the values,
 history, and religious traditions of the local majority. Children also suffer from the
 extreme paucity of social services, especially the lack of adequate care for mentally
 retarded children.
 There is no discrimination or societal pattern of abuse against children. Nonethe-
 less, they have suffered and continue to suffer disproportionately from the societal
 stress being experienced in Bosnia. United Nations experts estimated that one-half
 of the children in Bosnia and Herzegovina-some 700,000-are refugees or displaced
 persons.
 A U.N. official overseeing human rights in Bosnia reported two situations in
 which children were apparently singled out for abuse. In an ethnically motivated
 incident, a bus carryingBosniak children was pelted by a stone-throwing mob near
 Banja Luka and received no assistance from local authorities. In the Velika
 Kladusa-Cazin area, the teenage children of returning Bosniaks who had not sup-
 ported the SDA were assaultedbecause of their parents' alleged political beliefs. The
 perpetrators were identified to the local police, arrested, and speedily released.
 People With Disabiities.-By law the Federation Government is required to assist
 people with disabilities in finding employment and protecting them against discrimi-
 nation. In the current situation there are few jobs available, and approximately
 12,000 newly disabled victims of the war are entering the job market. The Govern-
 ment had limited resources to address the special needs of the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-in July a Roman Catholic church in the Muslim-controlled
 town of Bugojno was firebombed. It was reportedly the last Catholic church in the
 town. This act followed by a few days a fire that damaged a mosque in the Croat-
 controlled town of Prozor and may have been in retaliation for the burning of the
 mosque. In the latter case police apprehended a Croat man in connection with the
 vandalism.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic differences--complicated by religious
 differences-were at the heart of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Afer family
 ties, ethnic identity remains the most powerful social force in the country. Both the
 SDS and the HDZ leaders have conveyed a commitment to the concepts of a "Great-
 er Serbia" and a "Greater Croatia," even after having agreed in the Dayton frame-
 work to abandon them. These parties, and to a lesser extent the primarily Bosniak
 SDA as well, have sought to manipulate the movement of people and the access to
 housing and social services they control to ensure that the ethnic groups with which
 they are associated consolidate their position in their respective geographic regions.
 Although in certain areas like Sarajevo and Tuzla mixed communities coexist rel-
 atively peacefully, there continue to be an extremely high number of incidents of
 harassment and discrimination directed against minority populations throughout
 Bosnia and Herzegovina. In some cases, these reflect popular animosities exacer-
 bated by years of ethnic conflict. In many cases there is evidence of tacit or direct
 involvement of the authorities. Most such instances are clearly designed to intimi-
 date remaining ethnic minorities. There have been numerous, well-documented in-
 stances of overt discrimination or violence; incidents commonly cited include forced
 evictions, beatings, and arbitrary arrest/detention.
 Property disputes often form the basis of incidents of ethnic discrimination. The
 flight of hundreds of thousands of refugees during the war left many dwellings and
 other properties empty. Local officials continued to apply laws concerning aban-
 doned property arbitrarily either to manipulate the ethnic make-up of a particular
 area or to falsely declare apartments abandoned in order to evict minorities. The
 
 
 875
 OHR reported that in Busovaca, in the Federation, municipal authorities refused to
 recognize the occupancy of about 95 Croat families who had lived in military-owned
 apartments prior to the war, apartments subsequently allocated to other families.
 An RS law on deserted property permits the return of such property to the original
 owner only if any subsequent occupant willingly departs, an unlikely eventuality in
 light of the large number of displaced persons, mostly Serb, and the lack of ade-
 quate alternative dwellings.
 The departure of the majority of Serb inhabitants in connection with the transfer
 of authority over Sarajevo in March exemplified the effects of ethnic intolerance at
 all levels of authority and among the populace. RS authorities, expressing dis-
 satisfaction with the reorganization, threatened to pull all Serbs out of Sarajevo and
 sought to dismantle or destroy housing, industrial facilities, essential utilities, and
 other services. Reliable reports indicate that the RS authorities made plans in ad-
 vance to resettle Serbs in large numbers in areas of the RS from which Bosniaks
 had been forced to flee earlier. There were numerous reports of intimidation and
 harassment of those who indicated a willingness to remain in the suburbs after the
 20 March transfer. A common tactic, according to the OHR, involved late-night vis-
 its to homes of persons who did not appear to be making preparations to leave. In
 such cases these individuals were asked repeatedly when they planned to leave, and
 others were told that their apartments would be looted or burned if they did not
 leave. In part as a result of such pressure, about 60,000 of the 80,000 Serbs in the
 Sarajevo canton moved away; others trickled out in the months that followed.
 However, the arrival of Federation police did not result in a significant improve-
 ment in the situation for most of the Serbs who remained. Evictions and harass-
 ment of ethnic Croats and Serbs continued. Minorities remaining in these areas
 have trouble gaining or retaining employment. Many of these acts appear have been
 perpetrated by incoming displaced Bosnis from eastern Bosnia, although there
 were incidents involving the Federation police using violence against Serbs. Accord-
 ing to a statement made in June by the Chairman of the Hesinki Committee for
 Human Rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina, "the remaining Serbs in Sarajevo are cur-
 rently in an alarming position.: He claimed that neither the local nor the inter-
 national police were providing sufficient protection for the remaining Serb popu-
 lation, with the result that Muslims arriving from Podrinje, Srebrenica, Zvornik,
 Zepa, and Visegrad were throwing Serbs out of their homes.
 Ethnic discrimination was also evident repeatedly in international efforts to inte-
 grate Mostar, which had been divided for 3 years between the Croat-controlled
 Western sector and a Muslim controlled Eastern sector. European Union authorities
 responsible for overseeing the reunification enforced a political structure, including
 three districts for Croats, three for Bosniaks, and one mixed. Elections for the local
 government of Mostar in June demonstrated the highly charged atmosphere be-
 tween Bosniak- and Croat-controlled areas. When the mainly Muslim SDA gained
 a majority of one seat on the new city council, Bosnian Croats initially refused to
 participate in Council sessions. Mostar remained a city bitterly divided along ethnic
 nes, and movement between the two ethnic halves of the city was minimal. Inci-
 dents of ethnically based violence persisted.
 According to Bosnian Federation Ombudsmen, human rights violations based on
 ethnic origin continued to be committed at all levels of government in the Federa-
 tion. According to one report from the Ombudsmen, the essential problem is the con-
 tinued existence of two ethnically pure police forces; as a result, members of an eth-
 nic community who are part of a minority in a certain area suffer. There is report-
 edly little difference in this respect between the police in the areas under Bosniak
 control or in those held by the Croatian Defense Council. Two examples cited by the
 Ombudsmen were Croat-held West Mostar and Moslem-held Bugojno, where local
 police forces not only tolerated violence and discrimination but were directly in-
 volved in it.
 In the RS abuse of ethnic minorities has been tantamount to official policy. Ethnic
 minorities have been subjected to harassment and on occasion expulsion. Serb local
 authorities, whose numbers appear to have been purged by hard-line SDS officials,
 have been directly involved in restricting freedom of movement, conducting discrimi-
 natory policies, and fomenting, through propaganda, violence against non-Serbs. The
 return of minority refugees to their former place of residence in Serb-controlled
 areas was often hampered by the deliberate destruction of their homes.
 There are indications that some resettlement efforts in "strategic" areas of the RS,
 including by persons not originally residents of those areas, had tacit support from
 Bosniak authorities.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Federation Constitution provides for the right
 of workers to form and join labor unions. The largest union is the Confederation of
 Independent Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heir of the old Yugoslav
 Communist Trade Union Confederation. Unions have the right to strike, but there
 were few strikes during the year because of the economic devastation and jobless-
 ness caused by the war throughout much of the Federation.
 A threat to strike by representatives of 19,000 Bosnian miners was dropped in
 October after the Federation Prime Minister promised to pay back wages for Au-
 gust.
 Unions may affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar'ain Collectively.-The practice of collective bar-
 gaining in labor-management negotiations was used only in a limited way in 1996.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There were no reports of forced
 labor in either entity.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children in the Federation was 16 years. Children sometimes assisted their fami-
 lies with farm work and odd jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage is $60 (96 DM)
 and $46 (74 DM) per month for pensioners. In principle this wage level is guaran-
 teed, but in reality it is meaningless as the economy is only beginning to recover
 from the war. Many workers still have claims outstanding for salaries earned during
 the war but are being paid in fall for current work.
 Occupational safety and health regulations were generally ignored because of the
 demands and constraints imposed by the war.
