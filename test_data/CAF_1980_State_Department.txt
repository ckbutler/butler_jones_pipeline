 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 In September, 1979 former President David Dacko, who had
 been ousted by Bokassa in 1966, led a successful and
 bloodless coup d'etat with French assistance while Emperor
 Bokassa was out of the country. Shocking human rights
 violations over a 5 year span were in large measure res-
 ponsible for Bokassa's overthrow.
 Since the coup, a new draft constitution has been prepared
 and is under discussiqn; the constitution proclaimed by
 Emperor Bokassa in 1976 has been abrogated. In the interim,
 the new government rules by Presidential decree with advice
 from the Prime Minister and 19 cabinet ministers. The legal
 and judicial systems based on the French model, however,
 have resumed all functions. Political activity is limited to
 participation in the country's sole political party, the
 Union Democratique Centrafricaine (UDC) established by
 President Dacko who is also President of the party.
 The government has stated that its major aims are to build
 democratic political institutions and to restore health to
 the country's moribund economy.
 Government efforts to create or reconstitute political,
 judicial, governmental, and other institutions have gen-
 erally been cautious and tentative.
 The government has declared itself against tribal
 divisiveness, and has taken steps to effect equitable
 representation of the country's ethnic groups in the
 civil service at all levels. The rights of prisoners
 and defendants generally are respected, with no reports
 of mistreatment of prisoners. One of the first acts of
 the new government was the revocation of Bokassa's pro-
 scription of the activities and property rights of
 Jehovah's Witnesses.
 I.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 While the Dacko government still has made no official
 statement or passed any decrees specifically prohibiting
 torture, there have been no reports of torture during
 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prison conditions remain substandard, although the treatment
 of prisoners has improved markedly under the new regime.
 Those currently imprisoned, including those yet to be tried
 for specific crimes, have not been subjected to harsh
 treatment. Family members, legal counsel, doctors, clergy
 and others have access to prisoners.
 c.   Disappearances
 There is no evidence to suggest that people are abducted,
 detained clandestinely, or simply disappear as a result of
 
 
 49
 government actions.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The new government has proclaimed itself against the
 practice of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment. According
 to law, detention without charge by the police is limited
 to 48 hours. At that point, a detainee must either be
 formally charged or permitted to go free. However, for
 serious crimes, local judicial procedures allow for un-
 limited detention while the public prosecutor prepares the
 state's case against the accused. Several individuals
 closely connected with the Bokassa regime or political
 opposition leaders were imprisoned for over one year
 without trial, although they were formally charged with
 crimes ranging from embezzlement of public funds to attempts
 against the security of the state. As of December 7, 1980,
 the majority of prisoners had either been tried or freed.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The government has endeavored to guarantee that legal
 procedures are fairly and openly applied and that laws
 are properly executed. The verdicts of trials held early
 in 1980 for former officials of Bokassa's regime were
 overturned by the Supreme Court in August because of
 judicial irregularities and errors in the initial pro-
 ceedings. The cases in question were being retried or
 were in the appeal process in late 1980.
 f.    Invasion of the Home
 There is no constitutional safeguard against invasion
 of the home. There are, however, no reports of sig-
 nificant abuse of this right.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 The enormous tasks involved in rebuilding and expanding
 one of the world's poorest economies, which was pillaged
 by the former regime, are beyond the present government's
 ability without massive and long-term inputs of financial
 and human resources from abroad. Per capita income was
 $2S7 in 1979. Large numbers of the country's predominately
 rural population abandoned the cash economy for subsistence
 farming and hunting during the past several years. An
 inflation rate of 19 percent has contributed to a negative
 real growth rate for years. Despite the ravages of tropical
 diseases and an infant mortality rate of 190/1000, the
 country's population of about 2.3 million has a 2.5% annual
 growth rate. Health care available to Central Africans is
 either woefully inadequate or simply non-existent in some
 parts of the country.
 Although government support for education, even under
 the Bokassa regime, has always occupied an important part
 of the budget, the literacy rate is estimated to be 18
 percent with a total school population of about 280,000
 (primary through university level).
 Current government plans focus on strengthening the
 agricultural sector (primarily through road rebuilding/
 
 
 50
 maintenance programs and by encouraging cash crop
 production) and upgrading basic infrastructure. These
 programs should increase state revenues, thus lessening
 over time reliance on foreign aid.
 Ministry of Education expenditures are projected to
 increase more than 15 percent in 1981 while the Min-
 istries of Defense and Interior are to reduce expenditures.
 Health care has been accorded a high priority, but is
 handicapped by a lack of trained personnel and the inaccessi-
 bility of large parts of the country. Minimum wage laws are
 in effect for both industrial and agricultural workers. The
 number of those affected, however, is small relative to the
 population as a whole, due to the low level of economic
 development. Women are generally accorded a lower status
 than men. Polygamy is common, and the legal system and
 traditional practice tend to support the rights of wives and
 all children of a marriage.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Religious freedom is observed. One of the first acts of
 the new government was the revocation of Bokassa's pro-
 scription of the activities and property rights of Jehovah's
 Witnesses. Mass media are extremely limited and broadcast
 media are controlled by the government. Notwithstanding
 this control, prominent individuals have criticized the
 government on television. There is no evidence of censor-
 ship of reading material. Freedom of assembly generally is
 respected.
 Trade union activity, which was either banned or muzzled
 under Bokassa, has resumed under the Dacko government even
 though such activity has occasionally run counter to govern-
 ment wishes in certain strike situations.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Although there are security checks for travelers, there are
 few limitations on movement within the country. Financial
 and educational constraints rather than government controls
 restrict foreign travel and emigration. The right of
 voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized, and there
 appears to be no sexual discrimination in its application.
 There are approximately 7 to 8 thousand Chadian refugees in
 country, most of whom have been temporarily resettled in
 local communities.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There is only one legal political party in the Central
 African Republic -- the Central African Democratic Union.
 It is open to all citizens, but during its brief history
 has not attracted broad popular support. The party's
 stated goals are to organize the population for participation
 in national elections (promised for 1981) and to foster
 discussion of the draft constitution of the Republic
 which was prepared by a party congress in the spring of
 1980. Despite President Dacko's 1979 announcement that
 
 
 51
 political parties could be established and function freely,
 the draft constitution in circulation does not call for a
 multi-party system.
 The government is beginning to make an effort to lessen
 ethnic discrimination by ensuring a broad ethnic balance
 in the government. Women were legally equal to men under the
 Bokassa regime, and several women held high office in the
 government. President Dacko has expressed his intention to
 continue this practice, although no women have been named to
 his cabinet.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Buman Rights
 No international organization or human rights organiza-
 tion has made accusations against the government or asked
 to visit the Central African Republic for investigative
 purposes since the change of government in September, 1979.
 There are no domestic human rights monitoring groups.
