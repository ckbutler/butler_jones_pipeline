 ZAMBIA
 Zambia has a one-party system of government with the
 President, Kenneth Kaunda, exercising predominant executive
 authority. He is advised by a central committee of party
 leaders and governs through a cabinet and a parliament. There
 is strong competition for parliamentary seats within the
 single-party structure. However, all candidates for political
 office at any level must be members of the United National
 Independence Party (UNIP) and must be screened by its Central
 Committee in advance. Since 1964 a state of emergency has
 been in effect, under which the President has broad discretion
 to detain or restrict the movements of people, and law
 enforcement personnel have extraordinary powers to detain
 suspects and search homes.
 Security forces are divided into three main groups. The
 Zambia Police, operating under the Ministry of Home Affairs,
 is generally responsible for maintaining law and order. It is
 divided into regular and paramilitary units. Also under the
 authority of the police is a volunteer vigilante force
 composed primarily of party activists. The Zambian
 Intelligence and Security Service (ZISS) is charged with
 intelligence-gathering and counterespionage responsibilities.
 Finally, the armed services are used increasingly for internal
 security, especially at checkpoints and roadblocks. Urban
 crime and smuggling are widespread and growing, severely
 taxing the limited capabilities of Zambia's police and
 military forces.
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to
 factors such as servicing charges on its $5.8 billion external
 debt, long-term low prices for the country's mineral exports,
 and rapid population growth, which is outstripping increases
 in productivity. In the face of high unemployment and
 inflation, there has beer. a continuous decline in the standard
 of living of most citizens. In 1987 President Kaunda
 cancelled the restructuring program supported by the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and instituted
 a "Zambian" program, which included price controls and a
 crackdown on black-marketeering and illegal strikes. At the
 end of 1988, the economic situation was still bleak, but it
 had improved somewhat due to stronger world prices for
 Zambia's principal export, copper, and good rainfall which
 helped increase the production of corn, its domestic staple.
 In Zambia individual rights and due process are generally
 respected, with some important exceptions. Political rights
 are restricted in a one-party structure. In 1988 the human
 rights situation was sharply influenced by the deteriorating
 economic situation which led the Government and the National
 Assembly in February to enact new emergency laws (the
 Emergency Powers Act). Inter alia, these regulations
 empowered security officials to search without warrants and
 seize goods from premises of traders whose licenses had been
 revoked for suspected black-marketeering. Government action
 subsequently hit many businesses owned by persons of Asian
 descent. The vigilantes (volunteer party activists) and army
 units who man roadblocks used excessive force in many
 instances in the effort to control smuggling. The external
 headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC) is located
 in Lusaka, and there are a number of South African, Namibian,
 and Angolan refugees in Zambia. Concern over South African
 efforts to destabilize the country remained high. Several
 persons were detained as suspected South African agents.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no killings for which there was evidence of Zambian
 political motivation or government instigation. In May a
 refugee, who was a former member of the Southwest Africa
 People's Organization (SWAPO), was murdered at the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Makeni Refugee
 Transit Center near Lusa-ka.
 b... Disappearance
 There were no known cases of government-inspired disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible
 reports that police and military personnel have resorted to
 excessive force when interrogating detainees or prisoners. In
 September a High Court judge criticized "overzealous" police
 officers and said innocent people were "treated brutally" to
 obtain statements of confession. Alleged abuses reported
 during 1988 included beatings, the withholding of food, pain
 inflicted on various parts of the body, and long periods of
 solitary confinement. The courts have ordered investigations
 to ascertain if confessions or statements were made after
 torture or mistreatment. In one 1988 case, a High Court judge
 ruled that statements of two defendants in an espionage case
 had been obtained through torture. In border areas, there
 were allegations in 1988 that Zambian soldiers beat, and in
 some cases killed, local civilians who had been mistakenly
 identified as infiltrators from the Mozambican Resistance
 Movement (RENAMO).
 Zambian prisons are severely understaffed and unsanitary.
 Medical facilities are meager, but prisoners with serious
 medical problems are treated in public hospitals. Several
 foreigners who had been imprisoned for brief periods in Zambia
 have reported abuses, including beatings, substandard food,
 and the absence of beds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A state of emergency has been in effect since independence was
 achieved in 1964. Under the Preservation of Public Security
 Act, during a state of emergency, the President has broad
 discretion to detain or restrict the movements of persons and
 can order that persons be arrested and detained indefinitely.
 Presidential detainees are entitled to formal notification of
 the reasons for their detention within 14 days of arrest,
 publication of their detention in the government gazette,
 access to counsel, frequent visitation by family and
 colleagues, immediate right to petition the detaining
 authority for release, and the right to seek judicial review
 of the detention order by an independent and impartial
 tribunal after 1 year. The President is not legally bound to
 accept a tribunal's recommendation of release if he still
 believes that the detainee poses a threat to national
 security. In practice, detainees have been released if the
 
 
 414
 ZAMBIA
 judicial tribunal so recommended. Some detainees have been
 held for years without coming to trial.
 In December President Kaunda revoked the detention orders of
 eight persons detained under the Preservation of Public
 Security Act. Approximately 20 persons still remained in
 detention at the end of the year, including 8 who were
 detained in October for allegedly plotting the overthrow of
 the Government. Many of those detained before October were
 seeking their release through court action, a slow process
 which could take as long as several years. Detainees may sue
 the State for unlawful detention and false imprisonment, and
 in the past some have successfully done so. One of those
 released in December has announced that he intends to bring a
 civil suit against the police over his detention.
 The 24-year old state of emergency also gives law officers and
 defense personnel extraordinary powers. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank and above may arrest without a
 warrant and detain a person for up to 28 days if the officer
 has reason to believe that grounds exist to justify a
 presidential detention order. In theory, police must provide
 the detainee with the reasons for his detention within 14 days
 of arrest. Security officers have broad powers to search
 suspects and their homes and sometimes act without warrants
 when looking for smugglers or illegal aliens. These powers
 were further augmented in February when the National Assembly
 passed additional legislation affecting search and seizure of
 property, especially business property (see Section l.f.).
 The Government has used its detention powers to control some
 of the Angolan refugees. Eleven Angolan refugees were
 imprisoned in 1987 for political reasons, but all were
 apparently released in 1988 (see Section 2.d.). As a result
 of a series of foreign military incursions in the southern
 African regions, and continuing fears of South African efforts
 to destabilize Zambia, Zambian police and security forces are
 suspicious of foreigners. There have been incidents in which
 foreigners have been detained, and the Zambian authorities
 have been very slow in informing embassies and in granting
 consular access.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judicial system consists of a Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts, of which the
 High Court is the most important. Presidential detainees are
 not guaranteed public trials, but, if their cases come to
 trial, they usually are tried in public. The safeguards of
 English common law apply in cases not involving presidential
 detainees. The Zambian judiciary traditionally has maintained
 its independence from executive branch influence. Although
 the President has the power to appoint and transfer judges,
 there appears to be no evidence that such power has swayed
 court decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is generally respected, except
 in cases relating to the state of emergency or to roundups of
 illegal aliens. In such cases, security forces often enter
 the homes of suspects without search warrants.
 
 
 415
 ZAMBIA
 Between February and April, during a crackdown on alleged
 black-marketeering, the Government revoked trading licenses of
 203 businessmen, predominantly from the Asian community.
 Legislation under the Emergency Powers Act was subsequently
 passed by Parliament which allowed the State without warrant
 to enter premises and seize without compensation goods
 belonging to a person whose license had been revoked. Under
 this Act, police and paramilitary forces cordoned off large
 areas of Lusaka and conducted mass searches. Hundreds of
 small vendors were arrested and their goods seized. In the
 ensuing melees police beat some protesters. The seized goods
 were later resold through state-owned stores. Some trading
 licenses were later restored; other traders have challenged
 the constitutionality of the seizures in court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 People speak openly on most subjects, and there is lively
 debate in Parliament on a wide range of political, economic,
 and social issues. However, direct negative comments
 concerning the Head of State, the concept of the one-party
 state, or the national philosophy, "Humanism," generally may
 not be expressed in public, the Parliament, or the media. The
 Government sometimes harasses persons who overstep these
 unwritten limits on free expressioh.
 The media regularly report criticism of government activities
 expressed by sources ranging from elected officials to average
 citizens. For example, the press reported criticism of the
 excessive use of force by security authorities in manning road
 blocks. The two national dailies are owned by the Government
 and the party, respectively, and television and radio are
 state owned. However, they carry substantial commentary
 critical of party and government performance. In 1988 radio
 and television broadcasting was removed from the Ministry of
 National Guidance and Information to become a separate
 state-owned corporation with a mandate to become financially
 self-sufficient. An independent biweekly paper, which is
 sometimes critical of official policies, is published by an
 association of churches, and two other independent papers
 focus on mining and financial subjects. Provision for
 censorship is established in Zambian law, and there is a duly
 constituted censorship board.
 Journalists play an active role in protecting the press
 freedoms that exist in Zambia. At the urging of journalists,
 the Government referred the law of defamation to the Law
 Development Council for review. In June the editor-in-chief
 of the Zambia News Agency (ZANA), citing professional
 privilege, refused to testify at the trial of a ZANA reporter
 charged with writing a false news story. In September a
 magistrate ruled he must give evidence in the case, stating
 that Zambian law does not recognize the legal claim of
 professional secrecy for journalists. The case was dismissed
 in November by the presiding judge, who ruled that
 insufficient evidence had been presented. The editor was not
 obliged to testify.
 Academic freedom is highly respected in Zambian society, and
 educators are outspoken in their commitment to an educational
 system free-of government influence. There is little or no
 government influence in matters relating to curriculum,
 
 
 416
 ZAMBIA
 student selection, or faculty assignment at the university
 level.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All political activity outside the one-party structure is
 banned. Police permits are required for meetings, rallies, or
 marches. These permits are issued routinely, unless the
 Government believes the proceedings are likely to be directed
 against local authorities. Zambia has a profusion of
 associations and professional groups which serve as unofficial
 pressure groups on various economic, political, and social
 subjects.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution.
 Zambia has no state religion, and adherence to a particular
 faith does not confer either advantage or disadvantage.
 Although the Government lacks the constitutional authority, it
 has prohibited the Jehovah's Witnesses from proselytizing.
 Nevertheless, the sect functions openly, and its freedom to
 refrain from participating in various secular activities such
 as voting, singing the national anthem, and saluting the flag
 has been upheld in the courts and supported by senior party
 leaders. Christian missionaries from a wide variety of faiths
 operate in the country. Lay associations and religious youth
 groups operate independently of party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Police roadblocks are common, and vehicles and passengers are
 commonly searched. Under the longstanding state of emergency
 legislation, the President may restrict the movement of
 persons within Zambia, although this authority is seldom used
 and was not used in 1988. The Government also withholds or
 withdraws passports to prevent foreign travel by persons whose
 activities are considered inimical to Zambian interests. In
 1988 the Government returned the passports of two senior trade
 union leaders, Newstead Zimba and Frederick Chiluba, which had
 been withdrawn the previous year (see Section 6.a.).
 Zambia hosts a large refugee/displaced person population that
 originates in several strife-torn southern African countries.
 The UNHCR estimates that there are approximately 147,000
 refugees and displaced persons in Zambia. The largest group
 of refugees is from Angola, totaling more than 97,000
 persons. Nearly 30,000 Mozambican refugees have also entered
 in recent years. In 1987 the Zambian Government began moving
 Mozambicans from border areas to a resettlement center in the
 Eastern Province. The Zambian Government operates two other
 large refugee resettlement centers, and the Southwest African
 People's Organization operates one camp for Namibian
 refugees. Persons who have left SWAPO and other "liberation
 groups" are subject to harassment by their former associates.
 However, UNHCR intervenes to provide protection and/or
 resettlement on a case by case basis. Government policy is to
 offer Angolan and Mozambican refugees who arrived after
 September 1985 the option of moving to a resettlement center
 or returning to their country of origin. Although there have
 been allegations, there have been no substantiated reports of
 
 
 417
 ZAMBIA
 forcible repatriations under that policy. Eleven Angolan
 refugees detained in late 1987, reportedly for suspicion of
 sympathy with the Angolan opposition force, the National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola, were released from
 detention in 1988 and placed under the protection of the UNHCR
 pending resettlement to a third country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Zambian citizens do not have the right to change the
 Government. Under the Constitution, UNIP is the sole legal
 political party, and it-has an estimated membership of less
 than 10 percent of the adult population. Power is
 concentrated in the hands of the President as leader of the
 party and Head of State. He plays a dominant role in
 determining the membership of Zambia's top executive
 institutions, the party Central Committee and the Cabinet,
 although traditionally both bodies contain a general balance
 of regional and tribal representation. Candidates for
 political office at any level must be members of the party and
 are subject to close examination by the Central Committee. In
 practice, the political system is open to persons of somewhat
 divergent opinions, provided they are willing to work within
 the one-party structure and not challenge the President's
 preeminent position.
 In August UNIP approved a number of changes to the party
 constitution designed to strengthen the party, including the
 creation of a "control commission" to enforce discipline in
 the party, government, and state-owned industries. The party
 rejected efforts to diminish party supremacy over other
 government institutions, including proposals to provide for
 the popular election of central committee members and to
 introduce a clause into the party constitution guaranteeing
 the independence of the judiciary and Parliament from party
 supremacy.
 The National Assembly, whidh generally reflects constituent
 interests, resisted government and party efforts in 1988 to
 increase control over the Parliament. On several occasions,
 the President publicly criticized Members of Parliament and
 warned that appropriate action would be taken against those
 who opposed party policy. Nevertheless, Members of Parliament
 spoke out against government expenditures, poor services, and
 economic reforms, and defeated a government attempt to change
 the manner in which Members of Parliament are elected.
 In the parliamentary elections in October 1988, the party
 tightened its control. While 609 candidates contested 125
 seats, thus assuring some choice between UNIP candidates,
 another 138 persons (including several incumbent Members of
 Parliament who had been critical of government policy) were
 not permitted to stand as parliamentary candidates when their
 applications were vetoed by the UNIP Central Committee.
 In 1988 there were 7 women on the party's 68-member Central
 Committee. In the October elections, 7 women were elected to
 the National Assembly. Presidential and general elections are
 by universal suffrage. The numbering of ballots, which can be
 cross-checked against voter registration numbers, could
 undermine the secrecy of the ballot.
 
 
 418
 ZAMBIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no public record of the Zambian Government having
 been the object of such investigations during 1988. The
 Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or visits
 by human rights organizations. The Zambian Law Association is
 active in the human rights field. The Government did not
 respond to Amnesty International's (AI) 1987 report on
 Zambia. There is an AI chapter in Lusaka.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 The 7-million population comprises more than 70 Bantu-speaking
 tribal groupings. Economic and social needs are met on a
 generally nondiscriminatory basis. The Government's
 withdrawal of trading licenses from a number of Asians (see
 Section l.f.) in an effort to battle black-marketeering was
 interpreted by many in that community and elsewhere as
 discriminatory and an aberration from Zambia's traditional
 respect for all races.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men, and women participate increasingly in Zambia's social,
 economic, and political life. They hold some senior positions
 in the party, government, and judiciary and are gaining
 increasing representation in the professions and higher
 education. Nevertheless, the majority of Zambian women still
 occupy traditional roles. Customary law and practice
 sometimes conflict with Zambia's Constitution and codified
 laws in rural areas. Customary law places women in
 subordinate status with respect to property, inheritance, and
 marriage. The Law Development Commission is seeking ways to
 remove such anomalies. In Zambia's traditional society,
 women's primary role is bearing and raising children, but they
 also make a major contribution to food production. Female
 students may be admitted to secondary school with lower
 passing marks than male students as part of Zambia's
 "affirmative action" program.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 national large unions, which are
 organized by industry or profession, are all members of the
 Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the sole legal
 confederation.
 The ZCTU is not controlled by the party or the Government, and
 union leaders frequently criticize government policy on such
 subjects as wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and
 labor representation in party and government organs. The ZCTU
 is democratic and regularly conducts open elections to select
 its leadership. It is active in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and is a member of the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 The Government confiscated the passports of the Chairman of
 the ZCTU, Frederick Chiluba, and of ZCTU General Secretary
 Newstead Zimba, upon their return from the ILO conference in
 
 
 419
 ZAMBIA
 June 1987. Prior to the conference, there had been a similar
 problem, and the Government claimed that these measures had
 been taken for "security reasons." The confiscation measures
 prevented Chiluba and Zimba from attending various
 international trade union and ILO meetings. After several
 interventions from the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions, the ILO, and others, the Government decided in
 April 1988 to return the passports to Chiluba and Zimba and to
 allow them to attend the ILO conference in June.
 In support of the ZCTU, the ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) criticized Zambia on several issues in
 1988. For example, theoCFA, citing a disagreement between the
 ZCTU and the Government over the selection of labor leaders to
 participate in training courses abroad, recommended "...that
 the choice of unionists to take part in purely union-organized
 training courses, wherever held, be left to the workers'
 organization or educational institution responsible for such
 activities...."
 With the economic downturn, there has been considerable labor
 unrest, often in the form of wildcat strikes. Under existing
 legislation, strikes are permitted only after all other
 recourse has been exhausted. Virtually all strikes are
 illegal, since they almost always commence before the
 mandatory process of mediation has run its course. The
 Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once they have begun. However, in
 1987, after a series of wildcat strikes, President Kaunda
 declared the Government would not tolerate further illegal
 strikes. He announced that workers in essential industries
 who went on strike would be arrested, while nonessential
 strikers would be fired. In June 1988, the Government
 initiated legal action against teachers who went on a wildcat
 strike early in the year, but no cases had actually gone to
 court as of December 1988. In October the management of the
 government-owned newspaper, Daily Mail, sacked 250 striking
 printers (union members) who had refused to sign a pledge to
 follow established grievance procedures. Management gave the
 striking printers 24 hours to reapply for their jobs. (All
 but 46 went back to work.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 ZCTU's right to organize and bargain collectively with
 employers is codified under regulations in the Industrial
 Relations Act (IRA). The IRA provides a mechanism for
 initiating and settling worker-employer disputes and provides
 for the establishment of an Industrial Relations Court. These
 rights are respected in practice. Union rights against
 management interference have been readily upheld by the
 Industrial Relations Court. There are no export processing
 zones in Zambia, and labor legislation is applied uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor are
 prohibited by the Constitution. Generally, these prohibitions
 are observed in practice. For some years, the ILO Committee
 of Experts has urged the Government to modify or repeal
 certain provisions of the Public Security Regulations, under
 which public employees in certain services may be prohibited
 from leaving their employment, to insure the observance of
 Convention 29 on forced labor.
 
 
 420
 ZAMBIA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Age restrictions apply to the industrial sector, and there are
 only a few employees under age 16. However, persons under age
 14 are often employed in the commercial and subsistence
 agricultural sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 While the majority of Zambians are subsistence farmers, about
 47 percent of the people live in urban areas, and the
 migration to cities is increasing. Zambian law regulates
 minimum health and safety standards and worker rights in any
 industrial undertaking, and the Government generally attempts
 to enforce the regulations. Boards appointed by the
 Government, which include worker and employer representatives,
 fix minimum wages, overtime pay rates, and conditions of
 employment. An average minimum wage in the mining industry,
 for example, is $70 per month which is sufficient to provide
 an adequate standard of living. The normal workweek is 40
 hours. Women are legally excluded from night work and a
 variety of hazardous occupations.
