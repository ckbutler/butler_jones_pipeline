 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention
 of 1974, an event which followed a coup dletat directed from
 Greece. Since that time, the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of
 Cyprus, and the northern part under an autonomous Turkish
 Cypriot administration supported by the presence of Turkish
 troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the
 "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which has been
 recognized only by Turkey. In 1985 it held a constitutional
 referendum and "presidential" and legislative elections.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic and based on
 free elections, and they guarantee basic human rights to their
 populations in both theory and practice.
 Free enterprise, private initiative, and the right to own
 property are characteristic of both Cypriot economies. The
 economy in the south has prospered in recent years, benefiting
 especially from tourism and manufactured exports. The economy
 in the Turkish Cypriot area is closely linked to that of
 Turkey and has significant underemployment. State enterprises
 play a large role in the Turkish Cypriot economy.
 The conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the subsequent presence of Turkish troops in the north
 have led to continuing charges of human rights violations.
 These events resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and
 Turkish Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the
 island respectively, and the loss of lives, homes, and
 livelihoods.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention during 1989. However, the
 issue of persons missing during the 1963-74 period remains a
 source of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot communities. The Tripartite Committee on Missing
 Persons established under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary
 General in 1981 continued its investigations into this issue
 during 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice in
 both communities.

 CYPRUS
 'd. Arbitrary Airest, Detention, or Exile.
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Preventive detention is not
 legally authorized, nor has it been reported in practice. No
 one may be held for more than 1 day for investigation of a
 crime without referral of the case to the courts for extension
 of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. Attorneys have free access to detainees. No instances
 of exile werle reported.
 With .regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In b6thparts of Cyprus, fair public trial is guaranteedby
 law and exists in practice. The judiciary is independent of
 executive or military control. Defendants have the right to
 be present at their trials, to be represented by counsel (at
 government expense for those who cannot afford one), to
 confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own
 defense: Cases are denerally tried before a judge or panel of
 judges,.although a request f6r a jury trial is usually
 granted.' There are no special 'courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. Civilians are not tried by military
 courts. There are no political prisoners-in Cyprus.
 f:' Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community include provisions protecting
 the indifidual against arbitrary interference. A judicial
 warrant is requirdd, for example, for a police official to
 enter'a private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to
 the democratic traditions of both communities. However,
 Turkish Cypriots continue to complain that mail coming through
 the Republic of Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened,
 or not delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are provided for by law and are widely and freely
 bfactic4d throughout the island. The press is free and
 represents the entire political spectrum. There is no press,
 censorship, but the authorities exercise monopoly control over
 radio and television. LegislatiQn was passed by the Republic
 of Cyprus in 1986 giving each party represented in Parliament
 a seat on the board controlling the Cyprus Broadcasting
 Corporation. A draft bill in the Greek Cypriot House of
 Representatives would authorize private broadcasting. In
 addition, the proliferation of.party and independent newspapers
 in both communities enables ideas and arguments to circulate
 freely.
 Opposition papers on both sides of the island frequently
 criticize the authorities. When a prominent Turkish Cypriot
 politician in 1989 made statements and 'published articles
 critical of Turkey's relationship with northern Cyprus, the
 Turkish Embassy requested that he surrender his Turkish
 passport to it, which he did. Since most states do not
 
 
 1068
 recognize "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" passports,
 this severely restricted his freedom of movement outside of
 northern Cyprus.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 trade unions, see Section 6.a.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south, the
 vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the
 north, Sunni Muslim. The Greek Orthodox Church in the south
 has the character of a state institution. Missionaries are
 permitted to proselytize in both communities. There is,
 however, some hesitation on the part of the Government of
 Cyprus to allow such activities to go on in an unrestricted
 manner owing to the primacy of the Greek Orthodox Church.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots who still live in the south
 of the island are allowed to practice their religion freely.
 In the north, non-Muslims include approximately 700 Greek
 Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some foreign
 residents--all of whom are free to practice their religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 regulate travel into and out of the Turkish Cypriot area. In
 general, they have barred Greeks, Greek Cypriots, and
 sometimes third-country nationals with Greek surnames from
 entering the north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the
 south. In late November, Turkish Cypriot authorities
 announced the easing of requirements for travel documentation
 for Greek Cypriots wishing to visit the north. While
 significant restrictions remain--including a requirement that
 Greek Cypriots have "legitimate business" to conduct in
 northern Cyprus--the period since November saw a marked
 increase in the flow of Cypriots in both directions across the
 U.N. buffer zone.
 The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of enclaves in the
 north to visit the south are usually granted, but the
 applicants must return within a designated period or risk
 losing their right to return, along with their property;
 foreigners coming from the south must obtain permission to
 enter the north. At the same time, the Government of Cyprus
 bars entry into the Greek Cypriot area by foreigners who
 arrive at Turkish Cypriot ports of entry. Those who have
 entered through the south but wish to stay overnight in the
 north are discouraged from doing so by the Cyprus Government.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although persons facing military service or legal action in
 either part of Cyprus may not be allowed to travel without
 specific permission. Turkish Cypriots have difficulty in
 traveling to some countries because travel documents issued by
 the Turkish Cypriot authorities are not widely recognized. In
 such cases, they travel on Turkish passports, to which they
 
 
 1069
 are considered entitled by Turkey. Citizens may repatriate
 freely.
 The Government of Cyprus does'fiot honor the practice of
 accepting third-country persons as refugees, arguing that it
 already has enough responsibilities in caring for the Greek
 Cypriot refugees (displaced persons) from the 1974' Turkish
 intervention. The Greek Cypriot authorities endeavor to
 remove or deport all such third-country'refugee claimants as
 soon as'possible, even prior to a determination by the local
 United NatiOns High Commissioner for Refugees representative
 that the claim is valid, or prior to acceptance for
 resettlement by a third country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the'Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties compete
 actively and without restriction for popular support.
 Suffrage'is universal, and elections are held by secret
 ballot. Elections for the office of President of the Republic
 of Cyprus are held'every'5 years, and elections for the House
 of Representatives every 5 years or less. The Turkish
 Cypriots-elect a'ledder every 5 years, and a representative
 body every 5-years or less. Gteek Cypriots and Maronites
 living'in'the.nOrth--the latter-having chbsen before
 independence in 1960 to be regarded as members of the Greek
 Cypriot corimunity--do'not participate in Turkish Cypriot
 elections but'blect their Own village officials. They are
 eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must make
 their way to the south in order to exercise that right.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international human rights
 organizatiois to investigate human rights conditions in
 Cyprus. Representatives of such human rights organizations
 have openaccess to both the south and the north.
 The question of'human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities. In
 1986 a group of Greek Cypriots announced the formation of a
 "Committee for the Restoration of Human Rights Throughout
 Cyprus." This Committee ascribes the problem of human rights
 on the island to the 1974 Turkish military intervention and
 the continued presence of Turkish troops in the north. The
 Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Committee in turn denounces the'
 Greek Cypriot charges, stating that the Turkish troops are
 present to protect Turkish Cypriot human rights. Such
 exchanges continued in 1989.
 The Republic of Cyprus has applied to have'the question of
 human rights in Cyprus placed on the agenda of the European
 Commission of Human Rights. In addition, the Government of
 Cyprus has repeatedly raised in inteinational forums the
 question of persons missing since 1974.
 
 
 1070
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are usually
 available to members of both communities regardless of race,
 religion, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Nevertheless, there have been complaints that the welfare of
 minorities in the north is impaired by Turkish Cypriot
 restrictions on housing, education, and movement. The United
 Nations Force in Cyprus monitors the welfare of the Greek
 Cypriots and Maronites in the north, as well as that of the
 Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions exist requiring equal
 pay for mer. and women performing the same job. In the south,
 until recently, government workers received equal pay for
 equal work, regardless of sex. In October a new law was
 passed requiring equality of pay between men and women working
 in the private sector.
 Social taboos, traditions, and family honor shroud incidents
 of wife and family abuse on Cyprus. Moreover, it is
 understood that police files on incidents of domestic violence
 are sometimes destroyed under the pretext that it is "a
 personal matter." Several directors of the Crisis Center for
 Family Violence in the south, nevertheless, have recently
 reported that the number of domestic abuse cases, including
 wife beating, is on the rise. The Crisis Center, as well as
 several other support groups, has been established in part to
 draw public attention to this problem and to encourage
 governmental action in dealing with it.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions and confederations are free to organize in both
 the north and south. For several years, however, the
 Committee of Experts of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) has noted that Cypriot labor legislation restricting the
 rights of trade unions to elect their representatives freely
 is not in conformity with ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of
 Association which Cyprus ratified in 1966. More than 80
 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 40-50 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot workers belong to independent trade unions. Union
 officials in the north, however, allege that the ruling party
 has tended to exert its influence to split the labor movement,
 especially in the government service sector, by supporting the
 establishment of rival syndicates. In both communities, trade
 unions freely and regularly take stands on public policy
 issues affecting the workers.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike. In general,
 strikes are infrequent and usually of short duration. Both
 the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities
 have the power to curtail strikes in what they deem to be
 essential services. The Government of Cyprus did so once in
 1989, in relation to a strike by the staff of the Cyprus Ports
 Authority. In the north, authorities moved to ban a
 veterinarians' strike which had run for 2 weeks. In 1989 the
 Committee of Experts noted that essential services should be
 more strictly interpreted in Cyprus as those whose
 interruptions would endanger the. life, personal safety, or
 health of the whole or part of the population.
 
 
 1071
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in
 international meetings. Most unions are affiliated either
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions or
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions. 'Labor unions, more than most other organizations on
 Cyprus,- attempt to maintain contact and cooperation across the
 dividing line.
 b. 'The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under law and in actual practice, trade unions and
 confederations are'free to organize and to bargain
 collectively in both parts of Cyprus. In both the north and
 the south, parties to a dispute may request mediation by the
 authbrities.. In both sectors, legislation prohibits dismissal
 for-pa'rti'cipation in trade unions. There are no export
 prbcebsfig z6oes on either side of the demarcation line.
 c'rohibition'of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and no
 instances wVere reported.
 d' Minimdm Age for Employment of Children
 The Gbve5cnmeht 6f Cyprus'has set the.minimum age of employment
 of childen 'in an-"industrial uidertaking" at age 16. In the
 north- the age is']l5. The law is effectively.enforced in both
