 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is a democracy with a constitutionally elected
 government. The free elections held on July 14, 1985,
 resulted in the first constitutional transition from one
 civilian government to another in almost 20 years. On August
 6, 1985, after a close contest between the two major parties
 in which neither candidate received an absolute majority of
 the votes, Victor Paz Estenssoro was elected President by the
 Bolivian Congress in accordance with constitutional procedures.
 Despite substantial natural resources, Bolivia is the second
 poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. The 1985 collapse
 of the international tin market depressed export earnings and
 contributed to the continuing decline in per capita income.
 The Government's efforts to reduce the size and cost of the
 public sector--especially the inefficient and unprofitable
 state mining corporation, COMIBOL--has met with strong labor
 resistance. About one third of COMIBOL's labor force has been
 laid off.
 The Paz Estenssoro Government is carrying out one of the most
 far-reaching economic reform programs ever attempted in Latin
 America. Under this program the Government has promoted the
 private sector, curtailed hyperinflation, previously running
 at 20,000 percent annually, rescheduled its debt, reorganized
 tax and customs administration, and issued a simplified
 currency.
 In addition, the Paz Government has undertaken a comprehensive
 nationwide antinarcotics campaign. In August, despite
 political criticism, the Government requested and received
 U.S. military assistance to mount a successful large-scale
 interdiction operation.
 The state security apparatus was abolished under the 1982-85
 government of President Siles Zuazo. Bolivia has an internal
 intelligence service under the responsibility of the Ministry
 of Interior and a military intelligence service.
 Overall, in 1986 the human rights situation in Bolivia
 remained good. Protests over the continued imprisonment of
 seven persons arrested by the previous President were resolved
 when they were released in October. When faced with a miners'
 protest march on La Pa, the Government imposed a state of
 siege, for the second time in 2 years. During the 90-day
 state of siege, some 200 people were temporarily detained, and
 restrictions were placed on freedom of assembly, travel, and
 peaceful protest. Most of these restrictions, however, were
 enforced only sporadically. The Government became
 increasingly concerned about the presence of small,
 non-Catholic cults such as the "Children of God" and the Hare
 Krishna. In April the foreign members of "Hare Krishna" were
 expelled from the country..
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a., Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings were reported.  The murder
 of a leftist Congressman, possibly carried out by drug
 traffickers, is under investigation.

 BOLIVIA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no verified cases of politically motivated
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of torture, and the
 Government neither condones nor practices torture. Most
 problems of prisoner mistreatment arise from overcrowding and
 from underpaid, undertrained prison and police personnel.
 Corruption, malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions are
 endemic in Bolivia's underfinanced prison system. In October
 the Chamber of Deputies authorized construction of a new
 prison in the Department of La Paz. It also authorized the
 Government to use 40 percent of the money seized from drug
 traffickers for construction of the new jail..
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution no one can be arrested without a court
 order, and detainees must be charged or released within 24
 hours. However, constitutional provisions under a state of
 siege allow for detention up to 48 hours before an arrest
 order is required. After the initial detention period,
 prisoners are allowed access to a lawyer of their choice.
 Bail is possible in Bolivia.
 In August the Government invoked Article 112 of the
 Constitution and proclaimed a state of siege for the second.
 time in 2 years; it was lifted 3 months later. The decision
 to implement the state of seige responded to what a government
 spokesman described as the "emergency condition caused by the
 internal convulsion," and was intended to minimize disruption
 of the country from a miners' march on La Paz. On August 28,
 162 people were arrested, and 27 more were detained the
 following day. On August 29, the Government began releasing
 some detainees, while sending others into internal exile in
 remote areas in northern Bolivia. Among these were union
 leaders, university students, teachers and administrators,
 journalists, leftist politicans, clergymen, human rights
 workers, and civic figures. By September 3, about 60 people
 had been internally exiled, while over 120 were released from
 detention. On September 11, eleven more people were
 detained--mostly from small leftist political groups. Between
 August 31 and September 10, three people were released from
 internal exile.
 In response to requests from the Catholic Church, human rights
 groups, and others including the U.S. Embassy, the Government
 authorized the shipment of food, medicine, and clothing to the
 detainees.
 On September 13, after several days of talks mediated by the
 Catholic Church, the Government and the mineworkers' union
 reached an agreement. The Government promised to release the
 people remaining in internal exile, and the mineworkers agreed
 to end the general strike. The Government fulfilled its part
 of the agreement, but some mineworkers remained on strike.
 Upon return from internal exile, some detainees complained
 about living conditions during their detention. There were no
 complaints of torture or beatings or of ill health as a
 consequence of their exile.

 BOLIVIA
 Bolivian law prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trail
 The Government upholds the constitutional right of fair public
 trial, but delays in the judicial system are common.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, at public expense if
 needed, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to
 appeal a judicial decision.
 The Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court, Bolivia's
 highest civilian judicial body, to review legislative measures
 to determine if they are in accordance with a citizen's
 "concrete rights or the Constitution."
 Bolivia has both civilian and military judicial systems. The
 Constitution empowers the military "to defend and conserve
 national independence.., security and stability... and national
 sovereignty." The military government of 1976 revised the
 Military Penal Code and established the military court
 system. The law defined and established military jurisdiction
 over actions against the security of the state, military
 personnel, or property.
 Seven persons detained by the army near Luribay in 1983 for
 alleged involvement in training of leftist groups were
 convicted of arms theft and conspiracy to commit treason by a
 military court in 1984, after the Supreme Court ruled that the
 military court had jurisdiction over the case. Although
 President Siles granted amnesty to the "Luribay Seven" later
 that year, a dispute over legal jurisdiction prevented their
 release. On October 14, 1985, the Supreme Military Tribunal
 reduced the sentences of the seven, who were then paroled in
 1986.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives
 are protected by the Constitution and normally are respected.
 House searches, monitoring of conversations, and other abuses
 that occurred under previous military regimes have ceased.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are state-owned and private radio and television
 stations operating in Bolivia. Newspapers are all privately
 owned. Since the restoration of democracy in 1982, Bolivians
 have enjoyed a generally unrestricted press representing a
 wide spectrum of ideological views. With a few exceptions,
 the Paz Estenssoro Government has tolerated full criticism
 from the media, although it has constitutional authority to
 impose censorship.
 During the August-November state of siege, government agents
 broke into the University of La Paz television station,
 ostensibly looking for people on a detention list. Some
 television equipment was damaged, and the station, a harsh
 government critic, was still off the air as of December 1986.
 In September, local government authorities in the town of
 Bermejo shut down a Catholic Church radio station for
 operating without a license and for broadcasting "subversive
 
 
 411
 BOLIVIA
 communiques." As many radio and television stations operate
 without a license, it was assumed that the station was closed
 for political reasons. As of December, the station remained
 off the air.
 In October unknown assailants bombed the house of Carlos
 Serrate Reich, editor of the leftist La Paz newspaper "Hoy"
 and head of 9 April Vanguard Party. No injuries were
 reported. No group claimed responsibility.
 Prior to the state of siege in August, five unknown assailants
 blew up a Jesuit-owned radio station in Tarija. No group
 claimed responsibility for the attack, although some
 newspapers speculated that it was carried out by
 ultrarightists angered by the radio's alleged leftist
 political orientation. A government investigation failed to
 shed any light on the case.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except during the state of siege, peaceful assembly and
 association were not restricted. Provisions of the state of
 siege prohibited groups of two or more from gathering between
 midnight and 6 a.m.; in October this was modified to between
 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Demonstrations, strikes and protest
 marches were also prohibited under the state of siege, but
 enforcement was lax, and the Government even allowed some
 anti-government marches, protests, and labor strikes.
 Permission had to be obtained from the police for evening
 gatherings, but permits were readily available.
 Bolivian workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. While Bolivian law still does not extend these
 rights to government workers, this distinction is ignored as
 virtually all government employees are unionized.
 The Bolivian Workers Central (COB), an umbrella labor
 federation which represents the majority of Bolivian workers,
 is independent, politically powerful, and in the past has
 frequently paralyzed the economy with crippling strikes. The
 COB has been an arena where leftist and ultraleftist parties
 have fought each other and the Government. Within the COB,
 some political figures have called for revolution, armed
 struggle, repudiation of Bolivia's foreign debt, and mass
 strikes and have questioned the legitimacy of Bolivia's
 legally elected government. The Government places no
 restrictions on a union's right to join international trade
 secretariats or other international labor organizations. In
 June 1986, the Government paid for a COB delegate's trip to
 Geneva to represent Bolivian labor at the annual meeting of
 the International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism, the predominant religion, is recognized by
 the Constitution as the official religion of the country.
 Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the State, but
 no other secular advantage is conferred. Protestant churches
 operate openly and freely. In 1982, a Protestant college
 opened in Santa Cruz. Two years later, a Baha'i university
 opened in the same city. The Mormons, Baha'is, and Seventh
 -Day Adventists freely proselytize and operate churches and
 training centers throughout the country. The small Jewish
 community has been treated fairly by the Paz Government. The
 
 
 412
 BOLIVIA
 Mennonites have large rural colonies in the Department of
 Santa Cruz.
 Citizens in general are free to practice the religion of their
 choice. There are no restrictions on publishing, places of
 worship, religious schools for training clergy, or church ties
 to international organizations. However, Bolivian law
 requires that religious groups be licensed. Although most
 groups receive licenses without difficulty, this requirement
 allows the Government to expel as "illegal" unlicensed sects
 it finds undesireable. While the Government does not
 persecute clergy for their religious beliefs, it sometimes
 displays strong opposition to what it believes are their
 sympathy with and support for "subversives."
 In February the Bishop of Oruro, who is also president of the
 Episcopal Conference, protested that six unidentified men,
 including one in a policeman's uniform, broke into the
 residence of the Oblate Fathers. He said the intruders
 presented no judicial order and searched the house on the
 pretext of looking for a "Colombian." In the same month, the
 Bishop of La Paz protested that Radio San Miguel and church
 officials in the Department of Pando had been harassed by
 local government officials for advocating the rights of
 peasants and the poor.
 In June a Jesuit high school director charged that state
 security personnel raided the school library and beat and
 detained some students for a short time. During the first
 days of the August state of siege, one Catholic priest, two
 Methodist pastors, and some Catholic seminary students were
 detained, apparently suspected of subversive activities. One
 Methodist pastor was released in mid-September after 2 weeks
 in internal exile in northern Bolivia. A leading Methodist
 theologian was also detained in August.
 The Methodist Church has expressed its concern about what it
 sees as incidents of official hostility and the resurgence of
 accusations that the Methodist Church works with Sendero
 Luminoso, the Peruvian terrorist movement.
 In September the Minister of Defense told the Bolivian
 Congress that "foreign citizens who were supposedly in Bolivia
 to fulfill religious missions" were assisting a group of
 miners in anti-government subversion. The Secretary General
 of the Catholic Bishops' Conference called upon the Government
 to prove this accusation.
 In November the Archbishop of Sucre protested that five
 government agents broke into a Franciscan convent looking for
 marijuana plants. No marijuana was found, and the officials
 apologized for the break-in.
 The Government has grown increasingly uneasy over the presence
 of small cults such as "God's Messengers," "Children of God,"
 and Hare Krishna. In April the Foreign Ministry's
 Sub-Secretary for Worship charged that some of these groups
 were functioning "illegally." A government spokesman also
 charged Hare Krishna with using illegal drugs. The Government
 subsequently expelled about 30 foreign Hare Krishna members
 for practicing an "illegal" religion. Again in October, the
 Sub-Secretary warned that there were about 170 "clandestine
 religious sects" in Bolivia, many of which he said had
 "strange ideas that confuse Bolivia's youth."

 BOLIVIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There were no unusual travel restrictions within Bolivia or
 abroad, except during the state of siege. Under the state of
 siege, a police permit was needed to leave the country, travel
 within Bolivia, or drive a car between midnight and 6 a.m.,
 modified in October to between 3 and 5 a.m. Most of these
 restrictions were disregarded. The Government does not
 restrict emigration and guarantees citizens who leave the
 country the right to return. Citizenship is not revoked for
 political reasons. Many Bolivians who either fled the country
 or were exiled for political reasons during the tumultuous
 1978-82 period returned with the restoration of democracy.
 These persons are not politically persecuted or unfairly
 treated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president
 and a functioning and independent bicameral legislature.
 Opposition groups exist both in and out of Congress and are
 tolerated by the Government. The political system is
 dominated by people of European or mixed race origin. Indians
 speaking Aymara or Quechua as a mother tongue make up an
 estimated 60 percent of the population. With some notable
 exceptions, Indians generally have failed to advance to
 leadership positions. This is principally because of economic
 disadvantages, educational and cultural isolation, and some
 overt discrimination. There is no legal discrimination,
 however.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of both
 international and domestic organizations regarding alleged
 violations of civil liberties. The Bolivian Congress has
 subcommittees with responsibility for monitoring human rights.
 The Government is willing to discuss human rights concerns
 with outside or nongovernmental organizations. The President
 and other senior government officials met with Methodist
 Church leaders to discuss human rights concerns in October.
 The Catholic Church, the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights in
 Bolivia (APDHB) and the press have been the most aggressive
 monitors of human rights. Two APDHB leaders were detained
 during the state of siege. The Interior Minister criticized
 the APDHB for "only protecting leftists and not the rest of
 the country."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although protected in theory by social legislation which
 represented a pioneering effort in the Latin American context,
 Bolivian women do not enjoy a status in society equal to that
 of men. The main obstacles to advancement are cultural
 traditions, social conditions, and lack of political
 influence. In rural families, women have contributed
 significantly to economic activities but are nonetheless
 considered subordinate. In urban settings, women are slowly
 achieving a greater role in Bolivian business and professional
 
 
 414
 BOLIVIA
 life. Their participation in cooperatives, community affairs,
 and education is increasing.
 Since the 1952 Revolution, the Constitution has banned racial
 discrimination. However, informal discrimination by Bolivians
 of mixed European origii against people of Indian background
 continues. At least partially as a result of this
 discriminatory treatment, the Indian majority of the
 population remains at the lower end of the country's
 socioeconomic scale. Indians experience poorer health, lower
 life expectancy, less education and income, and higher
 unemployment.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Bolivian labor law prohibits any labor contract which denies a
 worker constitutional rights and freedoms. The employment of
 minors under 18 years of age and women in dangerous,
 unhealthy, or immoral work is prohibited. No other
 restriction on employment of minors exists.
 Bolivia's labor laws contain provisions for child protection,
 paid vacations, and protection of workers' health and safety.
 However, these laws are not rigorously observed in practice
 and funds are lacking for adequate enforcement. The mines,
 often old and operated with antiquated equipment, are
 particularly dangerous and unhealthy. Many mine workers
 suffer from silicosis.
 Bolivia has a minimum wage law and an elaborate system of
 bonuses and compensations for the private sector. Most
 workers observe an 8-hour day.
