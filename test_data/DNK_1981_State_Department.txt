 DENMARK
 
 Human rights receive broad official and public
 support in Denmark. The constitution contains
 specific provisions for the protection of individual
 rights and these provisions are reinforced by
 specific legal statutes. Protections in law are also
 provided to safeguard the rights of minorities. A
 highly-developed social system puts particular stress
 on full consideration for the needs of less
 privileged members of the society. Danish human
 rights policy is guided by three principlest 1) the
 concept of human rights should be expanded to include
 the right to sound economic and social conditions as
 well as civil and political rights; 2) the continued
 extension of the existing legal basis is the best
 surety for improving international protection of
 human rightsu and 3) international controls to
 supervise the protection of human rights should be
 improved.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Protection against offenses committed by any person
 against the integrity of another person is contained
 in Section 244 of the criminal code. There is no
 indication of torture in Denmark.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Provisions of Section 244 and 245 of the
 criminal code prohibit cruel and unusual punishment
 and establish penalties where bodily harm is
 associated with cruelty. These provisions also cover
 offenses against persons in the form of medical and
 scientific experiments. Capital punishment, corporal
 punishment, and imprisonment with hard labor have
 been abolished.
 c. Disappearances
 Danish police and security forces carry out no
 abductions, secret arrests or clandestine detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 No Danish subject can be deprived of his liberty
 because of political or religious beliefs. Article
 71 of the constitution, which provides that personal
 liberty shall be inviolable without due process of
 law, is respected in practice.
 Persons taken into custody must be taken before a
 judge within 24 hours of arrest. If the person
 cannot be immediately released, the judge must decide
 within three days whether the individual should be
 committed to prison or is eligible for release on
 bail. The judge also has authority to determine the
 
 (760)
 
 
 761
 amount and the nature of bail. These judgments are
 subjected to appeal procedures. The constitution
 states that persons may not be held in pre-trial
 confinement for offenses which would normally be
 resolved by payment of fines or by mitigated
 (sentences of seven days up to six months)
 imprisonment until sentence is imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is a basic tenet of Danish justice that trials be
 open and public. The principle of public hearings
 may be limited to protect the parties and witnesses.
 Persons without means to hire legal assistance are
 guaranteed legal aid and persons unfamiliar with the
 Danish language are provided with interpreter service.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 72 of the constitution provides for the
 protection of the home. This section also prohibits
 the seizure and examination of letters or violation
 of the secrecy of postal, telegraph, and telephone
 communications except under judicial order. These
 legal provisions are respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the provisions of
 part VII, article 67, 68, and 70 of the constitution.
 Guarantees of freedom of speech, press, and assembly
 are contained in articles 77 and 79. These
 constitutional provisions are honored both in spirit
 and practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement, emigration and
 foreign travel. In 1980, Denmark admitted a total of
 885 refugees. The normal quota is 500 refugees per
 year with an additional allowance for refugees
 rescued at sea. The bulk of the refugees, i.e., 675
 in 1980, came from Indochina. Refugee assistance is
 coordinated through the Danish Refugee Council
 composed of 12 public and private organizations.
 Among the groups represented on the Council are
 Amnesty International, Caritas, the Danish National
 Council of Women, and the Danish Jewish community.
 Retugee selection principles are agreed upon by a
 committee of representatives of the ministries of
 foreign affairs, of justice, and of social affairs
 plus the Danish Refugee Council. Welfare assistance
 is based on the principles of Danish social law, as
 applied to Danish citizens, adapted to the individual
 needs of refugees. Welfare aid is designed to make
 refugees self-reliant in the community. The program
 includes counseling, financial aid, Danish language
 training, aid with housing, employment, and social
 contacts. Requests for asylum are handled by the
 ministry of justice and are channeled through the
 alien police. If the alien police report is
 
 
 762
 negative, there is an informal hearing in which the
 Danish Refugee Council participates before the
 ministry makes a final decision.
 c. Freedom to Participate in tne Political
 Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. There is respect for civil and political
 liberties both on a theoretical level and in
 practice. Danish law guarantees trade unions the
 right to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and
 lobby. The labor movement, a powerful social and
 political force, fully protects the rights of both
 sexes, a policy backed up by advanced and
 comprehensive public welfare legislation. Danish
 women hold high and influential positions in
 virtually every area of societys they are cabinet
 ministers, parliamentarians, judges, journalists and
 are integrated into the government bureaucracy at all
 levels.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Denmark has conceptually and in practice been a
 leader in the field of human rights. It has
 supported human rights in international fora and been
 in the vanguard of those furthering the rights of
 women, the disadvantaged, and the poor. Its human
 rights record is open for international appraisal.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Danes enjoy a per capita GNP of approximately
 $11,900. At birth, Danes may expect to live to be
 75. The infant mortality rate is 9 per 1000 live
 births, and the fertility rats is 1.8. Population
 grows at the average rate of 0.4 percent annually.
 All school-age children have access to free public
 education, and the nation is 99 percent literate.
 The Danish diet is well in excess of nutritional
 requirements.
 Over 50 percent of the national budget is devoted to
 welfare, housing, labor and education. Social
 benefits are available to all on an equal basis
 without regard to race, creed or ethnic origin.
 However, unemployment among young women is roughly
 twice that of young men.
