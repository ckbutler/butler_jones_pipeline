 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a
 parliamentary democracy and a member of the Commonwealth of
 Nations. It is governed by a prime minister, a dabinet, and a
 bicameral legislative assembly. The Governor General, with
 largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State and
 serves as the representative of the British Monarch. The
 Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister V.C. Bird, Sr., and his Antigua Labor
 Party (ALP) hold 15 of the 17 seats in the House of
 Representatives. The Governor General appoints the 17-member
 Senate with the advice of the Prime Minister and opposition
 leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and
 Barbuda Defense Force, a 90-person infantry unit. .The police
 are organized, trained, and supervised according tb British law
 enforcement practices. The security forces have a reputation
 for respecting individual rights in the performance of their
 duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy, with a strong private
 sector. Following 6 years of high economic growth, Antigua's
 economy slumped to a 6 percent growth rate in 1990 and slipped
 further into recession throughout 1991. A slowdown in the
 tourism sector, Antigua and Barbuda's major industry, caused by
 significantly reduced international travel due to worldwide
 recession and concern over developments in the Perisan Gulf,
 was blamed for the declining growth. A large and growing
 external debt combined with the pressures of meeting payroll
 demands of an oversized public-sector workforce, continued to
 concern the Government.
 The Constitution provides for political and civil rights, which
 are generally respected in practice. However, government
 control of the electronic media continued to result in almost
 no access for opposition parties or persons presenting opinions
 opposed to government policies; during 1991, the Government
 used its monopoly of the electronic media to censor news
 reports about political challenges against ruling party
 members. An amendment to the law to allow flogging as a
 penalty in rape cases-drew protest from one human rights group.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Po-litical and Other Extraludicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance or politically motivated
 abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees, and these prohibitions are
 generally respected in practice. However, in 1990 Parliament
 amdnded the law to permit flogging as a penalty for rape. One

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 human rights organization protested to the Prime Minister that
 flogging constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment.
 There were no reported floggings as a penalty for convicted
 rapists during 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention,
 which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants have the
 right of judicial determination of the legality of their
 detention. Detainees must be brought before a court within 48
 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports of
 involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is modeled on that of the United Kingdom
 and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system. Final
 appeal may be made to the Queens's Privy Council in the United
 Kingdom and is invariably made in the case of death sentences.
 There are no military or political courts. Criminal defendants
 are assured a fair, open, and public trial. In capital cases
 the-Government provides legal assistance-at public expense to
 persons without the means to retain a private attorney. There
 are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence in 1991. The police must
 obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, the press, and
 other forms of communication. These provisions are generally
 respected. However, the Government dominates the electronic
 media, the only daily source of news. The Government owns one'
 of the two radio stations and the single television station. A
 son of the Prime Minister owns the second radio station while
 another son is the principal owner of the lone cable television
 company. The cable service also operates a channel that
 occasionally features local programming. The government-
 controlled media reports regularly on the Government's
 activities but rarely on those of the opposition political
 parties.
 ABS radio and television regularly censor and manipulate news
 -that could be potentially damaging to the Government. During
 public demonstrations in 1991 to-protest the Government's
 apparent reluctance to implement reforms recommended by
 independent commissions set up to investigate the possible
 involvement of Antiguan government officials in the diversion
 of Israeli arms to Colombian narcoterrorists, the Government
 refused to permit selected reports filed by the regional
 Caribbean news agency to be aired on local stations.
 One weekly newspaper representing the opposition publishes a
 variety of opinions.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 police interference. Required permits for public meetings are
 issued by the police and are normally granted. Permits for
 po-litical rallies were routinely granted during 1991. Permits
 for several protest marches were also granted without
 hindrance, although march routes were sometimes altered by the
 police.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is unrestricted exercise of religious fteedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of other
 religious denominations practice their religion and proselytize
 openly without government interference. AU groups are free to
 maintain links with coreligionists in- other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country-, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration-, and Repatriation
 Neither law nor practice restricts the right of. citizens of
 Antigua and Barbuda to move about within, the country, to travel
 abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system
 accommodating a wide spectrum of political viewpoints. All
 citizens 18 years of age and older may register and: vote by
 secret ballot. The Constitution requires general, elections at
 least every 5 years. The Government is obligated- y law to
 hold. voter registration during a fixed period each year, and
 parties coiduct their own registration drives free of
 government interference. The last general elections were held
 in March 1-989 and were won by the ALP. WitY 15 of the 17 seats
 in the House of Representatives, the ALP retains the power that
 it has held since 195r, except for a-period of opposition from
 1971 to 19.6. One seat is held by United -ational Democratic
 Party. (UNDP) leader- Baldwin. Spencer- who is aiso the- designated
 leader of the opposition; The remaiing seat represents the-
 Barbuda constituency, and is held by Hilbourne Fr-ank, a
 politicar independent who leads the Barbuda faction advocating
 secession from the union with Antigua. The opposition has
 charge that the- ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage and
 its influence on the economic life of the- country made it
 extremely- diffieu-lt for opposition parties tor attract
 membership and financial support. During r991, public dissent
 over government policy.came more from competing ALP factions
 than from the oppositin UNDP, which has been increasingly
 quiescent.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Xiqhts
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human
 rights groups have formed to date. There were no requests for
 human rights investigations or inquiries during 1991.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination'based on race, sex, creed,
 language, or social status, and it is generally observed.
 However, while the role of women in society is not legally
 restricted,"frit18tin tends to limit women to home and family,
 particularly in rural areas, and to restrict their career
 options. These traditional roles are changing, however. The
 Government has begun programs to provide enhanced educational
 opportunities for both sexes as well as family planning
 services. The Directorate of Women's Affairs (previously the
 Women's Desk), has worked energetically, with some success, to.
 help women advance in government and the professions, but
 progress is slower in the private sector. The Women's Desk was
 founded a decade ago with one director and a secretary; the
 Directorate now employs, in-addition to the Executive Director,
 three professionals and -clerical and support-staff. In 1991
 the Directorate continued educational programs for women in
 such areas as health, crafts, and improving business skills.
 Most violence against women in Antigua probably goes
 unreported. Gauging the extent of the problem is difficult,
 due to the lack of- accuratedata, and is compounded by the
 reluctance of women in many cases to testify against their
 abusers. Police may be reluctant to interfere in cases of
 domestic violence, and some women charge that the courts are
 too lenient.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to form labor
 unions. Although fewer than 50 percent of Antigua and
 Barbuda's workers-belong to unions, the-important hotel
 industry is heavily unionized. Unions are free to affiliate
 with international labor organizations and do so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda, has two major trade unions: the Antigua
 Trades and Labor Union .ATLU) and the Antigua Workers Union
 (AWU). T!he ATLU is associated-with the ruling ALP, vhile the
 AWU is somewhat more loosely aalied with the opposition UNDP.
 The AWU is the larger and more active of the two major unions.
 The right to strike is recognized by the Labor Code. This
 right may be limited in a given dispute by the Court of
 Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dispute
 requests the court to mediate, there can be no strike, a
 provision of law that the International Labor Organization's
 Committee of Experts again criticized in 1991. Because of the
 delays associated with this process, in practice labor disputes
 are often resolved before a strike is called. There were no
 strikes in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor organizations are free to organize and bargain
 collectively. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law,
 and there have been no reports of its practice. There are no
 areas of the country where union organization or collective
 bargaining is discouraged or impeded. There are no export
 processing zones.
 
 
 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery or forced labor, and they do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law provides a minimum working age of 13, which is
 respected in practice. Responsibility for enforcement rests
 with the Ministry of Labor, which is required by law to conduct
 periodic inspections of workplaces. While there have been no
 reports of minimum age employment violations, the political
 strength of the two major-unions and the powerful influence
 which the Government has on the private sector, combine to make
 the Labor Ministry very effective in the enforcement of this
 issue.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law permits a maximum 4&-hour, 6-day workweek, but in
 practice the standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave and-up to
 13 weeks of maternity leave. Different minimum.wages for
 different work categories were established-by law in 1981.
 Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but in practice the
 great majority of workers earn substantially more than the
 minimum wage. Increases in the minimum wage were recommended
 'in 1989, but there was no action to implement the
 recommendation in 1991. There are no occupational health and -
 safety laws or regulations.
