 LEBANON
 Lebanon is endowed with democratic institutions. Its
 Constitution provides for a unicameral parliament which elects
 the President. Newspapers and private radio stations
 representing a broad spectrum of political opinion operate
 with relatively little government interference. A private
 enterprise economic system prevails. Although restricted by a
 conservative male-dominated society, women have had access to
 education, and many have been able to play a role in the arts
 and professions. Lebanon's numerous religious groups have
 enjoyed freedom of worship. Since independence in 1943 an
 unwritten agreement known as the National Pact has provided
 for the division of elective offices and civil service jobs
 among religious groups, according to their proportion of the
 population as determined by a census taken in 1932.
 Civil strife since 1975 has rendered government institutions
 largely irrelevant to most Lebanese. Unofficial militias have
 seized control of many parts of the country, where they levy
 taxes and enforce their own version of justice without regard
 to the central Government or legal norms. The presence of
 Syrian/Palestinian military forces in the northern third of
 the country and Israeli forces in the southern third has
 greatly diminished government authority in these regions.
 Even in greater Beirut, the only area of the country
 theoretically under government control, government authority
 does not go unquestioned.
 Ten years of violence have severely weakened the Lebanese
 tradition of respect for the rights of others. Not only have
 civilians been endangered unintentionally by opposing groups
 which have fought major battles in densely populated areas,
 but noncombatants far removed from battle-fronts also have
 been the deliberate target of indiscriminate violence
 (terrorist bombings, random shellings, abductions, etc.).
 The violence has had a devastating effect on a once prosperous
 economy. The division of the country into zones controlled by
 militias and foreign armies has disrupted trade and led to
 serious economic hardship in some areas. Business confidence
 has evaporated; new investment has dried up; and remittances
 from overseas Lebanese (a major source of foreign exchange)
 have dropped sharply.
 The year 1984 brought no improvement to the human rights
 situation. As a consequence of many months of fighting
 involving government troops and the several militia forces,
 hundreds of civilians were killed or injured, many lost their
 homes or had them severely damaged, and freedom of movement
 was severely limited. Economic conditions deteriorated
 further, causing widespread hardship. The value of the
 Lebanese pound plummeted and unemployment and underemployment
 increased.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Lebanon's contending factions have come to view political
 killing as a normal part of their struggle. Violence is not
 limited to battles between fighters belonging to the various
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 83
 
 
 1304
 LEBANON
 parties but also is employed against noncombatants both
 indiscriminately and in carefully planned attacks, costing the
 lives of tens of thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants. Although
 there are no accurate statistics, it is clear that political
 killings occurred on a regular basis in 1984.
 The lives of thousands of civilians were endangered by
 artillery fire in 1984. On many occasions this fire has
 appeared to be deliberate. Civilians have also been the
 target of indiscriminate terrorist violence. On several
 occasions car bombs have exploded in crowded streets, killing
 and wounding large numbers of passersby. In most instances
 these explosions have occurred in neighborhoods in which one
 confessional group predominates and have thus appeared to be
 an attack against that group's members.
 There have also been massacres of unarmed civilians.
 According to the international media quoting Israeli sources,
 on September 19 a patrol of the Israeli-armed and -trained
 Army of South Lebanon (ASL) was ambushed in the predominantly
 Shi'a town of Suhmur in Israeli-occupied south Lebanon and
 four Lebanese Druze members of the patrol killed. On the
 following day Army of South Lebanon troops accompanied by
 Israeli officers returned to Suhmur and ordered all males in
 the town to assemble for an investigation of the incident.
 After 500 men had gathered on the edge of town, relatives of
 the slain Druze (ASL) troops arrived on the scene and began
 firing at random with automatic rifles at the assembled
 townsmen in an apparent effort to avenge their kinsmen. The
 attackers killed 13 Suhmur men and wounded 22 before Israeli
 officers present could stop them. Fifteen Druze men from a
 nearby town were subsequently arrested by the ASL in
 connection with this attack.
 In addition to random acts against civilians, there have been
 numerous carefully planned attacks against politically
 important individuals. The senior Druze cleric in Beirut was
 assassinated on December 1, 1983. In Tripoli, a senior
 official of the Tawhid Movement was assassinated on August 2,
 1984.
 In Israeli-occupied South Lebanon politically motivated
 assassinations are also common. Anti-Israeli underground
 organizations have begun to eliminate persons accused of
 collaboration. For example, a group calling itself the
 Lebanese National Resistance claimed responsibility for the
 July 10 assassination of the Mayor of Sarafand and charged him
 with being an Israeli agent. On the other hand, supporters in
 Beirut of the underground groups in South Lebanon have
 frequently charged that Israeli intelligence agents have
 assassinated individuals opposed to the Israeli presence in
 the South.
 Attacks on foreign diplomats stationed in Beirut assumed
 disturbing proportions in 1984. In addition to the September
 20 car bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy which left two U.S.
 personnel dead, diplomats from several other embassies were
 killed or wounded. Other diplomats, including representatives
 of France, Egypt, and the United States, narrowly survived
 assassination attempts.
 b. Disappearance
 During the past 10 years many residents of Lebanon have
 
 
 1305
 LEBANON
 disappeared. Estimates vary but all sources agree that the
 number runs into the thousands. Most seem to have been
 kidnapped by the militias at roadblocks or captured during the
 major battles of the civil war. It is probable that most of
 the disappeared are dead--summarily executed shortly after
 their capture. According to the best estimates, the major
 militias active in the Beirut area have only slightly more
 than 100 persons in their custody. Two prominent members of
 the small Lebanese Jewish community also have been kidnapped.
 One was subsequently found dead; the other remains unaccounted
 for.
 The issue of the missing has generated great public concern as
 relatives have agitated for an accounting of the fate of their
 kinsmen. The Government published in August a list of 764
 names, which it claimed included everyone in government
 custody. On July 11 the Cabinet formed a committee to arrange
 an exchange of militia kidnappees and an accounting of the
 missing. The committee, however, has made little progress.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government officials publicly state that they do not permit
 torture, but there have been reliable reports that both the
 Surete Generale (security police) and the Lebanese Army
 systematically use the threat of torture in the interrogation
 of suspects and security prisoners. In its report, Torture in
 the Eighties, Amnesty International noted that it had received
 allegations of "some cases of torture' in Lebanon.
 There have been fewer complaints about the government security
 services in 1984. This may be attributable in part to an
 improvement in their behavior following the appointment of a
 new Surete chief and a new military prosecutor. In part, it
 must also be ascribed to the Government's loss of control of
 much of Beirut following the battles in February. As a
 result, the area in which the security services could operate
 freely was greatly reduced.
 Prison conditions are generally adequate. Prisons in Beirut
 (less so outside the city) are sometimes overcrowded, but
 sanitation and diet are satisfactory. In principle, families
 are accorded visitation privileges, but this privilege has not
 always oeen granted.
 Relatively little information is available on the treatment of
 prisoners held by the militias. Allegations of brutal
 treatment (usually made by bitter enemies) abound. However,
 in most instances the militias do not appear to abuse their
 prisoners. Summary execution has in the past posed the
 greatest danger for persons held by militias. In 1984
 relatively few instances of such executions were reported.
 There is little information on the treatment of prisoners
 detained by Syrian forces in north Lebanon. Few neutral
 observers, if any, have had access to Syrian detention
 facilities.
 Palestinian guerrilla groups active on Lebanese territory also
 hold prisoners. Little is known about their treatment.
 However, in the summer of 1984 the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) was at last permitted to visit all three
 Israeli prisoners held by the Popular Front for the Liberation
 
 
 1306
 LEBANON
 of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), who had been captured
 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. The prisoners
 were reported in good health.
 Israel holds more than 1,000 prisoners in southern Lebanon,
 most of whom are being detained for alleged involvement in
 attacs on Israeli troops. At the end of September, 982 were
 held in the Israeli prison camp at Ansar, Lebanon. Others are
 detained in a number of smaller centers. Informed sources
 estimate that 80 percent of the population in these prisons is
 Lebanese with most of the remainder Palestinian.
 Conditions in Ansar Camp are reported to be generally
 acceptable. Representatives of the ICRC have visited the camp
 regularly. However, much less is known about the situation in
 the smaller detention centers, where detainees are
 interrogated upon arrest before being either released or sent
 to Ansar. Lebanese sources have alleged that suspects are
 tortured in these centers. This has not been confirmed by
 neutral observers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Lebanese law, a suspect must be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours, but prosecutors sometimes hold a
 suspect for interrogation indefinitely without reference to a
 judge. Every prisoner has the right to legal counsel, but
 there is-Mo public defender's office. In most cases, bail is
 permitted. Even a decree law promulgated in 1983, which
 granted the Lebanese army special powers to maintain order in
 Beirut, required that a suspect be charged within five days
 and that the equivalent of a warrant be obtained prior to
 entering a private building. These provisions were sometimes
 ignored with persons suspected of having engaged in a military
 attack on government forces.
 The Government does not exile political opponents, but
 non-Lebanese security prisoners, including Palestinians
 resident in Lebanon, have been summarily deported. Fear of
 assassination has driven several prominent Lebanese into
 voluntary exile.
 No militia observes the legal safeguards which the Government
 is committed to apply in arrest cases. Instead, members of
 the various groups frequently detain individuals arbitrarily
 for indefinite periods. The detainees are frequently held as
 hostages to be exchanged for persons held by rival militias.
 Some militias presume to enforce law and order in regions
 under their control, arresting and imprisoning individuals on
 purely criminal charges. The Progressive Socialist Party
 (PSP) and Tripoli-based Arab Democratic Party have executed
 individuals for criminal offenses.
 In general, those arrested by the militias are denied access
 to the Lebanese judicial system and due legal process. The
 Lebanese Forces (LF) militia has handed over some of its
 detainees to the Government for investigation and trial.
 However, this militia is widely believed to be holding many
 more persons on criminal charges than it has turned over.
 Israeli military authorities frequently seal off towns or
 villages in South Lebanon for periods of up to seven days
 
 
 1307
 LEBANON
 while searching for perpetrators of guerrilla attacks against
 them. In the course of these "sieges" inhabitants are
 generally prevented from entering or leaving the village. On
 such occasions the Lebanese media have alleged that the
 Israelis have cut water, electricity, and communications lines
 leading into the village.
 Israeli authorities have also expelled individuals considered
 troublesome from the area under their control. Such
 individuals are usually taken to the Israeli forward position
 on the road to Beirut and put in taxis headed for the capital.
 Lebanese government autnorities have been accused in the past
 of holding persons incommunicado for periods of several
 months. However, there were few complaints of such practices
 in 1984. The various militia groups frequently hold persons
 incommunicado for extended periods.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the right to a fair
 public trial. However, there have been complaints that the
 Government has been dilatory in trying some of those
 arrested. The Government has responded by pointing to a
 shortage of judges and the difficulty of conducting
 investigations when much of the country remains beyond its
 control.
 Although Lebanese police and courts are in place throughout
 the country, outside of govdrnment-controlled Beirut the
 disposition of a criminal case ultimately depends on the group
 in power locally. The militias frequently intervene to
 protect their supporters from prosecution. In the occupied
 areas Lebanese authorities reportedly find it difficult to
 arrest and prosecute those with good connections to the
 occupying powers, Syria and Israel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government has generally evinced no interest in
 controlling personal life. The law requires the Government to
 obtain the equivalent of a warrant before entering homes,
 except when the Lebanese Army is pursuing an armed attacker.
 Rights of privacy, however, have been frequently violated in
 the course of military operations mounted by the Government,
 militias, and foreign forces (Syrian, Israeli, and
 Palestinian). All of these groups have attempted to gather
 intelligence on their adversaries. To the extent of their
 ability, they have set up informer networks and monitored
 telephones.
 Sanctity of the home has been violated by some militia groups
 which have deliberately shelled residential areas, destroying
 homes and injuring their occupants. It is a common practice
 for people fleeing fighting to take over the homes of others
 in order to find shelter.
 In Soutn Lebanon Israeli forces on occasion have demolished
 the nomes of persons suspected of activities against the
 Israeli presence. On the night of May 15-16, Israeli forces
 entered a Palestinian refugee camp near Sidon and exploded a
 cache of explosives, damaging the homes of several camp
 
 
 1308
 LEBANON
 residents and injuring three. According to the United Nations
 Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), occupants of these shelters
 were not warned of the explosion in advance.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a long tradition of press and academic freedom.
 The Government has scrupulously protected the rights of those
 who have opposed it only by peaceful means, and no one has
 been imprisoned merely for expressing his views, however
 critical of the Government they may be. An effort made in
 September 1983 to establish some official censorship of the
 media was abandoned after the Government lost control of West
 Beirut, where many newspapers are published, in February
 1984. Dozens of newspapers and magazines representing a broad
 spectrum of opinion are freely published in Beirut. (Even
 when the authorities attempted to censor the press,
 considerable criticism of the Government was allowed.) The
 Government has also tolerated the activities of several
 extralegal private radio stations, operated by widely diverse
 political groups.
 Intimidation of journalists by militias and foreign
 intelligence services constitutes the most serious threat to
 press freedom. During the past year, the offices of the
 conservative newspaper L'Orient Le Jour were rocketed and the
 headquarters of the leading leftist daily As-Safir was bombed
 twice. The As-Safir publisher and editor-in-chief narrowly
 escaped death when a gunman shot him as he entered his
 apartment building.
 Foreign journalists were subjected to similar treatment. A
 U.S. journalist was kidnapped in March 1984 and has not been
 released. In September a Western wire service correspondent
 escaped from kidnappers who had held him for weeks.
 Intimidation of faculty by private groups threatens Lebanon's
 long tradition of academic freedom. In January the President
 of American University of Beirut (AUB) was assassinated by an
 unknown gunman.
 The Israeli authorities have at times banned the entry of
 certain Beirut newspapers into southern Lebanon. As-Safir and
 the Communist daily An-Nida, for example, were barred for
 periods of several weeks in 1984. In September, Israel
 announced that foreign reporters based in Beirut would no
 longer be allowed entry into South Lebanon. Syria too keeps a
 tight rein on correspondents in the area of Lebanon under its
 control, restricting what they can report.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restriction on the right of free
 assembly, as long as it does not incite popular unrest. Many
 groups in Beirut exercised their right to engage in peaceful
 public demonstrations during the past year.
 The major constraint on this freedom comes from the militias
 and foreign forces. For example, this spring militia groups
 prevented a peace march organized by a West Beirut woman and
 involving demonstrators from both parts of the city. In areas
 under the exclusive control of one militia, demonstrations or
 
 
 1309
 LEBANON
 open shows of support for rival militias or political groups
 are not permitted. Although the Syrians have not suppressed a
 militia opposed to them in Tripoli, they have not accepted
 groups hostile to them in other areas. In South Lebanon the
 Israelis have at times permitted peaceful public protests
 against their occupation. On other occasions they have
 dispersed demonstrators. Political groups opposed to their
 presence are not permitted to operate freely in south
 Lebanon. The trade union movement is protected by laws
 permitting the right to organize, strike, and bargain
 collectively. There are also provisions for mediation and
 arbitration. Except for about five percent of the work force,
 all workers belong to one of the 150 unions and 18 labor
 federations comprising the Confederation of Lebanese Trade
 Unions. In theory, unions should exercise considerable
 influence, but in reality workers and the unions are subject
 to pressure by militias and foreign forces. Strikes for
 higher wages were rare in 1984, and union leaders concentrated
 principally on preserving the jobs of union members.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Lebanese can practice their religion freely. The Government
 affirms the right of freedom of worship, and the militia
 groups and foreign forces have not sought to interfere with it.
 The 1943 National Pact essentially allocated political power
 to Lebanon's religious groups, according to the proportion of
 their followers in the 1932 census. The formula stipulated
 that the President would be a Maronite Christian, the Prime
 Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of Parliament a Shi'a
 Muslim. Seats in Parliament were to be divided on a six to
 five ratio of Christians to Muslims. Positions in the
 government bureaucracy were divided on a similar basis. Some
 religious groups thus enjoyed greater political power than
 others, and it was frequently charged that the politically
 powerful groups influenced government policies to the economic
 benefit of their coreligionists.
 Efforts to alter or abolish entirely the system of allocating
 political power have been at the center of Lebanese politics
 for more than three decades. Those religious groups most
 favored by the 1943 formula have sought to preserve it, while
 others who feel disadvantaged by it have sought to revise it.
 This struggle has given a religious coloring to Lebanese
 politics and the continuing civil strife.
 The intensification of religious hatreds has reinforced a
 trend away from confessional mixing. Since 1975 few Muslims
 have lived in Christian East Beirut. In the aftermath of the
 September 1983 fighting in the Shuf most Christians fled the
 area. To date only a handful have been permitted to return.
 Shi'ites in the predominantly Christian Jubayl district
 allegedly were harassed in 1984 in a deliberate effort to
 drive them from the area. Many Christians left predominantly
 Muslim West Beirut during the year, complaining of increasing
 efforts to enforce Islamic mores, including attacks by Muslim
 fundamentalists on bars and threats made against hotels and
 beach clubs which permitted mixed bathing. Lebanese today
 live more and more in neighborhoods and villages exclusively
 inhabited by one religious community. Many fear to travel to
 areas where other sects predominate.
 
 
 1310
 LEBANON
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Foreign travel of Lebanese citizens is unrestricted.
 Emigration and dual citizenship are permitted. There
 is no impediment to voluntary repatriation of those with valid
 identity papers.
 Lebanon has historically been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has given refuge to thousands of Armenians and
 Palestinians as well as smaller numbers from other Middle
 Eastern ethnic/religious groups. Lebanon's political and
 economic troubles in recent years have greatly diminished its
 appeal to refugees. Relatively few sought asylum there in
 1984.
 Lebanon's relationship with its Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians have not been able to obtain
 citizenship. Their involvement in the internal fighting from
 1975 until the evacuation of Palestinian fighters from Beirut
 in the Israeli invasion of 1982 brought them the bitter enmity
 of many other groups. Many Palestinians have encountered
 difficulty in renewing residence permits and travel
 documents. The delay may stem partly from a tremendous
 backlog of work at the Surete Generale, but several
 Palestinians have had their documents renewed with the
 provision that they not be used to return to Lebanon.
 Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of internal travel
 but this freedom has been greatly circumscribed by militia
 groups which have established checkpoints to keep those deemed
 undesirable out of areas under their control. Militias have
 also collected taxes from trucks carrying freight through
 their territory.
 In 1984 Israel progressively tightened restrictions on travel
 into and out of territory occupied by its forces. In February
 the main coastal highway was closed. This, taken with the
 earlier closure of other roads, left a narrow secondary road
 as the only land access into South Lebanon from the rest of
 the country. Travel by sea from the port of Juniyah to the
 ports of Jiyah or Sidon was also permitted. However, Lebanese
 Muslims were generally afraid to use this service, as it was
 operated by the predominantly Christian LF militia.
 In the spring Israel began requiring Lebanese seeking to
 travel in or out of South Lebanon to obtain a permit from its
 authorities. The Israeli Liaison Office in Dubayyah in the
 eastern suburbs of Beirut was the only place outside of South
 Lebanon where such permits could be obtained. When the
 Lebanese Government closed it in early summer, it became
 virtually impossible for Lebanese residing outside
 Israeli-occupied territories to obtain travel permits. In
 August the Israelis announced new controls at the Batir
 crossing point, which barred automobiles and trucks from
 entering South Lebanon. All Lebanese travelers have
 subsequently been forced to enter or exit Israeli-held
 territory on foot. Trucks from one area must off-load their
 cargo onto trucks from the other area.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Lebanon has the institutions of a parliamentary democracy.
 
 
 1311
 LEBANON
 According to its Constitution, elections must be held for its
 99-member Parliament every four years. Parliament elects the
 President every six years, and the President appoints a
 cabinet which must obtain the confidence of Parliament.
 Political parties may be formed. Women enjoy the same civil
 rights as men.
 A decade of civil strife and foreign invasion has robbed these
 democratic institutions of much of their meaning. No
 parliamentary elections have been held since 1972. Although
 Parliament, the Presidency, and the Cabinet continue to
 function, their authority does not extend to those parts of
 the country under foreign occupation or militia control.
 In the past decade the political process has been dominated by
 violence, as militia groups and foreign forces have resorted
 to force to gain their way. Leaders of the major factions met
 in Lausanne, Switzerland, in March 1984 and agreed on a
 program for national reconciliation. These leaders later
 agreed to join a Cabinet, which was able in early July to
 implement a security plan ending the daily skirmishing between
 militia groups along the line which separates East from West
 Beirut. It is still too early to tell whether this Cabinet
 will be able to implement the Lausanne program and restore a
 peaceful, democratic process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has a mixed record in dealings with.
 international human rights groups (indigenous groups have not
 pressed the Government strongly). In its 1984 report Amnesty
 International expressed concern about arbitrary arrests and
 detentions, including incommunicado detention, abductions,
 torture, and extrajudicial killings in regions of Lebanon
 under the effective control of the Government, the Israel
 Defense Forces, the Syrian army, and a number of Lebanese
 militias. Freedom House rates Lebanon 'partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lebanon's economy attained a high degree of prosperity in the
 1950's and 1960's by acting as an entrepot and service center
 for the Middle East. During this period medical and
 educational facilities attained a level unmatched in the Arab
 countries of the Middle East. Wealth tended to center in
 Beirut and, according to some, was concentrated among members
 of the more powerful religious communities.
 Continuing civil strife destroyed the basis of Lebanon's
 prosperity. Beirut's port and airport were closed frequently;
 tourism virtually dried up. Many multinational firms moved
 their regional offices from Beirut to other capitals.
 Remittances from Lebanese working abroad dropped off sharply.
 Industrial production fell 70 percent below the level of
 1975. Many banks are faced with large outstanding loans which
 they cannot collect. Standards of education and health care
 have declined. The economy of South Lebanon was harmed
 seriously by the increasing Israeli restrictions on access to
 the area. Enforced reliance upon a single road created a
 serious bottleneck, preventing export of the South's
 agricultural produce.
 
 
 1312
 LEBANON
 Unemployment appears to be rising rapidly, although no
 accurate statistics exist. The Lebanese Industrialists
 Association has estimated that 80 percent of the factories and
 workshops still operating have dismissed more than half of
 their employees. Underemployment is also a serious problem.
 Many employers have reacted to the slump by putting their
 employees on short time.
 The Government faces great difficulty in dealing with the
 economic and social problems caused by the civil war. The
 loss of control of much of the country to militias and foreign
 armies has drastically reduced its ability to collect direct
 taxes. The prolonged closure of Beirut's port and airrort in
 1984 greatly diminished customs revenues and spurred the
 militias to open small ports where they, not the Government,
 collected 'taxes' on imported goods. As these fees are set
 deliberately at rates below those of government duties,
 shippers continued to use the militia-run ports even though
 Beirut's port reopened, causing government custons revenues to
 remain low. On October 22, however, the Government ordered
 all illegal ports closed. Initial reports indicated that
 these orders were being implemented.
 Despite its financial problems, the Government has tried to
 provide some help to the populace. Prices of some basic
 commodities are subsidized. Also, the Council for Development
 and Reconstruction, a government agency, has attempted to fund
 reconstruction projects. However, there have been charges that
 the Government has disbursed assistance in a biased fashion.
 The inhabitants of South Lebanon, the far north, and the Biqa
 Valley have claimed that they have been ignored. Residents of
 the predominantly Palestinian and Lebanese Shi'a southern
 suburbs of Beirut complain that the Government has been
 dilatory in providing basic services such as water,
 electricity, and telephones to their area and, instead, has
 concentrated on predominantly Christian areas in East Beirut
 and the northern suburbs of the capital. The Government has
 responded to such charges by explaining that it can spend
 money most easily in areas under its control.
 The population is 2,601,000 and is growing at an annual rate
 of 0.7 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 66 and the infant
 mortality rate is 43 deaths per 1,000 live births. The adult
 literacy rate is about 68 percent.
 Women enjoy equality of civil rights and attend institutions
 of higher learning in large numbers (e.g., women make up 41
 percent of the enrollment in American University of Beirut).
 Religion and custom still limit women, however. The
 prevailing atmosphere of insecurity and economic hardship
 makes it difficult for women to expand their participation in
 society. The women's organizations which do exist are for the
 most part subordinate arms of one or another of the political
 parties 'nd work to advance the interests of the parent party
 rather th n of women in general. Moreover, the continuing
 turbulence  as spawned Islamic religious movements which
 advocate con *ning women to traditional roles and "modest
 dress' (e.g., Xhadors and veils).
