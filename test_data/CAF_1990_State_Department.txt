 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) is a one-party state in
 which General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has exercised virtually
 full political control since his accession to power in a
 bloodless coup on September 1, 1981. In 1986 President
 Kolingba introduced a new constitution, which was subsequently
 approved in a national referendum. In that same vote he was
 elected without opposition to a 6-year term as President. The
 new Constitution established a directly elected parliament
 (National Assembly) and an advisory body known as the Economic
 and Regional Council. Both have met regularly since 1987. In
 February 1987, President Kolingba established-the only legal
 political party, the Central African Democratic Assembly (RDC).
 The Ministry of Defense controls a military police force
 (Gendarmerie Nationale), in addition to the armed forces,
 which together number about 4,000. These forces share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian police
 force (Police Nationale) under the Ministry of National
 Security, which is responsible for policing major roads and
 keeping records of the movement of vehicles. President
 Kolingba has a presidential security force.
 The C.A.R. is a poor, landlocked, and sparseIy populated
 country, most of whose inhabitants derive their livelihood
 from subsistence agriculture. Since 1982 the Government has
 tried to implement economic structural reforms in cooperation
 with international donors. However, because of continuing
 unfavorable world economic trends and corruption and
 mismanagement in government, progress has remained elusive.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 199a, including the
 rights of free speech and assembly. The Government continued
 to hold in long-term detention without charge or trial General
 Francois Bozize and 10 followers who were forcefully
 repatriated from Benin in 1989. It also used detention to
 combat growing demands for political reform. Responding to-
 growing popular pressures for political reform in 199&, tie
 Government at first temporized, permitting some harsh
 criticism within party meetings, but later increasingly
 cracked down on political opponents. In September and
 October, it arrested a large number of concerned citizens who-
 called for a national congress, rather than an RDC congress,
 to discuss political reforms. By the end of 1990, the number
 of dissidents in detention stood at more than 44, and some
 were reportedly about to be tried on charges of endangering
 state security. The Government did permit some advances in
 worker rights with the holding of a National Constitutive
 Labor Congress in July, which included the free elections of
 officers. A general strike in November ended peacefully
 following discussions between the unions and the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 A presidential spiritual adviser, Pierre Bernard Kowada, was
 murdered on September 29. The Government has given out very
 little information on the circumstances surrounding the
 murder, but it was widely assumed to have political
 overtones. At the end of the year, details about the murder
 
 
 62
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 remained unclear, but at least five arrests had been made. In
 late December, four of those arrested were tortured, and one,
 Pierre Wanga, died as a result of the torture. The Government
 promised an investigation into the circumstances of Wanga's
 death and later announced that several persons had been
 arrested in connection with this case.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against those found guilty of physical abuse. Nonetheless,
 there were credible reports of police beatings of criminals or
 suspects. Following an attempted prison escape, dissident
 General Francois Bozize was reportedly beaten severely and
 required hospital care. There were no reports of punishment
 of those responsible for the Bozize beating or other instanceg
 of mistreatment. One of 11 men arrested with General Bozize
 in 1989 died in custody from unknown causes. As noted above,
 four suspects in the case were severely beaten, resulting in
 one death and hospitalization of the others. Family members,
 legal counsel, doctors, and clergy generally have access to
 prisoners, including prominent political detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Central African law, political detainees may be held
 without charge for up to 2 months but must then be formally
 charged or released. This limit is consistently ignored by
 the Government. When political detainees are charged,
 judicial procedures allow for indefinite preventive detention
 while the public prosecutor prepares the State's case against
 the accused. Such cases often involve incommunicado detention.
 In normal criminal cases, those arrested must be brought
 within 96 hours before a magistrate, who decides whether
 formal charges will be filed. In practice, this limit is
 often exceeded owing to inefficiencies in judicial
 procedures. No system of bail exists.
 The exact number of political detainees and political
 prisoners is not known. However, at least 44 political
 prisoners, many advocates of multiparty political reform, were
 imprisoned in Bangui at year's end. Included among them are
 former ministers, journalists, academics, bankers, and
 businessmen. Government opponent General Francois Bozize and
 his 10 folloiers have been held without charge since August
 1989. The Government says it will bring them to trial as soon
 as preparations are completed, possibly before the High Court
 of Justice. In addition to the four persons referred to
 above, former minister Sylvestre Yangongo was arrested in
 November in connection with the Kowada murder and has been
 held without charge since then. Sometime political opponent
 Ruth Rolland, arrested on December 16, 1989, reportedly
 remained under house arrest at the end of the year, although
 no charges have yet been filed.
 As 1990 progressed, there were public demands for political
 and economic reforms; in particular students and unemployed
 civil servants demonstrated and went on strike. In September
 the Government arrested 23 members of a group known as the
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Coordinating Committee for 4 National Congress (CCCN) who
 called for a national congress independent from the RDC
 congress meeting. The CCCN members, who favor a multiparty
 system, were arrested while meeting in a private home. A
 subsequent meeting called by the CCCN was broken up by
 security forces and ended in minor rioting and random violence
 against passersby. Other persons sympathetic to the CCCN,
 including General Timothee Malendoma, were subsequently
 arrested (see Section 2.b.). At the end of 1990, the
 Government had still not filed charges against any political
 detainees but continued to claim that the cases against them
 were nearly completed.
 During certain events, such as the Harvest Festival, the
 Government heightens security. At these times, the Government
 controls the activities of about 10 opponents, particularly
 supporters of former Emperor Bokassa, by holding them under
 house or village arrest until the event is over.
 Two expatriates accused of possessing military material were
 held for approximately 3 1/2 weeks without being formally-
 charged. They were eventually released and repatriated.
 The number of political opponents outside the C.A.R. is
 unknown. Among those exiled are Rodolph Iddi-Lala, whose
 current whereabouts are unkown, and Ange Patasse, currently in
 Lome, Togo. Opposition tracts from Central African students
 and opposition groups based in France circulated in-Bangui in
 May
 e. Denial of Fair Ptblic Trial
 The judiciary consists of regular and military courts, with
 the Supreme Court at the apex. In most common criminal cases,
 the Government permits legal procedures to be fairly-and
 openly applied.   However, execution of the law is hampered by
 inadequate training of officials, deliberate underfunding of
 the judicial system, and persistent traditional beliefs
 regarding witchcraft and sorcery which sometimes take
 precedence over strict rules of evidence. The accused have a
 right to legal counsel at all stages in the formal procedures
 and have the right of appeal.
 In 1988 a High Court of Justice was created to try political
 prisoners, replacing the special tribunal of civilian
 magistrates and military advisers which had adjudicated
 political cases from 1981 to 1987. It functions in much the
 same manner as the ordinary courts, except there is no right
 of appeal. The possibility of presidential clemency exists.
 No cases have yet come before this Court, although a president
 of the Court was named in October 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famtly, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference with privacy is common in political
 and security cases. Legal prohibitions on invasion of the
 home without a warrant are not generally abused in civil and
 criminal cases. Police are allowed to search private property
 without written authorization in suspected political cases.
 The consensus among Central Africans is that their GovernNent
 keeps a close watch on any citizen who opposes or appears to
 oppose it, but government surveillance is rare in practice.
 To combat increasing local crime, including robbery and
 assault, citizens' action groups, called vigilance committees,
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 were created by the party in 1988. These committees,
 consisting of 20 volunteers per neighborhood, patrol the
 streets and have the right to stop and hold suspected
 criminals briefly before handing them over to the police. A
 code of conduct guides committee members and prohibits them,
 for example, from invading private property or acting in the
 capacity of a police officer.
 Civil servants are not required to be party members, but there
 are strong social pressures to join, particularly for those
 holding higher level positions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of private citizens to speak publicly about
 political developments or to criticize the Government is
 circumscribed, although most people feel free to comment
 privately on political affairs. The RDC insists that it is an
 open forum in which all viewpoints may be expressed, but
 nonparty members disagree with this claim. The National
 Assembly provides a forum for public discussion of government
 policies, but as the Assembly is subservient to the executive,
 few citizens follow Assembly debates or approach their
 representatives with their concerns.
 Newspapers, radio, and television are all government owned and
 controlled. The media provide uncritical support for
 President Kolingba and the RDC. The sole newspaper, E Le
 Songo, was not published from April to September due to lack
 of funds. Domestic news favors upbeat stories and
 noncontroversial events. Reporting on international news is
 selective and tends to avoid events that may be embarrassing
 to friendly foreign governments. Radio reports in the past
 year, however, have included accounts of efforts to reform
 other single-party systems in Africa and Eastern Europe.
 In May and June, open letters to President Kolingba bearing
 several hundred signatures circulated throughout Bangui. The
 signatories sought political reform and claimed these letters
 were the only means of expressing peaceful dissent. While at
 first they were not harassed, eventually at least 20 civil
 servants were removed from their political appointments,
 prompting several others, including one state secretary, to
 deny having signed one of the letters.
 Attorney Nicolas Tiangaye faced the equivalent of disbarment
 for remarks critical of the Government during his defense of
 two military officers accused of coup plotting. The Minister
 of Justice was removed from his position for backing
 Tiangaye. The Tiangaye case was dismissed by the Disciplinary
 Council in October.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to assembly is constitutionally guaranteed but is
 restricted in practice. Beginning in April, a number of
 peaceful demonstrations were held in Bangui by unemployed
 civil servants, teachers, and students. Security forces
 monitored the demonstrations and initially did not interfere
 with the demonstrators, on specific instructions from the
 Minister of the Interior. In later demonstrations Security
 forces actively intervened to disperse crowds, notably during
 a university teachers' strike that involved the stoning of
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 passing vehicles and led ultimately to a march towards the
 Presidential Palace. The presidential security forces fired
 tear gas into the air to disperse crowds but made no arrests.
 These demonstrations coincided with a growing demand from a
 cross section of Central African society for an open
 conference to discuss current political problems and the
 future political structure of the C.A.R. The Government
 refused all such requests, stating that all national concerns
 would be discussed at a party congress to be held in October.
 Those not in the party claimed that such a congress would not
 represent all sectors of the population and continued to
 demand a national meeting. The party congress produced
 several recommendations aimed at improving economic,
 political, and social conditions in the C.A.R., but it
 endorsed the single-party political system, proclaiming an
 openness to all political tendencies within the party.
 Although other views were expressed at the Congress, members
 of the opposition, several of whom were in jail, were notably
 absent. Nonparty members continue to seek a congress which
 would allow them to speak out.
 On September 12, the authorities arrested 23 signatories-of a
 May open letter to President Kolingba, who were meeting at the
 home of one of the signers to discuss the political situation.
 They were ostensibly arrested for not notifying the Government
 of the meeting. Supporters of those arrested stated that it
 was not necessary to inform the Government since it was a
 meeting in a private home (see Section l.d.)_
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A, variety of religious groupings are active in the country,
 including traditional African faiths, Christian denominations,
 and Muslims. Religious organizations and missionary groups
 are generally permitted to operate freely, but any group whose
 behavior is considered political in nature is quickly
 stifled. In September 1989, the Minister of the Interior
 suspended indefinitely the activities of the Union of
 Evangelical Pentecostal Churches for "irresponsible conduct."
 It remained suspended at the end of 1990.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 While people are generally free to move about within the
 country, police at checkpoints along major roads sometimes
 harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes.
 The right of voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized.
 Financial and educational constraints, rather than government
 controls, act to restrict most foreign travel and emigration.
 There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 Attorney Nicolas Tiangaye was restricted from movement outside
 Bangui city limits pending a government investigation against
 him, but the restriction was lifted upon dismissal of the
 case. Signers of open letters to President Kolingba and some
 former ministers have also been forbidden to leave the country.
 In late 1990, approximately 5,000 Sudanese fleeing civil
 strife in Sudan sought safe haven in the remote southeastern
 corner of the C.A.R.. The C.A.R. National Commission for
 Refugees, in collaboration with U.N. agencies and private
 relief groups, is providing assistance for this group. The
 C.A.R. also hosts just over 1,600 self-settled Chadian
 
 
 66
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 refugees who were no longer receiving international assistance
 by the end of 1990. The Government has a generally positive
 attitude towards the protracted stay of this refugee group and
 has made no effort to revoke their refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite constitutional guarantees, citizens may not change
 their goverment by democratic means. In practice, National
 Assembly elections have been limited to choosing between
 multiple candidates vetted by the sole political party, and
 only the RDC may nominate a candidate for President. The
 power and prerogatives of the President and the sole party
 have not been susceptible to peaceful change from below. The
 President makes all important national policy decisions.
 Although he allows his Cabinet considerable leeway in
 day-to-day activities of government administration, cabinet
 changes are made often.
 The Constitution grants the National Assembly the authority to
 debate and vote on bills proposed by the executive and to
 initiate legislation of its own. Deputies have constitutional
 immunity from prosecution or other government interference for
 opinions voiced or votes cast during the exercise of their
 duties in the National Assembly. Assembly sessions often
 involve frank criticism of government policy, and Deputies
 have been able to modify the language of proposed
 legislation. Still, the Assembly has yet to reject a law put
 before it. Deputies have begun to cast negative votes or
 abstain when not in agreement with proposed legislation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations to monitor human rights
 issues. Although the October party congress discussed a
 recommendation for a national human rights organization,
 government critics remained skeptical that any truly
 independent human rights organization would be permitted. The
 Government permits representatives of Amnesty International
 and the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit
 Bangui periodically. In January the Government hosted a
 conference on human rights sponsored by the International
 Committee on African Human Rights. A broad cross section of
 citizens, including political opponents, attended the
 conference.
 Section 5 Discrimination based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before
 the law without regard to wealth, race, or religion. In
 practice, some minorities tend to receive unequal treatment,
 e.g., the forest-dwelling Bamingua, commonly known as Pygmies,
 are subject to discrimination and exploitation which the
 Government has done little to correct. Pygmies are often
 hired by villagers to work for wages much lower than those
 received by other groups. There are some indications that
 Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peuhl) herders, are resented by
 other Central Africans because of their economic well-being
 and are singled out for harassment, such as police shakedowns.
 There are more than 80 ethnic groups in the Central African
 Republic, and about 70 percent of the population is Ngbaka,
 
 
 67
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Baya, or Banda. Despite President Kolingba's statements about
 the desirability of ethnic balance in his Cabinet, preference
 for high government and military positions has been given to
 membert of his Yakoma ethnic group which forms less than 10
 percent of the population. During a special session of the
 RDC in May, the Government was publicly criticized for its
 ethnic imbalance and corruption. President Kolingba responded
 by making changes in his Cabinet, including the replacement of
 Yakoma. The percentage of Yakoma in the Cabinet.remains out
 of proportion with their percentage in the total C.A.R.
 population and Yakoma retain key financial and security
 positions, including in a number of state-owned enterprises.
 Although the Constitution affirms the equality of all
 citizens, women traditionally have been accorded fewer
 opportunities than men. There is no precise data on the
 percentage of women in the wage labor force, but in 199a women
 for the first time were accepted for training in the
 Gendarmerie, with the first class expected to graduate in
 1991. Many women are involved in traditional agricultural
 activities, while others are in commerce as market vendors.
 Many educated women working outside the home are in clerical
 positions. A small but growing number of women are
 establishing private businesses or moving into the upper ranks
 of the Government. While women have equal access to
 education, a majority of young women leave prior to completing
 high school due to social pressures.
 Polygamy is legally sanctioned, although increasingIy fewer
 women accept the practice. A prospective husband must
 indicate at the time of the-marriage contract whether he
 intends to take further wives.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it
 is difficult to gauge the extent of the problem, as it is
 seldom officially reported. The Ministry of Justice does not
 generally learn of many cases concerning spouse abuse,
 although it reports the issue-does come up during divorce
 trials or in civil suits for damages. Most often, women
 tolerate abuse in order to retain a measure of financial
 security for themselves and their children. Neither the
 Government nor the women's division of the RDC has publicly
 addressed this issue, although the Women's Party Organization
 has begun to consider the problem. Cases of domestic violence
 occasionally appear in the judicial column of E Le Songo.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) has been forbidden by
 law since the 1960's, but it continues to be practiced in
 rural areas and, to a lesser degree, in the Muslim quarters of
 Bangui. Many urban dwellers consider it an outdated custom.
 Enforcement of the prohibition is rare as it is basically
 considered a private, family matter. The practice of proper
 hygiene during circumcisions has become a target of the
 Government's AIDS awareness campaign.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 A 7-year suspension of most trade union activity ended in
 1988, when a law granting trade union freedom and the
 protection of union rights was adopted. This law permits
 workers freely to establish and join organizations, to draw up
 constitutions and rules, to elect representatives, and to
 formulate programs of action  The law permits strikes when
 
 
 68
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 all efforts at conciliation have failed. If a government
 mediator and an arbitration council both fail to achieve
 agreement between labor and management, then a strike is
 permitted provided notice of intent to strike is given. It
 also allows unions to affiliate with international labor
 organizations.
 The law entered into full force on May 1, 1989, with the
 Minister of Labor giving workers throughout the country
 official permission to begin organizing. The Government
 determined that all major trade unions should be established
 through elections organized by profession and place of work
 before workers would be permitted to convene a congress to set
 up a nationwide structure. In response to concern voiced by
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) that the law
 mandates a single federation, the Government has stated that
 the law does not require unions to form a single trade union
 federation.
 By December 60 local unions and six federations had been
 recognized by the Ministry of the Interior. A National
 Constitutive Congress was held in Bangui in early July,
 attended by almost 200 union members from throughout the
 country, as well as representatives of international labor
 organizations. The Congress formed a new umbrella trade
 union, the Union Syndicale des Travailleurs de Centrafrique
 (USTC), elected a 21-member executive bureau by secret ballot
 in a contested election, and selected representatives to the
 Regional and Economic Council and to the Board of the Social
 Security Office.
 In October 1990, teachers and health workers went on strike
 demanding that their salaries, which had been frozen for 8
 years, be increased. In support, the USTC executive bureau
 called a general strike on November 21, after negotiations
 between union and government leaders proved inconclusive.
 While acting with restraint; the Government maintained that
 the strike was illegal as the appropriate procedures had not
 been followed, e.g., arbitration councils had not been
 formed. On December 4, the strike ended without the teachers'
 having achieved the salary concessions they had sought
 However, the Government agreed in principle to raise salaries
 and negotiations were expected to resume in early 1991.
 Although the strike could not be considered a complete
 success, it clearly established the unions' legitimacy.
 In April 1989, the U.S. Government announced the suspension of
 certain tariff preferences accorded the C.A.R., based largely
 on the Government's failure to respect freedom of association
 since 1981. The C.A.R. formally requested reinstatement in
 September 1989, and the matter is currently under
 consideration by the U.S. Government's Generalized System of
 Preferences Subcommittee.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 1988 union law, which applies throughout the country,
 accords trade unions full legal status, including the right to
 own property and to sue in court, but it does not specifically
 address whether trade unions may engage in collective
 bargaining. Mechanisms for collective bargaining spelled out
 in the 1961 Labor Code were occasionally used in the private
 sector during the ban on union activity but had not yet been
 fully revived in late 1990. Employers are forbidden from
 discriminating against workers on the basis of union
 
 
 69
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 membership or union activity, and infractions can result in
 the assessment of legal damages. It is too early to tell
 whether, or how effectively, these provisions will be
 enforced. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is not practiced but is not specifically
 prohibited by law. The Government has maintained that the
 laws in question, which all date back to the 1960's, are
 obsolete and are no longer observed or enforced. At the end
 of 1990, amendments to the 1961 Labor Code, bringing it into
 line with ILO standards, were under review by the Council of
 Ministers, prior to being introduced in the National Assembly
 for debate.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law. The relevant legislation is only loosely enforced. Jobs
 are in such demand by adults that children in the labor force
 are generally limited to helping the family in traditional
 subsistence farming or retailing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government, and a social
 security system exists for private industry. The minimum wage
 for a manual laborer, for example, is about $40 per month and
 for a stenotypist about $140 per month. These salaries assure
 a family the basic necessities but are.barely adequate to
 maintain a decent standard of living. The Government has not
 raised the minimum wage since 1980, partly in response to
 pressure from international financial institutions. Much
 labor is performed outside the wage and social security
 system, especially by self-employed farmers in the large
 subsistence agricultural sector. The law sets maximum working
 hours for government employees and most people in the private
 sector at 40 hours per week. Domestic employees may work up
 to 55 hours per week. There are also general laws on health
 and safety standards in the workplace, but they are neither
 precisely defined nor actively enforced.
