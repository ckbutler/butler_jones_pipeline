 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which effective political power is
 exercised by the President and a strong ruling party. The
 President's party commands a large majority in Parliament, but
 opposition parties play an increasingly important role. The
 Cabinet is headed by a Prime Minister responsible to the
 President. The parliamentary institutions are the Peoples
 Assembly and the Shura (consultative) Council.
 Vice President under Sadat, Hosni Mubarak was elected
 President in 1981, following Sadat's assassination, in
 accordance with constitutional procedures. Mubarak's National
 Democratic Party (NDP) retained its majority in the Peoples
 Assembly elections held in May. Two opposition parties are
 represented in the Peoples Assembly, but the NDP, whose
 chairman is President Mubarak, represents the major force in
 the Peoples Assembly and political life generally. There is
 an independent judiciary. Governmental and legal systems
 reflect Egypt's Muslim and Arab heritage, as well as
 principles deriving from the 1952 revolution and other stages
 in the nation's political development. Western influences are
 also present, as evidenced by the country's Napoleonic legal
 code.
 The scope for legal opposition to the Government is limited
 but increasing. Representatives of opposition parties
 participate fully in Peoples Assembly debates and, joined by
 NDP members, regularly criticize government policies.
 Al-Shaab and Al-Ahali, two secular opposition papers banned by
 Sadat in 1981, now conduct a lively debate on national
 issues--frequently, and often harshly, criticizing government
 figures. As soon as it returned to political legitimacy in
 1983, the New Wafd Party began publishing its weekly
 newspaper, Al-Wafd. The other opposition papers include the
 Socialist Liberals' weekly Al-Ahrar and Al-Umma, which appears
 irregularly. These papers, and sometimes officially supported
 publications as well, challenge government policies and
 officials.
 After Sadat's assassination in October 1981, a state of
 emergency was proclaimed. It was extended by presidential
 decree and with the approval of the Peoples Assembly in 1982
 and 1983 and again in September 1984. Under it, certain
 constitutional and legal safeguards, normally associated with
 the protection of civil and political liberties, can be
 suspended. In September, the Prime Minister announced that no
 Egyptian citizen was being held under the emergency
 provisions, and there have been no reports to the contrary.
 In September, the trial of 300 persons connected with the
 Al-Jihad (Holy War) organization ended with the Supreme State
 Security Court acquitting 190 defendants and sentencing the
 remaining 110 to prison terms. There were no death
 sentences. The Al-Jihad organization has been described as a
 loose association of Islamic extremist groups dedicated to the
 overthrow of the secular Egyptian state and to the
 establishment of an 'Islamic Republic" based on Shari'a law.
 The defendants were charged with inciting a violent uprising
 in Assiut following Sadat's assassination. In a separate
 trial, in which defendants faced the less serious charge of
 membership in the banned Al-Jihad organization, the Supreme
 State Security Court in October decided, at the prosecution's
 request, to postpone the proceedings indefinitely. The Court
 also acted to free 62 defendants still detained; 114 accused
 
 
 1203
 EGYPT
 in the case had previously been released for lack of
 evidence. There has been no indication if or when this case
 may be resumed.
 In another major development, President Mubarak's decree of
 January 1, 1985, restored Pope Shenouda to the full exercise
 of his papal functions, effectively terminating his enforced
 seclusion. His alleged involvement in sectarian strife led
 Sadat in 1981 to suspend official recognition of his status as
 Patriarch of the Coptic Christian Orthodox Church. Pope
 Shenouda was subsequently confined to a monastery in Wadi
 Natrun. A 1983 court ruling upheld the validity of this
 decree, but legal redress was still being sought for Pope
 Shenouda at the time of his release.
 The National Democratic Party (NDP) and four opposition
 parties together ran over 2,000 candidates for 448 seats in
 the Peoples Assembly in the May elections, widely regarded as
 the freest since the 1952 revolution. The NDP received 73
 percent of the vote. In postelection statements, the
 opposition charged the Government and the NDP with committing
 numerous improprieties to influence the balloting results.
 The then-Interior Minister acknowledged that irregularities
 had taken place and gave assurances that abuses would be
 rectified. President Mubarak has advised election critics to
 follow up on their complaints through the courts.
 Egypt is a developing country moving toward political
 liberalization and greater freedom of expression. Scope for
 initiative has been expanded by economic development and
 social policies. Although the Government discourages and in
 some cases actively opposes certain political activities, its
 human rights record in 1984 continued a trend of progressive
 improvement over the situation prior to 1981. Some members of
 the Christian minority are concerned by the potential threat
 to their rights posed by growing Islamic influence in Egyptian
 life. However, the Government appears committed to the
 protection of minorities' rights. The demonstrated
 independence of the judiciary and the greater freedom accorded
 the media are also encouraging. Mechanisms for redress of
 abuses of human rights are available and are used.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of government-instigated
 killings in 1984. The one reported instance of a politically
 motivated slaying occurred during the Peoples Assembly
 elections in May, when a supporter of the ruling NDP shot and
 killed a candidate of the opposition Socialist Labor Party.
 The perpetrator was apprehended and charged with murder.
 According to an opposition press report in October, he was at
 that time free on bail, awaiting resumption of his suspended
 trial. There is no evidence of official involvement in the
 killing, which apparently was the result of a local partisan
 feud.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known politically motivated disappearances in
 1984. Names of persons detained by authorities under
 
 
 1204
 EGYPT
 emergency law are generally made public, and the detainees are
 entitled to inform whomever they wish of their detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are forbidden by the Constitution and by law.
 Persons claiming to have been tortured have redress in the
 courts. Information gained through torture is not admissible
 in court, and police and security officials convicted of
 torture face prison terms and other lesser sanctions. Some
 detainees and prisoners have claimed they were tortured and
 have submitted appeals for redress to the courts or to the
 public prosecutor. These appeals, which usually lead to
 investigations by legal and medical authorities, sometimes end
 with the Government's denial of the alleged torture. More
 often, the Government fails to reveal the findings of its
 investigatiois.
 On November 3 the semiofficial daily Ai-Ahram reported that
 the Supreme State Security Court had 'conclusive evidence" of
 torture in the Al-Jihad case which ended September 30. This,
 according to Al-Ahram, was the basis for the acquittal of some
 defendants and the relatively lenient sentences meted out to
 others, and led to calls by the judges for an immediate
 investigation to identify the responsible security officials.
 That investigation is under way.
 Opposition papers had already been featuring allegations of
 the torture of Al-Jihad defendants, as well as in other
 instances. In September, the New Wafd's weekly newspaper,
 Al-Wafd, alleged that various Al-Jihad detainees, along with
 other persons associated with radical Muslim and leftist
 groups during the period 1981-83, had been tortured.
 Accompanying the article, which named some individual victims
 and described torture methods allegedly used, are facsimiles
 of official medical reports on torture cases that appear
 genuine. In July, the National Progressive Unionist Grouping
 Party's weekly, AI-Ahali, claimed that officials at Cairo's
 Torah Prison had tortured a detainee to death. In December,
 the opposition press accused security officials of torturing
 students detained in connection with the disorders that
 erupted at Cairo's Al-Azhar university in late November.
 In September, Al-Ahram and other progovernment papers joined
 the opposition press in reporting the suspension from duty and
 arrest of a police official in Fayyoum Governorate for
 severely beating an ex-convict during interrogation.
 Moreover, according to the opposition paper AI-Ahrar, the
 courts recently acted to rectify abuses dating back to the
 Nasser era by awarding compensation to an individual tortured
 and imprisoned in 1965.
 In its report Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International
 noted that it had rarely received reports of torture or
 ill-treatment in Egypt until after the assassination of
 Sadat. Between October 1981 and March 1982, however, it had
 received numerous and consistent reports of torture and
 ill-treatment, mostly relating to alleged members of militant
 Islamic groups, notably Al Jihad, but also including several
 left-wing detainees.
 
 
 1205
 EGYPT
 As in 1983, there were reports in the opposition papers of
 strikes by Al-Jihad defendants in protest over prison
 conditions, including solitary confinement, flogging, and
 other forms of physical abuse. There is evidence that prison
 guards at times beat inmates or strike them with rifle butts
 to discipline them. There were also opposition press stories
 of major prison riots, allegedly the result of discontent over
 substandard prison conditions and mistreatment by guards, in
 August and September at facilities in Gharbiyya Governorate
 and Alexandria. However, there are reports that Alexandria
 prison officials are now acting to improve living conditions
 and eliminate excesses by guards.
 Conditions vary with respect to living conditions and
 treatment. Prisons often appear to be crowded and to lack
 adequate medical and sanitary facilities. Some prisons,
 however, appear to provide reasonable living conditions and
 opportunities for vocational training and recreation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 Arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile are forbidden by law.
 Arrests follow investigations, and arrested persons are
 charged with violations of specific laws. With some
 exceptions which are discussed below, preventive detention is
 not practiced. Arrested persons have the right of habeas
 corpus and there is a system of bail. The law, however,
 permits detention of a suspect in a crime up to 90 days during
 investigation. By and large, constitutional and legal
 safeguards of due process in the arrest and pretrial custody
 stages are carefully observed. Arrests occur openly and with
 warrants, and the accused are brought before an independent
 judiciary. The Government does not appear to practice
 incommunicado detention.
 Exceptions to these arrest and detention procedures have
 existed during the state of emergency, which, since Sadat's
 assassination, has been extended annually by presidental
 decree, with approval by the Peoples Assembly. The
 Constitution and the Emergency Law of 1958, as amended,
 empower the President to invoke his emergency powers when
 security or public order is in peril. Among these powers is
 the authority, delegated by the President to the Prime
 Minister and Interior Minister, to order the arrest or
 detention of persons suspected of being dangerous to state
 security, without regard for provisions of the code of penal
 procedure. The emergency powers of arrest and detention have
 been circumscribed in the past few years. For example, the
 emergency law was amended in 1982 to accord detainees and
 prisoners greater rights of appeal, as well as prompt redress,
 including judicial review, against improper treatment. In
 1983 several related laws granting the Government additional
 authority to arrest and detain suspects were repealed or
 liberalized.
 With the September 30 verdicts in the Al-Jihad trial, all
 persons arrested or detained under the state of emergency
 following Sadat's assassination have now been either tried and
 convicted, or released. The last were the 62 defendants in a
 separate Al-Jihad trial, and they were released in October
 following suspension of the current proceedings. In 1983 and
 1984, arrests and detentions under emergency provisions
 dropped sharply from 1981-82 levels. According to the Prime
 Minister's testimony before the Peoples Assembly in September,
 
 
 1206
 EGYPT
 no citizen was being held under emergency provisions.
 According to an official source, as of December 1983, the
 Government was holding one person, presumably the Muslim
 religious figure Sheikh Taba Ahmed Al-Samawi. Detained in
 1981, Al-Samawi was released in the spring of 1984. According
 to the Interior Minister, authorities did not resort to
 emergency powers in dealing with the civil disturbances
 September 30 in the Delta city of Kafr Al-Dawwar. Instead,
 security forces reportedly followed the search, arrest, and
 detention procedures of the standard penal code to apprehend
 those suspected of violence. The opposition charged that
 there was excessive use of police force. In the course of the
 prosecutor's investigation, some suspects were released, while
 others were remanded for trial.
 There were no reports of arbitrary deportation of foreigners.
 However, the opposition paper Al-Ahali reported that
 authorities expelled numerous Syrians, Lebanese, and
 Palestinians for alleged subversive activities following the
 unsuccessful Libyan plot in November to assassinate exiled
 former Libyan Prime Minister Bakoush. The Government has not
 confirmed such action.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law provides for public trial and equal treatment
 before the law, and these legal safeguards appear to be
 observed. Persons accused of espionage, plotting to overthrow
 the state, or similar crimes, however, are tried in State
 Security Courts, often in closed proceedings. The Al-Jihad
 trials were held in these courts, and a number of the sessions
 were closed. However, all of the Al-Jihad defendants in the
 case that ended September 30 were present at the proceedings
 and were represented by lawyers conducting an active defense.
 This is also true of another case recently brought before the
 State Security Court involving 19 defendants charged with
 belonging to an armed, Communist-oriented group. According to
 Al-Ahali, in August the court ordered the release of all the
 accused.
 There is widespread agreement that, under Mubarak, the
 judiciary enjoys greater independence. For example, the
 September 30 Al-Jihad verdicts were less harsh than expected,
 including 190 acquittals and no death sentences. Of the
 remaining accused, 17 were sentenced to life imprisonment at
 hard labor--the harshest penalty meted out--while 93 others
 received prison terms ranging from 2 to 15 years. In a
 posttrial interview, the presiding judge declared that there
 had been no governmental interference to influence the
 verdicts.
 Article 2 of the Constitution states that Islamic
 jurisprudence is the principal source of law. However, the
 application of Islamic law is limited to the so-called "Family
 Status Courts," which have jurisdiction over such matters as
 divorce and inheritance for Muslims. In addition to Islamic
 law, these courts apply the codes of other religions in family
 matters if the parties are non-Muslims.
 There are no public statistics on the number of persons
 serving prison sentences (as opposed to detainees on trial or
 awaiting prosecution) for acts of violent protest or
 membership in proscribed organizations espousing terrorism or
 the violent overthrow of the state. However, in the wake of
 the Al-Jihad verdicts of September 30, there remain an
 
 
 1207
 EGYPT
 estimated 200. The conviction and sentencing of "prisoners of
 conscience' or other nonviolent dissenters appear to occur
 rarely, if at all. However, the emergency law provides ample
 powers to detain people believed to be planning violent acts
 against the Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference by the state or by
 political organizations in private life is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. The Government does not appear to interfere,
 except where actual crimes are involved or where the state
 believes there is evidence that persons may be engaging in
 potentially violent political activity.
 Under normal circumstances, police must obtain a warrant from
 the State Security Prosecutor before undertaking arrests,
 searches, or seizures. The warrant need not specify the
 material being sought in a search, and the material seized can
 be presented as evidence during trials. On occasion, the
 courts have dismissed cases when they considered that warrants
 were issued without sufficient cause. Officials who conduct
 searches without a proper warrant are subject to criminal
 penalties. Monitoring of correspondence or telephones does
 not appear to take place without the legally required
 authorization of the State Security Prosecutor.
 The emergency law empowers the President to authorize searches
 of individuals or premises without regard for the code of
 penal procedure. Since the sweeps carried out in the wake of
 Sadat's assassination in 1981, there has been one credible
 report of a warrantless search. According to an opposition
 weekly, in April security forces, relying on emergency powers,
 searched private residences without warrants as part of a
 massive hunt for purloined evidence, chiefly weapons, in the
 Al-Jihad trials. Subsequently, a security guard confessed to
 stealing the weapons in order to sell them.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government's respect for these freedoms is
 reflected in the debate of national issues and criticism of
 government officials in the media. Such debate appears
 occasionally in the government-owned press, but criticism is
 found especially in the weekly newspapers of the legal
 opposition parties. The opposition press gave full coverage
 to the riot late last September in the textile town of Kafr
 Al-Dawwar, criticizing the Government's handling of the
 situation; no censorship was applied. Many believe that the
 press has never been freer than it is today, an opinion
 supported by an evaluation published by the London-based
 International Press Institute in December. According to a
 statement by the Institute's Director General quoted in the
 Egyptian press, the Institute has chosen Cairo as the site for
 its general assembly meeting in 1985, reflecting its
 recognition of the extent of press freedom attained in Egypt.
 Nonetheless, the Government can, and occasionally does,
 exercise influence on government-owned publications, including
 the major daily newspapers, whose editors are appointed and
 can be dismissed by the Government.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 77
 
 
 1208
 EGYPT
 There is no machinery for direct control of the print media
 (as there is for radio and television), but under the law the
 Shura Council has responsibility for press supervision. The
 Council theoretically exercises its supervision through the
 Government's ownership of major non-party newspapers and
 magazines and through its role in the Higher Press Council.
 The latter, a 45-member body chaired by the Speaker of the
 Shura Council and composed of senior press figures, is not
 designed to serve as a vehicle for imposing censorship over
 the press and does not appear to be a very active body.
 Overt censorship does not exist, though journalists working
 for government-owned newspapers may be "guided' on occasion by
 officials on the treatment of specific issues. Sanctions
 against press critics are rarely applied. Since Mubarak
 assumed the presidency, no journalists have been arrested on
 political grounds, and the sole instance of seizure of an
 opposition paper occurred in April, when state security
 authorities ordered the confiscation of an edition of
 Al-Wafd. The paper returned to newsstands the following day,
 however, as a Cairo magistrate rejected the authorities'
 contention that the story on the disappearance of evidence in
 Al-Jihad court proceedings could jeopardize efforts to recover
 the missing items.
 President Mubarak has publicly emphasized the importance of
 opposition criticism and declared his commitment to a free
 press. He has sometimes 'criticized the critics," including
 those published in the government-owned press, for failing to
 offer constructive alternatives or for neglecting Egypt's
 *national interests.*
 Three of the five Muslim and Coptic religious publications,
 whose suspension by the Sadat Government in 1981 was canceled
 by the courts in 1982, reappeared in 1984. They are the
 Muslim Brotherhood organs Al-Eitisam and Al-Mukhtar Al-Islami,
 and the Coptic weekly newspaper Watani. Still suspended are
 the Muslim Brotherhood's Al-Dawa and the Coptic Al-Kiraza
 Al-Murqassia. The latter is expected to reappear soon.
 Al-Dawa may not return at all due to the recent death of its
 publisher. In light of the 1982 court order restoring their
 right to publish, it is not clear why reappearance of the
 three was delayed until 1984, and why the other two remained
 suspended. However, the emergency law authorizes preventive
 censorship of all publications prior to their distribution at-
 the Government's discretion. It also authorizes confiscation
 of publications and closure of publishing houses. A number of
 Muslim religious journals were not subject to the 1981 ban and
 have continued publishing unhindered.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in both Arabic and
 other languages is readily available. On a few occasions in
 1984, the authorities appear to have temporarily banned
 certain foreign publications, including the Saudi-owned daily
 Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat and the London-based newsmagazine
 Al-Majallah, also Saudi-owned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can place limitations
 on the constitutionally guaranteed right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Interior Ministry to hold a
 public meeting. Despite its emergency authority to restrict
 gatherings of government opponents, the Government has allowed
 
 
 1209
 EGYPT
 opposition parties to hold numerous gatherings. With a few
 exceptions, the opposition parties and their candidates were
 free to stage rallies and public meetings as part of their
 campaign efforts for the Peoples Assembly election in May. In
 one widely publicized incident, New Wafd leaders alleged that
 security forces and National Democratic Party supporters
 disrupted a preelectoral mass rally by the New Wafd in
 Alexandria. The Interior Ministry contended that security
 officers intervened to preserve order when attendees began to
 fight among themselves. On another occasion, the authorities
 reportedly refused permission to opposition parties for a
 rally in Cairo to commemorate the anniversary of the U.N.
 Declaration of Human Rights. According to an Al-Wafd report
 in October, the Interior Minister instructed security
 officials to permit the holding of mass open-air rallies by
 opposition parties. In the past, the authorities had often
 required that these be held indoors, prompting complaints that
 this limited attendance.
 About 20 to 25 percent of the work force is unionized. Every
 50 workers in a given activity can form a committee which
 operates as a local union. These locals are affiliated with
 national unions. Workers at firms employing fewer than 50
 persons can join a national union directly.
 The principal function of the trade unions is to defend the
 rights of the membership in dealing with management on such
 issues as wages, worker welfare, and working conditions.
 Labor defines its interests on these issues and pursues them
 with few restrictions. Unions are entirely self-financed and
 spend their funds as they wish. The labor code provides for a
 system of arbitration to resolve wage and working condition
 issues, but omits any reference to the right to strike.
 Although discouraged by government and trade union leaders
 alike, strikes sometimes occur. In 1984, there were a few
 reports by opposition papers and other unofficial sources of
 scattered strikes in the construction, utilities, steel, and
 military production sectors. These incidents were apparently
 of a few days' duration at most and centered mainly on issues
 of wages, benefits, and working conditions peculiar to the
 factories and plants involved. In most cases, the strikes
 reportedly ended with management's pledge to act on workers'
 grievances, while in a few instances the authorities
 intervened quickly to restore the factories to normal
 operation.
 Union leaders are elected at almost every level, but
 controversy exists over the legitimacy of these quadrennial
 elections. Following union elections held in November 1983,
 the opposition press alleged that balloting was rigged in
 favor of candidates backed by the National Democratic Party.
 Though these allegations appear exaggerated, improprieties may
 have occurred.
 The controversy over the new social insurance law approved in
 April illustrates the readiness of the unions to challenge the
 Government on matters of critical importance to their
 rank-and-file. In response to the labor movement's opposition
 to the increases in workers' pension and severance pay
 contributions, the Government twice postponed implementation
 of the new provisions to permit government and union
 negotiators to reach a compromise. After the Government
 reduced the amount of the original hikes in worker
 contributions, the new social insurance plan was implemented
 
 
 1210
 EGYPT
 September 30. There are reports of discontent by some workers
 over the increased social insurance withholding, and this
 apparently was a factor in the violence at the textile center
 of Kafr Al-Dawwar in September.
 Professional associations have been subject to government
 intimidation in the past, but have experienced increasing
 autonomy under Mubarak. The Bar Association has won two key
 court battles which remove vestiges of government controls,
 dating back to the Sadat era, over its affairs. In 1983, the
 Higher Constitutional Court ruled unconstitutional Sadat's
 dissolution in 1981 of the Association's duly elected
 Executive Council and its replacement by a government-
 appointed council. In April, the courts struck down a law
 mandating a new system of elections for the Association's
 council and, in so doing, reinstated the council members
 ousted by Sadat. This court decision also paved the way for
 new council elections under the pre-1981 procedures favored by
 Association members.
 The April elections for the executive council of Egypt's
 medical syndicate reportedly were honest and free of
 government interference. According to postelection reports,
 candidates backed by the Muslim Brotherhood in alliance with
 smaller Muslim religious groups won 11 of the 12 council seats
 at stake.
 The Egyptian General Trade Union Federation adheres to
 principles of neutrality and non-membership in international
 workers' organizations, except for the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity, the Arab Labor Organization, and the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions. The latter
 suspended Egypt's membership in 1978, in reaction to the Camp
 David Accords, and the Arab Labor Organization did likewise in
 1979; the suspensions are still in effect. Formal ties are
 also discouraged between the Federation's constituent unions
 and international trade union organizations, but in fact some
 unions have established such affiliations. The Federation has
 signed at least one international cooperation agreement--with
 the AFL-CIO. There appear to be no restrictions on the
 international affiliations of professional associations, which
 have established numerous ties with organizations abroad.
 In 1984 the International Labor Organization (ILO) requested
 the Government to change provisions of its legislation which
 have the effect of limiting the right to strike, which provide
 for only one national trade union organization, and which
 prohibit several categories of senior workers from joining
 trade union committees. The changes would bring Egyptian law
 into conformity with ILO conventions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 guarantees freedom of religious expression. The Constitution
 also guarantees all persons equality before the law regardless
 of religion. Egypt has a substantial tradition of religious
 toleration, and persecution or discrimination on religious
 grounds is not sanctioned by the Government. Islam and Coptic
 Christianity are the two major religions. Most Egyptian Jews
 emigrated many years ago and those few who remain appear to
 practice their faith without restriction or harassment from
 any source. Various Protestant sects operate, though they
 have a small following confined largely to the expatriate
 community. All organized religions may maintain links with
 
 
 1211
 EGYPT
 coreligionists in other countries. Proselytizing of Egyptians
 is prohibited. Conversion from Islam, while officially not
 restricted or penalized, is discouraged in practice by the
 Government and seems to occur rarely. Proposals that would
 implement legal sanctions for conversion have been rejected on
 various occasion.
 All faiths can, in principle, establish places of worship, run
 schools, and train numbers of clergy adequate to serve
 believers. Under a law dating back to the Ottoman era,
 non-Muslims must obtain numerous official permits, not
 required of Muslims, to build churches. Obtaining
 authorization can take years. Although there is no evidence
 that the Government uses the permit process to deny religious
 minorities the right to build churches adequate for their
 congregations, the effect of the law is to place official
 controls and limits on church construction. These permits are
 not required for the restoration and repair of existing
 churches.
 Coptic Christians are the most significant indigenous
 religious minority and constitute about eight percent of the
 population. Copts work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. As a general rule, they participate fully in the
 life of the country. Copts by and large seem to enjoy equal
 access with Muslims to public employment, although there may
 be instances of discrimination against Christian applicants
 for government positions. Copts are sparsely represented at
 the uppermost levels of government: 2 of 33 ministers are
 Copts. In September, Al-Ahrar reported a court decision in
 favor of a Coptic official in the Interior Ministry who had
 filed suit alleging unfair denial of promotion to
 Undersecretary. The court ordered his immediate promotion to
 the position and nullified the original selection of another
 person. In the Peoples Assembly, 9 of 458 deputies are
 Copts. In October, President Mubarak appointed 2 Copts to the
 NDP's 14-member Politburo.
 Though many Copts face prejudice and individual acts of
 discrimination from Muslims, there is no evidence that these
 acts are officially inspired or sanctioned. There are
 indications of anti-Copt discrimination in university
 admissions to some fields of medical study, but university
 officials have denied allegations that general admission
 procedures were revised in the fall to discriminate against
 Copts. Copts and other non-Muslims are not permitted to
 enroll in Cairo's Muslim religious-oriented Al-Azhar
 University, and the Government has denied a request to
 establish a Coptic university.
 Some Copts have expressed concern that the resurgence of Islam
 may undermine minority rights, eventually reducing non-Muslims
 to the status of "second-class citizens.* They cite the
 introduction several years ago of a bill which would replace
 the existing legal code with the Islamic Shari'a, and the
 election in May of Muslim Brotherhood members to the Peoples
 Assembly. These fears derive in part from the Islamic
 extremist-initiated violence of 1980-81 and also reflect
 concern about heightened religious feeling throughout the
 Islamic world.
 Mubarak, while giving recognition to the nation's Islamic
 heritage, has emphasized publicly the full equality of Copts
 and other religious minorities with Muslims. The Government
 
 
 1212
 EGYPT
 has made clear that Egypt, its Islamic character
 notwithstanding, remains a secular state governed by a civil
 law based on the Napoleonic code. Courts have upheld the
 supremacy of Islamic law only with respect to those few areas
 (inheritance and family matters) to which it is applied in the
 Muslim community. They have left untouched the
 constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of Copts and other
 minorities.
 The Government has sought with success to defuse sectarian
 tension, which reached a peak in the period preceding Sadat's
 assassination. Reports of persecution and physical attacks on
 Copts by Islamic extremists have diminished sharply. In
 April, the national press reported the arrest in Fayyoum
 Governorate of 11 suspected Muslim extremists on charges of
 committing acts of arson against a Coptic bookstore and
 several automobiles owned by Copts. The Government continues
 to take substantial measures, such as posting security forces
 near Coptic churches, to protect the Coptic minority from
 violence at the hands of Islamic militants. In a May 1984
 article, Pope Shenouda praised Mubarak for his crackdown on
 Muslim extremist groups and claimed that Muslim-Copt relations
 had improved since the sectarian violence of 1981. This view,
 which the Pope has repeated in statements to the press since
 his release, appears to be widely shared in Coptic circles.
 Religious extremism has been dealt with severely, whether
 Islamic or Christian, and religious personalities of both
 faiths accused of fomenting sectarian strife were detained in
 1981. All of these individuals have now been released, but
 some, including scores of Islamic prayer leaders and 26 Coptic
 bishops and priests, are still barred from resuming their
 former positions. Western observers have reported that most
 Coptic clergy not allowed to return to their home districts
 are able to function from nearby churches. There are
 occasional press reports of the apprehension of suspected
 Muslim extremists. In April the daily papers reported the
 arrest of 53 members of the banned Muslim extremist group
 Al-Takfir Wal Higra (Atonement and Holy Flight). Al-Wafd
 accused the Government in September of launching a campaign of
 arrests directed against persons associated with unnamed
 Muslim religious groups.
 Political activity along religious lines is forbidden, and
 various Coptic and Islamic societies are legally proscribed.
 One partial exception is the Muslim Brotherhood--technically
 banned--whose activities appear to be tolerated so long as
 they do not threaten state security or foster sectarian
 tensions. In campaigning for the Peoples Assembly elections
 in May, the Muslim Brotherhood declared its alignment with the
 New Wafd Party, and eight of the group's adherents were
 elected on the Party's slate. In a postelection statement,
 the Interior Minister expressed the view that the elected
 Muslim Brotherhood deputies should be considered members of
 the New Wafd, as the Muslim Brotherhood itself is not a
 legally recognized group.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship by
 religious figures or others to criticize the State. In June,
 the opposition paper Ash-Shaab reported that 35 Muslim
 religious leaders had filed a court suit challenging the
 constitutionality of this restriction. While the Government
 maintains that sermons by Islamic and Coptic religious figures
 
 
 1213
 EGYPT
 are not censored, various reports have appeared in the
 opposition press about Muslim prayer leaders being detained
 and questioned about their allegedly inflammatory,
 anti-government sermons.
 Pope Shenouda III, whose recognition as Coptic Orthodox Church
 Patriarch was revoked by the Government in 1981, remained in
 government-enforced seclusion at a Wadi Natrun monastery for
 over three years until his release under Mubarak's decree on
 January 1, 1985. There did not appear to be any conditions or
 restrictions attached to his return to public life and full
 papal responsibilities. During his incarceration, attorneys
 brought suit on Pope Shenouda's behalf, challenging the
 legality of Sadat's 1981 decree which withdrew recognition of
 the Pope with respect to his official functions vis-a-vis the
 state. In 1983, the Administrative Court of the Council of
 State sustained Sadat's action. In addition, the court
 divested the Pope of his ecclesiastical powers, while, on the
 other hand, also canceling Sadat's appointment of a papal
 committee which had performed many of the Pope's functions
 during his enforced seclusion. This decision was under appeal
 at the time of his release.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Egypt is guaranteed except for
 travel in well defined military districts and--for foreigners
 only--in certain other areas. Except for limitations
 affecting males who have not completed compulsory military
 service, freedom of travel and emigration is guaranteed.
 However, a married woman must have her husband's permission to
 obtain her initial passport. Citizens who leave the country
 have the right to return. Some who left for political reasons
 have returned since Mubarak assumed office. There are no
 known cases of citizenship being revoked for political
 reasons. Egypt has a liberal policy on political asylum, and
 the extradition of political refugees is prohibited by law.
 Under the current state of emergency, the Prime Minister has
 authority to restrict foreign or domestic travel. The
 opposition press has reported that the Government has used its
 emergency powers on occasion to prevent or hinder suspected
 Islamic militants from traveling abroad. According to other
 opposition press stories, however, the courts on various
 occasions have nullified Interior Ministry decrees forbidding
 the travel of some Muslim religious figures.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Egypt's political system is characterized by a strong
 President. He heads the National Democratic Party (NDP),
 which wields a substantial majority in the Peoples Assembly.
 As a result, power is relatively concentrated. Yet opposition
 parties are assuming a growing role in Egypt's political
 life. Opposition parties organize, publish their views, and,
 in some cases, represent their followers in the Peoples
 Assembly and on the local level. Mubarak has maintained the
 dialogue with opposition party leaders he began upon assuming
 office. He also appointed, for the first time ever, two
 opposition deputies to Egypt's five-member parliamentary
 delegation that attended the opening of the U.N. General
 Assembly.
 
 
 1214
 EGYPT
 In addition to the NDP, there are five legally constituted
 opposition parties: the Socialist Labor Party, the Socialist
 Liberal Party, the National Progressive Unionist Grouping
 (NPUG), the New Wafd Party, and the Umma Party. There are
 indications that as many as five new parties may be formed in
 the near future. The law, in addition to prohibiting
 political parties based on religion, also forbids the
 formation of parties along class lines.
 The largest and most influential of the opposition parties is
 the New Wafd, a revival of the Old Wafd, Egypt's major
 political party before the 1952 revolution. It was reborn in
 1977, but suspended itself in 1978 when several leaders were
 banned by government action. When the New Wafd tried to
 resume activity in 1983, the Parties' Committee ruled that the
 party had no legal existence, a ruling the New Wafd challenged
 in court. In October 1983, the Administrative Court of the
 Council of State issued a decision recognizing the legitimacy
 of the New Wafd Party, suspending the Parties' Committee
 finding.
 With the elections in May, the Peoples Assembly was expanded
 from 392 members to 458, of whom 10 are appointed by the
 President. Thirty-one of the elected seats are reserved for
 women. President Mubarak's NDP controls the Peoples Assembly
 with 395 seats, the New Wafd Party has 58, and others (all
 appointed) 5, giving the opposition greater representation
 than in the previous Assembly. Although a government defeat
 on a key issue is unlikely, the assembly is not a rubber
 stamp. Both NDP and opposition deputies can and do strongly
 criticize the Government. With increasing frequency, Assembly
 members call for parliamentary investigations into government
 actions or policies, requiring testimony of government
 officials. In voting, there is some crossing of party lines.
 In debates of proposed legislation, opposition members
 criticize government policies, present alternative ideas, and
 challenge government-sponsored legislation.
 An electoral commission drawn from the judiciary is designed
 to insure that voting is conducted fairly and legally. It
 supervises parliamentary elections and is present in each
 district on voting day. Election voting can be invalidated if
 ballot-stuffing or other irregularities are found. Each party
 in the election may have observers at the polling places.
 Police are present to keep order. Losing candidates are
 entitled to challenge election results and seek redress in the
 courts. In a recent case, the courts ruled that an opposition
 candidate had been defrauded of victory in the 1979 Assembly
 elections and ordered payment of compensation.
 In the Peoples Assembly elections in May, 43 percent of
 Egypt's approximately 12 million voters cast ballots. The
 elections were conducted under the July 1983 electoral law.
 The previous system of single-member constituencies was
 superseded by a party list system in which parties submitted
 lists of candidates for each of the 48 electoral districts.
 The parties fielded over 2,000 candidates. With few
 exceptions, resulting from an insufficient number of
 candidates in a given area, the opposition parties ran
 candidates in all districts. In each district Assembly seats
 were awarded in proportion to the number of votes for each
 party's list, subject to the requirement that a party receive
 at least eight percent of the total vote nationwide. With the
 
 
 1215
 EGYPT
 stipulation that all candidates must run on party lists, the
 new law spelled the-end of independent candidates, of whom
 there had been 900 in the 1979 elections.
 In the vocal and hard-fought election campaign, the
 opposition, like the NDP, was free to publicize party
 platforms, meet with voters, place campaign banners in public
 places, and distribute campaign literature. The opposition
 complained, however, about inadequate television and radio
 time to address the voters. These complaints have some
 foundation, as each political party was limited to two
 20-minute television slots during the campaign. While the
 opposition newspapers published their respective party
 positions in detail and criticized the performance of the NDP,
 the daily press devoted relatively little space to the
 opposition or their platforms.
 The May elections are widely regarded as the freest and most
 competitive since the 1952 revolution. Electoral commission
 officials and party representatives, including those of the
 opposition, were present at polling sites. In postelection
 statements, the Interior Minister acknowledged that
 irregularities had occurred at 88 out of the more than 23,000
 polling sites and said the Government would act to rectify
 abuses. The opposition charged the NDP and, to a lesser
 extent, security officials with committing widespread
 improprieties, including ballot-stuffing and voter
 intimidation. Reportedly, a number of losing opposition
 candidates have filed court cases challenging the election
 results. The indications are, however, that the improprieties
 were random, isolated events and that there was no systematic,
 government-supported effort to rig the elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Egypt has signed the Organization of African Unity's African
 Human Rights Charter and has reaffirmed its commitment to the
 U.N. Human Rights Declaration and respect for related
 international conventions. The Government is responsive to
 queries from Amnesty International and other international
 groups about human rights concerns, including requests for
 visits. Within the Government, primary responsibility for
 international human rights matters rests with the Foreign
 Ministry's Legal Office and Office of International
 Organization Affairs.
 Human rights groups exist in Cairo and in other large urban
 areas. Their activities are related mainly to the welfare of
 prisoners and to women's rights, although at least one
 organization is trying to mobilize public support on certain
 political issues. Thus far, the Government apparently has not
 interfered with their activities.
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the detention of political prisoners, curbs on
 defendants' right of appeal in state security courts,
 allegations of torture and mistreatment of prisoners, and Pope
 Shenouda's confinement, since ended. Freedom House calls
 Egypt "partly free.'
 
 
 1216
 EGYPT
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Egypt's population is about 47 million and its per capita
 gross national product was $686 in 1982. The Government has
 given priority to economic growth and economic liberalization
 and has continued the policy of trying to safeguard living
 standards in the face of worldwide inflationary pressures.
 The primary vehicle for this policy has been a massive subsidy
 system costing about $2 billion annually, 11 percent of total
 budgetary expenditures for fiscal year 1984-85. Most of this
 amount goes to subsidize bread, rice, tea, edible oil, butane
 gas, meat, and corn. As one result of this policy, caloric
 intake for the average Egyptian exceeds minimal nutritional
 requirements. The subsidy program assures ample supplies of
 basic necessities at fixed and affordable prices for consumers
 with limited incomes. Aware of the strain on the budget and
 the distortions this system introduces into supply-and-demand
 relationships, the Government is trying to reform the subsidy
 program through such measures as raising bread prices,
 stiffening eligibility requirements for subsidized items, and
 raising some energy tariffs.
 With Egypt's population growing at an annual rate of 2.6
 percent, the shortage of housing is one of its most acute
 problems. The five-year development plan, currently in its
 third year, includes an ambitious program for the construction
 of public housing for the less well-off.
 Education and health services are free and available to the
 majority of Egyptians. Infant mortality is about 67 per 1,000
 and life expectancy is 58 years. According to the most recent
 figures (1976), about 44 percent of adults are literate; the
 primary school enrollment ratio in 1980 was 86 percent of male
 youth, but only 61 percent of school-age females. University
 education is free to anyone who passes the secondary school
 completion exam. Assignment to faculties or schools is based
 on score rather than a prospective student's own choice
 (except for those with top scores).
 Public sector and government employment policies aim at
 providing jobs for everyone, although population growth has
 made this increasingly difficult. The private sector is a
 growing source of employment opportunities. Egypt enforces
 strict laws limiting the size of landholdings in an attempt to
 guarantee equitable income and production opportunities in
 rural areas. The limit in *settled lands' (the Delta and Nile
 Valley) is 100 feddans (one feddan equals 1.04 acres) per
 family. Larger holdings are permitted and encouraged in *new
 lands,' the desert areas being brought under cultivation
 through irrigation. Despite these policies, an expanding
 population living on a limited natural resource base has
 contributed to keeping per capita income below $700 per year.
 By law, and in many respects in practice, equality of the
 sexes is the norm. Women vote, work outside the home, and can
 serve in the military. Women are represented in medicine,
 law, and education, and serve in the Peoples Assembly and the
 Cabinet. They are generally free to travel both internally
 and abroad, though a married woman must have her husband's
 permission to obtain her initial passport. A husband may
 subsequently rescind his permission and request that his
 wife's passport be canceled, though cases of this are rare.
 
 
 1217
 EGYPT
 Under Islamic law, female heirs are entitled to one-half the
 inheritance amount that male heirs can receive. In rural
 areas and within more traditional communities, prevailing
 cultural values make it more difficult for women to pursue
 careers outside the home. In such households, by custom and
 by tradition, women occupy a subordinate role. Other
 appearances of discriminatory treatment between the sexes
 derive from ingrained cultural patterns which persist, despite
 government efforts to foster change.
 Reinforcing the legal basis for equality of the sexes is the
 Family Law of 1979. It codifies the right of women to seek
 divorce, enhances child custody rights for divorced women, and
 stipulates that, in case of divorce, the woman is entitled to
 retain the family residence, provided the couple's children
 remain with her. In the courts, this law takes precedence
 over the legal codes of Islam and the Christian sects
 practiced in Egypt. The courts have rejected arguments by
 some Muslims that the law is unconstitutional because it is
 inconsistent with Islamic law.
