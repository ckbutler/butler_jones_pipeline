 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic with an elected head of state (President), Par-
 liament, and head of Government (Prime Minister), and with an independent judici-
 ary.
 The security apparatus is effectively controlled by elected officials and supervised
 by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy, primarily and extensively market based.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 The Government is taking serious steps to address the problem of violence against
 women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an-independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court,
 and the lower courts. The President appoints Supreme Court justices, who in turn
 appoint the lower court judges.
 The law provides for the right to fairpublic trial and the judiciary vigorously en-
 forces this right. Local courts may conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or en-
 danger the security of the State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold
 from the public any or all information pertaining to charges, verdicts, and sentences.
 The law provides for sanctions against violators of such restrictions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference -With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.

 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice. Nontraditional religious groups freely profess
 and propagate their beliefs. Such groups are eligible for some tax relief (e.g., they
 may receive tax-free donations), provided they are registered with the Government
 as religious communities. Eighty-seven percent of the population belongs to two
 state churches, the Lutheran and the Orthodox Churches. All citizens belonging to
 one of these state churches pay, as part of their income tax, a church tax. These
 church taxes are used to defray the costs of running the state churches. Those who
 do not want to pay the tax must notify the tax office. Such groups as Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses and the Mormon Church have been active in Finland for decades. In Decem-
 ber the Ministry of Education turned down the application of the Finnish Associa-
 tion of Scientologists to be registered as a religious community. This was the first
 time in Finnish history that an applicant had been denied church status. The
 Scientologists' application had been pending for nearly 3 years while the Govern-
 ment awaited additional information that it had requested from the Association.
 The Association acknowledged that it had not followed up on the Government's re-
 quest. The Education Ministry's decision can be appealed to the Supreme Adminis-
 trative Court. The Scientologists have not yet done so but have indicated that they
 may begin the process anew and reapply for recogition as a church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Approved refu-
 gees and asylum seekers are processed directly for residence. The issue of the provi-
 sion of first asylum has never arisen. There were no reports of forced expulsion of
 those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 In 1997 973 persons applied for asylum, up from 711 in 1996. During 1997 the
 Directorate of Immigration processed 559 asylum applications, awarding asylum to
 4 persons and residence permits to 277 persons.
 In 1997, the Government issued guidelines aimed at creating a more coherent im-
 migration and refugee policy rather than dealing with immigration and asylum mat-
 ters on a case-by-case basis.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment                                                              .
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their Gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women are fairly well represented in Government. There are 69 women in the
 200-member Parliament, and 6 in the 18-member Cabinet. The Ministers of Foreign
 Affairs and Defense are female, as is the Speaker of Parliament. In April, the fe-
 male Governor of the Bank of Finland moved to the European Central Bank as a
 member of the Board of Directors. In 1995 Parliament passed quota legislation for
 all state committees, commissions, and appointed municipal bodies, requiring a min-
 imum of 40 percent membership from each sex.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, lan-
 guage, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Women.-The law provides for stringent penalties for violence against women;
 thisprovision is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shel-
 ter Homes as well as the municipalities maintain such homes for female, male,
 adult, and child victims of violence in homes all over the country. The total number
 of shelters is around 55. Many of the people served by the shelters are women with
 small children fleeing from abusive husbands. Increasing numbers of elderly per-
 sons--the parents of abusive (usually male) offspring-have sought safety in the
 shelters. Generally the conditions that cause both young and old to avail themselves
 of the shelters are alcohol-related. Studies show that the opening of a shelter in an
 area brings cases of family violence out into the open. The concept of family violence
 in Finland includes negligence in care, psychological violence, and economic abuse.
 The annual number of calls to the police relating to domestic violence is not cen-
 
 
 1250
 trally compiled but is estimated at some 10,000 to 12,000. Shelter officials state that
 the figure is less than half of the number of actual incidents. -Most of the persons
 seeking shelter are women between 25 and 35 years of age, either married or in
 a common-law relationship. Nearly one-third are immigrants. The Union of Shelter
 Homes has introduced a special program to alert those persons from other cultures
 to the possibilities of gettinghelp from the authorities in a society where they lack
 a natural support network. Police statistics from January to June show virtually no
 rise in domestic assault figures over corresponding figures from the previous year
 (statistics not broken down by sex). There were 130 cases of rape reported to police
 as of the second quarter in 1998. Government experts report no significant change
 in the incidence, of rape in recent years but note that as many as half of all rape
 cases may go unreported.
 A study published in the summer of 1998 indicated that the typical victim of fam-
 ily violence is a young woman between 18 and 24 years of age who is married or
 is living in a common-law relationship. The study concluded that every fifth married
 woman or woman involved in a common-law relationship has suffered from violent
 behavior at the hands of her partner. The study also concludes that as many as 40
 percent of all women over the age of 15 have experienced some form of, family vio-
 ence. (The study considerspsychological and verbal abuse as "violence.")
 The Government-established Council for Equality coordinates and sponsors legis-
 lation to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, or retirees.
 In 1985 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights law that mandates equal
 treatment for women in the workplace, including equal pay for "comparable" jobs.
 In practice comparable worth has not been implemented because of the difficulty of
 establishing criteria, but the Government, employers, unions, and others continue
 to work on implementation plans. Women's average earnings are 81 percent of those
 of men, and women still tend to be segregated in lower paying occupations. While
 women have individually attalned leadership positions in the private and public sec-
 tors, there are disproportionately fewer women in top management jobs. Industry
 and finance, the labor movement, and some Government ministries remain male
 dominated. Some 60 percent of Finnish physicians are women. Women are per-
 mitted to serve in the military. The Government's Equality Ombudsman monitors
 compliance with regulations against sexual discrimination. Of the 92 complaints
 processed by the Ombudsman between January 1 and June 30, 15 cases were estab-
 lished as violations of the law.
 In February 1997 the Government approved a special program to promote wom-
 en's equality during the period 1997-99. This program consists of 30 projects. In ad-
 dition the Government seeks to integrate women's viewpoints into all of its activities
 at the United Nations and the Council of Europe. One of the purposes of this ap-
 proach is to identify the sex of human rights victims in United Nations reports.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, and the national consensus
 supporting children's rights is enshrined in law.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law has required since the 1970's that
 new public buildings be accessible to people with physical disabilities, many older
 buildings remain inaccessible" to them. There is no such law for public transpor-
 tation, but each municipality subsidizes measures to improve accessibility to vehi-
 cles. Local governments maintain a free transport service that guarantees 18 free
 trips per month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided interpre-
 tation services ranging from 120 to 240 hours annually. The Government provides
 subsidized public housing to the severely disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Sami (Lapps), who constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent
 of the population, benefit from legal provisions protecting minority rights and cus-
 toms. Sami language and culture are supported financially by the Government. The
 Sami receive subsidies to enable them to continue their traditional lifestyle, which
 revolves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and civil rights and are
 able to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cultural interests.
 In February the President issued instructions on implementing an EU directive
 on the use of minority and regional languages. The directive's purpose is to ensure
 that the use of minority languages is permitted in school, the media, dealings with
 administrative and judicial authorities, economic and commercial life, and cultural
 activities. The Sami language belongs to the category of a minority language used
 regionally.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-In recent years, concern has arisen about in-
 creasing expressions of racist and xenophobic behavior. One of the ways the Govern-
 ment is trying to combat this problem is through an in-depth, ongoing study of atti-
 tudes toward different ethnic groups. The government study examines discrimina-
 
 
 1251
 
 tion in working life, looks into popular attitudes toward foreigners, and charts the
 attitudes of those authorities involved in immigration affairs-the police, teachers,
 social workers, border guards, and employment office personnel. The reports making
 up the study are due to be published in early 1999.
 There are two government-sponsored legislative initiatives before Parliament
 aimed at improving the situation of non-Finns. The first is a law promoting the inte-
 gration of immigrants into Finnish society; it is expected to go into effect in January
 1999. The second is an ongoing revision of Finland's Aliens' Code; it is also expected
 to go into effect in January 1999. In addition to these legislative initiatives, the Gov-
 ernment in February 1997 issued policy guidelines for promoting tolerance and com-
 bating racism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the rights of trade
 unions to organize, to assemble peacefully, and to strike, and the Government re-
 spects these provisions. About 87 percent of the work force is organized. All unions
 are independent of the Government and political parties. The law grants public sec-
 tor employees the right to strike, with some exceptions for provision of essential
 services. In the first quarter of the year there were 18 strikes, 17 of which were
 wildcat strikes.
 Trade unions freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are usually
 based on income policy agreements between employee and employer central organi-
 zations and the Government. The law protects workers against antiunion discrimi-
 nation. Complaint resolution is governed by collective bargaining agreements as
 well as labor law, both of which are adequately enforced.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is honored in practice. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children and adults, and such practices do not exist. The
 Government enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.). Youths under 16
 years of age cannot work more than 6 hours a day or at night, and education is
 compulsory for children from 7 to 16 years of age. The Labor Ministry enforces child
 labor regulations. There are virtually no complaints of exploitation of children in the
 work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage, but the
 law requires all employers-including nonunionized ones-to meet the minimum
 wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in the respective industrial sec-
 tor. These minimum wages generally afford a decent standard of living for workers
 and their families.
 The legal workweek consists of 5 days not exceeding 40 hours. Employees working
 in shifts or during the weekend are entitled to a 24-hour rest period during the
 week. The law is effectively enforced as a minimum, and many workers enjoy even
 stronger benefits through effectively enforced collective bargaining agreements.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Labor
 Ministry effectively enforces them. Workers can refuse dangerous work situations
 without risk of penalty.
