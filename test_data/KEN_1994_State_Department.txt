 KENYA
 After 9 years as a single-party state led by the Kenya Africa National Union
 (KANU), a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multiparty democracy. How-
 ever, President Daniel Arap Moi and his KANU party continued to dominate the
 political process. In addition to his role as President, Moi also heads the military,
 university, civil service, and provincial district, and local governance systems.
 KANU controls a majority of the National Assembly's 200 seats.
 The large internal security apparatus includes the police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), the paramilitary General Services Unit (GSU), and the Direc-
 torate of Security and Intelligence (DSI). The CID and DSI investigate criminal ac-
 tivity and also monitor persons the State considers subversive. The internal security
 apparatus committed abuses against suspected criminals (including street children)
 and continued to harass opposition politicians and critics of the Government. City
 council security officers, known as "Askaris," also committed abuses against licensed
 vendors.
 The economy includes a well-developed private sector in trade and light manufac-
 turing as well as a strong agricultural sector that provides food for local consump-
 
 
 tion and substantial exports of coffee, tea and other commodities. Tourism re-
 mained the top foreign exchange earner. The 1993 economic reform program has
 slowed inflation and expanded trade, while price controls have been eliminated, and
 the official exchange rate has aligned with the free market rate. Future challenges
 to the country's continued improvement are privatization of state-owned enterprises
 and civil service reform. Although the population growth rate declined from 3.7 per-
 cent to 2.9 percent between 1989 and 1993, unemployment remains high at about
 22 percent.
 The Government took some steps to improve its human rights practices in 1994.
 Nevertheless, serious human rights problems persisted. In June the Attorney Gen-
 eral withdrew most charges against opposition leaders facing trials. However, the
 Government continued to intimidate and harass those opposed to government/
 KANU policies and regularly interfered with many civil liberties-notably freedoms
 of speech, press assembly, and association-in attempts to silence critics. Security
 forces contiued to arrest and detain temporarily opposition parliamentarians and
 journalists, harassed voters in several by-elections, broke up lawful public gather-
 ings, and flouted international labor covenants by quashing attempts by doctors and
 university professors to form unions. During the year, the Police Commissioner ac-
 knowledged problems of police brutality and domestic violence, both of which re-
 mained serious problems.
 Ethnic violence in the Rift Valley decreased considerably over the past year, fol-
 lowing the Government's establishment of security zones. Nevertheless, questions
 remain about the Government's and KANU's roles in fomenting the violence. After
 initially cooperating with international relief organizations to resettle displaced vic-
 tims of the ethnic violence, late in the year the Government forcibly relocated ap-
 proximately 2,000 Maela camp residents, calling into question the Governments
 commitment to work cooperatively to resettle the displaced.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government security forces. However, in a case with political undertones,
 approximately 45 unidentified assailants raided the home of o pposition par-
 liamentarian Peter Anyang Nyong'o on March 4 and murdered yongo's uncle.
 Nyong'o issued a press statement implicating the Government in the raid and was
 subsequently temporarily detained by police. At year's end, five suspects arrested
 in connection with the attack were in custody awaiting a trial date. Six persons
 were killed in postelection violence, although there is no evidence that either the
 Government or the opposition parties were responsible (see Section 3).
 Substantial evidence dating from 1991 indicates that high-level government offi-
 cials were complicit in instigating and promoting the ethnic clashes, which had as
 of year's end claimed over 1,000 lives and displaced 250,000 people (see Section
 On July 29, the High Court acquitted Jonah Anguka, the former Rift Valley pro-
 vincial commissioner, who had been accused of killing Foreign Minister Robert Ouko
 in 1990. Although presidential confidant Nicholas Biwott had been named as a prin-
 cipal suspect, the Attorney General claimed that there was insufficient evidence to
 try him. (The other principal suspect, Hezekiah Oyugi, died of natural causes in
 1992.) The Attorney General also ruled out attempts by opposition politicians to in-
 vestigate the murder privately, asserting that only he was constitutionally empow-
 ered to initiate such proceedings.
 Kenyan police used excessive lethal force on several occasions in attempts to ap-
 prehend criminal suspects. In a widely publicized case in August, a police reservist
 reportedly shot and killed a homeless child for attempting to steal a car mirror.
 After several protests and calls for an inquiry into the incident, the authorities
 charged the reservist with murder but had not brought him to trial by year's end.
 Police reservists have also been implicated in the deaths of five other street chil-
 dren. While most prison deaths stemmed from disease and lack of medical care,
 there was at least one death as a result of police brutality. Charles Ireri Njeru, ar-
 rested March 29 in Karaba on suspicion of theft, died the following day m police
 custody. The postmortem report indicated that he had died from multiple injuries
 caused by a blunt object. The authorities arrested two Karaba constables, charged
 them with Njeru's murder, and issued a warrant of arrest for a third constable who
 remained at large.
 In late December, the Government had still not made an accounting for the death
 of Jackson Mutonye Ndegwa, who was arrested November 2, 1993, afer an alleged
 raid on the Ndeiya chiefs camp, an arsenal near Nairobi. The police reported he
 
 
 116
 died the following morning of injuries sustained during the arrest, although there
 were credible reports that the police had interrogatedhim the previous night. At
 year's end, the investigation was ongoing.
 The Government still has not taken any steps to punish those responsible for the
 September 1993 beating death of the nephew of Central Organization of Trade
 Unions' Secretary General Joseph Mugalla.
 Mob violence remained a serious problem in 1994, although there are no statistics
 available on the number of deaths. The Government condemned the practice but has
 taken no action to address the problem, as it treats such incidents as individual
 cases of murder.
 b. Disappearance.-The only alleged disappearance concerned an Islamic Party of
 Kenya (II) activist, Mohammed Wekesa, who was arrested in August with two
 other persons in connection with disturbances in Mombasa. Although Wekesa was
 supposedly released, he has not been seen since his arrest.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite constitutional provisions and the Police Commissioner's June announcement
 that torture was prohibited and would not be tolerated, there continued to be credi-
 ble reports that the police and security forces resorted to torture and brutality. Se-
 curity forces also used severe methods to break up both licensed and unlicensed
 public assemblies.
 In particular, police targeted for abuse those connected with Koigi Wa Wamwere,
 the former parliamentarian on trial for his alleged raid on the Bahati police station
 in Nakuru in November 1993. In July Nakuru police arrested Wamwere's cousin,
 Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, on theft charges and beat him unconscious with rifle butts,
 batons, and kicks. Relatives who glimpsed Kariuki during his subsequent 10-day in-
 communicado confinement reported that he had swollen lips, a swollen left eye, and
 a deep wound on the right side of his forehead. Police arrested two other associates
 of Wamwere, Michael Kungu and John Kinyanjui, on the same night as Kariuki and
 likewise battered them. According to the Kenya Human Rights Commission, Kungu
 urinated blood for 2 days as a result of his beating. At year's end, no action had
 been taken to punish the officers responsible for the beatings.
 The Government had also taken no disciplinary measures against policemen re-
 sponsible for the abuse of those arrested in connection with )og, Va Wamwere's
 aleged police station raid. (Eleven of the original 15 suspcts have been cleared of
 all charges.) The injuries sustained by the sus ats included open and infected
 wounds sweliing and bruising at the knee and ae joints, and bleeding from
 under the toenails. On November 20, 1993, plice arrested the physician who exam-
 ined the suspects, searched his office, and detained him for 3 days. In respose to
 diplomatic inquiries, the Government expressed dissatisfaction with the poice offi-
 cers' explanation of the matter and prmised an investigation, but by late-December
 had provided no information about the results, if any.
 Similar diplomatic inquiries were made in the case of six suspects whom police
 tortured following an alieged raid on the Ndeiya chief's camp in September 1993.
 One of the 'Ndeiya Six," David Njenga Ngugi, reportedly had his genitals pricked
 with a pin and a toenail removed with pliers. On June 10, Nairbi senior principal
 magistrate Onesmus Githingi acquitted the six suspects and directed the Commis-
 sioner of Police, Shadrack Iruki, to take action against the police officers who tor-
 tured them. However, at year's end no officers had been disciplined. Moreover, in
 what appears to have been a punitive measure, magistrate Githingi was transferred
 in September from Nairbi to a small rural court in Kituyi.
 Police continued to disporse public assemblies brutally. According to the Kenyan
 Human Rights Commission, wile breaking up a University of Nairobi gathering on
 February 2, police forced one student to jump from a window by throwing a gas can-
 ister into his room. In February police injured several students while attempting to
 disband student meetings in support of the professors' strike. The authoritis took
 no action to punish offending police officers.
 There were also reliable reports of police violence against women. When the
 League of Women Voters attempted to hold a seminar on June 18 in Kirinyaga, ap-
 proximately 100 armed police chased participants from the venue by beating them
 with clubs. In January about 200 women accused police of harassment and rape
 when officers conducted a housese-u semsearch for bandits in Wgir. In a gender
 violence workshop hosted by the Federation of Women Lawyers (F gA) in Septem-
 ber Police Commissioner Kiruki pledged to work with women's groups like FIDA
 and to implement guidelines for the treatment of women by police. However, at
 year's end, the police had not yet taken any specific action to implement any such
 guidelines.
 Conditions in prisons are life-threatenng, due inpart to lack of resources and in
 part to the Government's unwillingness to address deficiencies in the penal system.
 
 
 Both male and female prisoners are subjected to sexual abuse, severe overcrowding,
 a poor diet, inadequate health care substandard bedding materials, and flooded or
 unheated cells. There were several iundred deaths in prison in 1994, most of which
 stemmed from disease. Kenyan prisons do not have resident doctors, and only one
 prison had a doctor permanently assigned to it. Kenya's 78 prisons hold approxi-
 mately 51,000 prisoners, 12,000 of whom are awaiting trial. Rape is a serious prob-
 lem for both men and the more than 3,000 women in prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that most per-
 sons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reasonably
 practicable,* which would be within 24 hours of the arrest or from the start of de-
 tention. However, this statute does not apply to those detained under the Preserva-
 tion of Public Security Act (PPSA).
 The Constitution was amended in 1988 to allow the police to hold persons sus-
 pected of capital offenses for 14 days before charging them in court. Capital offenses
 include such crimes as murder and treason. A 1993 amendment to the Penal Code
 excludes weekends and holidays from this 14-day period, potentially a significant in-
 crease in the time prisoners can be held without charge. In practice, suspects are
 sometimes held incommunicado for 2 to 3 weeks before being brought before a court.
 Persons arrested and charged are usually allowed access to their family and attor-
 ney promptly. However, only family members and attorneys may visit detainees at
 the discretion of the State. For those who have been charged, it is often possible
 to be released on bail with a bond or guarantees of return. In cases where the de-
 fendant fails to appear in court, the judiciary may issue a warrant for his arrest.
 A relic of the colonial period, the Chiefs Authority Act empowers local officials,
 called "chiefs," to arrest individuals and to restrict a person s movement without
 trial. (The Chief's Act was not formally invoked in 1994 to detain anyone, but chiefs
 occasionally cite the Act to take suspected criminals to the police. Under the Act,
 chiefs are technically not supposed to detain anyone for more than 12 hours.)
 The PPSA, on the other -hand, allows the State to detain a person indefinitely
 without charges or trial upon a determination that it is necessary for the "preserva-
 tion of public security." This includes "prevention and suppression of rebellion, mu-
 tiny, violence, intimidation, disorder and crime, unlawful attempts and conspiracies
 to overthrow the Government or the Constitution," and several other grounds. No
 persons were detained under the PPSA in 1994.
 In July 1993, the Attorney General created 11 task forces to review various sec-
 tions of the Constitution. In July 1994, the Task Force on the Reform of Penal Laws
 and Procedures formally proposed that statutes relating to criminal investigation,
 arrest, detention, questioning, charge and bail be reexamined. The Task Force is
 expected to subnt its final report by December 1995.
 Although the Government held no political detainees at year's end, the police con-
 tinued to detain arbitrarily politicians, human rights advocates, journalists, and oth-
 ers who were critical of the Government. In most instances the police held the de-
 tainees for several hours and then released them without formally charging them.
 In August police detained the Vice Chairman of the FORD-Kenya (FORD-K) oppo-
 sition party, James Orengo, for 7 hours at the Kisumu police station after he made
 public statements implicating Nicholas Biwott in the 1990 murder of Foreign Min-
 ister Ouko. In June police also detained opposition parliamentarians Martha Karua
 and Allan Njeru and Presbyterian Bishop David Gitari for 2 hours after disrupting
 the FIDA seminar they were attending in Kirinyaga (see Section 1.c.). In Septeinber
 police held Kenyan Human Rights Commission executive director Maina Kiai, oppo-
 sition parliamentarian John Wanyange, and 10 others for 6 hours without charge
 at the Naivasha police station for attempting to demonstrate against the denial of
 national identification cards to young Rift Valley Kikuyus.
 Government security forces continued to arrest and harass opposition Members of
 Parliament (M.P.'s), most often charging them with some variation of subversion or
 holding an unlicensed meeting. The authorities arrested and formally charged a
 total of 15 opposition M.P.'s in 1994, as opposed to 36 in 1993. Police arrested
 FORD-K M.P.'s Mukhisa Kituyi and Musikari Kombo in April after they brought
 relief supplies to a Rift Valley displaced persons camp. The Government character-
 ized the trip as an unlicensed meeting in which they "uttered words calculated to
 incite the public against the President. In April police arrested opposition MP. Jo-
 seph Mulusya while he was socializing with friends and charged him with partici-
 pating in an unlawful meeting. In June the Attorney General rescinded charges of
 sedition and subversion against 13 of the arrested M.P.'s. However, in doing so he
 warned M.P.'s against slandering the President in their public remarks. Two MP.'s,
 Stephen Ndichu and Kamuiru Gitau, still had cases outstanding at year's end.
 The police also arrested more than 400 residents of Nakuru during periodic arbi-
 trary sweeps. On February 18, police arrested more than 200 young men and
 
 
 women at a bus park in the city. They faced charges of walking in a suspicious man-
 ner, hawking, shouting to attract passeners, entering into a volatile area, and hav-
 ing no national identity cards. Then in    Nakuru    lice arrested approximately
 200 street salesmen in the city center. A police source later said that theft had been
 increasing and that the arrests were intended to rid the town of suspects.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control, but in Decem-
 ber the Government effectively expatriated Sheik Khalid Balala, a former leader of
 the Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK), when Kenyan Embassy officials in Bonn rejected
 Balala's application for a passport extension. In 1994 the Government also deported
 a number of foreigners for questionable reasons. In June it deported Dr. Dorothee
 Von Brentano, the Friedrich Naumann Foundation development ageny representa-
 tive, after she authorized funding for a political opposition party.in July the Gov-
 ernment deported Australian training editor John Lawrence after he edited a com-
 pilation of critical social commentary that ran in the Nation newspaper.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The court system consists of a Court of Appeals,
 a High Court, and two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal and civil
 cases originate. Judges hear all cases; there is no jury system. Customary law is
 used as a guide in civil matters affecting persons of the same ethnic group as long
 as it does not conflict with statutory law. In 1989 High Court Justice Norbury
 Dugdale ruled that the courts have no power to enforce the "Bill of Rights," which
 is part of the Constitution. In spite of legal challenges that the ruling effectively
 subsumes the judiciary under the executive branch, his decision has not been over-
 ruled.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts, and trials are public, although some testi-
 mony may be held in secret, There is a presumption of innocence, and defendants
 have the right to attend their trial, to confront witnesses, and to present witnesses
 and evidence.
 Defendants do not have a right to government-provided legal counsel, except in
 capital cases. For noncapital charges free legal aid is usually not available outside
 of-Nairobi. (Poor people who do not have an attorney are usually found guilty for
 lack of an articulate defense.) Although defendants generally have access to an at-
 torney in advance of trial, defense lawyers do not always have access to govern-
 ment-held evidence, since the Government can plead the state security secrets
 clause as a basis for withholding evidence. Military personnel are tried by courts-
 martial, and verdicts may be appealed. Attorneys for military personnel are ap-
 pointed on a case by case basis by the Chief Justice.
 Civilians generally have a right to appeal a verdict to the Kenyan High Court and
 ultimately to the Court of Appeal. However, these rights were effectively denied in
 a case involving Bedan Mbugua and David Makali, the editor and reporter of The
 People newspaper, and attorney G.B.M. Kariuki (see Section 2.a.). In May the three
 were arraigned on contempt charges after the two journalists published a story
 quoting Kariuki's criticism of a decision delivered by the Court of Appeal. Under
 Kenyan law, a person must be tried by the same court in which he is in contempt.
 While Kariuki agreed to pay a substantial fine, Mbugua and Makali refused and
 were consequently given prison sentences of several months.
 The judiciary is not independent. The President has extensive powers over ap-
 pointments. He apoints the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, Court of Appeal
 judges, and, with theadvice of the Judicial Service Commission, High Court judges.
 He also has authority to dismiss judges and the Attorney Gneral upon the rec-
 ommendation of a special presidentially appointed tribunal. In 1994 the Office of the
 President declined to renew the contracts of three High Court judges who had pre-
 viously made rulings against the Government.
 In September the government-aligned Judicial Service Commission transferred
 senior principal magistrate Onesmus Githingi out of Nairobi following his acquittal
 of the suspects in the "Ndeiya Six case. Githingi had ruled that the police used tor-
 ture to coerce the confessions of the suspects, who were accused of raiding the
 Ndeiya chiefs camp outside Nairobi in September 1993.
 The political trial of Koigi Wa Wamwere began in Nakuru on April 12 and was
 continuing at year's end. A former M.P. from Nakuru, Wamwere has spent the bet-
 ter part of the past 9 years in police detention. He has been targeted by the Govern-
 ment because of his popularity among Rift Valley Kikuyus, who are considered polit-
 ical rivals of President Moi's Kalenjin tribe. The state prosecutor in the trial fin-
 ished presenting his case in September without producing credible evidence tying
 Wamwere to the alleged attack on the Bahati police station in November 1993. In
 November defense attorneys began to present evidence that Wamwere was in
 Nairobi on the night of the alleged raid and that police tampered with evidence sup-
 posedly confiscated from the crime scene. Leading human nghts groups have named
 Koig Wa Wamwere and his codefendants in the "Bahati Police Station" case as
 
 
 119
 probable political prisoners. The trial continues amid news that Wamwere was diag-
 nosed in December with bleeding ulcers which may be connected to the harsh condi-
 tions of his confinement. (The trial of Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki and two other associ-
 ates of Wamwere had not commenced by year's end.)
 There was one instance in which a case was moved to a magistrate who consist-
 ently ruled in favor of the Government. In late December, the authorities arrested
 several members of a Kikuyu religious organization in Laikipia District for tribal
 oathing and later charged tem in the Nakuru District Court. Contrary to previous
 years, there were no instances in which the Government prevented its critics from
 filing cases to obtain legal redress from harassment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to promote the
 public benefit," such as in security cases. Although security officials generally obtain
 judicially issued search warrants, at times they conduct searches without warrants
 to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize property believed to be stolen. The
 courts have admitted evidence obtained without search warrants to support convic-
 tions.
 Security forces employ various means of surveillance, including electronic surveil-
 lance and a network of informers. Police routinely monitored the activities of politi-
 cal opponents and their associates. In a June letter to the Director of State intel-
 ligence, FORD-K M.P. Paul Muite complained that several specific vehicles with ci-
 vilian license plates constantly shadowed his movements and that of his family.
 Muite, who is also the lead defense attorney in the Wamwere case, reported that
 the cars even followed him from Nairobi to the Nakuru courtroom and back again-
 a 4-hour trip.
 The Government monitored and intercepted correspondence as well. In August the
 US.-based Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights mailed two pack-
 ages to the Kenya Human Rights Commission. The local Nairobi post office refused
 to release the packages, claiming that the reports were "political" and "hitting at
 the Government." In April police detained and interrogated an 18-year-old stu ent
 for several hours after police intercepted a letter she had sent to opposition MI'.
 Paul Muite.
 City council security officers, or "Askaris," continued to destroy the kiosks of li-
 censed and unlicensed vendors in several Kenyan cities. On February 9 and 15,
 Nairobi Askaris demolished and burned a stretch of vendors' booths at the
 Machakos country bus terminal, destroying several thousand dollars' worth of prop-
 erty. On February 16, Askaris beat and arrested the chairman of the Vendors' Asso-
 ciation when he visited the Machakos bus terminal. Askaris also arrested and con-
 fiscated goods from vendors at the Kisumu town center in February.
 Although Kenyans are theoretically free to choose their political affiliation, gov-
 ernment employees continued to be warned to support the ruling party or be fired.
 In May the Government dismissed a permanent secretary in the Ministry of Labor
 after he reportedly made contact with an opposition party member.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Ethnic clashes that began in 1991 have killed over 1,000 civilians and dis-
 placed 250,000 persons. Violent clashes involving several ethnic groups continued
 throughout the year, albeit less frequently than in 1993. International attention has
 focused on the Kikuyus whom the Maasai forcibly evicted from Enoosupukia in
 Narok district of the Rift Valley and were living in displaced persons camps in
 Maela. Victims of the violence are largely from ethnic groups opposed to the ruling
 party, particularly the Kikuyu, who comprise 21 percent of the population. For ex-
 ample, in the first half of the year, there were violent attacks by Maasai directed
 at Kikuyus in which villagers were murdered, houses burned, and property con-
 fiscated. At year's end, tensions remained high in Molo and sites of other clashes
 because government efforts to promote reconciliation had not been fully successful.
 Serious questions remain about the Government's complicity in instigating the vi-
 olence, and on several occasions in 1994 KANU and Government officials made
 statements targeting particular ethnic groups that led to renewed violence. Clashes
 occurred in March in Burnt Forest between Kalenjins and Kikuyus, in June in
 Mombasa between coastal groups and Luos, and in Turkana between non-Turkana
 and Turkana. All of these followed inciteful statements made by government or
 KANU officials. The Government took no action to disavow or punish those officials
 or others who incited violence. Reports by several organizations, including a special
 parliamentary committee, the Catholic Bishops of Kenya, the National Council of
 Churches of Kenya (NCCK), the National Elections Monitoring Group, the Kenya
 Human Rights Commission, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center, and Human
 Rights Watch/Africa placed primary blame for the violence on the Government. Crit-
 ics charge that the Government initially supported tribal clashes to strengthen its
 
 
 120
 hold on power and to prove its assertion that multiparty politics will not work in
 Kenya.
 In 1993 the Government announced measures to control the ethnic violence by es-
 tablishing "security zones" in areas hardest hit around Molo, Londiani Elgburgon,
 and Burnt Forest. These measures were successful in curtailing the violence. Regu-
 lations introduced in the security zones severely restrict entry and movement and
 grant security forces search and seizure rights within the zones. However, they also
 authorize security forces to shoot to kill in cases in which there was suspicion that
 a crime had occurred, such as illegal entry into the security zones. The regulations
 also absolve government forces from responsibility for death and destruction in the
 zones by specifically prohibiting suits for compensation. Despite these restrictions,
 there were sporadic reports of violent clashes within the security zones.
 Citing the provisions of the security zone regulations, the Government sought to
 prevent opposition M.P.'s, domestic and international human rights advocates, and
 most journalists from entering the zones, and arrested many who did so. In early
 1994, the Government reluctantly allowed NGO's working under the U.N. Develop-
 ment Program (UNDP) displaced persons program and a few others, including dipo-
 matic officials, some access to the security zones. Later in the year, the local admin-
 istration also allowed media representatives to accompany important visitors and
 diplomats to the zones. The UNDP Rogge report, published in September, noted that
 the Government had made an effort to reduce tensions and to resettle those dis-
 placed. The report estimated that 30 percent of those displaced had been resettled
 to their villages, that 50 percent were in various stages of return, and that another
 20 percent remained in camps.
 In October President Moi instructed the Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner to
 resettle displaced persons resident in camps in Mala. However, local administra-
 tors proved unable or unwilling to cariy out these presidential instructions as in-
 tended. They actually resettled over 200 families (out of 3,000), who, once relocated
 to unproductive farm land, were not given resettlement assistance. On December 24,
 the Govenment dismantled the Maea camps and razed the shelters without prior
 notice and without the cooperation of UNDP. It forcibly resettled hundreds of refu-
 gees to areas outside Maela who were left to fend for themselves. The Government
 ad restricted UNDP and NGO's from entering Maela and participating in the re-
 settlement process. At year's end, the status of the displaced remained uncertain.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and the press and outlaws discrimination on the grounds of political opinion.
 Nonetheless, there are restrictions on the exercise of free speech. Freedom of speech
 is often breached by security forces and undercut by broad interpretations of anti-
 quated sedition and libel laws. In his May 31 pledge to reconsider subversion and
 incitement cases, the Attorney General cautioned that words or actions critical of
 the President or that could alarm the public or disturb the peace were illegal. The
 Government has used these provisos as a basis for denying opposition parties the
 right to free speech. Similarly, it arrested several opposition leaders on the charge
 that their critical commentary about the Government was inciteful. Despite these
 forms of government obstruction, the political opposition and human rights groups
 continued to present their views to the public.
 Radio is the medium through which most Kenyans get their news. The Govern-
 ment controls the single radio station and its affiliate television station, the Kenyan
 Broadcasting Corporation, which produces both television and radio news. They
 typically avoid stories critical of the Government, give a large share of news time
 to government or ruling party functions, and neglect to give anything approaching
 equal coverage to opposition activities. The ruling party owns a second television
 station, the Kenya Television Network, and a government supporter owns a new
 cable television station. The Information Minister announced in late December that
 the Government would not license any new radio and television stations in the near
 future, even if the Attorney Generals Task Force on the Press which is expected
 to submit its final report by mid-1995, recommended radio liberalization.
 The print media include three daily newspapers that provide extensive coverage
 of national politics. Two dailies, the Nation and the Standard, cover political issues
 and print articles critical of government policies, though at least one former editor
 has charged that the papers are under pressure to self-censor. The third daily news-
 paper, the Kenya Times, more often reflects the views of the ruling party. Weekly
 newspapers and magazines, many of which take a more strident tone in their citi-
 cism of the Government, also have substantial audiences.
 The printed press remained vibrant and independent and government harass-
 ment of the press decreased noticeably after midyear. However, in attempts to si-
 
 
 121
 lence its critics, the Government arrested 18 journalists in 1994 and fined or incar-
 cerated them for violating antiquated libel and sedition laws. In the year's most no-
 table case, the Court of Appeal in June found Bedan Mbuua, the editor in chief
 of the weekly newspaper, the People; David Makali, a People reporter, the publish-
 ing company; and human rights attorney G.B.M. Kariuki guilty of contempt of court.
 The contempt charges arose from an article in The People that quoted Kariuki's crit-
 icism of the same Court of Appears decision in a case involving the Universities
 Academic Staff Union (see Section 6.a.). The Court fined Kariuki approximately
 $10,000, fined Bedan and Mbugua each rughi twice that amount, and required
 them to pubish apologies. When Mbugua and Makali refused to apologize, the Com-
 missioner of Prisons elected to send them to a maximum security prison for 5 and
 4 months, respectively. The authorities released Mbugua afer serving 3 months and
 20 days, and freed Makali after 3 monh.
 The Government continued its ban on a number of books, including a Kiswabili
 play based on George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and a number of works by emigre
 Kenyan author Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. On January 13, a truckload of armed policemen
 raided Colorprint Limited, a N-arbi publisher, and impounded 15,000 copies of
 "Kenya: Return to Reason," a book by the chairman of the FORD-Asili (FORD-A)
 o position party, Kenneth Matiba. The following day, the Government announced
 that the book was a "prohibited publication." Tn Novembr the authorities arrested
 a Nairobi businessman on a sedition cha  for  ssessing a booklet entitled "Patri-
 otic Voices." At year's end, the Attorney Gneralh ad not given his consent to begin
 prosecution.
 In August the Government withdrew sedition charges against four journalists
 from the Standard newspaper. It had accused the four of publishing a seditious
 story in March about ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley security zone of folo-a story
 that was later proven untrue.
 In 1994 the Government streamlined procedures for accreditin representatives of
 the international media, who by and large operated unfettered in Kenya.
 In previous years, the Government pressured university students and faculty to
 support the ruling par, but since the professors' strike closed down institutions of
 hi her learning for the better part of the year, the degree of academic freedom was
 dicult to gauge. The authorities fired 26 professors because of their participation
 in the walkout, and in March the Court of Appeal upheld the firings, effectively de-
 nying the professors tenure. Police posted on university campuses monitored student
 and faculty activities. On several occasions, police peaceably dispersed gatherings of
 rofessors on university grounds but used force to disrupt student assemblies (see
 ction 1.d.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is pro-
 vided for in the Constitution, but is seriously limited by the Public Order Act, which
 gives the authorities power to control public gatherings. The Act prohibits unli-
 censed meetings of 10 or more persons without approval from the district commis-
 sioner. In theory the law does not apply to persons meeting for "social, cultural,
 charitable, recreational, religious, professional, commercial, or industrial purposes."
 In practice, meetings under almost all categories fall under the jurisdiction of the
 Public Order Act.
 Throughout 1994, but particularly in the early part of the year, the Government
 restricted the right of peaceful assembly by refusing to register meetings. Between
 January and May, it refused the FORD-K opposition party permits for public rallies
 six times and also disallowed gatherings planned by nonpolitical organizations. In
 March the district commissioner refused the NCCK a permit for a seminar regard-
 ing start-up business loans for community development projects.
 The Government also frequently broke up both licensed and unlicensed meetings.
 On March 27, administrative police fired into the air and used tear gas to disperse
 people gathered for a free eye clinic, just as opposition M.P. George Nyanja began
 to address the crowd. The parliamentarian had, obtained a permit for the gathering,
 but an officer on the scene announced that the provincial administration had with-
 drawn the permit, rendering the assembly unlawful.
 Armed police dispersed 400 people attending a seminar hosted by the FORD-A
 party at the Limuru conference and training center on April 23. Police entered the
 conference center's dining hall while the participants were at breakfast and ordered
 them to leave the premises immediately. When arguments ensued between the po-
 lice and the FORD-A leaders, the police used tear gas to scatter the crowd.
 The authorities were no less forceful in preventing opposition leaders from pub-
 licly meeting their constituents. On April 4, antiriot police stopped seven FORD-K
 parliamentarians from addressing a large crowd in Homa Bay, forcing them to leave
 the town at gunpoint. When James Orengo, the party's first vice chairman, then at-
 tempted to walk back through the town, he was blocked by police and forced into
 
 
 122
 his car. Later in the day, police again dispersed crowds in the Rangwe and Ndhiwa
 townships before the seven parliamentarians had an opportunity to address them.
 In late May, several government officials, including the Minister for Education
 and the Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner, announced that the Government
 would be more forthcoming on permits for public assemblies. The Government ac-
 cordingly licensed a united opposition public meeting held in Nairobi in early June.
 Individual opposition parties also conducted campaign rallies prior to the June 27
 parliamentary by-elections without government interference.
 The Societies Act governs freedom of association; it states that every association
 must be registered or exempted from registration by the Registrar of Societies. Ten
 political parties are currently registered under this statute: KANU, FORD-K
 ORD.A, the Democratic Party, the Social Democratic Party the Kenya National
 Democratic Alliance, the Kenya National Congress, Labor Party Democracy, the
 Kenya Social Congress, and the Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya. The
 Government has refused to register the Islamic Party of Kenya (IPK), even though
 the Societies Act nowhere prohibits religion-based parties. The Attorney General
 has argued that registering sectarian parties would contradict the spirit of the Act,
 which proscribes organizations "incompatible with  'ace welfare, or good order in
 Kenya." A secretive organization known as the M-au Mau Posterity Party, which
 claims responsibility for anti-Asian propaganda in Kenya's urban centers, has not
 attempted registration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Kenya has no state religion, and the Constitution ac-
 knowledges freedom of worship. The Government generally does not infringe upon
 religious activities, except to require registration by new churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the  ountry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--By law, citizens may travel freely within the country. However, ethnic
 clashes and the establishment of security zones restricted the ability of many
 Kenyans to travel, particularly to those parts of the Rift Valley most affected by the
 violence.
 The Government does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens and, in con-
 trast to previous years, did not prevent travel abroad by its critics in 1994. The Gov-
 ernment does not regard provision of passports to its citizens as a right and reserves
 the authority to issue or deny passports at its discretion.
 There are 240,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia and Sudan living in camps and
 100,000 living outside the camps in cities and rural areas. Somalis account for about
 80 percent of the total refugee population. Kenya has accepted most asylum seekers
 though sometimes entry is delayed. None of these refugees has been granted legal
 permanent residence status.
 Following a series of formal warnings, in July the Government gave the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 3 days' notice to close a large
 refugee camp near a tourist area in Mombasa. Although the Government did not
 follow through with its demand, official pressure to close the camp remained strong
 at year's end. The UNHCR accepted in principle the Government's right to close the
 camp.
 According to Africa Watch and the UNHCR, there continued to be credible reports
 by UNHCR and other relief agencies of rapes of Somali refugee women in the North
 Eastern province. Unlike 1993, when most of the rapes took place inside the con-
 fines of the camps, those reported in 1994 took place outside the camps. They have
 been directed mostly at young giris herding goats or collecting firewood. Most of the
 rape incidents are believed to be committed by other refugees or bandits operating
 outside the camps. The incidence of rape decreased dramatically in 1994, from an
 average of 27 down to 9 per month, after the UNHCR increased assistance to the
 women and improved security in the camps. The Government, initially stung by al-
 legations of government security involvement and of not taking the issue seriously,
 arrested two individuals in the camp identified by the victims.
 Refugees living outside the camps are vulnerable to arrest, and those who pur-
 chase false identification documents and visas put themselves even further at risk.
 In August the police raided Somali communities in an effort to ferret out "illegal
 aliens.  There were redible reports that Somali refugees, as well as ethnically So-
 mali Kenyans, were targets for extortion and that some were arrested following
 these sweeps.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kenyan citizens have the legal right to change their government through free and
 fair elections, but their ability to do so has yet to be demonstrated fully. The presi-
 dential and parliamentary elections of 1992 were marked by violence, intimidation,
 fraud, and other irregularities, but opposition candidates nevertheless won 63 per-
 
 
 123
 cent of the vote. Diplomatic observers viewed the 10 by-elections held in 1994 as
 generally free and fair, despite minor irregularities.
 However, the Government continued tharass and intimidate the political opposi-
 tion. The President exercises sweeping powers over the local political structure as
 well as the National Assembly, and the KANU party he heas controlled 118 out
 of the 200 National Assembly seats. The President appoints both the powerful pro-
 vincial and district commissioners, as well as a multitude of district and village offi-
 cials. At the district and village level, these political appointees are responsible for
 security as well as the disbursement of federal development funds.
 At the national level, the Constitution authorizes the President to dissolve the
 legislature and prohibits Assembly debate on issues under consideration by the
 courts. This law, in conjunction with the Speaker of the Assembly's ruling that the
 subject of the President's conduct is inappropriate for parliamentary debate, has se-
 verely limited the scope of deliberation on many controversial political issues. M.P.'s
 are entitled to introduce legislation, but in practice it is the Attorney General who
 does so. As the head of KANU, the President also influences the legislative agenda.
 He also bolstered KANLs majority by acting on his constitutional authority to ap-
 point 12 M.P.'s.
 Three opposition parties--the DP, FORD-K, and FORD-A-hold the majority of
 the opposition's 82 seats. KANU used a variety of pressure tactics to entice opposi-
 tion M.P.'s to defect to KANU, and by year's end six opposition M.P.'s had done so.
 As a result, there were 10 by-elections, including 2 forced by the death of two M.P.'s.
 During the seven by-elections held in June, there were credible reports that govern-
 ment and KANU officials bribed voters, purchased voter cards, and forcibly removed
 an election observer from a polling station. There were also violent incidents at pub-
 lic rallies prior to the June elections involving both opposition and KANU support-
 ers. Street skirmishes between supporters of contending parties also broke out on
 the day of two by-elections in October. A U.S. Embassy observer witnessed an as-
 sault in front of a polling station on a FORD-A candidate, who was later hospital-
 ized. The assailant, who struck the candidate to the ground with repeated blows as
 armed police looked on, came to the polling station in a convoy of vehicles escorting
 the KANU Secretary General. Following the announcement of the October election
 results, in which two opposition candidates won parliamentary seats, fights erupted
 again resulting in the deaths of at least six people.
 Another round of by-elections were to be held in January 1995, following the High
 Court's decision in November to nullify opposition victories in two 1992 parliamen-
 tary elections. The Court overturned the results of one election because the opposi-
 tion winner had allegedly administered tribal oaths to supporters, although the deci-
 sion was based on contradictory testimony given by witch doctors.
 Merus, Kalenjins, Kisiis, Luhyas, Kambas, Taitas, Luos, Giriamas, Maasai,
 Kikuyus, Pokot, and Embus are represented in the President's Cabinet. However,
 the President is widely reputed to rely on an inner circle of advisers drawn mostly
 from his Kalenjin tribe.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in politics, the role of women in the political process nonetheless remains cir-
 cumscribed by traditional attitudes. In 1994 there were six female M.P.'s, no female
 cabinet ministers, and one female assistant minister. Within the political opposition,
 women figure most significantly in the Democratic Party, where 25 percent of the
 party's national office holders are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Kenya has several well-organized and vocal human rights organizations. Two
 groups, the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) and Release Political Pris-
 oners (RPP), are particularly active and publish regular reports that are often criti-
 cal of the Government's human rights record. The Institute for Education in Democ-
 racy continues to monitor parliamentary by-elections with generally good coopera-
 tion from the Electoral Commission. Legal organizations, such as the Public Law In-
 stitute, the Kenya Law Society, the International Commission of Jurists, and the
 International Federation of Women Lawyers, also cover human rights issues, and
 a large pool of Kenyan attorneys handle pro beno cases for defen ants and serve
 as an informal source of human rights information.
 President Moi continued to criticize the activities of both domestic and inter-
 national human rights NGO's, and the Government targeted several of them for
 harassment in 1994. After the KHRC sent a letter to President Clinton urging rev-
 ocation of Kenya's trade privileges because of the Government's refusal to register
 the University Professors Union, President Moi branded the letter as "treasonous."
 Authorities also intercepted KHRC mail (see Section 1.f.) and detained persons par-
 
 
 124
 ticipating in KHRC demonstrations. In September Nakuru police arrested 12 RPP
 members attending the trial of Koigi Wa Wamwere and held them incommunicado
 for several days. When another RPP member visited police headquarters to inquire
 about his colleagues, he too was put in incommunicado detention. The entire group
 was eventually released without charge.
 In contrast, human rights organizations have been successful in efforts to cooper-
 ate with government officials on issues like domestic violence. In September a gov-
 ernment-sponsored human rights monitoring group hosted a representative from the
 Kennedy Center for Human Rights, and the Kenyan Embassy in the United States
 issued visas to representatives of several U.S.-based human rights organizations in-
 terested in traveling to Kenya.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel~gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's "race, tribe,
 place of origin or residence or other local connection, political opinions, color, creed."
 Women.-The Constitution does not specifically address discrimination based on
 gender, and women continue to face both legal and de facto discrimination on sev-
 eral fronts. For example, women cannot legally work at night, which disadvantages
 female employees in hotels, homes, and industries in the export processing zones.
 According to Kenyan pension law, a widow loses her work pension upon remarriage,
 whereas a man does not. When men and women perform comparable jobs, men often
 receive a higher job classification and therefore better pay. Not only do women have
 difficulty moving into nontraditional, professional fields, but they also are promoted
 more slowly than men and bear the brunt of retrenchments.
 Kenya's    w of Succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal
 consideration of male and female children. In practice, most inheritance issues do
 not come before the courts. Women are often excluded from extralegal inheritance
 settlements or are given smaller shares than male claimants. In a widely publicized
 trial that focused national attention on female inheritance rights, the mother of a
 recently deceased Olympic boxing hero lost her bid to inherit her son's professional
 earnings.
 Societal discrimination is most apparent in rural areas, where women account for
 75 percent of the agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to invest
 in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at the higher levels. The num-
 ber of boys and girls in school are roughly equal at the primary and secondary lev-
 els, but men outnumber women almost two to one in higher education, and literate
 men significantly outnumber literate women.
 Violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. Police statistics re-
 leased in 1994 showed that in 1992 there were 454 cases of rape, 136 cases of at-
 tempted rape, 343 cases of indecent assault, 407 cases of defilement (e.g., child mo-
 lestation), and 14 cases of incest. These statistics are probably underreported, how-
 ever, since social mores deter women from going outside their clan or ethnic groups
 to report sexual abuse. The Government has condemned violence against women,
 ard the law carries penalties up to life imprisonment for rape. Still, the rate of pros-
 ecution remains low because of cultural inhibitions against discussing sex, the fear
 of retribution, the disinclination of police to intervene in domestic disputes, and the
 unavailability of doctors who might otherwise provide the necessary evidence for
 conviction. Furthermore, traditional culture permits a man to discipline his wife by
 physical means and is ambivalent about the seriousness of rape. Organizations con-
 cerned with women's rights charge that the Government is often apathetic and flip-
 pant about women's issues. The Attorney General remarked in Apiil that a woman
 could not claim rape against her husband under current laws.
 Children.-Economic displacement, a high population growth rate, and the ethnic
 clashes have resulted in a large number of homeless street children. Media reports
 place the number of such children nationwide in the tens of thousands, and the Gov-
 ernment estimates that their number is growing at an annual rate of 10 percent.
 According to the Attorney General's Task Force, these children are typically in-
 volved in theft, drug running, assault, trespassing, defilement, and property dam-
 age, and there have been credible reports that the police have treated these children
 ihumanely (see Section L.a.).
 The May report of the Task Force on Children recommended both programmatic
 and legal measures to safeguard the rights of children. A variet of roposed legal
 remedies are incorporated in a new law prospectively called the Childrens Act.
 However, the Attorney General had not presented the draft bill in Parliament by
 year's end.
 Despite the Government's stated opposition, female genital mutilation (FGM) re-
 mains widespread, particularly among Kenya's nomadic peoples. It is usually per-
 
 
 125
 formed at an early age and has been condemned by international health experts as
 damaging to both physical and mental health. Neither the Government nor women's
 groups have reliable information about the extent of the practice, but according to
 rugh estimates the percentage of females who have undergone this procedure may
 be as high as 50 percent. The Task Force on Children has recommended outlawing
 this practice, as it endangers the "the survival, safety, and development" of the
 child.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the 1989 government census,
 whose figures were released in May, the Kikuyu are the largest ethnic community,
 comprising 20.8 percent of the population. The Luhya, Luo, Kamba, and Kalenjin
 (an amalgamation of 9 small tr ) are the next largest, each making up over 11
 percent of the population.
 The Government continued to discriminate against Rift Valley Kikuyu. Acording
 to the Kenya Human Rights Commission, provincial authorities have denied na-
 tional identification cards to a substantial number of Kikuyu youths, even thoughi
 they and most of their parents have been brn and raised in the Rift Valley. With-
 out identification cards these youths cannot marry, attend universities, obtain em-
 ployment, or register to vote. In addition, the Minister for Local Government, Wil-
 liam Ole Ntimama, reiterated this year that Kikuyus displaced from Ensupukia by
 the ethnic clashes would not be allowed to return. In various newspaper interviews,
 Ntimama characterized the land titles held by displaced Kikuyus as illegally ac-
 quired documents.
 Asians, or Kenyans of sub-continent descent, have also been targets of official and
 societal purejetay general of tie F ORD-A oppsiton party, Martin
 Shkk, announced at a public rally in August that he would kick Asians out of
 the country if he were chosen pdresident. Anti-Asian leaflets supposedly authored bny
 a dup called the Mau Mau Posterity (see Section 2.b.), also cculated in Kenya a
 urban centers. The leaflets reflect a general sense of resentment among Kenyan Af-
 ricans toward the Asian community, which is more affluent and reluctant to assimi-
 late African culture. An Indian police reservisis alleged involvement in the shooting
 death of an African street child n August inflamed these preexisting racial tensions.
 The Government singled out ethnic Somalis as the only ethnic group in Kenya re-
 quired to carry an additional form of identification proving that they are Kenyan
 citizens. Ethnic Somalis, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, must still produce upon
 demand their Kenyan identfctifaon card and a second identification card verifying
 "screening.j Both cards are also required in order to apply for a passport. In August
 the police made sweeps through two known Somali communities inNairobi, osten-
 sibly in search of illegal aliens. They arrested many Somali Kenyans during these
 sweeps. The presence of large numbers of Somali refugees mo Kenya has exacerbated
 the problems faced by Kenyan Somalis.
 People With Disabilities.--Government policies do not discriminate against people
 with disabilities in employment, education, or other state services. There is no man-
 dated provision of accessibility or the dabled to public buildings or transportation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Save for central government civil servants, including
 medical personnel, and university academic staff, all workers are free to join unions
 of their own choosing. The law provides that  as   seven workers may establish
 a union, provided th~at objectives of the union do not contravene Kenyan law and
 that another union is not already representative of the employees in question. The
 Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of Trade Unions must give
 the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice; an appeal of the Registrar's
 final decision may be brought before the High Court.
 President Moi deregistered the Kenya Civil Servants Union in 1980; since 1989
 the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) has sought to reverse this deci-
 sion. In September 1993, 16 officials announced formation of their union and de-
 manded registration by the Government. In April the head of the Civil Service Com-
 mission announced with great fanfare the recognition of the Civil Servants Union,
 but President Moi subsequently rescinded the approval (see below).
 There are at least 33 unions in Kenya representing approximately 350,000 work-
 ers, less than 20 percent of the counts industrialized work force. Except for the
 150,000 teachers ho belong to the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT),
 which the Government has registered, all other unions are affiliated with one
 central body, the COTU. The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor
 to bth the Kenya Federation of Labeor and the Kenya African Workers Congress.
 The 1965 decree establishing COTU gives the President power to remove from office
 the central body's three senor leaders and grants nonvoting membershi on the Ex-
 ecutive Board to a representative of the Ministry of Labor as well as of 3ANU. Most
 
 
 secretaries general within COTU including those who staged an abortive "coup" on
 July 2, 1993, putting into power feaders more acceptable to the Government, agreed
 that any COTU-KANU connection was obsolete in the multiparty era.
 A High Court decision November 10, 1993, nullified the July 2 "election," but the
 coup plotters refused to vacate COTU headquarters. On January 31, however, a
 three-member panel of the Appellate Court confirmed the November 10 decision and
 threatened to jail the Registrar of Trade Unions on contempt of court charges should
 he maintain his refusal to recognize the old COTU leadership. He complied with the
 order. Two further government-sponsored but unsuccessful attempts to unseat the
 COTU leadership took place in March, and the elected leadership remained in office
 throughout 1994.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission of a written report to the Minister of Labor. The
 military, police, prison guards and members of the national youth service are pre-
 cluded by law from striking. Other civil servants, like their private sector counter-
 parts, may strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days if it is an essential
 service, e.g., water, health, education, air traffic control). During this 21-day period,
 the Minister may either mediate the dispute, nominate an arbitrator, or refer the
 matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges appointed by the President,
 for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either mediation, fact finding,
 or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. However, Section 28 of the Act gives
 the Minister of Labor broad discretionary power, based on the Minister's opinion,
 to determine the legality of any strike. The-Minister in 1994 used this power to de-
 clare several strikes illegal, although the required notice had been given. If workers
 attribute dismissals to strike or union activities, they have recourse to the Indus-
 trial Court.
 There were several strikes in 1994, including one by the Universities Academic
 Staff Union (UASU) and one by the Kenya Union of Medical Practitioners and Den-
 tists (KUNPD). The UASU strike was the longest in Kenyan history. Both groups,
 representing government university and hospital staff, struck after the Government
 had refused to register their unions. The Government arrested and dismissed the
 UASU leadership, and the authorities did not reinstate over 20 professors after sus-
 pending their strike September 28. KUMPO leaders were expelled from their gov-
 ernment-provided housing. After suspending their strike September 27, fully quali-
 fied doctors-but not necessarily interns-went back to work and received new
 housing. Although the UASU lost another court case in October, both unions contin-
 ued to press for recognition.
 Internationall  COTU is affiliated with both the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many of its
 affiliates are linked to international trade secretariats of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities. Both the Trade Disputes Act and the
 Charter authorize collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in the context of negotiations between
 unions and management. In 1994 the Government relaxed wage policy guidelines
 to permit wage increases of up to 100 percent and renegotiation of collective agree-
 ments. Collective bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial
 Court in order to guarantee adherence to these guidelines. In 1994 about 250 agree-
 ments were newly signed and registered with the Court. Some 1 million workers
 (union and nonunion) were covered by these accords.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities are generally awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of export processing zones (EPZ's) was passed
 in November, 1990. The EPZ Authority decided that local labor laws, including the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, would apply in the EPZ's. However, in
 practice, it gants many exemptions. For example, the Government waived aspects
 of the law that prevent women from working at night because women prevail in a
 number of industries in the zones (see Section 6.e.). Workers and some government
 officials criticized working conditions in the EPZ's in 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor. However, under the Chiefs' Authority Act, local offi-
 cials may require people to perform community services in an emergency. This prac-
 tice did not occur in 1994. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee
 
 
 127
 of Experts has found these and other provisions of Kenyan law to contravene ILO
 Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced labor but noted the Government's efforts
 to review the Chiefs' Authority Act.
 d. Minimum Age for Emplyment of Children.-The Employment Act of 1976
 makes the employment in industiy of children under the age of 16 illegal. This Act
 applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 percent of the labor force
 is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the terms of the Industrial
 Training At. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce the minimum age statute.
 Children often work as domestics in private homes (including those of re atives), in
 the informal sector, and in family businesses and farms (see Section 5). Given the
 h levels of adult unemployment and underemployment, the employment of chil-
 dain the formal industrial wage sector in violation of the Employment Act is not
 a significant problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The legal minimum wage for blue-collar work-
 ers in the wage sector varies by location, age and skills, with 12 separate scales.
 After a modest May wage increase and considerable appreciation of the Kenya shil-
 ling (ksh) against the dollar the lowest minimum wages were $37.80 (ksh 1,700)
 in urban areas and $21.22 (kish 955) in rural areas. Workers in some enterprises
 claimed that employers force them to work extra hours with no overtime pay. Prices
 for some basic com mdities declined in mid-1994, but because of rampant inflation
 the minimum wage was still insufficient to support a family. Most workers relied
 on second jobs, subsistence farming, or the extended family for additional support.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours, although some categories of workers have a shorter work-
 week. Nighttime employees, however, may be employed for up to 60 hours a week.
 As is the case with respect to minimum age limitations, the Act specifically excludes
 agricultural workers from its purview. An employee in the nonagricultural sector is
 entitled to 1 rest day in a week. There are also provisions for 1 month of annual
 leave and sick leave. Kenyan law provides that the total hours worked (i.e., regular
 time plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night workers may not exceed 144
 hours; the limit is 120 hours for other workers. The Ministy of Labor is tasked with
 enforcing these regulations and reports of violations are few.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; the Act
 was amended in 1990 to encompass the agriculture, service, and government sec-
 tors. The Minister of Labor is responsible for enforcement of heath and safety provi-
 sions of the Factories Act. The 65 health and safety inspctors attached to the Min-
 istry of Labor's Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety Services have the au-
 thority to inspect factories and work sites. As a result of the 1990 amendments, the
 Directorate's inspectors may now issue notices enjoining employers from practices
 or activities which involve a risk of serious personal injuries. Previously, only mag-
 istrates were vested with this authority. Such notices may be appealed to the Fac-
 tories Appeals Court, a body of four members, one of whom must be a High Court
 judge. In 1994 the Directorate's factory inspections maintained their level which
 had increased dramatically in 1993. Work-related accidents and illnesses declined
 slightly.
