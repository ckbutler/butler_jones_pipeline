 ETHIOPIA
 Ultimate power in Ethiopia, wielded by Chairman Mengistu
 Haile-Mariam and a small group of former military associates,
 continues to be exercised and maintained through intimidation
 and arbitrary arrest. The country is without civil or
 political freedoms and without institutions or laws to
 protect its citizens' human rights. The Provisional Military
 Government of Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) maintains complete
 control over the media, labor, education, internal and
 external movements of Ethiopian citizens, and all political
 processes.
 Persons expressing opposition to the regime or who are
 believed not to support it are routinely arrested by security
 police and subjected to torture in varying degrees; some
 executions have been reported as well. The individual
 citizen enjoys no legal protection and may be detained at any
 time, without explanation and be held indefinitely without
 any prospect of trial. For example, as many as 1,000 low and
 mid-level Ethiopian government officials and business or
 government-affiliated organization members were arrested in
 Addis Ababa during June, July, and August.
 The Government's control over the population is being
 strengthened through the establishment of the Workers' Party
 of Ethiopia. Formally declared on September 6, 1984, it is
 the sole legal political party and its membership is
 carefully selected. Mengistu holds the top post of
 secretary-general and the military retains strong control in
 the party, whose goal is to help transform the country into a
 Marxist-Leninist state. Marxist-Leninist ideology has
 already been imposed in the press, throughout the educational
 system, the *kebele" (urban neighborhood association)
 network, and increasingly, in the military and workplace. A
 comprehensive system of surveillance and informants has been
 set in place by the regime.
 There was continued armed conflict in 1984 between the
 Government and insurgent forces in Eritrea, Tigray, the
 Ogaden, and other regions. In addition, there are signs of
 growing rebellion among the Oromo people, Ethiopia's largest
 ethnic group. The Government has endorsed military solutions
 and has not been ready to offer significant political
 compromise to meet demands of the various regions. The
 continued fighting has perpetuated massive human rights
 violations by both the Government and insurgent forces
 against the civilian population in the war zones. Bombing
 and shelling of suspected guerrilla positions in populated
 areas by Ethiopian forces, together with frequent infighting
 between rival factions within the dissident groups, continued
 to produce civilian casualties and dislocations in the
 contested areas.
 In the economic sphere, serious drought and the effects of
 the regime's discouragement of private agriculture caused
 even more acute food shortages in 1984 than in 1983. There
 was widespread famine in much of the country's northern areas
 and in some parts of the south. Some six to seven million
 persons were seriously affected. By October, hundreds were
 dying daily of starvation in Welo region, and probably as
 many or more were perishing in neighboring Tigray.
 Nevertheless, all during the summer months as the famine
 gathered momentum, the Government of Ethiopia was
 
 
 108
 ETHIOP IA
 preoccupied with the organization of the Worker's Party and
 preparation for the 10th anniversary of the revolution, on
 which tens of millions of dollars were lavished. It did not
 adequately coordinate with donors on the increasingly serious
 food shortages until the 10th anniversary celebrations were
 past.
 In November, the Ethiopian Government embarked on a massive
 resettlement scheme, starting an initial movement of 70,000
 people, with plans to transfer a-total of 1.5 million from
 drought affected northern areas of Ethiopia to new settlements
 in the western part of the country. Besides directing much
 needed resources from the desperate famine relief effort in
 the north, this endeavor has been opposed by most Western
 donor nations on human rights grounds. There has been minimal
 preparation for arrival of new settlers in resettlement
 areas. There are reports from observers in Ethiopia that the
 resettlement has not been voluntary or that the people have
 been desperate and starving, with no real choice. There are
 charges that the Government is using resettlement for
 political purposes to disperse local opposition to the regime
 centered in the north. More than 120,000 people had
 reportedly been resettled by the end of 1984. Another 100,000
 Ethopians had fled to Sudan in 1984 to escape the drought and
 often also to escape forced resettlement.
 Ethiopia, with a population of over 40 million, continues to
 have one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world
 ($140). The vast majority of Ethiopians live with inadequate
 housing, water, sanitation, and medical facilities. The
 Government has so far been unwilling to reduce its sizable
 military spending to increase relief or development efforts.
 More than one million Ethiopians remained outside the country,
 the result of years of war, drought, poverty, civil strife,
 and oppression. Human rights prospects for the future remain
 bleak.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Widespread politically motivated-executions of dissidents,
 suspected 'feudal sympathizers," and other
 'anti-revolutionaries" that occurred following the revolution,
 and especially during the 'white terror" and 'red terror'
 period of 1977-78, ended during the 1980's in areas outside
 insurgency regions. However, from time to time during 1984
 there were reports of such summary executions. In the
 insurgency areas, political killings by both government forces
 and the various involved factions continued. Insurgency
 forces use assassination, sniping, and the mining of roadways
 as tactics against the Government and its sympathizers while
 the Government continues to execute opposition forces'
 members, bomb civilian population centers, and destroy homes
 and crops in rebel-held areas.
 b. Disappearance
 Sudden apprehension and detention of persons suspected of
 anti-regime activities or merely lack of sympathy with the
 regime continued to be practiced by the Government. As in
 previous
 
 
 109
 ETHIOPIA
 years, there were in 1984 documented cases of Ethiopians being
 abducted without charge by plain-clothes security police and
 held incommunicado for extended periods. Families are not
 notified of their relatives' arrest or, if they are,
 frequently not informed of their whereabouts. Prisoners also
 have been known to disappear from their jail cells, never to
 be seen again. Six Ethiopian employees of the United Nations
 Economic Commission for Africa, headquartered in Addis Ababa,
 were abducted several years ago by Ethiopian police and are
 yet to be accounted for; one is reported to have died in
 police custody. Amnesty International in its 1984 report
 (covering 1983) expressed concern over the regime's continued
 failure to account for some 15 political prisoners who
 disappeared in 1979.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 It is generally believed that torture is applied less
 extensively now than it was in the 1970's. However, there are
 no legal provisions safeguarding the Ethiopian population from
 torture, or cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment by
 government personnel and institutions. There were unconfirmed
 reports in early 1984 of political prisoners suffering severe
 injury, leading to their deaths, following cruel interrogation
 practices. Torture, including severe beatings, crushing of
 bones of the hand, and electric shocks, is reported to be
 practiced in cases involving insurgent combatants and those
 engaged in activities, such as statements or writings, against
 the Government.
 Amnesty International states that torture is often practiced
 on Ethiopian prisoners interrogated at the Central
 Revolutionary Investigation Department ('Third Police
 Station") in the capital and routinely is used in other parts
 of the country to interrogate prisoners about opposition
 organizations, especially those engaged in armed conflict
 against the Government.
 At an interrogation center in Nazareth where political
 prisoners are brought, torture is commonly practiced and the
 possibility is ever present that torture or ill-treatment will
 be used against the detainee or his family or friends.
 Uncertain periods of imprisonment and lack of access to family
 are other forms of cruel and unusual treatment. In many cases
 the detainee is not informed of the reason for his or her
 incarceration or the length of time he will remain imprisoned.
 Prison conditions in Ethiopia continue to be, in the great
 majority of cases, extremely poor. Cells and detention areas
 are damp, overcrowded, and unheated. Sanitation facilities
 are inadequate. Prisoners must rely upon their families to
 provide food and in some cases are denied changes of
 clothing. Family visits are limited or sometimes denied.
 Conditions in one of the main detention centers in the
 capital, where members of the royal family and other political
 prisoners are held, are said to be reasonably good.
 Occupational and academic training is available, and books and
 magazines are provided. Families and friends are allowed to
 visit with reasonable frequency. Former prisoners held at the
 
 
 110
 ETHIOPIA
 Gebi Palace prison, below Mengistu's offices, have reported
 that they were relatively well treated, though their quarters
 were crowded and damp, and brief visits by family members were
 allowed only once a year. Those held were mostly high-ranking
 officials from the former Government. There is no evidence
 that political prisoners are subjected to living conditions
 worse than those of convicted criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ethiopians suspected of anti-government actions or sentiments
 are subject to arrest or detention without charge or judicial
 review. During the months preceding the September party
 founding congress and celebration of the 10th anniversary of
 the Ethiopian revolution, possibly as many as 1,000
 Ethiopians, the majority ethnic Eritreans and Tigreans, were
 rounded up in Addis Ababa and held without charge, presumably
 due to suspected dissident group sympathies or associations.
 In many, if not most, cases, political detainees are held
 incommunicado, at least initially and sometimes during the
 entire length of their arbitrary term of incarceration. There
 are no legal provisions in these cases for the reading of
 charges to the detainee. Rights to counsel and the
 opportunity to face one's accusers are nonexistent. A writ of
 habeas corpus on the country's statutes has not been
 successfully invoked in any known case. The term of
 confinement for a suspect held without legal charge is subject
 to the whims of the incarcerators who can be from any level of
 government, from the politburo down to the local kebele.
 Prisoners have been held for a few months or up to nine years.
 Remarks considered critical or derisive of the Government,
 failure to attend mandatory political or kebele meetings,
 suspicion of association or sympathy with organizations
 opposed to the Government and, in the case of Ethiopian women,
 suspicion of sexual liaison with foreign visitors in public
 hostelries, are all reasons for arbitrary arrest and detention.
 In February, the Government announced that it had been holding
 18 persons in detention since December 1983 for "distributing
 anti-revolutionary pamphlets." The fate of the 18 is unknown.
 In politically sensitive arrests, the Government generally
 prefers to operate in secret, taking the suspect at home at
 night. However, arbitrary arrest is not limited to the
 politically suspect. It is commonplace for people with no
 record of political activity or political beliefs to be
 arrested and detained for months or longer with no explanation
 ever being given. In one case, the family of a person
 arrested in early February 1984 was told by prison officials
 some two weeks after the arrest that he had been found
 innocent--of what, if was not specified--and would be released
 soon. Despite repeated appeals by the family and assurances
 by prison officials that he was considered innocent and would
 be released "soon," he was still under detention as of
 mid-October 1984. In September, the Government announced its
 customary revolution anniversary political prisoner release.
 The names of the 96 detainees released were not announced,
 though it has been learned that the list included several
 officers of the former ruling military council (the Dergue)
 and excluded the remaining imprisoned royal family members.
 
 
 111
 ETHIOPIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no discernible separation between the executive
 branch and the judiciary. Courts are subject to political
 control, and are responsive to the requirements of Ethiopia's
 leadership.
 Ordinary criminal and civil cases are more generally based
 upon the submission of evidence in a public setting. Minor
 cases are tried at the kebele level while more serious
 criminal accusations are tried in courts where the accused has
 access to court-appointed lawyers.
 Ethiopian political prisoners generally do not receive trials,
 public or otherwise. No guarantee of a public trial with
 counsel exists, nor is the accused permitted to present
 witnesses or evidence in his or her defense. Political trials
 are almost always held in secret with only the verdict (if
 released at all) publicly announced. Prisoners cleared of
 charges or whose terms have been completed are not always
 released from prisons.
 There are conflicting reports about the current number of
 political prisoners, which is virtually impossible to
 estimate. If the total includes those taken prisoner as a
 result of ethnic insurgencies, it could well number in the
 thousands. Amnesty International believes thousands are still
 being held without trial or charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Warrants are not required for entry into or search of offices
 or private homes in Ethiopia. As a result, forced entry is a
 common method of the police and security forces, although the
 level of this activity is currently much lower than during the
 "red terror* period of 1977-78. But surveillance of
 individuals, both visual or through listening devices, has
 increased and operates with no legal strictures.
 All mail is monitored by the Government. Ethiopian citizens
 can be called out at any time for questioning by authorities,
 mandatory kebele meetings, or non-voluntary political rallies
 or marches. Refusal to show up for any of the above can be
 punishable by imprisonment without hearing. Every Ethiopian
 lives under the watchful eye of local kebele or rural
 dwellers' association officials, who monitor visitors
 received, items being brought in and out of houses, meetings
 taking place, and adherence to the midnight to 5:00 a.m.
 curfew. These local officials are empowered to arrest anyone
 whom they deem guilty of illegal or suspicious conduct.
 Ethiopian citizens are often forced to join 'mass"
 organizations, and it is reported that many who joined the
 party did so because they were forced to join.
 Foreign radio broadcasts such as the VOA and BBC are widely
 listened to in Ethiopia, and there is no evidence of overt
 efforts by the Government to interfere.
 
 
 112
 ETHIOPIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethopia. The
 Government has complete ownership and operation of all
 information media and exercises censorship through editorial
 boards and the cultural ministry. Expression of political
 opinion which is unauthorized or at variance with the official
 government line is strictly forbidden. Political, economic,
 and social policy in Ethiopia is formulated at top levels of
 government, then disseminated through the government-
 controlled media and government-organized citizens' groups,
 i.e., women's, youth, workers', and peasants associations,
 kebeles, and military commissariats. Opinion expressed
 contrary to the government line can, and often does, result in
 imprisonment without charge or sentence. Books and magazines
 can be confiscated if they are deemed counter to the
 revolution.
 The pronouncements of public officials, academics, and clergy
 are closely monitored by the Government. Surveillance of
 public opinion is implemented through official guidelines for
 thought and by a widespread system of informants within
 government offices, schools, businesses, the military, and the
 university..
 Some instructors and professors in secondary schools and at
 the university have resisted the politicization of education.
 Academic freedom, although circumscribed, especially in
 political and social sciences, still finds limited expression
 at the university. Private secondary schools, where
 Ethiopians who can afford them send their children, are mostly
 free of political orientation. Many, including people in the
 Government, seek to send their children abroad for education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly of any sort that has not been approved by the
 Government is strictly forbidden under penalty of arrest. In
 contrast, attendance at government-backed rallies, meetings,
 and parades is mandatory and enforceable by arrest and
 detention.
 Ethiopians are cautious in their associations with each other
 and with foreigners. A system of informants and surveillance
 is pervasive. Frequent association with foreigners can result
 in questioning, arrest, and detention.
 Formation of political groups outside government-organized
 bodies like the youth, women's, and peasant associations is
 illegal and is dealt with harshly. Professional associations
 such as the Rotary and Lions Clubs are allowed to operate,
 though it can be assumed that their membership and activities
 are monitored by the Government.
 Labor is not permitted to organize independently in Ethiopia.
 Labor-management negotiations are not allowed. Strikes or
 slowdowns are strictly forbidden. The only labor organization
 allowed to operate is the government-controlled All-Ethiopia
 Trade Union (AETU). The AETU is one of Ethiopia's 'mass
 organizations' and is basically a political group, utilized by
 the Government to implement its policies, expand party control
 
 
 113
 ETHIOP IA
 into the workplace, prevent work stoppages, and to keep the
 labor force in line. A number of AETU's top leadership have
 been trained in the Eastern bloc, and the organization has
 close ties with Soviet and East European labor organizations.
 The Government uses both convict and forced kebele labor.
 Prisoners used in various construction projects, such as road
 building and forestation, reportedly are criminal convicts
 such as murderers, robbers and, as widely reported in the
 press, those found guilty of corruption. Kebele dwellers,
 young and old, male and female, are obligated to "volunteer'
 their services for work programs upon the demand of kebele
 officials. Those with proof of employment or the funds to pay
 a bribe generally escape such mandatory tasks, which the poor
 and unemployed have little chance of avoiding.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With the overthrow of the Haile Selassie regime, the Ethiopian
 Orthodox (*Coptic') Church lost its favored position, along
 with its lands and most of its property. The Government
 allows the Orthodox church and the Muslim religion (each
 claims to make up about 50 percent of Ethiopia's population)
 freedom of worship and proselytism. However, the Orthodox
 church has government-appointed officials within its
 administration to ensure its conformity.
 Orthodox and Muslim holidays are recognized by the Government,
 and officials of both religions are allowed to exercise
 jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriages. There is,
 however, a continuing effort to de-emphasize the presence and
 importance of religion in Ethiopian life. References to deity
 are expunged from dialogue in television programs and movies,
 and forbidden in government statements or publications.
 Often, obligatory seminars for youth have been organized on
 Sunday mornings in conflict with religious observance. During
 the weeks preceding the traditional Orthodox pilgrimage to
 Kulubi in late 1983, the Government restricted bus
 allocations, train schedules, and gasoline rationing. When
 the unpopularity of this move among the Ethiopian public
 became apparent, the Government backed off, but the disruption
 caused a lower attendance level than in previous years. The
 Government has not interfered so openly in 1984.
 Other religions, particularly Western Protestant evangelical
 organizations, have found their activities sharply curtailed
 by the Government, through the closure of churches, the
 seizure and nationalization of property and facilities, and
 harassment and surveillance. At least one organization's
 congregation now assembles in secret 'safe areas' for worship
 and other church-related meetings. The Government does allow
 some limited missionary activity; it gives permits to foreign
 missionaries to enter and work in Ethiopia in limited
 numbers. Amnesty International's 1984 report notes that over
 30 officials of the Ethopian Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church
 had been imprisoned for their non-violent beliefs.
 There has been considerable illegal emigration by Ethiopian
 Jews (Falasha) during 1984, continuing a trend of previous
 
 
 114
 ETHIOPIA
 years. Legal emigration is greatly restricted. Access by
 foreign Jewish and Israeli visitors to Falasha villages in the
 Gondar region was shut off for most of 1984, although reopened
 to some extent in December. There had been many such visits
 in 1983. Ethiopian authorities apparently suspected that
 foreign Jewish and Israeli visitors provided Ethiopian Jews
 money and encouragement to leave the country. They may also
 hope to prevent the outside world from learning of the
 frictions that continue to mark government relations with the
 Ethiopian Jewish community, resulting from government efforts
 to prevent emigration (emigration is forbidden by law to all
 Ethiopians), lack of Hebrew instruction, and the resistance of
 Ethiopian Jews to Marxist-Leninist indoctrination. Ethiopian
 Jews are situated in areas of insurgency (Tigray, Gondar) in
 which they frequently get caught in the crossfire. However,
 stories of 'genocidal" actions by Ethiopian authorities, or of
 highly brutal behavior, appear unfounded.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In November 1984, the Government began a massive and forced
 resettlement scheme to move more than 1.5 million persons from
 the drought affected north to the western part of the
 country. The people being resettled are moved from a highland
 environment to lowlands where they are susceptible to malaria
 and other parasitic diseases unfamiliar to them. They have
 been placed in the midst of ethnically, culturally, and
 linguistically different populations who regard them as
 intruders. There are reports that many attempt to flee back
 to their home areas and that those who are unsuccessful are
 returned to resettlement areas under armed guard. Families
 being resettled are nuclear, comprised only of husband, wife
 (not over age 35-40) and children. The elderly and sick are
 left behind.
 Other restrictions on freedom of travel within Ethiopia exist
 as a result of the insurgency (several areas, mainly in the
 northern administrative zones, are closed for security
 reasons). Moreover, permission is required for Ethiopian
 citizens to change their places of residence, and persons
 considered politically suspect may be forbidden to travel
 outside their home areas.
 Travel for Ethiopians outside their country is heavily
 restricted by the Government. Issuance of a passport can be
 denied for failure to attend the mandatory Sunday morning
 political meeting or to 'volunteer" for kebele work
 activities. It is not unusual for bribes to be solicited.
 Government policy regarding the issuance of travel documents
 is subject to sudden and arbitrary change. During late 1983
 and through 1984, issuance of external travel permits to
 Ethiopians was occasionally shut off with no warning, then
 suddenly renewed within a short period of time. Military-age
 Ethiopians (between the ages of 16 and 30) have a particularly
 difficult time obtaining external travel permits and passports.
 Emigration remains strictly forbidden to Ethiopian citizens
 except in very special and limited circumstances such as
 marriage to or adoption by a foreign national.
 
 
 115
 ETHIOP IA
 Unauthorized flight from Ethiopia is regarded by the
 Government as a serious offense punishable by 5 to 25 years
 imprisonment or, reportedly in exceptional cases, death.
 There is nonetheless considerable illegal emigration,
 undertaken either under the subterfuge of travel abroad for
 business or to visit relatives, or by arduous treks overland
 and surreptitious crossing of the border.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for those Ethiopians
 living abroad (numbering more than one million) remains in
 effect. To date, more than 10,000 Ethiopians have returned
 from Djibouti, and many ethnic Somalis have returned as well,
 though estimates of their exact numbers vary from 100,000 to
 as many as 320,000. Small numbers have also returned from
 Sudan.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ethiopian citizens have no legal right or means to change
 their Government or to affect decisions. All power to decide
 policy in Ethiopia resides in the upper echelons of
 Government, led by Chairman Mengistu and a small group of
 former military officers. Political thought, economic policy,
 and public opinion are dictated to the population. The
 Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia
 invariably claims to be speaking on behalf of the whole
 Ethiopian people. The new Workers' Party of Ethiopia purports
 to offer Ethiopian citizens a means of participation in
 government, but its role is still unclear, and candidates for
 party positions are carefully screened and serve to
 rubber-stamp government decisions and help propagate the
 Marxist-Leninist system. The various other "mass
 organizations' are also government controlled and directed.
 Kebeles and peasants' associations, which are the primary
 government control mechanism at the local level, control
 people's movements, housing allocation, basic food rationing,
 political indoctrination, and implement other government
 policies, such as registering youths for national military
 service.
 The highest echelons of the Government are no longer dominated
 by the Amhara ethnic group but includes many Oromos, and some
 Eritreans and Tigreans. Almost all senior government and
 political figures are of Christian origin although the
 population is 50 percent Muslim. Women are very poorly
 represented at the top echelons of government. Only one woman
 holds a senior position at the level of Vice-Minister.
 There have been no concrete developments on the autonomy
 question for Ethiopia's various ethnic groups, and the
 insurgencies in the predominantly Eritrean, Tigrean, and Oromo
 areas of Ethiopia continue.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no government or private body to investigate alleged
 human rights violations, although various organizations are
 permitted to make statements on human rights in South Africa.
 
 
 116
 ETHIOP IA
 The Government opposes any attempt by international and
 non-governmental organizations to investigate such
 allegations. Representatives of the International Committee
 of the Red Cross in Addis Ababa are not allowed to visit
 political prisoners, only prisoner of war internment centers.
 Freedom House rates Ethiopia 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ethiopia's first census indicates that its diverse population
 is 40-42 million (contrasting with a 1984 World Bank previous
 estimate of 32 million). This would put Ethiopia's per capita
 income (estimated by World Bank in 1982 at about $141) among
 the lowest in the world and well below the poverty line. Of
 the more than 40 different groups, the Amhara, Tigreans, and
 Oromo make up more than three-fourths of the population.
 Approximately 85 percent of the population is rural and the
 majority of this population resides over half a day's walk
 from an all-weather road. According to a May 1984 World Bank
 report, during the decade ending 1982/83, Ethiopia's GDP grew
 at an average rate of 2.2 percent annually against an annual
 population growth rate of more than 2.5 percent. The rate of
 under- and unemployment in Ethiopia's cities and villages is
 reportedly around 50 percent.
 Ethiopia's development problems are considerable and growing
 in scope. The chronic drought problem is worsening. Famine
 has reached crisis proportions in several areas of the
 country, and the number of Ethiopians affected by food
 shortages, including in the capital, reportedly ranges from
 six to seven million. Indications are that famine has already
 reached a scale equal to or beyond that of the 1973-74 famine
 which resulted in approximately 200,000 deaths and contributed
 to the downfall of Haile Selassie.
 Agricultural production has suffered not only from the
 drought, but also importantly from ideological constraints.
 State farms and collectivization schemes have been given high
 priority but have consistently shown poor results. Price and
 distribution controls on agricultural products act as a
 disincentive to increased food production. In early September
 1984, kebele officials seized "hoarded' supplies of teff from
 private shop owners to make up for shortages of
 government-issued grain rations.
 Industrial production, in the face of overcentralization of
 the economy, is stagnating, with growth impeded by spare parts
 shortages (due to chronic foreign exchange problems),
 managerial inefficiency, shortages of capital investment, and
 government ownership of almost all industrial facilities.
 Huge military expenditures take upwards of 40 percent of
 Ethiopia's national budget. The Government's pursuit of a
 military solution to the continuing insurgencies in the
 northern regions of the country makes it likely that military
 expenditure will remain at this very high level. Ethiopia's
 standing army is the largest in Africa south of the Sahara.
 Despite serious drought and famine in many areas of the
 country, the Ethiopian Government in 1984 spent large sums on
 building construction, extra security, and general
 refurbishing of Addis Ababa in preparation for the September
 
 
 117
 ETHIOPIA
 Workers' Party of Ethiopia Founding Congress and the
 celebration of the 10th anniversary of the revolution.
 Estimates of these expenditures ranged upwards of $20 million.
 The Government has attempted to increase medical services to
 the peasantry and urban poor, but the magnitude of the
 country's infrastructural and financial problems have made
 this effort inadequate to the total need. There is no
 evidence that last year's statistics of 1 doctor per 75,000
 persons and I nurse per 5,320 persons have changed
 significantly. Infectious disease is rampant, including
 leprosy, tuberculosis, and trachoma. Only six percent of the
 population had access to safe water in 1976. Lines at water
 pumps are common in the poorer areas of Addis Ababa, and open
 ditches are commonly used as sewers. The infant mortality
 rate is high (172 out of every 1,000 births).
 The Government has expanded access to educational facilities
 for the rural and urban poor (the primary school enrollment
 ratio reportedly increased from 19 to 46 percent between 1973
 and 1981). As a result, the literacy rate has risen from
 approximately 6 per cent before the revolution to the
 currently claimed level of 54 per cent. The World Bank cited
 a 15 per cent literacy rate in the late 1970s. Recent figures
 (government statistical abstract for 1981) showed 1,386,648
 males and 744,068 females in grades 1-6, and 135,708 males and
 25,013 females in grades 7-8. University enrollment has been
 expanded considerably and now stands at about 12,000 day
 students and over 8,000 extension students. Ethnic Oromo
 students have been given opportunities for advanced studies
 that were largely unavailable under the previous regime. A
 quota system allows students from the outlying regions
 entrance into the universities even if their test scores are
 lower than those of their counterparts in Addis Ababa or other
 cities.
 A United Nations study published in 1980 concluded that 'women
 are discriminated against under marriage laws, in their
 participation in political and civic affairs, and in terms of
 equal educational opportunity and receiving wages equal to
 those of men." A 1982 UNICEF study also concluded that
 Ethiopian women are among the most disadvantaged sectors of
 the population, citing cultural and traditional biases,
 marriages imposed at a very young age, the hard and
 time-consuming labor of rural women, and inadequate employment
 opportunities and decent wages for urban women. Village
 leadership is male, and all clergy are male. However, women
 in the central Ethiopian cultures (Oromo, Amhara, Tigre) enjoy
 economic rights equal to those of men. They may inherit,
 sell, or buy property and engage in business. Women have a
 subjugated status within the home, and child marriages remain
 common in some rural areas despite opposition by the
 Government. Female circumcision is practiced in the northern
 parts of the country although the Government has stated its
 opposition to this practice.
 The Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association (REWA), a
 .mass organization' created in 1980, has the proclaimed goal
 of improving the status of women. Its plans include
 vocational training courses, increased employment and
 education for women, and programs to rehabilitate
 prostitutes. REWA claims that 3.2 million women have
 benefited from the literacy campaign and that many laws

 discriminatory against women are being eliminated. Since
 customs and practices are difficult to overcome, REWA's main
 focus has been to educate, organize, and encourage women to
 participate fully in authorized economic and political
 activities. At the same time, because the organization is
 controlled by the party, it also is heavily engaged in
 political indoctrination programs.
