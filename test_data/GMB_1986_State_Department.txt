 THE GAMBIA
 A former British colony on the West African coast, The Gambia
 is a parlimentary democracy with an elected president. Until
 the bloody coup attempt in July 1981, The Gambia had a history
 of political stability under the leadership of its first and
 current President, Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's
 Progressive Party has dominated the House of Representatives
 since independence in 1965, but several opposition parties
 actively participate in the political process. Two new
 political parties were formed in 1986 and will join the ruling
 party and the existing opposition National Convention Party in
 contesting the presidential election scheduled for March 1987.
 Given impetus by the coup attempt and formalized by the
 Confederation Treaty of 1981 establishing Senegambia, the
 process of confederation with Senegal continued during 1986,
 albeit slowly, with discussions mainly in the defense and
 economic areas. The Gambia has a small army and a modest
 navy. The Gambia gendarmerie has been organized under a
 Senegalese officer, and the first company trained by British
 officers has now been integrated with Senegalese troops into a
 confederal battalion.
 The Gambia's population of 762,000 consists largely of
 subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts (peanuts), the
 country's primary export crop. The Gambia continued in 1986 a
 stringent program of economic reform which in mid-year included
 new arrangements with the International Monetary Fund, the
 World Bank, and other donors to allow The Gambia to reschedule
 its debt and receive critical new loans.
 The Gambia continued the human rights improvement begun in 1985
 with the lifting of the state of emergency. Its human rights
 record in 1986 was good. In April 1986, the Government
 commuted the death sentences of 13 more persons convicted of
 treason and other crimes connected with the 1981 coup attempt.
 Presently there is only one outstanding treason-appeal case,
 which, after several postponements, is scheduled to be reviewed
 in 1987 by the Criminal Appeals Court.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known allegations of abduction or secret
 detention by the Government or by any other group.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution contains prohibitions against torture, and
 cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. There were no
 allegations of torture in 1986. Prison conditions are severe,
 but there have been only isolated reports of mistreatment of
 prisoners. There are segregated prison facilities for men and
 women of both maximum and minimum security types. The
 Government allows prison visits by representatives of the local
 Red Cross and by close family members.

 THE GAMBIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, there are well-developed
 constitutional and legal procedures governing the arrest,
 detention, and bringing to trial of persons accused of crimes.
 Under these procedures, a detained person must be brought to
 trial within 1 week of arrest. This waiting period, however,
 can be extended twice, making 21 days the maximum period of
 detention before trial.
 The Government scrupulously observed its laws in handling the
 1,091 persons detained after the coup attempt. Under the
 Emergency Act of 1981, which was abrogated in February 1985,
 the Government could and did order the detention of persons who
 were considered to have been involved in acts prejudicial to
 public safety for up to 14 days without a detention order but
 with the right to legal counsel.
 The Labor Administration Act prohibits forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Sixty-two persons were sentenced to death--after lengthy public
 trials--for crimes committed in connection with the 1981 coup
 attempt. Except for one, the cases have now gone through
 appeal, and the President in each case brought to him has
 granted executive clemency. No executions have taken place.
 There are currently no known political prisoners in The
 Gambia. One of the 1981 coup leaders was arrested in 1985,
 tried, and sentenced to death in 1986. His case is now in the
 criminal appeals court and is scheduled to be reviewed soon.
 To help discourage future coup attempts, The Gambia Parliament
 enacted a law in May 1986 which imposes the death penalty for
 treason, but which also includes the safeguard that a person
 cannot be convicted of treason on the uncorroborated statement
 of only one witness.
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is observed in
 marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers
 marriage, inheritance, divorce, land tenure and utilization,
 local tribal government, and all other civil and social
 relations originating in the traditional religious and tribal
 situation of the country. General law, based on English
 statutes and modified to suit The Gambian context, governs
 criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari'a, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution guarantees to criminal defendants the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as the
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, the accused person need not come
 to trial until the investigation is completed, and there
 apparently is no maximum time limit for investigations.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the
 Court of Appeals, the country's highest tribunal. Under the
 Emergency Act, the Government established a special division of
 the Supreme Court, comprised of judges and prosecuting and
 defense attorneys from neighboring English-speaking countries
 having the same basic legal system as The Gambia. This unusual
 step helped overcome the shortage of trained legal personnel,
 
 
 121
 THE GAMBIA
 avoided overwhelming the regular judicial system, and
 demonstrated publicly the Government's concern for impartiality.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property. The
 Constitution permits the voluntary submission by a suspect to
 search, or a mandatory search if it is reasonably required in
 the interests of national defense or other public interest.
 Under the criminal code, search warrants based on probable
 cause are issued by magistrates upon application by the
 police.   There are a number of police and military check
 points in and around Banjul. Drivers are stopped and vehicles
 are searched periodically.
 The rights of family are of extreme importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not normally intrude in family
 matters. There is no effort to censor or control personal
 correspondence or communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees press freedom, and the Government
 does not attempt to censor published materials whether they
 originate within or outside the country. However, the
 Emergency Act, with its broad powers of detention, did have an
 inhibiting effect on criticism of the Government by the few
 independent news sheets. In practical terms, The Gambia, with
 its small, mainly rural, largely illiterate, and multilingual
 population, does not support an active press. There are no
 daily newspapers. There is a government weekly newspaper and
 several independent, intermittently published, mimeographed
 news sheets. Both the opposition and the independent press are
 sometimes very critical of the Government. There is, however,
 some degree of self-censorship in the government-owned media,
 which exercises restraint in reporting criticism of the
 Government. There is no television in The Gambia, although
 Senegalese stations can be received.
 The Government dominates the media through Radio Gambia, but
 there have been no reported instances of government
 interference with the one commercial radio station which mainly
 broadcasts music. A few foreign magazines and newspapers are
 available in the capital.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In general, there is no interference with the freedom of
 association and assembly, which is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 meetings but requires that these meetings be open to the public.
 Trade unions are small and fragmented and are a minor element
 in Gambian economic and political life. Less than 20 percent
 of the work force is engaged in the small, wage sector, where
 unions normally are active. The Gambian Workers Union (GWU),
 an umbrella organization covering six major unions, finally
 
 
 122
 THE GAMBIA
 registered in 1986 and is recognized by the Government. The
 GWU was deregistered after an illegal strike in the late 1970's
 and subsequently became engaged in a long dispute with the
 Government over conditions for reregistration, e.g. the filing
 of financial documents. Other unions not affiliated with the
 GWU, function under basic labor and trade union legislation.
 The labor Administration Act specifies that workers are
 guaranteed freedom of association and the right to organize and
 to bargain collectively. Union members have the freedom to
 attend meetings outside the country.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitutional guarantees of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is
 secular though Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related activities. There is no evidence
 of discrimination in employment, education, or in other areas
 of Gambian life on religious grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Consitution guarantees freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals. There
 is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Internally, police and military checkpoints exist in
 and around Banjul, but there is no evidence that police harass
 travelers.
 Because of historic and ethnic ties with the people of Senegal,
 Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Mali, people tend to move
 unregulated across borders, which are poorly marked and
 difficult to police. Under the Confederation Treaty of 1981,
 neither Gambians nor Senegalese need passports or visas to
 travel to the other country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Right: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is elected by citizens 18 years of age and
 older. The chief executive (the President) and the members of
 the legislature (House of Representatives) are popularly
 elected, as are the district councils and the chiefs, who
 exercise traditional authority in the villages and compounds.
 A functioning multiparty system exists in The Gambia, even
 though the People's Progressive Party has been in power since
 independence. The principal opposition party, The National
 Convention Party, contests national and district elections.
 Other opposition parties contest the presidency and other
 offices on a selected basis. Independents have run for and won
 legislative seats. While there have not been any serious
 allegations of election fraud, the opposition boycotted the
 1983 district elections, claiming in advance that they would be
 unfairly managed by the Government. The government party holds
 43 of 50 seats in the House of Representatives. The opposition
 is therefore not able to defeat or modify significant
 legislation sponsored by the Government. Nevertheless, debate
 is open, and accepted parliamentary procedures are observed.

 THE GAMBIA
 Two new political parties were formed in 1986 in anticipation
 of the next election which is scheduled for early 1987. Both
 parties were formed by defectors from the ruling party. In
 October 1986, one of the leaders of the new Gambia People's
 Party (GPP) was arrested for 2 days for alleged "possession of
 government documents." After his release he resigned from the
 GPP and rejoined the ruling party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International
 and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of detainees and the
 trial process. There were no requests by such organizations
 for investigation of alleged human rights abuses in The Gambia
 during 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Sex, Race, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 The people are overwhelmingly Muslim and 85 percent of the
 population live in villages. While personal initiative and
 choice are valued, rights and privileges are generally
 perceived to reside in the group rather than in the
 individual. Traditional conservative values are changing but
 very slowly. Females comprise over one-third of the students
 in primary school, and with growing educational opportunities,
 women participate increasingly in the professions and in
 political life. The Minister of Education and the
 Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Health are women.
 In addition, there are women in prominent positions in the
 civil service as department heads and undersecretaries.
 Marriages are still often arranged, but there is growing
 freedom of personal choice. Family planning, focused on the
 health and welfare of mother and child, remains controversial
 but is gaining some acceptance. There is a women's bureau in
 the Office of the President which actively promotes debate on
 women's issues.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for employment is 18, at which age a
 prospective employee is authorized a labor card. The
 prohibition on child labor does not apply to customary chores
 on family farms. Minimum wages and hours of work are
 determined by the Joint Industrial Council, pursuant to the
 Labor Administration Act, which has representation from
 employees, employers, and government. Occupational safety and
 health are covered by The Factory Act under which the Minister
 of Labor is given authority to regulate factory health and
 safety, accident prevention, and dangerous trades and to
 appoint inspectors to ensure compliance.
