 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal
 parliamentary form of government. Representatives in the
 multiparty political system are'elected by universal suffrage
 at local, Provincial, and Federal levels. The national
 Constitution defines government responsibilities and is
 subject'to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Federal and Provincial election mandates last a maximum of 5
 years. Elections are completely free and often result in a
 changeover of-power to opposition parties.
 Federal, Provincial, and municipal police forces are
 responsible for national and local law enforcement. An
 elected civilian government controls the armed forces, which
 have'no role in domestic law enforcement except in strictly
 defined national emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 Canada's human rights performance in 1989 was exemplary. The
 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised
 Constitution in 1982, provides fundamental rights and freedoms
 to everyone. Government and private organizations try to
 ensure that these rights are respected in practice at all
 levels bf society,. Canada actively promotes respect foi human
 rights around, the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings. However,
 Canadian authorities and the general public are concerned
 about the potential for terrorist activity by Sikhs and
 members.of other resident ethnic groups with active ties to
 troubled homelands. United Kingdom authorities have approved
 the extradition to. Canada of a Sikh, formerly resident in
 British Columbia, who stands accused of having placed a bomb
 on a Canadian airplane in 1985 that killed two baggage
 handlers in Tokyo's Narita Airport.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically
 motivated disappearances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment-or Punishment
 These abuses are prohibited by law, and none was reported.
 d." Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected in practice.
 In January 1989, a law came into effect which strengthened the
 authority of the Federal Government to detain claimants to
 refugee status and swiftly deport those found inadmissible.

 C~AA
 A 1988 law authorizes the Federal Government to take special
 measures to ensure safety and security during national
 emergencies. The intent of the law is to define the kinds of
 emergencies under which the Government may assume
 extraordinary powers, including the suspension of basic civil
 liberties. This law replaced the older and more loosely
 defined War Measures Act. The 1939 Official Secrets Act
 prohibits the private possession, distribution, and
 publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests
 of the State and provides that persons under suspicion may be
 arrested without a warrant.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is based on English common law on the
 Federal level and in most Provinces. In the Province of
 Quebec, the judicial system is based on the Napoleonic Code.-
 Judges in Canada are appointed. In criminal trials, Canadian
 law provides for a presumption of innocence of the defendant
 until proven guilty, as well as the right to a public trial
 and to counsel. Free counsel is provided to indigents.
 The Official Secrets Act provides that trials concerning
 national security be held in secret with certain presumptions
 in favor of the State. Prosecutions under this statute are
 extremely rare, and convictions hard to sustain on appeal.
 There are no political prisoners in Canada.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Federal and Provincial governments do not interfere with a
 person's basic rights. Obtrusive searches may only be carried
 out when there is a reasonable basis for assuming that the
 person is involved in criminal activity. Police officials
 face the possibility of judicial penalties if they invade a
 person's privacy without first obtaining a search warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. Laws prohibiting
 certain forms of hate literature and pornography, restrictive
 decisions by provincial film censorship boards, and
 legislation which specifically protects language and cultural
 rights are the sole exceptions to these freedoms. The
 Canadian Human Rights Act makes it illegal to make repeated
 communications by telephone that expose persons to hatred or
 contempt. In July 1989, the Human Rights Tribunal, created by
 mandate of the Canadian Human Rights Act, ordered a white
 supremacist group in Alberta to stop playing an anti-Jewish
 taped message over the telephone.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed. Permits are not required
 for meetings.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 trade unions, see Section 6.a.

 CANADA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,.and Repatriation
 There are'no r~strictions on movement within or outside
 Canada, including the rights of emigration and repatiiation.
 Canada continues'to:be'a haven for many refugees and displaced
 persons. Widespread conce.rn,.hat many economic refugees have
 taken advanta e'of Canadals' gnerous refugee law and made
 spurious requests forasylum led to the passage of a new
 refugee la', which 'went into effect on January 1, 1989. By
 sucssfully discouraging claimants from such countries as
 Portugal and Triniaad, where-the conditions that generate
 valid claims for refugee status are generally lacking, this
 law brought'about a 50-percent reduction in asylum
 applfcations. As of August, 78 percent of applications
 processed since the beginning of the year had been accepted.
 The backlog 6f refugee'applications pri6r to 1989 is being
 proc6ssed under heparate procedures.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by Federal and Provincial governments that
 are freely elected by the Canadian-people, through universal
 suffra e. Legislative elections must be held at least every 5
 yea~~, ah'voter participation rates are high. The.0overnor
 Generl'is thQuee's representatiVe as-Jiead of'State.  In
 practice,'power is exercisid by the'Prime Minister and the
 Cabinet, who usually are. electpd membegg of the 295-seat House
 of Commons."-Three main parties are represented in the
 Commons, afid sleveral others function at the Provincial level.
 All Provinces and territories have similar" fireely elected
 ldgislatu'res'
 Sectioh4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Igin9overnmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of-Human Rights
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums,
 and the Feder l Government dhcourages'nOngovernmental
 organiiiations'to pursue investigations'of humqn rights abuses
 throughout the world. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
 and its Prbvincial'counterparts investigbVe and resolve
 complaints of discrimination'in pd Iib and private sector
 activities under governmental jurisdiction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 backgronnd, or political opinion. Article 15 of the Charter
 of Rights and.Freedoms guarantees equal benetits and     -1
 protection of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic
 origin, color, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical
 disability. These'rights are respected in practice. However,
 a virietyof'groups continued in 1989 to express concern that
 the adoption by Canada of a constitutional accord, known as
 the "Meech Lake Accord," granting Quebec special status as a
 "distinct society" could endanger the rights of women and of
 linguistic and cultural minorities throughout Canada. The
 
 
 1064
 CANiADA
 accord, signed by the Prime Minister and the Provincial
 Premiers and approved by Commons in 1987 but not yet approved
 by all the Provincial legislatures, is seen by some groups as
 threatening the promise of equal rights for women and
 minorities set forth by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
 Women's groups have been effective in bringing the issue of
 family violence to the fore. In A June 1987 report, a
 Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women estimated
 that 1 in every 10 women is physically, psychologically, or
 emotionally abused by her spouse or partner. Federal and
 Provincial governments have attempted to address the issue of
 family violence. In June 1988, the Federal Government
 appropriated $40 million for the construction of new shelters
 for battered women and their children, for police education on
 how to deal with domestic violence: and for research.
 Ontario Province enacted a far-reaching law that took effect
 on January 1, 1990, which requires that all employers (public
 and private) with more than 10 workers provide equal pay to
 men and women for work of comparable skill and provides a
 formula for evaluating and comparing jobs traditionally held
 by women with those traditionally held by men. Women enjoy
 marriage and property rights equal to those of men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to associate freely and to strike. The Canada Labour Code,
 which covers all employees under Federal jurisdiction,
 protects these rights at the Federal level, while Provincial
 labor legislation protects all other organized workers. Trade
 unions are independent of the Government and may freely
 affiliate with international organizations. About 36 percent
 of Canada's nonagricultural work force is organized into trade
 unions. All workers' rights protected in law are respected in
 practice. The Canadian Labor Congress is a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and many of
 its member unions are branches of American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations unions.
 In practice, certain groups of essential public sector
 employees are not allowed to strike. Restrictions vary from
 province to province. The 17,500-member British Columbia
 Nurses Union struck legally in June 1989, while 1,000 Quebec
 nurses struck illegally in September 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 is protected by law and freely practiced, though some
 essential public sector employees have limited collective
 bargaining rights, which vary from province to province.
 Antiunion discrimination is banned by law, and there are
 effective mechanisms for resolving complaints. All labor
 unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the
 judicial system. Canada has a limited number of export
 processing zones, and labor laws and practices within them are
 consistent with Federal and relevant Provincial laws and
 practice.
 
 
 1065
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is illegal and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor legislation differs among the provinces. The
 Federal Government generally prohibits those under 17 years of
 age from working for the Federal Government while school is in
 session. Provinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or
 16 from working without parental consent, working in any
 hazardous employment, or working at night. These prohibitions
 are effectively enforced through inspections conducted by the
 Federal and PIovincial labor ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor- standards vary from province to province, but all limit
 the standard workweek to 40 6r 48 hours. Minimum wages are
 established in both Federal and Provincial jurisdictions. The
 Federal minimum wage, covering about 10 percent of the
 Canadian work force, is about $3.40 per hour. A lower minimum
 wage covers minors. Colledtively, only 1 percent of workers
 governed by the Federal minimum wage are paid at the minimum.
 Eight percent of all workers are paid at the respective
 minimum wage-covering thbir class of employment* Lower
 minimum wages for minors are being phased out. A family with
 onlylone'eployed member working at the minimum wage would be
 below the 'poverty level. All Provinces have established
 minimum wages higher than the Federal minimum.
 The Federal Government establishes health and safety standards
 for the approximately 10 percent of workers covered by Federal
 labor legislation. Provincial legislation provides for health
 and safety standards for other workers. Federal and regional
 authorities enforce these standards through inspections.
