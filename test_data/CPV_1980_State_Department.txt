 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde gained its independence on July 5, 1975 after
 more than five'hundred years of Portuguese rule. The Party
 for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC),
 which had led a successful guerrilla war against the Portuguese
 in Guinea-Bissau (there were no military engagements in Cape
 Verde), sent its representatives and troops to Cape Verde and
 took over the reins of government from the departing Portuguese.
 The PAIGC continues to rule. No formal opposition is
 permitted.
 There is a National Assembly which meets for about two or
 three weeks a year to approve decisions made by the execu-
 tive. National elections were held in December 1980 to
 choose National Assembly members. There was a single voting
 list comprised primarily of PAIGC members. The National
 Assembly in turn elects the president.
 Cape Verde has a one party system. While the ideology of
 the party is socialistic, Cape Verde has a mixed economy
 with most shops in private hands. The party leadership has
 tried to improve the physical well-being of the poor major-
 ity without engaging in arbitrary expropriations of private
 property, or passing confiscatory taxes. The government is
 the largest employer and controls banking, commodity im-
 ports, mass transit, the press, schools and most medical
 services. There are no political prisoners.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly forbidden in the constitution (article
 35, clause 3). There were no known incidents of torture
 during the year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 These practices are outlawed in the constitution and no
 violations have been reported in the past year.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of any mysterious disappearances,
 abductions or secret arrests.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits such action. It is believed that
 there are no political prisoners in Cape Verde. In November
 1980, in a period of political tension after the coup d'etat
 in Guinea-Bissau, several persons were arrested for speaking
 out in favor of the coup or for suggesting the desirability
 of a similar act in Cape Verde. Tension eased quickly and
 all were released. Habeas corpus exists in practice for
 nonpolitical infractions, but is not always observed for
 alleged political offenses.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary of Cape Verde is independent in theory,
 although it is not known to have challenged an official act
 of the executive. Trials, both civil and criminal, are
 open to the publ c. The constitution specifies that "All...
 accused havetherighttodefense," and that "citizens...will
 not be denied justice because of insufficient economic
 means." Defendants are afforded legal counsel; if indigent
 or incompetent, they are assigned counsel from a judicial
 institute where Cape Verde's lawyers are registered.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 39 of the constitution " ..... recognizes and guaran-
 tees the inviolability of .... family houses ..." and
 article 40 recognizes  .... the citizen's right to the
 inviolability of domicile ...."  No reports or allegations
 have been received of forced entry by government authorities,
 nor have there been evictions of persons from their homes
 without due process of law.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The Government of Cape Verde is committed to a policy which
 seeks to guarantee the economic rights of its citizens as
 set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The
 government's ability to help its citizens attain a minimum
 level of well being is severely restricted by the islands'
 lack of resources and the continuation of severe drought -
 now in its twelfth year. The government's first priority is
 to prevent famine which it has successfully warded off since
 independence with food aid, primarily from western countries.
 Food distribution has been equitable.
 The government has also given priority to emergency programs,
 financed primarily by foreign grants, to provide jobs for
 agricultural workers displaced by drought. Water and soil
 conservation programs and road and school construction are
 given emphasis. High unemployment, about 33 percent, and
 recurrent droughts have led to periodic emigration and about
 500,000 Cape Verdeans live overseas, more than 300,000 in
 the United States. Emigrant remittances and official
 transfers account for two-thirds of the country's gross
 national product.
 The population of the Cape Verde Islands is about 300,000.
 Despite the continuing drought, Cape Verde has experienced
 an economic recovery during the past two years. Spurred by
 large public development outlays made possible by substantial
 foreign financial assistance, the real gross domestic
 product rose by 15 percent and 10.6 percent in 1978 and
 1979, respectively. The per capita income is now about
 $190.
 Life expectancy at birth of Cape Verdeans is 50 years and
 adult literacy rate is 35 percent.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde and
 the vast majority of the population shares various propor-
 tions of Portuguese - African ancestry. Sex discrimination
 
 
 exists because many of the traditional, male-oriented values
 in the Portuguese and African heritages of Cape Verde are
 still part of the island's culture. Women are customarily
 excluded from certain types of work, and are often paid less
 than men for comparable work. The government has included
 women in the labor intensive economic development projects
 financed by foreign grants. Article 27 of the constitution
 bans sex discrimination and the government and political
 party are making efforts to bring women into various economic
 and social activities where they have been traditionally
 absent.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees all these freedoms. In practice
 freedom of speech and assembly are limited, and strong
 criticism of the government in times of political tension
 has been surpressed and the critics detained. The government
 has not had to confront serious dissent.
 The news media (radio and newspaper) are government monopolies.
 News is edited to reinforce support for the government's
 economic development programs and foreign policy.
 No state religion exists. The government respects freedom
 of worship and members of all religious Sects practice their
 religions without harassment. The government, however,
 discourages the participation of religious leaders in
 political affairs. In the recent past a number of non-Cape
 Verdean Catholic priests, long resident in the islands, were
 forced to leave for allegedly engaging in political activities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation.
 The constitution states that repatriation is a right of the
 citizen. There is no refugee population in Cape Verde
 although many residents of Angola and Mozambique who left
 those countries after they achieved independence have
 settled in Cape Verde.
 There are no restrictions on travel within Cape Verde. The
 government imposes some administrative hurdles on emigrants,
 apparently ineffective as witnessed by the high level of
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in political affairs is possible through
 the single political party. Membership in that party is
 open to all who adhere to the party's principles. The first
 national elections for the assembly were held in December
 1980. There was only a single voting list which was com-
 piled by the PAIGC. Voters did have the option of rejecting
 the list. Eight percent did so. The National Assembly in
 turn elects the head of state but this election is believed
 to ratify a decision already taken at the Party's Superior
 Council level.

 Participation of the general population in a practical
 sense, takes place through activities at the local party
 level.
 It is not necessary to belong to the PAIGC to hold senior
 positions in government, but most leading officials are party
 members.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests by outside groups to investigate
 human rights conditions in Cape Verde and the attitude of
 the government to such investigations is not known.
