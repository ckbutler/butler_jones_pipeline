 LIBERIA
 Liberia has been ruled by a military government since the 1980
 coup led by Master Sergeant Samuel Kanyon Doe ended 133 years
 of constitutional government. The previous government was an
 oligarchy comprised largely of the descendants of freed slaves
 from the United States and the West Indies, who constituted
 about 5 percent of the population. Doe and his colleagues, all
 young noncommissioned officers with indigenous backgrounds,
 justified taking power as a revolt against elite minority
 rule. They established a military government ruled by the
 People's Redemption Council (PRC), suspended the Constitution,
 instituted martial law, and banned political activities.
 In 1984, the new Government instituted steps to return Liberia
 to democratically elected, constitutional, civilian rule.
 These steps included the drafting of a new constitution and
 lifting of the ban on political parties. Controversy soon
 surrounded the political reform program, both before and after
 the October 15 elections--the first national elections in
 Liberia's history based on universal suffrage. The Government
 carefully controlled the reform process by setting sharp limits
 on political debate (Decree 88A), forming a government party,
 establishing high registration standards, and banning two
 popular parties on the grounds they advocated Socialist
 policies, thereby reducing the number of eligible political
 parties to four. The campaign itself was lively, and both
 government and opposition parties received coverage in the
 media which consists of both government and nongovernment
 newspapers and radio. Voting on election day appeared
 generally free and open, with popular interest in the process
 very high. There were, however, immediate and widespread
 allegations of illegal procedures in connection with the
 counting of the votes. The Special Elections Commission
 announced that Samuel Doe had won the Presidency by 50.9
 percent and that his party had garnered 80 percent of the House
 and Senate seats. The three opposition parties denounced the
 results as fraudulent and announced they would contest them in
 court.
 During 1985, there was an April assassination attempt against
 Samuel Doe and a subsequent coup attempt against his Government
 which occurred shortly after the election results were
 announced. On November 12, a small force including some
 non-Liberians and led by former Army Commanding General Thomas
 Quiwonkpa entered Liberia from a neighboring country and
 attempted to overthrow the Government. Although the coup
 attempt lasted only a few hours, there was considerable loss of
 life associated with the abortive coup and its aftermath. No
 accurate casualty figures are available, but there are
 unconfirmed estimates that some 450-500 people, including
 Quiwonkpa, lost their lives in this period. In its wake, there
 were widespread arrests by government forces of military
 persons and civilians. There were reports of summary
 executions, killings, and reprisals against certain ethnic
 groups by government forces or government supporters. Both the
 Quiwonkpa and government forces and supporters engaged in
 beating presumed opponents during and following the coup, and
 homes were looted by both sides.
 Against this background, Liberia's mixed economy, with
 significant state enterprise activity, continued to decline in
 1985 due to weak export markets, economic mismanagement, lack
 of fiscal discipline, a large foreign debt, and government
 corruption. Foreign exchange receipts and government revenues
 
 
 176
 LIBERIA
 are heavily dependent on exports of iron ore, rubber, and
 timber, all of which have suffered prolonged market decline.
 The Government has attempted to reduce income disparities by
 increasing employment in government, but this has only
 postponed needed economic reforms. Retrenchment of government
 workers was begun in late 1985.
 While there were some notable achievements in 1985, such as the
 holding of multiparty presidential and legislative elections
 that were covered by both government and nongovernment media,
 concern over human rights performance in Liberia increased
 during the year. The Government used its authority inter alia
 to curtail political debate, to limit the number of political
 parties, and to detain opposition leaders and hold them
 incommunicado. In the wake of the October elections there was
 a bloody coup attempt in November, which left many dead and
 others in prison awaiting trial. The establishment of a
 constitutional government in place of military rule provides
 the basis, if respected, for greater protection of political
 and civil rights. Liberia returned to civilian rule on January
 6, 1986, when the new Constitution officially went into effect.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1985, there were reports of summary executions in connection
 with the April assassination attempt and the November coup
 attempt. An Army colonel accused of an attempted assassination
 on the Head of State was arrested on April 4. His
 investigation and interrogation ended in the early hours of
 April 8, and less than 12 hours later he was executed. The
 politicians whom he had implicated in his plot were arrested
 but subsequently released as there was no credible evidence of
 their involvement. Following the colonel's execution, the
 Government stated that the executed man had been tried by a
 military tribunal. There is, however, no public record that
 such a trial took place.
 On November 12, former commanding general of the Liberian Armed
 Forces Thomas Quiwonkpa led an armed group in an attempt to
 overthrow the Government by force. Although no accurate
 casualty figures are available, there are unconfirmed estimates
 that some 450-500 lost their lives in the coup attempt and its
 aftermath. A variety of sources in Liberia reported immediate
 summary executions of military personnel involved in the coup.
 Quiwonkpa himself was captured and killed, and a number of his
 supporters were either killed in fighting or executed. The
 Government denied that there were summary executions, although
 it acknowledged that a number of supporters of the failed coup
 were killed in mop-up operations after the coup.
 In November, after the attempted coup, a number of journalists
 were arrested. Charles Gbeyon, the editor-in-chief of the
 radio and television news for the Liberian Broadcasting System,
 was killed; the Government announced that it happened while
 Gbeyon attempted to resist arrest, although other sources
 disputed this account.

 LIBERIA
 b. Disappearance
 A number of people disappeared (either went into hiding, were
 arrested or killed) in the wake of the November 12 coup attempt
 and have not yet been accounted for. No accurate figures are
 yet available for these disappearances.
 In 1985, there were several instances when people disappeared
 and their mutilated bodies were later found. It is believed
 that these were cases of ritual killing. Some who practice
 traditional religions believe that ritual killing of others and
 the removal of certain parts of their bodies can increase one's
 power and chances of success in one's endeavors. The
 Government has condemned ritual killing but has been unable to
 identify the perpetrators.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Persons arrested are often subjected, upon or shortly after
 apprehension, to beating or whipping by security personnel as a
 form of summary justice and a means of preventive discipline.
 Such treatment is not generally repeated or used as a tool in
 interrogation.
 In 1985, there was an increase in reported instances of torture
 of political detainees and prisoners. There were reports of
 physical abuse of a number of persons arrested on suspicion of
 involvement in the November 12 coup attempt. Four individuals
 detained for 9 months without charge, allegedly in connection
 with the publication of an underground leaflet, were reportedly
 given 50 lashes each. It was widely reported that these four
 and two others detained in connection with the same publication
 were then each given 25 lashes upon transfer to a different
 prison several months later. Two journalists were also
 reportedly given 50 lashes each when they were arrested after
 announcing their intention to sue two high ranking government
 officials for false imprisonment in connection with an earlier
 detention which followed the journalists' publication of a
 story on government corruption.
 Approximately 12 persons, some of whom had been participating
 in an opposition party political rally, were detained in Grand
 Gedeh County and were beaten and whipped. In one case, family
 members of a politician were detained as hostages to force him
 to turn himself in for making "contemptuous remarks against the
 Interim National Assembly." The Defense Minister also
 threatened to arrest the families of two wanted men unless the
 families disclosed their whereabouts.
 Prison conditions are generally poor. Cells are often small,
 overcrowded, and without windows or ventilation. Food,
 exercise opportunities, and sanitation facilities are usually
 inadequate. Prisoners are often stripped to their underwear.
 One opposition party leader was stripped when he was arrested
 and forced to pose in his underwear in front of the executive
 mansion. Government supporters, including a government
 minister, were publicly stripped and beaten by supporters of
 the coup attempt on November 12, and their property was
 destroyed or stolen. Some opposition party officials and
 journalists arrested following the coup were reportedly beaten
 or mistreated, either at the time of arrest or afterwards, and
 some of their homes were looted or burned.
 
 
 178
 LIBERIA
 Custom and government regulations permit "trial by ordeal" in
 some criminal and legal cases, although senior government
 officials have spoken out against the practice. While the
 suspect's consent is formally required, social pressure may
 play a coercive role. The ordeal usually consists of drinking
 liquid prepared from the bark of a sassywood tree. Vomiting
 the liquid after ingestion indicates innocence, while its
 retention signifies guilt. Even if vomited, the liquids may be
 toxic. There were no reports of sassywood-related deaths in
 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrests, Detention, or Exile
 Since the 1980 coup, martial law has coexisted with civilian
 law enforcement and the judicial machinery. Although the
 Constitution and the writ of habeas corpus have been suspended,
 the full body of pre-1980 statute and case law is in most cases
 regarded as valid. In theory, civilians charged with statutory
 violations are arrested by police with warrants, must be
 charged within 3 days of arrest, have the right of bail in
 noncapital offenses, are entitled to legal counsel, and may be
 convicted in a court of law only under due process procedures.
 In practice, however, reports of abuses by police and soldiers
 are frequent. Civilians have been arrested or threatened with
 arrest by soldiers and police who then require payment of a
 fine. In cases of arrests for political crimes, there have
 often been long delays, eventual trials, sometimes harsh
 sentences, then pardoning by the Head of State or release on
 other grounds.
 In 1985, in connection with preelection political activities
 and in the aftermath of the November 12 coup attempt, there was
 a significant increase in the number of arbitrary arrests.
 More than 50 individuals were arrested for expressing views
 critical of the Government or for engaging in opposition party
 activities. For example, two leaders'of an opposition party
 were detained without charge for 2 months for "making remarks
 contemptuous of the Interim National Assembly." Most were
 detained without charge for periods ranging from several hours
 to 10 months. Six university students and opposition party
 members were detained for 10 months for their alleged
 connection with the publication of an underground pamphlet. Of
 the detainees, two were charged with "breach of security" and
 one with sedition for criticizing the Government. The two
 charged with breach of security were later released without
 trial.
 In November, after the coup attempt, at least 200 military and
 perhaps as many as 400 civilians were arrested and investigated
 on suspicion of involvement in, or sympathy with, the attempted
 coup. At the end of 1985, some military personnel had been
 charged and closed courts-martial were under way. Over 50
 civilians had been released, including presidential candidates
 of the Unity Party and the Liberian Unification Party and the
 chairman of the Liberian Action Party. Others, including the
 presidential candidate of the Liberian Action Party (Jackson
 Doe) and a former Minister of Finance (Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf),
 were still being detained. Civilians being detained had not
 been allowed access to lawyers and trials had not been
 scheduled as of December 31.
 There was also a noticeable increase in 1985 in the number of
 detainees held incommunicado. The Government refused to allow
 lawyers, family, friends, or, in one case, the Red Cross and a
 
 
 179
 LIBERIA
 local doctor, to visit these prisoners. For more than 3
 months, the Government refused to acknowledge that one
 opposition party official had even been arrested. It was only
 after the detainee escaped that the authorities admitted that
 he had been in custody for more than 3 months. As of late
 December, some persons detained after the November 12 attempted
 coup had not been allowed visits by their lawyers, family, or
 friends.
 In March, the Head of State established a special task force
 for debt collection headed by the Minister of Defense. Several
 dozen people were arrested without warrant and imprisoned
 without a hearing. They were held until they paid their taxes,
 made arrangements to pay them, or convinced the authorities
 that they did not owe the taxes.
 The Government does not exile its citizens. In fact, the Head
 of State and other government officials have on many occasions
 urged Liberians who fled or stayed abroad after the coup to
 return home. In most cases, those who did return have not been
 persecuted.
 The Liberian Government neither practices nor condones forced
 labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence. The military courts follow the uniform code of
 military justice of the U.S. military. The Liberian judiciary,
 both civilian and military, is vulnerable to influence exerted
 by the executive branch, and the Head of State has reversed
 unanimous Supreme Court decisions, notably in December 1984.
 While there are many good judges and lawyers, there have been
 widespread allegations of corruption among lawyers and judges
 and of interference in court cases by senior government
 officials. The concept of due process of law is
 well-established, but there are many allegations of
 bribe-related or politically motivated manipulations by judges.
 The Government sometimes uses the military court system for
 "political cases." In 1985, three civilians--two journalists
 and a leading member of one of the opposition parties--were
 tried in camera by a military tribunal. The defendants were
 not allowed civilian defense counsel. One of these trials,
 involving the two journalists, was suspended after 2 days, and
 the journalists were released after approximately 2 months'
 detention. A leading member of one of the opposition parties,
 former Finance Minister Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who was accused
 of sedition for criticizing the Government, was found guilty by
 a closed special military tribunal and sentenced to 10 years in
 prison. Shortly after the sentence was passed, the Head of
 State pardoned her. This special military tribunal was
 formally disbanded on January 4, 1986.
 In November 1985, a large number of military personnel and
 civilians were detained in connection with the November 12 coup
 attempt, and investigations of people whom the Government
 suspected of coup involvement began. By the end of 1985, in
 camera courts-martial were under way, with appointed military
 lawyers for some military personnel, on charges including
 conspiracy, mutiny, and sedition. At the end of the year,
 however, only five civilians had been indicted. In early
 January, the Government announced formal charges of treason
 
 
 180
 LIBERIA
 against one additional detainee. The Liberian Government had
 announced that it would hold open trials in civil courts for
 any civilians indicted on charges of involvement in this
 attempted coup.
 In 1985, several opposition political parties faced legal
 challenges to their registration. In two cases, the probate
 court ruled in the parties' favor but allowed significant
 delays in the cases, despite the fact that the parties faced a
 registration deadline. Appeals to the Supreme Court faced long
 delays. The Supreme Court's handling of these cases led to
 accusations that the Court was attempting to delay or even
 prevent the registration of opposition political parties. In
 the end, three opposition parties were allowed to register to
 participate in the elections.
 Traditional courts presided over by tribal chiefs are not bound
 by Anglo-American common law or judicial principles but apply
 customary unwritten law to domestic and land disputes and petty
 theft. These decisions may be reviewed in the statutory court
 system or may be appealed to a hierarchy of chiefs, followed by
 administrative review by the Internal Affairs Ministry and in
 some cases a final review by the Head of State. Allegations of
 corruption and incompetence in the traditional courts are
 commonplace.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the-martial law regime currently in effect, security
 forces may enter private residences without warrants, although
 civilian courts continue to issue warrants prior to such entry
 in most cases. Before the November 1985 coup attempt, there
 had been several cases reported during the year of persons
 arrested in their homes without warrants. In the brief period
 of control in parts of Monrovia by forces led by Quiwonkpa
 during the November coup attempt, homes and property of some
 government ministers were sacked and some members of the Doe
 Government were arrested and beaten. After the coup attempt
 had failed, there were widespread arrests without warrants of
 military personnel and civilians and reports of beatings,
 killings, and other reprisals against some opposition groups.
 The Government stated that some of the civilians, particularly
 opposition leaders who were later released, had been taken into
 protective custody in a period of great tension and civil
 disorder. Other military and civilians were being investigated
 for possible involvement in the coup attempt. In the period
 after the coup attempt, police and soldiers searched many homes
 without warrants. Houses and buildings associated with some
 opposition leaders, including the Liberian Action Party
 headquarters, were burned or looted. There were also reports
 of soldiers looting both in Monrovia and in the countryside.
 The Government called for a restoration of public order and an
 end to ethnic violence, but there were reports of lootings and
 ethnic reprisals for days after the coup attempt.
 There is no evidence of widespread monitoring of telephones or
 correspondence, but there have been allegations of specific
 instances of these practices.
 
 
 181
 LIBERIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Liberia has a relatively vigorous press, including a number of
 independent newspapers. However, the Government has passed
 laws and taken actions restricting freedom of speech and
 press. Among these actions in 1985 were the detention of
 journalists and the dismissal of members of the Interim
 Assembly for criticizing the Government. The key statutory
 limitation to free speech is Decree 88A which makes it a felony
 to accuse any government official or other individual of any
 crime if the purpose of the accuser is to injure the person's
 reputation, to create disharmony, to spread rumors, to
 undermine the security of the State, or to impede the electoral
 process. Some independent newspapers, opposition political
 parties, the Liberian Business Caucus, and the Liberian Council
 of Churches have called Decree 88A an unwarranted restriction
 on freedom of speech and press and demanded its repeal.
 Opposition party officials said the decree restricted their
 ability to mount effective political campaigns since they were
 unable to criticize the Government.
 Government officials frequently warned the press and other
 media in 1985 to temper their criticism. Head of State Doe
 stated that papers which published articles "designed to create
 fear and confusion" would face the consequences of the law.
 According to several newspaper accounts, the Minister of
 Defense summoned the publisher of one of the independent papers
 to the Ministry on October 31 and criticized his paper's
 coverage of the Head of State's election victory. He allegedly
 warned that the Government would "no longer tolerate" attempts
 by journalists to "create division among the people." The
 Government also allegedly threatened to close two radio
 stations because of their election coverage. In October, the
 Justice Minister warned that anyone spreading lies and rumors
 about the election results would be prosecuted.
 Some other specific actions included: (1) In January, the
 Government closed a leading independent newspaper on the
 grounds that it was "antigovernment." This was the fifth
 closure of the paper, and it remained closed at the end of the
 year. (2) In August, another independent paper was closed when
 the Government accused it of "injuring the image of the
 government." The ban was lifted 1 month later. (3) In
 September, members of the youth task force of the Government's
 party carrying batons and chains entered the office of a
 leading independent newspaper and threatened to destroy the
 office if the paper continued to print articles critical of the
 task force.
 Despite considerable self-censorship, there are no formal
 procedures in place to censor the independent media, and the
 relatively independent press did its best to provide balanced
 coverage of the process of transition to civilian rule.
 There is no prohibition against receiving foreign publications,
 but occasionally the Government bans a particular issue of a
 foreign periodical. The magazine, West Africa, is currently
 banned in Liberia.
 
 
 182
 LIBERIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The ban on political parties was lifted in 1984, and parties
 have generally been allowed to hold organizing meetings.
 However, in many instances opposition parties were denied
 access to public buildings such as town halls and stadiums. In
 some counties, opposition parties were prohibited from holding
 rallies. One opposition party was suspended for 3 months for
 publishing a pamphlet before the party was registered, although
 there was no prohibition against this in the election
 law. The leaders of two opposition parties were "banned,"
 which meant they were prohibited from attending political
 meetings or giving speeches or interviews. One opposition
 party was banned because its vice chairman made remarks
 "detrimental to the stability of the state," and another party
 was banned for its "alien philosophy."
 In 1985, the Head of State lifted a previous suspension on the
 activities of fraternal organizations such as the Masons.
 There are no official restrictions on social, recreational, or
 self-help development associations. There had been no official
 restrictions on other civic organizations until November 1985
 when the Liberian Government announced a ban on five
 organizations: the Press Union of Liberia; the National Union
 of Liberian Teachers; the Liberian National Students' Union;
 the Liberian Business Caucus; and the Provisional Student
 Leadership Council of the University of Liberia. Although the
 Government gave no explanation of the ban, members of some of
 these organizations had been outspoken during the campaign or
 have been in detention following the November coup attempt.
 Workers have the right to form unions and to organize and
 bargain collectively. Liberia has a national trade union
 confederation, the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU),
 as well as several independent unions. However, organized
 labor represents only a small part of the labor force.
 Approximately 70 percent of all workers are engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and are not affected by the union
 movement. Unions represent an estimated 20 percent of the
 workers in the monetary sector of the economy.
 Union organizing, collective bargaining, and the internal
 operations of trade unions are largely free from government
 interference. Nevertheless, in one case in 1985, the Head of
 State ordered the Labor Ministry to recognize one of two
 competing unions as the bargaining representative for workers
 at the Firestone plantation, despite the fact that the issue
 was at the time under appeal to the Supreme Court. The
 Liberian Government's suspension of a union which previously
 represented the workers at Firestone was criticized by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1985, and the ILO has
 requested more information on the Government's handling of the
 matter. Unions are prohibited from strike action, but brief
 strikes have occurred despite the ban. In most cases, workers
 have been persuaded to return peacefully to their jobs, and the
 Government has taken no punitive actions against them.
 The LFLU is a member of the Brussels-based International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as the
 continent-wide, Ghana-based Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity.
 In 1983, and again in 1984 and 1985, the Liberian Government
 was cited by the ILO for violations of ILO Convention 87,
 
 
 183
 LIBERIA
 regarding freedom of association, because Liberian legislation
 does not recognize the right of Liberians in the public service
 or in government enterprises to unionize or the right of
 workers to strike. The Liberian Government, the unions, and
 employers have drafted a new labor code which eliminates the
 objectionable legislation cited by the ILO, but the new labor
 code has not yet been promulgated.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is recognized and respected by the
 Government of Liberia. The pre-1980 constitution called for
 separation of church and state, a concept repeated in the new
 Constitution. Christianity, brought by 19th century settlers
 and spread through the interior by missionaries, has long been
 the religion of the elite groups but has not been an official
 or state-favored religion. The majority of the rural
 population continues to practice traditional religions, and
 approximately 20 percent of the total population is Muslim.
 The Government does not practice discrimination against any
 religious group. Although there is a tendency among some
 Liberians to view Muslims as "outsiders," many government
 officials are Muslims, and Muslims are active throughout the
 economy.
 During 1985, Head of State Doe twice warned the clergy to stop
 making political statements. After the Methodist bishop made
 remarks critical of the Government, the Government withdrew the
 Methodist Church's duty-free privileges and ended a government
 subsidy to Methodist schools. In November, the radio program
 of one reliious leader who had been critical of the Head of
 State was canceled by the government-owned radio station. The
 program was later reinstated.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, neither domestic movement nor foreign travel is
 restricted. Exit visas are required for departure and exit
 visas are occasionally denied. Neither immigration nor
 emigration is formally restricted. Refugees are not generally
 forced to return to the countries from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Choose Their Government
 Since the 1980 coup, Liberia has had a military government.
 Head of State Doe gradually consolidated his position and there
 were no effective checks on the power of the executive branch.
 At the end of 1985, however, preparations were under way for
 the institution of constitutional civilian rule on January 6
 under a constitution which provides for the separation of
 powers and a system of checks and balances among the three
 branches of government.
 In 1980, Head of State Doe pledged to return Liberia to a
 democratically chosen, constitutional, civilian government and
 subsequently instituted a series of steps toward this goal,
 including: drafting a new constitution; establishing an
 interim National Assembly; organizing a commission to supervise
 elections; initiating two voter registration drives; conducting
 a national referendum on the Constitution; and lifting the ban
 on politics. The elections, held in October 1985, attracted a
 
 
 184
 LIBERIA
 large voter turnout. Election day appeared largely free of
 attempts to intimidate the voters.
 However, there have been persistent and widespread allegations
 that the Government, the Special Elections Commission (created
 by the Head of State to organize and supervise the elections),
 and the Head of State's National Democratic Party of Liberia
 (NDPL) manipulated the transition process and engaged in
 illegal activities to secure victory for the NDPL. The
 Government, in turn, alleges irregularities by opposition
 parties during the elections.
 Eight of the 13 opposition parties were unable to meet the high
 financial requirements established by the Special Elections
 Commission (SECOM). Two other opposition parties were banned
 by the Government for espousing Socialist policies. All three
 opposition parties encountered procedural and legal delays; one
 was not registered until six weeks before the election. No
 opposition party was able to complete registration before July
 1985, while the government party was registered in November
 1984. As noted above, the opposition parties met a variety of
 other legal obstacles, such as Decree 88A, and opposition party
 supporters in some localities were jailed, intimidated, and
 prevented from campaigning by local government officials.
 The Interim National Assembly reduced the number of
 representatives to be elected on the grounds that the
 Government could not afford the salaries and support costs of a
 large House of Representatives. The manner in which
 constituencies were redrawn resulted in 26 percent of the
 population electing 46 percent of the representatives.
 The election law, written by SECOM and approved by the
 Government, stated that competing party representatives were to
 be present during ballot counting at polling stations,
 consulted on questionable ballots, and allowed to sign the
 official vote tally. The results of these tallies are unknown,
 but after the elections, SECOM's chairman ruled the tallies
 invalid because one opposition party allegedly had infiltrated
 the pollworkers. As a result, the chairman established a
 50-member committee without official representation by the
 opposition political parties to recount the ballots. There was
 no provision in the election law for such a committee. There
 were widespread though unconfirmed allegations that some
 ballots counted by the 50-member committee were fraudulent and
 that many ballots were secretly removed from ballot boxes and
 burned. On October 29, the Special Elections Commission     -
 announced that Samuel Doe had been elected with 50.9 percent of
 the vote and that his party had won 80 percent of the
 legislative contests. All of the opposition parties denounced
 the vote-counting procedure as illegal and fraudulent. They
 announced their intention to challenge the election in court
 and their refusal to accept the legislative seats they had
 reportedly won. In fact, however, in early January 1986, 12 of
 the 18 opposition legislators did take their seats.
 By-elections will probably be held for the other 6 seats if the
 elected members continue to refuse them after 30 days.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernhental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Foreign journalists and other observers were allowed to cover
 the Liberian elections in October. Several times this year the
 
 
 185
 LIBERIA
 Government has met expressions of concern or requests for
 information about alleged violations of human rights with the
 argument that they constitute unwarranted interference in
 Liberia's domestic affairs. The Government has generally been
 unwilling to supply information on alleged human rights
 violations. The Government refused permission for the Red
 Cross and a local doctor to visit political prisoners who had
 allegedly been beaten. In the month following the November 12
 coup attempt, people arrested in connection with that attempt
 were not allowed visits by lawyers or independent international
 groups. Several of those arrested have subsequently been
 allowed visits by lawyers. Some have been allowed visits by
 family members. The Government has indicated it will allow
 outside observers at any trials of civilians which may result
 from investigation of the coup attempt. The U.S. delegation to
 Doe's inauguration had individual meetings on January 6, 1986,
 with Jackson Doe and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and a group meeting
 with 12 other detainees.
 Amnesty International, in its 1985 report (covering 1984), was
 concerned about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and
 about the detention, usually without trial, of other
 individuals suspected of criticizing the Government. Freedom
 House rates Liberia as "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In rural areas, where 70 percent of Liberia's estimated
 2,232,000 (1985) population lives, the inhabitants practice
 subsistence agriculture and follow a traditional culture. The
 population is growing by 3.3 percent per year (1985).
 The Liberian economy depends heavily on export of iron ore,
 rubber, and timber, whose production is dominated by foreign
 corporations. Expatriate communities, primarily Lebanese and
 Indian, also control an estimated 80 percent of retail and
 wholesale trade. However, foreigners until December 1985 have
 not been permitted to own real property, and citizenship is
 open only to Negroes or persons of Negro descent. Gross
 national product (GNP) per capita was estimated in 1983 at $480
 annually, but 50 percent of national income is held by only 5
 percent of the population. The current per capita figure is
 probably significantly lower due to negative GNP growth each
 year since 1980.
 Health care is poor, especially outside-urban areas. Only 20
 percent of the population has access to safe water (35 percent
 in urban areas and 6 percent in rural areas (1974). The infant
 mortality rate is 127 per 1,000 live births (1985), and life
 expectancy at birth is only 52 years (1985). Average calorie
 supply, however, was 99 percent of requirements in 1977.
 Education for the growing population is a major problem.
 Two-thirds of all teachers are not professionally qualified and
 only 70 percent have finished high school. Only 25 percent of
 adults were literate in 1980 (42 percent of males and 9 percent
 of females). The primary school enrollment ratio was 80
 percent (99 percent for males and 61 percent for females), but
 many students drop out. Only 22 percent of school-age children
 finish elementary school, and the dropout rate is much higher
 among women than men.
 Liberia's labor laws provide for minimum wages and health and
 safety standards. However, the inspection is not rigorous. In

 many cases, the employer has provided appropriate protection,
 but the employees prefer not to follow the guidelines.
 Employers are prohibited from employing children under 16
 during school hours. This is a difficult statute to enforce,
 especially since many children are engaged in subsistence
 farming. While it is difficult for the Government to inspect
 all workplaces and enforce the laws, any employee with a
 grievance can file with a labor inspector.
 Liberia was founded by private American "colonization
 societies" as a territory where blacks could enjoy political,
 economic, and social freedoms denied them in the United
 States. Eventually, 20,000 settlers came to Liberia and they
 and their descendants have remained heavily influenced by
 American cultural, economic, and political models. In urban
 areas and along the seacoast where settler dominance was
 strongest, a modern sector has evolved with a free enterprise
 economy, substantial political and economic equality for men
 and women, and Anglo-American judicial procedures based on
 English common law as transmitted and modified by the American
 experience. Here, land is plotted, deeded, and held in fee
 simple, and women can inherit land and property. There is no
 formal discrimination in property ownership, educational
 opportunity, or participation in economic and political
 processes. Women in Liberia have held ministerial and
 ambassadorial positions and are represented in the professions
 and throughout the modern economy. Women hold two cabinet
 posts and several national judicial positions. There was one
 woman serving in the Interim National Assembly.
 In rural areas, most land is held communally among the related
 families of a clan, and women perform most of the labor in food
 production and distribution, both for household consumption and
 market sale. As opposed to statutory marriage, seen as a
 contract between individuals, customary marriage is an
 agreement between families. With payment of a dowry under the
 customary marriage system, a woman is considered the property
 of her husband and family. Upon the husband's death, the
 marital contract continues with the family, which has certain
 obligations and responsibilities to the widow, or more commonly
 widows, if they remain with the family as wives to other
 relatives. In the traditional sector, women are not usually
 entitled to inherit from their husbands or to administer their
 estates. In addition, women are informally excluded, in many
 indigenous ethnic groups, from chieftancies or membership in
 the councils of elders that direct the affairs of the
 community. Female circumcision is widely practiced by those
 Liberians following traditional religions. In practice,
 especially in newly urban areas, many women use both the
 customary and statutory legal systems.
