 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state dominated by President Fidel
 Castro, who is Chief of State, Head of Government, First
 Secretary of the Communist Party, and Commander-in-Chief of
 the Armed Forces. President Castro exercises control over
 nearly all aspects of Cuban life through a broad network of
 directorates ultimately answerable to him through the
 Communist Party, as well as through the government
 bureaucracies and the state security apparatus.- The Party is
 the only legal political entity and is headed by an elite
 group whose membership is ultimately determined by Fidel
 Castro. All government positions, including judicial offices,
 are controlled by the Party. Though not a formal requirement,
 party membership is a de facto prerequisite
 for high-level official positions and professional advancement
 in most areas.
 The Ministry of Interior (MININT) is the principal organ of
 state security and totalitarian control. It operates border
 and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations,
 determines whether or not to recognize nongovernmental
 associations, investigates evidence of nonconformity,
 regulates migration, and maintains pervasive vigilance through
 a series of mass organizations and informers. Reorganized in
 1989, the Ministry is under the de facto control of the
 Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR). The mass organizations
 attempt to extend government and Communist Party control over
 each citizen's daily activities at home, work, and school.
 Through neighborhood Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution (CDR), citizens are exhorted to ensure ideological
 conformity and to report deviation.
 The Cuban economy is highly centralized and managed by a group
 of advisers close to President Castro. The Government
 controls the means of production and is virtually the
 country's sole employer. As the economy deteriorated through
 1990, President Castro allowed discussion of minor adjustments
 which some observers believed-might lead to limited reform of
 the command economy. However, most economic adjustments to
 date appear to reflect continued resistance to reform. In
 October the Government began to implement the first phase of a
 program of extreme austerity measures, known as the "special
 period in peacetime," which emphasizes economic
 self-sufficiency at the expense of social programs. This
 policy appears to be motivated in part by the Government's
 expectation of reduced economic aid and less favorable terms
 of trade from its principal trading partner, the Soviet
 Union.
 The Government skillfully neutralizes dissent through a
 variety of usually nonviolent tactics which are designed to
 keep activists off-balance, divided, and discredited by
 labeling them as mentally disturbed, social misfits, or
 hostile agents of certain foreign countries. The Government
 sharply restricts virtually all the basic human rights,
 including freedoms of expression, association, assembly, and
 movement, as well as the right to privacy, the right of
 citizens to change their government, and worker rights. In
 March Americas Watch (AW) stated that "Cuba's human rights
 practices are sharply at odds with international standards.
 Cuban laws that curtail basic rights enumerated in the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights--freedom of expression,
 association, assembly and movement, and the rights of privacy
 and due process--remain in force. There are no legal
 
 
 569
 CUBA
 institutions independent of the Goveriment and the governing
 Communist Party that could ensure respect for such rights.
 There are no free press, no independent labor unions, and no
 legally recognized human rights organizations. All Cubans are
 affected by the absence of such institutions."
 In the spring, most of Cuba's well-known activists were
 rounded up in the wake of the passage of a United Nations
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) resolution which, among other
 things, called on the Cuban Government not to retaliate
 against those who had testified before a UNHRC group in 1988.
 President Castro responded to a UNHRC resolution on human
 rights abuses in Cuba by stating, "Do not even dream that we
 will follow one word of that resolution."  Other activists
 were able to continue their activities, although they were
 intimidated from expanding their work. Toward the end of the
 year, authorities released a number of detained activists into
 "limited freedom" (similar to parole.) The Government has
 increasingly refused to respond to calls for improvement in
 its human rights practices.  In June the Government suspended
 visits to Cuban political prisoners by the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a7. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In 1990 there were three cases of probable extrajudicial
 killings. Although two of the persons killed had some
 connection to human rights groups, there is no direct evidence
 that they were killed because of their human rights
 activities. However, reliable reports indicate that the
 victims were considered by the police to be troublemakers,
 disrespectful of authority and the Government. In one case,
 which was closed by year's end, major discrepancies between
 the official investigation report and a report based on
 interviews with the family of the victim indicate that the
 official report may have been a cover-up.
 On September 28,.Angel Galvan Vanegas, a human rights
 activist, was shot and killed by a police officer when he
 protested the arrest of his adopted son at his home.
 According to eyewitnesses, when Galvan questioned the officer
 about charges against his son, the officer shot Galvan in the
 chest at close range. According to one report, Galvan was
 shot after he made a gesture which could have been interpreted
 as preparing to draw a gun. There were unconfirmed reports
 that the police officer was arrested shortly after the
 shooting,.but no further information about an investigation of
 the case or charges against the officer was available at
 year's end.
 On February 13, 20-year-old Juan Carlos Mederos, a human
 rights activist who previously had been subjected to police
 harassment and detention, was found dead by a relative in an
 onion field near the town of Batabano. The relative had
 earlier learned that two auxiliary policemen had been sent to
 arrest Mederos, and the relative was able to question one of
 the two, who said that the policemen had spent 2 hours
 unsuccessfully trying to find Mederos in the onion field where
 he worked. The body showed signs of physical abuse, including
 blows to the head, stomach, and testicles. The death of
 
 
 570
 CUBA
 Mederos was reported to Cuban Border Guards, but there was no
 indication of any subsequent investigation.
 According to detailed reports from human rights activists
 based on interviews with family members and other witnesses,
 26-year-old Jose Antonio Sanz Campo was killed in police
 custody on May 31, following his arrest for illegally selling
 mangoes. Sanz was taken to the national police headquarters
 where relatives heard him screaming that he was being beaten;
 they later saw him taken to Gibara Hospital where he was
 pronounced dead. Police then took Sanz' body to Lenin
 Hospital in the provincial capital, where a forensic physician
 certified that the cause of death was asphyxiation by
 hanging. According to an official press account of the death,
 Sanz was arrested, taken to jail, and later hanged himself
 with his trousers. However, a physician who examined the body
 at the family's request said Sanz had died from multiple blows
 that were skillfully delivered, and the Sanz' family insists
 that there is no reason to believe Sanz would have committed
 suicide.
 The death of one person in psychiatric detention was
 reported. On March 9, the remains of Angel Tomas Quinones
 Gonzalez were turned over to relatives at the Havana
 Psychiatric Hospital, where he had been interned since early
 1989 following arrest for antigovernment activities. Quinones
 had served an earlier prison term. The official cause of his
 death was given as asphyxiation by hanging or suicide.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and
 prisoners. However, there was an increase in the number of
 reliable reports of prisoner beatings and other abuse in
 1990. Abuse and neglect by prison officials is often directed
 at those prisoners who have bedn convicted of political crimes
 or are unwilling to conform. The Government claims that
 prisoners have guaranteed rights, including family visitation,
 adequate nutrition, pay for work, the right to request parole,
 the right to present a petition to the prison administrator,
 and others. However, these purported rights are frequently
 and capriciously withdrawn, particularly in the cases of
 political prisoners, according to activists. There was no
 indication that Cuban authorities investigated these cases or
 took disciplinary action against those responsible for abuse
 or negligence.
 There continued to be reports of brutality by police and
 prison officials. Jorge Rodriguez Gonzales was detained on
 suspicion of car theft, beaten by police, and left
 unconscious. According to his brother, medical assistance was
 initially denied. On March 27, Rodolfo Frometa Caballero, who
 had rejected political reeducation, was beaten by guard Misbel
 Betancourt Gomes, Lt. Jesus Vera Ramos, and three others. The
 incident occurred when Frometa protested prison conditions.
 In June Lazarro Alberto Rigena Lopez was beaten senseless by
 guards Sarmiento, Juan Jose Octavio, and Ramon (full names
 unknown), at Combinado del Este Prison.
 
 
 CUBA
 Necessary medical treatment appeared to be given or withheld
 at the discretion or convenience of prison authorities.
 Eduardo Delgado de la Puente, a prisoner in Combinado del Este
 Prison, suffers from lymphatic tuberculosis. According to his
 mother, the prison's political reeducation officer refused to
 allow Delgado to be treated for the illness until he renounced
 his human rights activities. Hiram Abi Cobas of the Cuban
 Human Rights Party (PPDHC) received irregular medical care for
 gastrointestinal and heart problems. Mr. Cobas was arrested
 in August 1989 and sentenced to an 18-month term for
 "spreading false information against international peace"
 after he spoke with foreign journalists about the
 internationally televised drug trial of General Ochoa. He was
 released.in November 1990. In May Juan Enrique Garcia, a poet
 and edit6r who is a member of the Pro-Free Art Association
 (APAL), was reported to have been denied medical treatment for
 a severe digestive disorder, despite previous hospitalizations.
 Punishment cells are regularly used to discipline inmates.
 The punishment cell is a small isolation cell that is often
 kept dark. Punishment can include reduced or irregular food
 or use of a bed, prohibition of visits and correspondence,
 denial of reading or writing material and of medical
 attention. Esteben Gonzalez, Manuel Pozo, Jorge Marrerro, and
 Orlando Dominquez spent time in the punishment cells at the
 Combinado del Este Prison in 1990. Gonzalez and Pozo are
 activists in the dissident Democratic Integrationist Movement
 (MID). Rodolfo Frometa, who had refused prison political
 reeducation, was confined to a punishment cell throughout 1989
 and part of 1990; no information was available about him after
 September, when he was treated for a duodenal ulcer. Hubert
 Jerez of the Jose Marti Committee for Human Rights, who was
 sentenced in November 1989 to 18 months' imprisonment for
 'spreading false news against international peace," was
 reportedly put in a punishment cell at Kilo-7 Prison for at
 least 1 month early in the year; Olga Lidia Hernandez, a PPDHC
 activist, reportedly was sent to a punishment cell in the
 Western Women's Prison after she was attacked by another
 inmate on September 21.
 Diplomatic observers received reliable reports during 1990
 that the Government continued to use psychiatry as a tool to
 intimidate political dissidents. During detention, human
 rights activists were subjected to involuntary evaluation at a
 psychiatric hospital as part of the interrogation process.
 Security officers administered tranquilizers and other
 mood-altering drugs to political prisoners and common
 criminals without medical approval. According to the PPDHC,
 Francisco Tijera Garrido remained confined to the psychiatric
 unit of Havana's Naval Hospital throughout 1990. Interned
 after refusing induction into military service in September
 1988, Tijera reportedly was told he would remain in the
 psychiatric facility for a period corresponding to the
 duration of his military service obligation.
 A well-known human rights leader who was in prison in 1990
 described a wide range of tactics employed by the authorities
 to intimidate imprisoned human rights activists. Initially,
 activists receive privileges as an enticement to cooperate.
 If they do not comply, they are subject to subtle threats,
 then physically intimidated or attacked by other prisoners who
 are under the control of prison officials. Many observers
 believe that authorities used such tactics to persuade former
 PPDHC activist Tania Diaz Castro to renounce her beliefs.
 Arrested in March, she publicly recanted her former activism
 
 
 572
 CUBA
 in September while awaiting sentencing in prison; she was
 subsequently released and provided with employment.
 Intimidation was also utilized to break the spirit of other
 political prisoners and their relatives.
 Family members of imprisoned activists reported threats of
 psychiatric internment: one spouse was told by the
 representative of her local CDR that unless her husband ceased
 his human rights activities, she would be sent to a
 psychiatric hospital and her child to an orphanage. There
 were reports from families that the prisoner was told that the
 family's economic and social welfare depended on his or her
 willingness to cease or recant human rights'activities.
 Conversely, families were told that their agreement not to
 protest or comment publicly on a relative's detention would
 have a positive effect on the treatment the relative received
 in confinement. Female family members reported being
 subjected to extensive body searches, including of body
 cavities, before being permitted to visit dissidents.
 Prisoners continued to live under very difficult conditions in
 1990. Protests by inmates were at times harshly repressed.
 One human rights activist reported that, at Villa Clara
 Prison, Rudy Pardo Gonzales, an inmate suffering from amoebic
 dysentary, was beaten by guards for not attending a roll
 call. When other prisoners protested, 16 guards intervened
 with tear gas and locked Pardo and other prisoners in
 punishment cells for 15 days.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 245 of the Cuban Law of Penal Procedures requires
 police to file formal charges and either release a detainee or
 place him at the disposition of a prosecutor within 96 hours
 of arrest. Authorities are also legally required to provide
 suspects with access to a lawyer within 10 days-of arrest.
 These procedures are routinely denied in the cases of those
 detained on state security grounds. Article 61 of the
 Constitution permits denial of all constitutionally and
 legally recognized civil liberties in the case of anyone
 actively opposing the "decision of the Cuban people to build
 socialism." Cuban authorities implicitly invoke this Article
 by justifying lengthy detentions of dissidents on the grounds
 that they were "counterrevolutionary elements."
 Reports of arbitrary arrests and prolonged detentions of
 dissidents without trial increased in 1990. This campaign to
 intimidate dissidents was particularly marked in the spring
 and early summer following the passage of a UNHRC Resolution
 on human rights abuses in Cuba: approximately 30 such arrests
 occurred shortly after the UNHRC vote in early March. Some of
 the dissidents were held for brief periods ranging from
 several hours to several days; others remained in detention
 and awaiting trial at year's end; still others were charged
 but released awaiting trial.
 In March and April, the Government arrested numerous activists
 throughout the country for no apparent cause other than their
 human rights activities. On March 7, at least five Cuban
 Human Rights Committee (CCPDH) activists were arrested and
 detained at Villa Marista Prison. On March 8, PPDHC leader
 Domingo Hernandez Valdez was temporarily detained and warned
 about his human rights activities. On March 10, police
 searched the homes of and then arrested PPDHC leaders Trania
 Diaz Castro and Mario Remedios for "illegal association." At
 
 
 CUBA
 4 a.m. on March 10, police arrested APAL leader Pablo Pupo
 Sanchez at his home without charge; Sanchez was subsequently
 accused of "encouraging the United States to invade Cuba and
 counterrevolution." Both Sanchez and Tania Diaz were released
 after they agreed to denounce publicly the U.S. Government.
 On March 22, CCPDH activists Ruben Hoyo Ruiz, Miriam Aguilera
 de Hoyo, Ernesto Rios Nodarse, Felix Rodriguez Ramirez, Omar
 Perez, Fidel Vila Linares, and Leonel Maniedo were arrested in
 Villa Clara. In September Hoyo was sentenced to 6 years in
 prison for "illegal association and spreading subversive
 propaganda"; Vila and Rodriguez were sentenced to 5 and 4 1/2
 years respectively on the same charge; Perez was sentenced to
 2 years; and Rios to 1 year of labor in a work farm. At
 year's .end, Aguilera and Maniedo awaited trial on the charge
 of "spreading enemy propaganda." On May 14,'Amador Blanco of
 the Jose Marti Human Rights Committee was roughed up and
 arrested after leaving the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss
 Embassy. The same day, the group's vice president, Juan
 Delgado, was briefly detained in Villa Clara. By May the
 leaders of four of the five major Cuban human rights
 organizations were imprisoned.
 The Government prolongs prison sentences by resentencing
 detainees on new charges for activities allegedly committed
 during imprisonment. The new charges are announced when the
 prisoner approaches the end of his original prison term.
 Samuel Martinez Lara, a leader of the PPDHC, was to have
 completed a 9-month sentence on January 4 for having organized
 a demonstration during the March 1989 visit to Cuba of Soviet
 leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Prior to his scheduled release, he
 was infomed of new charges of "disrespect for authority" and
 "disrespect for the President," charges which carry a maximum
 sentence of 3 years' imprisonment. Martinez Lara was released
 as scheduled but rearrested on March 10, accused of plotting
 to overthrow the Government. He was still awaiting trial at
 year's end. APAL activist Juan Enrique Garcia was sentenced
 to 18 months imprisonment after his arrest in October 1988.
 While in prison, he was sentenced to 2 additional years on
 unrelated charges and is currently due for release in the
 spring of 1992. Human rights activist David Moya Alfonso was
 charged with contempt because of prison activities while
 serving 9 months for organizing an "illegal meeting." He was
 sentenced to an additional year. In November authorities
 released Moya on parole, probably because Moya had been
 selected to receive an award from Reebok for his human rights
 activities. On December 28, a week after he gave a press
 conference on the human rights situation in Cuba, Moya was
 ordered to report to Villa Marista prison. He was not
 arrested, but at year's end his status was not clear.
 Other dissidents, including Communist Party members, were also
 sentenced to prison terms for their activities. Elizardo
 Sanchez, President of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights and
 National Reconciliation (CCDHRN), Hiram Abi Cobas, head of the
 PPDHC, and Hubert Jerez of the Jose Marti Committee for Human
 Rights were arrested on August 6, 1989, for "disseminating
 false information" about the 1989 narcotics trial of executed
 Cuban General Arnaldo Ochoa. In November 1989, Sanchez was
 sentenced to 2 years in prison; Abi Cobas and Jerez each
 received 18 months. On January 4, two student members of the
 Communist Party's youth wing, the Union of Young Communists
 (UJC), were arrested for criticizing President Castro and
 urging political reform. Jorge Quintana Silva and Carlos
 Ortega Pinera were reportedly expelled from the University of
 Havana and detained on the charge of "enemy propaganda," which
 
 
 574
 CUBA
 carries a maximum sentence of 3 years. At their trial in
 November, the prosecutor described the defendants as
 .misguided" and requested that the sentence be reduced.
 Ortega and Quintana were sentenced to 3 and 2 years,
 respectively, of "restricted freedom," which is similar to
 parole in the United States. On April 3, Esteban Bonilla
 Fuentes, a UJC member, was arrested for "spreading verbal
 propaganda." He was sentenced on May 26 to 3 years in prison.
 Alfredo Mustelier, a "plantado historico" (a long-term
 political prisoner who has refused "reeducation") was released
 in March following a long and dangerous hunger strike after
 serving 20 years of a 25-year sentence. The penal code limits
 the maximum prison sentence to 20 years in most cases.
 Mustelier was accepted as a refugee by the U.S. Government,
 but until December the Cuban Government had denied his wife, a
 doctor, an exit permit to leave Cuba. Another "plantado
 historico, Mario Chanes de Armas, believed to be the world's
 longest serving political prisoner, completed the 29th year of
 his 30-year sentence. Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez, another
 "plantado," had served 21 years in prison. The Government
 refuses to reduce the sentences of other long-term political
 prisoners.
 The Cuban Penal Code retains internal exile as a sanction
 against convicted offenders, but no instances of formal forced
 removal or resettlement were noted in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cuban. law and trial practices do not meet international
 standards for fair and impartial public trials. Although the
 Constitution provides for independent courts, it explicitly
 subordinates them to the National Assembly and the Council of
 State (Article 122). Judges are elected by the rubberstamp
 National Assembly and its lower level counterparts. The
 independence of the judiciary is compromised by the de facto
 subordination of the courts to the Communist Party: there is
 no known case in which a Cuban court has successfully ruled
 against the Government on any political or security matter,
 although the courts have sometimes handed down shorter
 sentences than the prosecution requested.
 Civil courts exist at three levels, municipal, provincial, and
 the Supreme Court. All civil courts are presided over by
 panels composed of a mixture of professionally qualified
 judges and lay judges. There is also a system of military
 tribunals which tries certain counterrevolutionary activity
 cases.
 Criteria for evidence presented in Cuban courts do not meet
 generally recognized international standards. Article 58 of
 the Constitution states that "No violence or pressure of any
 kind can be used against people to force them to testify. All
 statements obtained in violation of the above precept are null
 and void and those responsible for the violation will be
 punished as outlined by law." In practice, the sole evidence
 provided in some cases is the defendant's confession, which is
 usually obtained without due process safeguards against
 self-incrimination or coercion.
 A trial for political offenses ordinarily consists of evidence
 given by prosecution witnesses, who are generally employees of
 state security organs. There are usually no defense witnesses,
 although testimony on behalf of the defendant from a member of
 
 
 575
 CUBA
 a CDR may be introduced and may contribute to either a reduced
 or an enhanced sentence.
 The law recognizes the right of appeal in municipal courts.
 In provincial courts, some cases are appealable and others are
 not. Cases involving maximum prison terms or the death
 penalty are open to appeal. The Law of Penal Procedure
 provides that an appeal must be presented within 5 days.
 Cuban law provides an accused the right to a defense attorney,
 but the latter's impartiality and independence are compromised
 by the absence of a private bar association and by ideological
 controls exerted over members of the state-controlled lawyers'
 collectives, especially in defending persons accused of crimes
 against state security. Observers have noted a reluctance
 among attorneys to defend persons charged wiht political
 offenses. Lawyers are discouraged from taking political cases
 because of persecution suffered by those who do. Former
 political prisoners have alleged that state security officials
 apply pressure on all persons involved in the judicial
 process, and that those officials, not the courts, really
 decide the fate of the detainee. Foreign observers at trials
 of activists report that the behavior of defense lawyers and
 judges indicates that decisions on guilt and sentencing are
 not made at the trials.
 In practice, government-appointed defense lawyers are
 generally poorly prepared and may be excluded from entering a
 case until the investigation phase is completed. Exceptions
 have been noted when there is international interest in a
 particular trial. Human rights activist Elizardo Sanchez was
 allowed to select and consult with his own attorney prior to
 his trial in November 1989. However, he was not permitted to
 call witnesses, and representatives of international human
 rights organizations were not allowed to attend the trial.
 According to human rights activists, when international
 observers are not present, defendants do not have the
 opportunity to explain their actions or to provide a
 meaningful defense. In June the trial of seven members of the
 MID was officially presented as "public." However, spectators
 affiliated with the Government took most of the seating in the
 courtroom so that little space was available for other
 observers, human rights activists who attended said. Persons
 who attended the trial reported that the arguments of the
 defense focused on efforts to reduce the proposed sentences
 rather than on the merits of the charges of
 "counterrevolution."
 The Penal Code includes a concept of "dangerousness" (Articles
 72-89), defined as "the special proclivity of a person to
 commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest
 contradiction of Socialist norms." In 1990 there were
 reliable reports that authorities intimidated activists and
 dissidents by threatening them with prosecution under this
 Article. If the police decide that a person is exhibiting
 such behavior, the offender can be brought before a court
 which may call for therapy or political reeducation lasting
 from 1 to 4 years.
 In 1990 the Government used the judicial system to discredit
 human rights activists by publicly associating them with
 certain foreign governments or with violent activities. In
 July Cuban media reported the July 17 closed trial of 11
 persons said to be members of the Youth Association for Himan
 Rights, said to be associated with the PPDHC. They wer .-t? ed
 
 
 CUBA
 on charges of plotting the violent overthrow of the Cuban
 Government with the support of the U.S. Government. Cuban
 media reports of the trial said other prisoners testified as
 witnesses and that caches of arms were found to support the
 charges against the defendants. According to persons who
 attended the trial, known government informants testified
 falsely against the defendants. The prosecution's line of
 questioning attempted to establish that human rights activists
 were terrorists. The accused were convicted and sentenced to
 terms ranging from 8 to 15 years.
 The precise number of political prisoners in Cuban jails at
 year's end is difficult to calculate because there is no
 international access to the prisoners, the Government charges
 some offenders with common crimes when in fact they have been
 incarcerated for political crimes, and the Government
 traditionally maintains secrecy about the prison population.
 In a July 1990 critique, the Lawyers' Committee for Human
 Rights, using a variety of sources, estimated that there were
 about 300 political prisoners in Cuba.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Official intrusion into private and family affairs remains one
 of the most repressive and pervasive features of life in
 Cuba. Government- or Communist Party-directed mass
 organizations permeate Cuban society. The State has assumed a
 virtual right of interference into the lives of its citizens,
 even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its
 practices. These intrusions encourage ideological conformity
 and aim ostensibly at "improvement' of the citizenry.
 Government authorities possess a wide range of social
 controls. The educational system teaches that the State's
 interests have precedence over all other ties and
 commitments. Teachers, selected in part for their ideological
 commitment, emphasize Communist Party doctrine in the
 classroom and can sanction students whose families question
 orthodox opinion. Teachers also evaluate the political and
 ideological character of their students, which is noted in
 records carried with each student throughout his or her
 education. Failure to join a party-controlled student group
 or otherwise not having an acceptable record can result in
 denial of student or worker access to higher education, a
 choice of career, or an improved job.
 MININT employs an extensive security apparatus to determine
 the legality of all private and public associations, utilizing
 an intricate system of informers, block wardens, and block
 committees (Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, CDR)
 to monitor and control public opinion. The guardians of
 social conformity, CDR's are neighborhood
 surveillance/security committees tasked with closely
 monitoring the daily lives of individual residents.
 Participation in Cuba's 80,000 CDR's is described as
 voluntary; however, in urban areas it is in fact involuntary.
 CDR's report suspicious activities, such as contact with
 foreigners, reception of foreign radio or television
 broadcasts in the home, conspicuous consumption, unauthorized
 meetings, and attitudes toward the Government and the
 Revolution. In 1990, CDR activity intensified as the
 Government heightened its campaign against
 "counterrevolutionaries". In September President Castro
 annnounced the establishment in Havana of 93 Peoples'
 
 
 577
 CUBA
 Councils, charged with halting petty economic crime and
 corruption at the neighborhood level. The Councils can
 arbitarily dismiss employees for alleged corruption.
 Diplomatic observers believe these Councils are intended to
 supplement CDR monitoring of the citizenry.
 Cubans have no right to receive publications from abroad and
 expect that all correspondence with foreign countries will be
 read by state security officials. Overseas telephone calls
 are monitored, and conversations with foreigners in embassies
 and public places are reported. Well-known activists report
 frequent physical surveillance by security agents, as do
 foreign diplomats and journalists.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are widely restricted. The Government does not
 allow direct criticism of the Revolution or its leaders; laws
 are enforced against antigovernment propaganda, antigovernment
 grafitti, and slander or insults against government officials.
 Local CDR's inhibit freedom of speech by monitoring and
 reporting on dissent or criticism (see Section l.f.).
 The electronic and print media are owned by the State or
 party-controlled organizations and operate according to party
 guidelines. Cuban media reflect government views of events
 and are used to indoctrinate the public. No public forum
 exists for airing one's views apart from the
 government-controlled media.
 Party leaders claimed in 1990 to want a more active press, but
 censorship continued, and writers and commentators were
 sanctioned for expressing unacceptable views. In March an
 actor/narrator for Radio Havana and a journalist for the
 government-owned youth paper Juventud Rebelde were expelled
 from their jobs after making comments critical of the
 Government: the narrator had described a Castro speech as
 vulgar, and the journalist said that his newspaper was not
 representative of Cuban youth because it did not allow the
 freedom of opinion that was being officially encouraged at
 that time. Due to a shortage of printing supplies, the
 Government, in the fall, closed all publications other than
 the daily newspaper Granma, 15 provincial dailies, 2 weekly
 newspapers, a weekly magazine, and a small number of specialty
 publications. Some Cuban journalists say that the measure
 gave the Government an opportunity to dismiss journalists who
 did not conform strictly to the official party line. Cuban
 press professionals say they have received reprimands for
 unauthorized contacts with politically unacceptable persons
 and certain non-Cubans. In mid-August, a sports commentator
 who had befriended a human rights activist was denounced by a
 colleague and threatened with removal from her position.
 Artistic and literary freedom are circumscribed by government
 control. Party and government officials carefully scrutinize
 humor and irony in the arts. Academic freedom is also
 severely limited. Education is the exclusive prerogative of
 the State, and the school system follows Marxist-Leninist
 precepts as interpreted by government guidelines. Academics
 may write freely so long as their work does not conflict with
 any government or party policy.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution does not provide for freedom of assembly or
 association, and those freedoms are not practiced.. Any
 assembly of more than three persons, even in a private home,
 is punishable by up to 3 months in prison and a fine.
 According to Article 240 of the Penal Code, organizers of
 "illicit or unrecognized groups" can receive a sentence of up
 to 9 months. There was no known instance in 1990 of
 authorities approving a public meeting of a group not
 officially recognized by the Government.
 Article 208 of the Penal Code forbids the existence of
 "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministry of Justice, in
 consultation with MININT, determines whether to recognize
 organizations. Apart from "recognized" churches and one or
 two carefully monitored groups such as the Masonic Order,
 small and not legally recognized human rights groups represent
 the only associations outside the State and the Party. The
 authorities continued to ignore applications for legal
 recognition made by the CCDHRN and the CCPDH over the past 3
 years.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes the rights of citizens to profess
 and practice any religious belief. However, the Government
 places restrictions on the practice of religion and
 -discriminates against believers. Religious believers are
 excluded from membership in the Communist Party and thus from
 almost all executive and leadership-positions, including posts
 in the Government, the courts, and the teaching profession.
 Those who publicly profess their religious beliefs may be
 subject to informal discrimination in the workplace-and
 through social pressures on their children at school.
 The Government and Communist Party continued to maintain
 restrictions and controls on the activities of organized
 churches. Churches and other religious groups must register
 with the Government and be officially "recognized."
 Recognized religious organizations customarily are permitted
 to hold religious activities only within specifically
 designated places of worship. Many Catholic and Protestant
 churches have closed, and new construction of church
 facilities has been restricted since the Revolution. Four
 Protestant and two Catholic seminaries are in operation, but
 no other formal religious training schools are permitted.
 In 1990 churchmen were allowed for the first time to have
 regular access to the prisons; a large group of
 Protestants/Evangelicals met with Fidel Castro for the first
 time in 32 years; Catholic and Protestant clergy for the first
 time were given, albeit extremely minute, access to official
 media; large Catholic processions,-with up to 15,000 people,
 were tolerated for several months before the Government ended
 them; and a number of Cuban and foreign clergy made reciprocal
 visits.
 However, overall relations between the Catholic Church and the
 Government worsened in 1990. The Catholic bishops delivered a
 letter to Fidel Castro in February, reportedly suggesting
 broader popular participation in the policymaking process. As
 of year's end, the letter had been ignored. In May, planning
 for a papal visit, which had been considered for late 1990,
 was postponed indefinitely, apparently because the Government
 had growing reservations about the visit. Religious
 
 
 579
 CUBA
 processions in small towns that had attracted thousands of
 participants in preparation for the Pope's visit were
 discouraged. In a pastoral letter in July, the Archbishop of
 Havana, Monsignor Jaime Ortega, called on the Government to
 pass a law guaranteeing the religious freedom of all
 believers. He suggested that the Communist Party drop its
 avowedly atheist character, and that party members be allowed
 to practice religion. Cuban Government officials have
 indicated on several occasions that such changes might be
 considered at the next Congress of the Communist Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on. domestic travel. In 1990
 opportunities for unofficial foreign travel remained tightly
 restricted, being limited generally to men over 55 and women
 over 50, church officials, humanitarian cases, athletes, and
 academic researchers. Late in the year, the Government
 announced that the general age limitation for foreign travel
 would be lowered to 45 for men and 40 for women. It also said
 it was considering a further relaxation of restrictions on
 exit permits.,
 The Government strictly controls emigration, but in 1990
 permitted several thousand persons, including hundreds of
 former political prisoners, to leave the country permanently
 with no right of return. During 199G the Government continued
 to deny or delay, without explanation, exit permission to some
 persons or their immediate familiesswho had been accepted into
 immigration or refugee programs. Several human rights
 activists fell into this category. The wife of Alfredo
 Mustelier, who was freed in March, was denied an exit visa to
 leave the country with her husband until December.
 It is a crime to leave the country without authorization.
 Persons who attempt to leave in small craft face sanctions
 ranging from fines to 3 years in prison. In 1990
 discrimination against intending legal emigrants continued.
 There are a number of complex regulations that specifically
 affect pending emigrants. Once emigration formalities are
 completed, all family possessions and property become the
 property of the State unless immediate relatives are able to
 prove ownership.
 In July the Government took extraordinary and violent action
 to choke off efforts by some Cubans to seek refuge in some
 local embassies. More than 40 persons, including human rights
 activists, sought refuge in several foreign embassies in
 Havana pending requests to leave the country. The Government
 announced that no citizen would be permitted to depart the
 country without authorization, but promised that none of the
 refuge seekers would be prosecuted for their actions. The
 Government sent state security agents posing as refuge seekers
 into some embassies to intimidate legitimate refuge seekers as
 well as foreign diplomats. The agents destroyed property at
 the Czechoslovak Embassy and at the residence of the
 Czechoslovak charge d'affaires, and at one point took hostage
 Czechoslovak diplomatic personnel and several human rights
 activists. One of the persons seeking to enter the Spanish
 Embassy for refuge was intercepted and beaten by police.
 Another person who attempted to enter the U.S. Interests
 Section was also beaten by police on diplomatic property.
 There are reports that at least one of the persons who sought
 refuge in the foreign diplomatic missions might have been
 
 
 CUBA
 detained briefly after leaving one of the embassies and that
 others have suffered retaliation despite President Castro's
 promises to the contrary.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuban citizens have no legal right to seek to change their
 government or to advocate such change. The only political
 organization allowed in Cuba is the Communist Party. The
 overlapping party and state hierarchies were reduced
 substantially in October. Members of the highest governing
 bodies, the Politburo and the Central Committee, are selected
 by a small group of party leaders. Direct elections are held
 to fill municipal offices and provincial assemblies and some
 seats in the National Assembly.
 The Party widely publicized preparations for the Fourth Party
 Congress, scheduled to be held in 1991. Cubans were invited
 to air their complaints through their local organizations.
 The Government announced direct secret elections at the local
 and provincial level. However, top party leaders have made it
 clear that there will be no discussion of a multiparty state
 or of any significant change in the role of the Communist
 Party.
 Spurred by the worldwide trend towards more open political
 systems, numerous exile groups proposed dialog and programs of
 democratic change in 1990. Some Cuban human rights leaders
 such as Gustavo Arcos called for a national dialog among all
 sectors of Cuban society, including the exile communities, to
 effect democratic change. President Castro ignored these
 calls for reform and labeled the human rights activists who
 proposed them "worms" and traitors working to undermine the
 Cuban Revolution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive and hostile to international and
 nongovernmental investigations of its human rights record.
 President Castro reacted to the March 6 passage of the UNHRC
 resolution calling on the Secretary General to gather
 information and report on the human rights situation in Cuba
 by stating: "We simply will not pay attention to it. Do not
 dream that we are going to comply with a single word of that
 resolution." On March 5, the day before the resolution's
 passage, a crowd of several hundred demonstrators gathered at
 the residences of activists Gustavo and Sebastian Arcos
 Bergnes where human rights leaders were meeting to discuss the
 formation of a united front. They shouted threats, defaced
 and damaged property, and assaulted some of the activists as
 they left the premises. Although the events received
 television coverage, authorities did not intercede either to
 disperse the demonstrators or to halt the activists'
 meetings. Government media described the gatherings as
 spontaneous repudiations of the Arcos brothers' activism.
 The Government reacted angrily to criticism of the human
 rights situation in Cuba by international leaders, including
 U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar, Czechoslovak
 President Havel, and Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez
 Ordonez. In June the Government suspended the right of the
 ICRC to visit Cuban political prisoners. ICRC representatives
 
 
 581
 CUBA
 had visited 395 prisoners in 12 prisons in 1988 and 257
 prisoners in 10 prisons in 1989. In 1989 the ICRC had been
 the only internationally recognized human rights organization
 permitted to visit Cuba. Representatives of Amnesty
 International and Americas Watch were able to interview some
 activists and participate in prison visits organized by the
 Government at the request of delegates to the U.N. Crime
 Congress, which was held in Havana in August-September.
 However, the Government did not permit Cuban human rights
 activists to attend the Crime Congress.
 Domestic human rights monitors are not recognized by the
 Government and are subject to varying degrees and forms of
 intimidation. The Government continued, in violation of its
 own statutes, to refuse to recognize the applications for
 legalization submitted by several such groups in 1990. The
 three principal domestic human rights monitoring groups are:
 the Cuban Human Rights Committee (CCPDH), the Cuban Human
 Rights Party (PPDHC), and the Cuban Commission for Human
 Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN). There are also a
 number of smaller human rights related groups. The Government
 continued to ignore the 1988/89 annual report of the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission which called on the
 Government to recognize human rights associations and their
 right to engage in their activities freely-
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a large population of
 persons with mixed racial ancestry. The Constitution
 expressly forbids discrimination on thebasis of race, sex, or
 national origin, but evidence suggests that racial and sexual
 discrimination sometimes does occur.
 The Family Code of 1975 states that women and men have equal
 rights and responsibilities-regarding marriage, divorce,
 raising children, maintaining the household, and pursuing a
 career. The maternity law for working women of 1974 provides
 18 weeks of paid maternity leave, and working women are
 granted preferential access to goods and services.
 Approximately 39 percent of Cuban women work, and they are
 well represented in the professions, but few are in positions
 of significant political responsibility. The official women's
 organization, the Federation of Cuban Women, is used to
 mobilize women politically rather than to advocate women's
 rights.
 Anecdotal evidence from human rights groups and other sources
 indicates that domestic violence such as wife beating is a
 problem, but the lack of statistical data makes it impossible
 to gauge its extent. Due to cultural traditions, victims of
 mistreatment are reluctant to file a report or press charges,
 so instances are probably underreported. Cuban law
 establishes strict penalties for rape, including the death
 penalty for the rape of minors or serious injury to the
 victim. The Penal Code also provides sanctions for sexual
 coercion of women by authorities or guardians.. These statutes
 appear generally to be enforced, although reports vary. Some
 Cubans believe that the incidence of rape is high but that
 sexual crimes are seldom if ever reported in the press, and
 reliable statistics are not available.
 Information about specific incidents of racial discrimination
 is not available. In general, blacks tend to be concentrated
 
 
 582
 CUBA
 in low paying and low status jobs; there are few in government
 ruling circles and in the top level of the military.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives priority to state or collective needs
 over individual choices regarding matters involving free
 association or provision of employment; the decisions and
 choices of workers are subordinate to the "demands of the
 economy and society" (Article 44). Strikes are not permitted
 under the law, nor are any known to have occured in 1990.
 Established Cuban labor organizations are not trade unions in
 any real sense and do not act as a voice for workers' rights,
 including the right to strike. Labor is organized under the
 control of the State and Party through one umbrella group, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC). The CTC is affiliated
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions
 and plays a leading role in its regional organization, the
 Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America. The
 CTC serves primarily as an instrument of the State to enforce
 political and labor discipline, to encourage productivity, to
 hold down labor costs, and to conserve raw materials. Some
 CTC member labor organizations have served as debating forums
 for the consideration of a limited range of labor issues, such
 as worker safety and local working conditions.
 There is no right to form independent unions, which are
 explicitly prohibited. Even discussion of such a step has
 been subject to punishment. Tiny, illegal, independent labor
 groups that appeared in 1989 were not heard from in 1990, and
 may have ceased to exist. In 1983 a group of five trade
 unionists were sentenced to death after attempting to form an
 independent trade union. After an international outcry, their
 sentences were commuted to 30-years imprisonment, and they
 remained incarcerated during 1990.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Effective collective bargaining does not exist. The State
 Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. There are no known export processing
 zones in Cuba. Because the CTC is a government instrument,
 antiunion discrimination is only a relevant concept as it
 applies to the Government's repression of any attempts to form
 independent union groups.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code contains
 prohibitions against forced labor. Workers do not have
 freedom to change jobs without official approval. Every
 worker must present a work identification card in seeking a
 new job. This card contains information on performance of
 "voluntary" work, protection of Socialist property, political
 consciousness, failure to meet production goals, and
 negligence. In practice, any job change remains under the
 control of the authorities who grade and evaluate employee
 records that form the basis of the work identity cards.
 Special groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan
 from other jobs, are employed on special construction
 projects. Some human rights monitors allege that workers
 refusing to "volunteer" for such projects often find
 
 
 583
 CUBA
 themselves victims of discrimination or even at risk of losing
 their jobs. Microbrigade workers, however, are reportedly
 rewarded with priority listing for apartments, a very powerful
 incentive for voluntary work. In October the Government
 announced that because of a failing economy many redundant
 jobs would be eliminated in the interest of greater
 efficiency. Very severe cuts were planned for the government
 bureaucracy and for workers whose enterprise could not
 continue due to a lack of materials. Displaced workers were
 offered alternative employment in "productive enterprises or
 services." Many observers took this to mean that workers
 would be requested to "volunteer" for manual agricultural
 labor. Since the State effectively controls all employment,
 displaced workers could likely come under pressure to accept
 agricultural work and relocation.
 Various International Labor Organization (ILO) bodies have
 found that governmental restrictions on the freedom to choose
 or change employment are incompatible with ILO Conventions
 prohibiting forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age is 17; however, the Labor Code
 provides for exceptions for those aged 15 and 16 in order for
 them to obtain training or to fill labor shortages. There is
 no evidence that authorities deviated from these rules in
 1990. However, all students above the age of 11 are expected
 to devote 3a to 45 days of their summer vacations to
 agricultural work up to a maximum of 8 hours per day.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In 1990 Cuba's minimum wage was about $130 per month at the
 overvalued official exchange rate or about $18 in terms of
 black market buying power, plus a "social wage" consisting of
 free medical care and education, along with subsidized housing
 and food. Even with the state subsidies, a worker needs to
 earn substantially more than the minimum wage to support a
 family. The value of the "social wage" in improving living
 standards is diminished by the persistent shortages and tight
 rationing that over the years have become standard features of
 the Cuban economy. For example, most newly married couples
 must live with relatives for years before obtaining housing.
 Until September, the workweek was 44 hours, with shorter
 workdays for unusually demanding jobs such as underground
 mining. In September the Government stopped most routine work
 on alternate Saturdays as an energy saving measure.
 "Voluntary" unpaid labor was still encouraged, but only in
 essential enterprises or those that produce more than they
 expend in energy by remaining open for voluntary overtime. In
 1990 the traditional mass worker mobilization for voluntary
 work on Red Sunday, the anniversary of the Soviet revolution,
 was cut back to include only those workers who could
 contribute real, rather than symbolic, production. Workers
 receive 30 calendar days of vacation regardless of seniority
 or age. Based on reports from Cubans who have left the
 island, provisions for worker safety and control of pollution
 generally appear to be inadequate. There is a lack of
 effective control and enforcement mechanisms to ensure worker
 safety, and industrial accidents are apparently frequent.
