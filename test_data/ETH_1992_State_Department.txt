 ETHIOPIA
 The coalition of ethnic-based insurgencies that took power in Ethiopia in 1991 re-
 mained committed to establishing a multiparty democracy by 1994. But tensions be-
 tween the principal armed groups of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TG),
 i.e., the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the Oromo
 Liberation Front (OLF), erupted into violent clashes several times in 1992. This re-
 sulted in an outbreak of low-level war between the two groups in June when the
 OLF boycotted local elections, withdrew its soldiers from camps, and took up arms.
 By year's end, the EPRDF forces had dominated the fightin.q, and negotiations to
 bring the OLF back into the TG coalition and resolve the political crisis had stalled.
 The EPRDF, which is officially a coalition of four parties but additionally controls
 more than a dozen loosely affiliated parties, dominates the TG and the quasi-legisla-
 tive Council of Representatives, especially since the departure of the OLF. The
 Council is composedof 74 members representing 30 political and ethnic groups. The
 TG held local and regional elections in June, the first attempt at internationally ob-
 served multiparty elections in Ethiopian history. However, the results were flawed
 by numerous irregularities, including fraud, harassment, intimidation, and political
 -assassination. In the months leading up to the elections, numerous offices of opposi-
 tion parties were closed, supporters of opposition parties were detained without
 charge, and both the TG an opposition parties were accused of political assassina-
 tion.
 In Eritrea the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) administers the one-
 party, provisional government of Eritrea tasked with governing the country until an
 internationally supervised referendum on Eritrea's political future, scheduled for
 April 1993, can be-held.
 When it came to power, the TG leadership dismantled the extensive military and
 security apparatus of the Mengistu regime. Following the OLF decision to leave the
 TG in June, the TG milit-y/poice force numbered about 100,000 and was composed
 primarily of EPRDF regulars. Battles with the OLF resulted in a number of casual-
 ties, including civilians, and the detention of 19,000 OLF fighters. Rural instability
 was a problem for much of 1992, but by the end of the year the countryside was
 largely free of major security problems. During 1992, the TG began efforts to recon-
 stitute a professional police force and to downgrade the temporary plice system of
 thousands of local "peace and stability committees" which have had sweeping pow-
 ers of investigation, arrest, and detention. All security forces, including the peace
 and stability committees, were accused of committing human rights abuses. Total
 military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the US. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $763 million. Reduction
 in military expenditures is a major goal of the TG, and current levels of military
 expenditure are substantiallf lower than they were in 1989. These reductions are
 linked to the Government's economic reform program.
 In Eritrea approximately 110,000 Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF)
 regulars make up the provisional government's militarylsecurity force. The provi-
 sional government expelled all remaining Mengistu troops, including those accused
 of "war crimes." The last remnants left in July 1992.
 Ethiopia's largely agricultural economy struggled to make its way out of 17 years
 of Marxist mismanagement and toward freer markets and competition. Nonetheless,
 food and fuel shortages were chronic; over a million people remained displaced by
 the war; the national treasury was depleted- foreign exchange was at a desperately
 low level; and the inflation rate was high. While 1992 was the third good agricul-
 
 
 tural year in a row (largely due to favorable rains), little real impact of the TG's
 anew economic policy  was felt by year's end.
 The economic situation in Eritrea roughly paralleled that of Ethiopia. Agricultural
 crop performance in 1992 was expected to be the best in many years, and the gov-
 ernment continued to strive for a mixed economy with at least partial privatization.
 While Ethiopia has shown considerable progress in extending and protecting
 human rights serious problems remain. In particular, over 2,000 former regime offi-
 cials were still in detention without hai  been charged after almost 20 months;
 members of the former Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) were disenfranchised; eth-
 nic and political violence continued with many extrajudicial killings, although at re-
 duced levels; and the continued lack of a police force and a fully reconstituted judici-
 ary resulted in increased use of force in dealing with criminal activity.
 In Eritrea the one-party provisional government expelled numerous non-Eritreans
 and was reluctant to repatriate its exiled or refugee citizens from neighboring coun-
 tries.
 In accordance with the 1991 National Charter, freedom of speech, assembly, asso-
 ciation, religion, and travel were more widely respected than under the Mengistu
 regime. With the appointment of special prosecutors and the declared intention of
 establishing an independent judiciary, the TG moved late in 1992 to bring its politi-
 cal detainees to trial and to institute the rule of law.
 The provisional government of Eritrea established a range of judicial safeguards,
 which are being observed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-In the tense atmosphere surround-
 ing the encampment of armed troops in April and the run up to the June elections,
 officials of EPRDF and non-EPRDF parties died in violent incidents. Charges
 abounded that EPRDF soldiers assassinated opposition party leaders. The body-
 guard of the chairman of the Sidamo Liberation Movement died in a shooting inci-
 dent with EPRDF soldiers at a checkpoint. The deputy chairman of the Is amic
 Front for the Liberation of Oromia (IFLO) was killed at an EPRDF checkpoint, and
 the head of the Oromo People's Liberation Front was also attacked at a checkpoint.
 Representatives of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization disappeared in OLF
 territory. OLF officials were gruesomely murdered-apparently by the IFLO-in
 eastern Ethiopia in May. In July newspapers reported a number of deaths of ban-
 dits in "mopping up" operations.
 In many areas of the country the TG does not exert effective judicial or police con-
 trol. This government weakness means that those responsible are seldom, if ever,
 held legally accountable for human rights abuses. There were dozens of instances
 of violent clashes in the countryside between local military elements of political par-
 ties within and outside the TG. In a number of instances, rival groups repeatedly
 engaged in politically or ethnically motivated violence and killings.
 In the campaign for the June local and regional elections, the Islamic Front for
 the Liberation of Oromia was linked to numerous, gruesome, politically motivated
 killings. Credible allegations spread in May and June that the Oromo People's
 Democratic Organization, an affiliate of the EPRDF, was responsible for the mas-
 sacre of Amhara nationals in Arbagugu and in other towns in May and June.
 In Eritrea there were no reports of extrajudicial killings. The provisional govern-
 ment of Eritrea has made no official accounting for a number of deaths that resulted
 during the 1991 forced repatriation of Ethiopians, following the establishment of the
 provisional government.
 b. Disappearance.-Since the TG came to power in Addis Ababa, its constituent
 political parties have traded charges and countercharges regarding politically moti-
 vated violence in the countryside as well as in the cities, including some disappear-
 ances of opposition party workers and supporters, some still missing at the end of
 1992.
 In Eritrea there have been reports of kidnapings of members of political opposi-
 tion parties, including reports that those in opposition to the EPLF have been kid-
 naped in neighboring countries and returned to Eritrea with the tacit approval of
 the provisional government in Asmara. By year's end, those reported kidnaped had
 not reappeared. It is assumed that they are in detention. While the provisional gov-
 ernment denies involvement in such disappearances, it has not made sustained ef-
 forts to investigate the allegations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The National Charter of the TG abjures torture and other cruel inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment or punishment. There were many credible allegations that de-
 
 
 86
 tainees were beaten while in detention, but there were no allegations of systematic
 torture in Ethiopian jails, prisons, or detention centers since the TG came to power.
 Three weeks after captu    Addis Ababa in May 1991, the interim EPRDF admin-
 istration announced that all detained Mengistu Government officials would be treat-
 ed humanely. In 1992 this continued to be the general pattern with a few excep-
 tions, such as at one detention center where 20 hunger strikers (security personnel
 in the former government) were detained in isolation from the rest of the detainees
 in unsanitary, cramped quarters.
 In Eritrea physical conditions in the prisons are acceptable. Families may send
 food to detainees twice a week and visit once a week. There were no allegations of
 torture in jails, prisons, or detention centers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The TG's National Charter approved in
 July 1991 prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as exile. However, at the
 endof the year there was still no criminal code or related laws implementing this
 general concept, and steps to develop a professional police force began only in April.
 In the absence of a police force and strict guidelines for military and quasi-security
 forces, arrests were often arbitrary, and investigations were the responsibility of
 many different groups, namely, EPRDF administrators, local peace and stability
 committees, complaints review committees, and personnel from the newly reconsti-
 tuted Ministries of Internal Affairs and Defense. In addition, individuals, particu-
 larly Oromos, were detained because of political affiliation, often without due proc-
 ess of law. The TG set up "complaints review and grievance clearing committees"
 to investigate allegations of corruption or abuse of power. These committees inter-
 fered in business and government operations and detained managers. As of late
 1992, they were slowly being disbanded. In the circumstances, citizens had little
 protection under the law from arbitrary arrest and detention.
 When the new authorities seized power in late May 1991, they detained thou-
 sands of civilians without charge, the largest number being senior Mengistu govern-
 ment or WPE officials arrested solely because of the positions they held. Also de-
 tained were former Mengistu government officials accused of corruption or involve-
 ment in violations of humanitarian law. While thousands-indeed the vast major-
 ity-were subsequently released, additional suspects continued to be arrested on the
 recommendation of local peace and stability committees throughout the country,
 many in connection with the OLF-EPRDF conflict.
 At the end of the year, the TG authorities acknowledged having over 2,000
 Mengistu government civilians under detention who had still not been charged-
 theyhad been held for almost 20 months. TG officials said this was a consequence
 of abolishing the Mengistu police force (formally charged with investigations) and
 susending Mentu public prosecutors and judges. In August the TG announced
 its intention of establishing an independent judiciary and in mid-September named
 a special prosecutor to head up investigations and prosecution of the Mengistu and
 WPE officials. In August the Ministry of Internal Affairs dispathed a seven-man
 team to begin investigations of detainees at a former military training site outside
 Addis Abba. As of the end of 1992, over 800 investigative interviews of former
 WPE and security   pruonnel were completed at a former milita  training site out-
 side Addis Abaa. I addition, the TG stated that all Menitu Gvernment detain-
 ees must be charged by February 1993 or they can be released on writs of habeas
 corpus. The federal judiciary for trials of Mengistu-era officials had not been nomi-
 nated by the end of 1992.
 The number of OLF fighters held in detention at the end of 1992 was approxi-
 mately 19,000 including several hundred women and children. No charges were filed
 against them. The TG was still conducting reeducation classes in the detention cen-
 ters. At the end of 1992, there were no reports of any releases from the detention
 centers, although one of the detention centers was closed and the detainees moved
 to other centers. There were indications that some civilians were included in the
 camps' detainee population. The TG has not announced how long these detainees
 will be held or how their caibs will be handled.
 The TG authorized the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit
 all former Mengistu Government and WPE civilians remaining in detention. The
 ICRC and foreign diplomats were also allowed to visit OLF military elements in de-
 tention following the OLF's June withdrawal from the TG and the voluntary depar-
 ture of its armed wing from encampment sites. There were credible reports that ci-
 vilians associated with the OLF were among the Oromo detainees.
 In June, 22 members of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, an opposition
 group, were arrested by Sudanese security forces in Sudan and were moved to
 northern Ethiopia without prior consultation with the TG. At the end of 1992, four
 of them remained in detention and the others had been released.
 
 
 87
 The previsional government of Eritrea published civil- and criminal codes in 1991
 which contain a full range of judicial safegards including habeas corpus and a 48-
 hour limit on detention without cha   with the possiblity of no more than two
 14-day extensions with judicial authorization). In general, these safeguards are in
 place and working. There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests or searches with-
 out warrants.
 When the EPLF came to power in Eritrea in May 1991, it repatriated all but 900
 of the 85,000 Mengistu military personnel captured (see Section L.a.). In July it re-
 patriated the remaining 900 to Ethiopia for possible trial. The provisional govern-
 ment admits to detaining a "small number" of Eritreans, somewhat over 200, ac-
 cused of collaboration and war crimes. None has been formally charged. According
 to the provisional government, some who were allegedly members of the former gov-
 ernment with no evidence against dhem, will not be charged, but held in prison for
 a total of 2 years and then released. The provisional government does not grant
 ICRC access to these detainees.
 As a government policy, neither the TG nor provisional government of Eritrea
 uses exile as a means of political control. The EPLF has, however, expelled thou-
 sands of Ethiopians. The TG announced that all citizens remaining in exile were
 free to return, and many did so in 1992.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--Since the new judiciary system was not yet in
 place during 1992, the TG in general continued to use the criminal court system
 from the former government, with the Supreme Court at thea pex. Proceedings were
 open, accused were permitted to present witnesses on their behalf, and decisions
 were rendered by a judge. In August the Council of Representatives issued aprocla-
 mation on judicial independence which had not been tested in practice by yearYs end.
 No trials of former Mengistu government officials had begun.
 In Eritrea the provisional government established a separate judiciary in Septem-
 ber 1991 and appointed a new Secretary of Justice in 1992. Local elders tried many
 lesser offenses. A three-judge bench tried more serious crimes, with arrest warrants
 required, evidence taken under oath, and rules of evidence observed. Convicted per-
 sons have the right of appeal to the Appeals Court, which also consists of three
 judges, and finally to the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1991 National Charter of the TG prohibits arbitrary interference in privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence. Nevertheless, complaints remained common about intru-
 sions into private premises by the EPRDF troops (who provided public security in
 urban areas in the absence of a police force). Local peace and stability committees
 often appeared to act arbitrarily in authorizing searches and arrests by the EPRDF.
 There were many reports, too, of EPRDF troops entering the homes of supporters
 of opposition political organizations and arresting people on the spot, both in cities
 and in rural areas. Unlicensed possession of firearms continued to be a problem for
 the TG, and private and commercial vehicles, as well as private homes were subject
 to random searches for weapons.
 The practice of former WPE members reporting to their local committee every
 Sunday was suspended in August, and their right to travel abroad was restored.
 The National Charter explicitly condemned the Mengistu Government's policies of
 resettlement and villagization and promised priority attention to the rehabilitation
 of persons who were uprooted under those programs and wished to return to their
 home areas. Some 60 to 75 percent of those resettled under Mengistu had returned
 to their home areas with some financial assistance from the TG. In May the TG also
 instituted a program to provide some financial assistance to those choosing to re-
 main in the areas in which they had resettled.
 In Eritrea the authorities must obtain a warrant before undertaking searches of
 home or other private property; this requirement was respected in practice.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Lw level conflicts between EPRDF and OLF forces continued throughout
 the year. These clashes resulted in a number of civilian casualties. For example, in
 April at Bedeno the OLF was responsible for a massacre of over 100 innocent civil-
 ians whose bodies were found with their arms bound behind their backs. They were
 allegedly thrown over a cliff.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-People spoke freely in 1992. While the media
 were freer than at any time in Ethiopia's history, they were still muted in their
 treatment of the TG. In 1992 the TG passed a press law which forbade official cen-
 sorship, but the law may in fact promote self-censorship because of imprecise defini-
 tions of what constitutes a threat to national security. The authorities may pros-
 Pcute iournalists and other writers for articles deemed to threaten national security.
 
 
 88
 In addition, very few political parties have been granted free access to the official
 media, consisting_of SIT broadcast and most print media. Five political parties-three
 in the coalition Government, two in opposition-have their own newspapers, which
 offered some critical comment on the TG.
 In Eritrea the EPLF put informal pressure-much of it by appeals to Eritrean pa-
 triotism and unity--on persons to make their opinions conform to provisional gov-
 ernment positions. Nevertheless, the provisional government publicly guaranteed
 the rights of all groups and individuals to air views on the April 1993 referendum,
 including those in opposition. In 1992 the provisional government allowed in state-
 controlled newspapers and on radio broadcasts only limited opposition views to be
 heard, but in part this was due to practical limitations such as a newsprint shortage
 which affected all publications, including official provisional government publica-
 tions. Views on the economy and criticism of the bureaucracy were expressed freely.
 The provisional government abolished the Mengistu government's censorship
 boards in 1991, and it imposed no formal restrictions on independent newspapers.
 While small newspapers printed by Eritrean religious organizations circulated freely
 in 1992, no newspapers of opposition parties and movements had appeared by year's
 end.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The July 1991 National Char-
 ter endorsed peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and the right to engage in
 unrestricted political activity, including the right to organize political parties. In
 1992 popular demonstrations became routine around the country, including those
 protesting TG policies.
 The TG proclamation of August 15, 1991, requires organizers to inform authori-
 ties of public political meetings 48 hours in advance. The authorities also hold the
 organizers responsible to ensure these meetings take place peacefully. However in
 July the High Court acquitted the three executives of the United Democratic Na-
 tionals Party, who were arrested in November 1991. They had been charged with
 responsibility for the outcome of their rally which turned violent.
 There was a proliferation of political organizations (over 130) from a wide spec-
 tram of political opinion. The TG dissolved Mengstu's WPE and its various append-
 ages after the EPRDF came to power, and the Council of Representatives continued
 to ban WPE members from any political activity, including voting in the June re-
 gional elections.
 The TG also abolished the Mengistu government's Revolutionary Ethiopian Wom-
 en's Association, an appendage of the banned WPE, and detained the former chair-
 woman without charge. She remained in detention at year's end, and no successor
 organization had been formed.
 While not formally banned, certain expatriate Ethiopian groups which reject the
 principles of the National Charter also were still not free to organize in the country,
 although certain elements of such groups began returning to thiopia. These groups
 included the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the Ethiopian People's Revo-
 lutionary Party, and the All-Ethiopian Socialist Movement.
 In Ertrea there were no restrictions on the freedom of assembly, and no permits
 for meetings were required. EPLF provisional government leaders declared that all
 individuals and groups were entitled to express their views freely in the period lead-
 ing up to the April 1993 referendum on independence. No opposition has formally
 emerged.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The National Charter guarantees freedom of religion, in-
 cluding the right of conversion, and since coming to power TG officials have advo-
 cated complete freedom of worship. A new patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox
 Church was elected in July following the TG's removal of his predecessor in 1991.
 At year's end, the TG had not restored the Orthodox Church to its preeminent, pre-
 1974 "state church" status and, instead, treated the Church as a powerful force sep-
 arate from the Government. The TG continued to allow the reopening of Protestant
 churches closed by the Mengistu government and returned their property.
 The Ethiopian Orthodox Church protested the expansion of Protestant missions
 into areas o its interests. 6n several occasions in 1992, these protests turned vio-
 lent and led to the burning of churches and homes of Protestant parishioners. In
 addition, the construction of mosques in traditional Christian enclaves led to violent
 clashes often resulting in deaths in some northern cities. The attempted construc-
 tion of a mosque in the traditionally Orthodox Christian area of Axum led to violent
 clashes which resulted in some deaths and severe damage. Ultimately, no mosque
 was constructed in Axum.
 Most members of Ethiopia's small Jewish population, known as Beta Yisrael or
 "Falasha" (a word meaning outsider), have left their traditional homelands in
 Gondar and Tigray and enigrated to Israel. At year's end, under 1,000 Jews were
 believed to remain in Ethiopia, and emigration processing was continuing for these
 
 
 89
 few. There were no reports of discrimination against Jews or 'Falash Mora' (Jewish
 converts to Christianity also seeking to emigrate to Israel) by the TG.
 In Eritrea the provisional government announced that it would be returning
 church property confiscated by the Mengistu government. It also said that religious
 schools would be allowed to open although this policy had not been implemented
 as of late December. All major religions are represented in the provisional govern-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pahriation.-The National Charter recognizes freedom of movement, including the
 right to foreign travel and emigration. Ostensibly to dampen ethnic tensions, some
 local government officials continued to discourage migration between regions and
 encouraged Ethiopians "resettled" under the draconian policies of the former govern.
 ment to remain in or to return to those areas. Emigration of individual Jews contin-
 ued throughout the year. The TG, continuing the practice of the former government,
 required exit visas from all people, Ethiopian and foreign, wishing to leave the coun-
 try.
 tDespite continuing economic and security problems in much of the southern half
 of the country, Ethiopia maintained its open-door policy for refugees as well as re-
 turning Ethiopians.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other inter-
 national and nongovernmental organizations have been permitted to continue their
 activities in eight refugeetreturnee camps, located primarily in the east near the So-
 mali border. Conditions are harsh in these camps, exacerbated by banditry and civil
 strife which interrupted supply rations during the early part of the year. Approxi-
 mately 500,000 people were estimated to be in need of food in the Ogaden region
 at the end of 1992.
 Similar problems of intertribal warfare (combined with culmination of a severe
 drought across the southernmost part of the country) created a new stream of ap-
 proximately 80,000 Ethiopian refugees most of whom migrated to Kenya. The 7G
 made efforts to bring reconciliation to the tribal disputes, and, working with human-
 itarian organizations, assistance to the region. After a November peace treaty be-
 tween Oromo subclans, some 50,000 Ethiopian refugees in Kenya registered to repa-
 triate. In the same manner, some 10,000 ethnic Uduks received assistance from the
 TG when they returned from Sudan. Despite the continued presence of the Adminis-
 tration for Refugee Affairs which actually runs the camps, refugee protection re-
 mained problematic throughout the year.
 In Eritrea the provisional government no longer pursued its policy of forced repa-
 triation to Ethiopia of certain categories of Ethiopians. Since May 1991, approxi-
 mately 50,000 Christian and Muslim refugees returned to Eritrea spontaneously but
 were screened by the provisional government. Most non-Eritreans, particularly eth-
 nic Amharas, left Eritrea or were expelled if they had close contacts with the
 Mengistu regime. Many ethnic Tigrayans remained, as did some non-Eritreans mar-
 ried to Eritreans. The approximately 50,000 non-Eritreans in and around Asmara
 are engaged mainly in trade. A few thousand non-Eritreans also live in the other
 major towns in Eritrea. Although the provisional government did organize some re-
 patriation from Sudan, it maintained that it needed over $200 million to repatriate
 Eritrean refugees from Sudan. The provisional government's demands were seen as
 unrealistic by the international community, and relations with the UNHCR deterio-
 rated throughout the year, with the UNHCR reducing its staff. Observers believe
 the provisional government prefers to maintain a restrictive policy towards return-
 ing refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Ethiopians were not free to change their government peacefully in 1992. However
 the collapse of Mengistu's authoritarian rule in 1991 brought to power new political
 forces proclaiming their intention of creating a democratic multiparty system, with
 national elections scheduled to be held by January 1994.
 In July 1991, the multiparty TG was established by means of a national con-
 ference held in Addis Ababa. It was charged with administering the country until
 a new constitution could be promulgated and national elections held. In 1992 the
 TG named members of the Constitutional Commission, and the Commission began
 the process of preparing a new constitution. By the end of 1992, it had not yet held
 public hearings to allow for citizen contributions. According to the TG timetable, the
 Constitution will be ratified or rejected by a special body (elected solely for that pur-
 pose) in 1993.
 The EPRDF, which is actually a coalition of four parties, dominates the TG, and
 its members hold the key positions of President. Prime Minister. and Ministers of
 
 
 90
 Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Internal Affairs. The TG quasi-legislative Council of
 Representatives comprises 74 members representing 30 political and ethnic groups.
 Prior to its departure from the TG in June (see below), the OLF had functioned as
 a form of loyal     tion within the Council of Representatives. After the 12 OLF
 representatives de parted, the EPRDF more easily dominated Council debate.
 On June 21, the T held elections for regional governments in 10 of the 14 newly
 estabished regions of Ethiopia (logistical diffiulties prevented the elections from
 being held in 4 of the regions at that time). In many areas, particularly in the
 southern and western regions of the country, the elections were marked by serious
 irregularities and allegations of fraud and intimidation, principally by the EPRDF
 but also by the OLF. The final results of the elections showed the EPRDF or its
 allies winning 96 percent of the seats. Shortly before the day of the vote, the OLF
 withdrew from the elections, claiming that it was being prevented from contesting
 in a free and fair manner. Smaller political parties from central and southern Ethio-
 pia also refused to recognize the elections.
 The withdrawal of the OLF from the election and from the Government plus the
 subsequent fighting, seriously threatened the prospects for democratic reform. The
 withdrawal increased the probability of de facto one-party rule under the EPRDF.
 In Eritrea the EPLF administers a one-party provisional government tasked with
 governing the country until an internationally supervised referendum on Eritrea's
 political future, scheduled for April 1993, can be held. The provisional government
 officially requested U.N. assistance in holding the Eritrean referendum. It an-
 nounced that once it attains its goal of de jure independence, it will convene a con-
 stituent assembly to draft a new constitution based on a multiparty political system
 and then will hold democratic elections.
 Since Eritrea's general population is about evenly divided between Christians and
 Muslims, the EPO? emphasized religious balance in leadership positions: five of the
 nine members of the EPLF politburo are Muslim, and Muslims hold half of the port-
 folios in the provisional government cabinet.
 Women are not well represented in leadership positions of the TG, the EPRDF,
 or any of the other newly formed parties, but the TG has made efforts to change
 this. Three of the 20 Cabinet members are women. The situation is similar in Eri-
 trea (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Ethiopia's first independent human rights monitoring body, the Ethiopian Human
 Rights onci, was established in October 1991, as were two other private groups
 formed to further political dialog and promote respect for democratic rights: the
 Ethiopian Congress for Democracy and Forum-84. All three groups were allowed to
 operate freely and at times voiced vociferous opposition to TG policies without reper-
 cussions.
 Reportedly, there is an independent human rights monitoring group in Eritrea,
 but it has not published any findings.
 The TG was generally willing to discuss human rights concerns with diplomatic
 missions and international and nongovernmental organizations. Amnesty Inter-
 national and Africa Watch both visited Ethiopia early in the year to investigate al-
 leged violations of human rights. They were received by government officials and
 granted access to political prisoners.
 In Eritrea the provisional government's relations with the ICRC and UNHCR de-
 teriorated in 1992. ICRC requests to visit prisoners have not been well received by
 the provisional government. The UNHCR recalled its senior representative in
 Asmara in September. Also, in September a visiting European delegation was given
 less than full cooperation when asking questions abut human rights, refugee repa-
 triation, and other sensitive issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Ethiopia comprises more than 80 different ethnic groups. At various times in the
 past, one or another of these groups has predominated in the political, cultural, and
 economic life of the country. Some ethnic groups, such as Oromos and other south-
 erners, claim that they have been dominated or hundreds of years by highlanders.
 The declared aim of the TG is topromote the interests of all ethnic groups through
 a federal system of government. For example, elementary schools will offer instruc-
 tion in the language of the local population; secondary education is in English. In
 Eritrea there were no reports of discrimination against individuals on the basis of
 ethnicity.
 Despite protections afforded them in the 1987 constitution women are accorded
 low social status in many traditional cultures in the country. IJ.N. studies document
 
 
 91
 that women are subject to marriage at very young ages, do more than their share
 of hard and time-consuming labor, have unequal modern sector employment oppor-
 tunities, and receive below average wages in urban areas. However, women in
 urban areas eruoy certain economic and legal rights equal to men; they may inherit,
 sell or buyprperty, vote and run for office, and engage freely in commerce.
 The TGhas established a national committee on traditional practices considered
 harmful to women. These include: female genital mutilation (circumcision); tattooing
 (a possible means of transmitting the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome virus);
 insertion of lip and ear plates among some southwestern tribes nutritional taboos;
 and child marriage. According to an independent exper in the feld, the percentage
 of Ethiopian women who have undergone genital mutilation may be as high as 90
 percent. Domestic violence remains common. While women have recourse to police
 protection and official prosecution in cases of domestic violence, societal norms and
 fear of loss of the social security that marriage provides inhibit many women from
 seeking legal redress. The TG established a new desk of women's rights in the Min-
 istry of Justice and in the Prime Minister's office, but at year's end it was too soon
 to know what, if anything, it would be able to do to ameliorate these problems.
 In Eritrea the participation of women in the armed struggle in which one-third
 of the EPLF fighters were women has worked to change this to a si0ficant degree.
 In the provisional government, four women hold Cabinet-level positions, and a num-
 ber of women hold mid-level positions. The provisional government codified a broad
 range of rights for Eritrean women in 1991, including guarantees of equal edu-
 cational opportunity, land ownership, equal pay for equal work, legal sanctions
 against domestic violence, and other economic and legal rights. The campaign
 against dangerous traditional practices, including female circumcision, nutritional
 taboos and traditional birth methods, was taken up by the National Union of Eri-
 trean Women. As in Ethiopia, it was too soon to know what specific improvements
 might result.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the National Charter, workers are free to
 form and join unions of their own choosing without authorization from the TG, and
 this right was exercised extensively. Over 300 trade unions were established at the
 plant level. Under the Mengistu government, the nonagricultural labor force was
 forced to organize under a single trade union federation, the Ethiopian Trade Union
 (ETU), under the control of the WPE. Agultural workers were similarly organized
 in the Ethiopian Peasant's Association (PA) also under WPE control. The TG dis-
 solved the ETU and EPA at the national level. Elections for new union officials were
 held at the factory and national levels in industrial unions during 1991 and 1992.
 Former members of the WPE and security personnel were barred from voting and
 holding office. Similar elections were held in those peasant associations surviving
 the transition. No new national bodies for workers and peasants have been estab-
 lished, but planning was under way in the TG for convening a national labor con-
 gress to discuss the issue. In the interim, the existing 1975 Labor Code remains in
 effect.
 In the absence of official guidelines, TG officials have been tolerant of strikes and
 protests in the workplace. Management frequently accuses the TG of being over-
 indulgent with labor demands, notably in strikes by former employees of Ethiopian
 Airlines and employees of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia.
 Under the 1975 Code, the right of affiliation with international organizations was
 reserved to the ETU. Despite its dissolution, the ETU technically remains an affili-
 ate of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Upon taking power in Eritrea, the provisional government similarly dissolved the
 ETU and EPA on the ground that they were instruments of political control for the
 Mengistu government. In September 1991, the provisional government promulgated
 a Labor Code giving workers the right to form and join unions of their choice and
 the right to strike. However, Eritrean courts are given the power to order workers
 to delay strikes for 50 days pending negotiations. Should negotiations fail, unions
 are required to give the provisional government a further 7-day notice before any
 strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1975 Labor Code in-
 cludes the right to organize and bargain collectively. Under the 1975 Code, wages
 are to be set in negotiations between unions and management. If no agreement can
 be reached, a disputes committee is formed, composed of two representatives each
 from the union and management and a committee chairman (usually a member of
 management). If an agreement still cannot be found the dispute goes to the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs for settlement. The TG's Prime Minister announced
 in 1991 that all collective baruainins agreements neaotiated bv the Meneistu ov-
 
 
 ernment, frozen since 1990, were valid. There were no known instances of collective
 bargaining in 1992. The 1975 Labor Code prohibits discrimination against union
 members by management, but union members claim that occasionally employers
 favor their own ethnic group.
 In Eritrea the provisional government's Labor Code explicitly recognizes collective
 bargaining and outlined an 11-step program for reaching agreements.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Slavery was officially abolished in
 Ethiopia in 1942 but legal codes do not address the issue of forced or compulsory
 labor. The TG's Charter proscribes slavery and involuntary servitude. Local TG offi-
 cials outside of Addis Ababa continue to call on residents to "volunteer" for uncom-
 pensated community work projects, such as road building and emergency road re-
 pair. Industries were operating at less than half capacity, in those state-owned fac-
 tories still functioning, workers are still sometimes compelled by factory managers
 to "volunteer" labor in order to tneet quotas which may result in cash bonuses.
 In Eritrea forced and compulsory labor was barred under the provisional govern-
 ment's Labor Code. The provisional government acknowledges that Eritrean "fight-
 ers" are often urged to 'volunteer' their services to rebuild the country's severely
 damaged infrastructure for minimal compensation, although food and housing are
 supplied.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the 1975 Labor Code, con-
 tract employment of children under the age of 14 is prohibited. The TG appears to
 respect this restriction in factories, shops, and among domestic workers. The Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs was active in enforcing these provisions in state-
 owned enterprises. Nevertheless, increasing numbers of young children are fre-
 quently seen peddling and begging on city streets or working in fields in rural areas
 throughout the year.
 In Eritrea the EPLF's Labor Code raised the minimum age of employment to 18.
 The provisional government also made education compulsory through age 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The statutory minimum wage, unchanged
 since 1974, remains low and woefully insufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living for an urban worker and family. On the other hand, only unskilled day labor-
 ers usually receive such a low wage. In addition, although not required by law, most
 employers provide some fringe benefits most commonly transportation, which raise
 the effective minimum wage. Low-paid workers often supplement their income by
 holding multiple *obs, and with help from the extended family. The 1975 Labor Code
 establishes an 8-hour workday and a 48-hour workweek. The maximum legal work-
 week appears to be respected in practice, with the exception of previously noted un-
 compensated *volunteer" labor to meet factory quotas. The 1975 Code also empowers
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs "to determine protective devices" and to ad-
 vise on the health and safety of workers. Compensation for occupational injuries and
 disabilities is mandatory. The Ministry's effectiveness in enforcing health and safety
 standards is severely hampered by lack of resources.
 In Eritrea the provisional government's Labor Code retains many provisions of
 the 1975 Code including: a very low minimum wage, an 8-hour workday and 48-
 hour workweek, and stipulations that the health and safety of workers be safe-
 guarded. The degree of enforcement, however, is low, as "fighters" are strongly
 urged to "volunteer" services. Resources for enforcing health and safety standards
 are severely limited.
