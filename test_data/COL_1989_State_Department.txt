 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy. Two
 parties, the Liberals and the Social Conservatives, have
 dominated national politics since-the mid-19th century, but
 smaller parties are usually represented in Congress, state
 assemblies, city councils, and among popularly elected
 mayors. The Constitution provides for independent legislative
 and judicial.branches of government. In practice, the courts
 and, to a lesser extent, the Congress provide significant
 checks on presidential power.
 Internal security is the primary responsibility of the
 Ministry of Defense, which includes the National Police. The
 Ministry is responsible directly to the President and operates
 under civilian control. The Department of Administrative
 Security (DAS), roughly equivalent to the U.S. Federal Bureau
 of Investigation, reports directly to the President.
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which private enterprise plays
 the dominant role. The coffee industry, which accounts for
 some 30 percent of the country's legal export earnings, is
 essentially in the private sector, as are most entities
 engaged in manufacturing, agriculture, and the service
 sector. There is also a large informal economy. State
 enterprises control domestic participation in the oil and coal
 industries and play an important role in the electrical and
 telecommunication utilities.
 Despite Colombia's strong democratic traditions, it has
 suffered from social unrest and an extraordinary level of
 violence for most of the past 40 years. The main causes of
 the violence and the concomitant human rights abuses are
 political extremists of both the left and the right, and the
 enormously wealthy narcotics traffickers, with the latter
 being the single largest cause in 1989. ,There have also been
 significant abuses by individual members of the army and
 police in responding to violence from these other sources.
 The extreme left includes several armed guerrilla groups which
 use terrorism and narcotics trafficking to achieve their goal
 of violently overthrowing the democratic Government. The
 extreme right is composed of disparate elements, including a
 number of "self-defense" groups which were originally formed
 by rural landowners to defend against guerrilla attacks and
 which have degenerated into vigilante squads that assassinate,
 torture, and massacre people believed to have links with
 leftist political figures or the guerrillas. In areas where
 traffickers are powerful, these groups are often allied with
 the traffickers. The traffickers control enormous illicit
 enterprises which utilize extreme violence in attempts to bend
 the Colombian political and judicial systems to their own
 purposes. The major traffickers have achieved virtual
 immunity from prosecution by threatening, kidnaping, and
 murdering judges, government officials, political leaders, and
 their families. The relationships among the traffickers and
 between traffickers and rightwing elements or guerrillas are
 complex.
 To cope with the persistently high level of violence and human
 rights violations, the Government has resorted to
 extraordinary measures. In August President Barco launched a
 major offensive against the traffickers and issued
 constitutionally authorized state of siege decrees providing
 for confiscation of the property of persons involved in
 narcotics trafficking and the reimplementation of extradition
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 for fugitive traffickers. The President's September 1988
 peace plan led to a reduction in guerrilla-related violence in
 1989. Colombia's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), announced a unilateral
 cease-fire in February, and the number of its attacks declined
 although it has not abandoned violence. The M-19 guerrilla
 group signed a peace accord with the Government in October,
 and tentative talks were begun with the FARC and another
 guerrilla organization.
 Human rights abuses violate government policy, and there is no
 evidence that the Government or senior military officers have
 ordered such acts; many take place in remote regions without
 the knowledge of central authorities. Although much more
 needs to be done, the Government in 1989 continued its efforts
 to improve the human rights record of its own security
 forces. It provided training on human rights to about 300
 military personnel and, with the assistance of Canada, it
 trained all village ombudsmen in human rights. Nevertheless,
 soldiers and policemen have also been involved in
 assassinations and massacres of suspected leftists, and
 rural-based local military commanders have sometimes assisted
 rightwing groups, seeing them as allies against the
 guerrillas. Some of these same groups have been linked to
 narcotraffickers. In past years little was done to stop such
 actions. Military officers have attempted repeatedly to
 obstruct prosecution of military personnel who committed human
 rights abuses. In early 1989, however, the armed forces' high
 command and the police began to dismiss officers and enlisted
 men believed to be involved in human rights violations, and
 some of these cases were subsequently being prosecuted in the
 civilian court system. None of these trials had been
 concluded by year's end, and violations continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect fbr the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Colombia has one of the highest murder rates in the world, and
 its police and judicial systems lack the resources to
 investigate and prosecute most of these crimes, making it
 difficult to separate political and nonpolitical murders.
 Nevertheless, the figure of 324 confirmed political killings
 in Colombia from January through August 1989 provided by the
 Bogota-based group Centro de Investigaciones y Educacion
 popular (CINEP)--a Jesuit-affiliated social research
 institution which follows the human rights situation--seems
 reasonably accurate. This is a significant drop from the 706
 political killings recorded by CINEP during the same period in
 1988. CINEP labeled an additional 1,069 murders as possible
 political killings, compared to 1,145 during the same period
 in 1988. These numbers exclude deaths in combat.
 Narcotics-related killings increased some 140 percent during
 this period for a total of 129.
 A number of spectacular assassinations in 1989 highlighted the
 vulnerability of even figures at the highest levels of
 Colombian politics and government. In the 90-day period
 beginning May 30, killers hired by the narcotics traffickers
 murdered a governor, a state police chief, two judges, and, on
 August 18, Senator Luis Carlos Galan, a leading presidential
 candidate. The head of the DAS narrowly escaped death on May
 
 
 512
 COLOMBIA
 30 when a car bomb exploded in a crowded Bogota street as his
 motorcade passed by during the morning rush hour. Seven
 persons died in the explosion. On October 17, Hector Jimenez
 Rodriguez, a judge of the Medellin Superior Court who, as a
 member of the Court's penal chamber, heard narcotics cases,
 was shot to death outside his home. On December 5, Criminal
 Court Judge Bernardo Jaramillo Oribe was also assassinated in
 Medellin. The self-described "Extraditables" (top
 traffickers) publicly admitted many such killings.
 Narcotics traffickers did not restrict their killings to
 prominent public figures. They, and groups of bandits and
 rightwing extremists backed by them, slaughtered hundreds of
 peasants, minor politicians, and low-level government
 officials, either because they were suspected of leftist or
 proguerrilla sympathies or because they had attempted to
 interfere with the criminal activities of the traffickers. On
 January 18, near the town of La Rochela, gunmen massacred a
 team of 12 judicial officials investigating a previous
 massacre of townspeople which likely had been ordered by
 traffickers. Narcotics interests are also believed to be
 responsible for the many deaths resulting from the bombing of
 an Avianca aircraft on November 27 and certainly were
 responsible for an explosion at DAS headquarters in Bogota on
 December 6, which killed 64 and injured over 700
 Labor suffers a disproportionately high rate of violence.
 Many affiliates of the largest workers' confederation, the
 Unitary Workers Central (CUT), are Communist controlled, and
 some, like the banana workers unions in Uraba, are controlled
 by guerrilla groups. Many of their members have been killed
 by presumed rightwing elements. Trade union leaders of the
 Democratic Labor Confederation (CTDC) have been threatened and
 assassinated by guerrillas trying to weaken and intimidate
 moderate unions. Two gunmen on November 21 murdered Nel Dario
 Gomez, the secretary of his CUT-affiliated union, who worked
 in Monteria, Cordoba department, distributing land reform
 parcels to rural members. Forty-seven union activists were
 killed during the first 8 months of 1989, according to CINEP
 figures; it is not clear that all these murders were
 politically motivated, however.
 At least 45 persons associated with the Union Patriotica (UP)
 party, which was established as the political arm of the FARC,
 were killed during the first 8 months of 1989, according to
 CINEP statistics. Most of these murders were probably by
 extreme rightists, although a few of the assassinated
 politicians may have been the victims of common crime. Many
 UP figures assert that the Government is either unwilling or
 unable to afford them adequate protection. The most notable
 UP casualty was seiior party official Jose Antequera, who was
 assassinated on March 3 in Bogota's airport. On November 21,
 Gustova Castro, a UP activist, was assassinated by
 unidentified gunmen near Ibaque, Tolima department.
 Political'killings also affected the ruling Liberal and the
 opposition Social Conservative Parties. At least 14 elected
 officials and a much larger number of party activists of these
 two major groups had been assassinated as of mid-September.
 Few of these'killings have been solved, and the specific
 motivations for many of these incidents of political violence
 are often unknown.
 Although the gunmen responsible for some of these crimes have
 been apprehended, those who ordered them almost invariably
 
 
 513
 COLOMBIA
 escape prosecution. Even if a major figure were to be
 captured, a conviction would be difficult; the judicial system
 has been paralyzed by intimidation.
 The leftist insurgent groups are responsible for a large
 number of killings which occur outside the scope of armed
 conflict. The guerrillas frequently kill those who refuse to
 submit to guerrilla extortion, those who attempt to leave the
 guerrilla organizations, and persons who are'perceived to have
 helped the Government. In several January incidents, the FARC
 murdered three fishermen, four cement workers, and five
 peasants, apparently because they did not support the
 guerrillas or were suspected of being army informers. The
 following month, another guerrilla group, the Popular
 Liberation Army (EPL), killed six peasants who had refused to
 pay a guerrilla-imposed "tax."
 The Government took action in 1989 against the military and
 police officials who participated in the 1988 massacre of
 residents of the village of Segovia, Antioquia. Two army
 officers and one police official were dismissed from service
 and along with three civilians were turned over to a civilian
 court to be prosecuted for terrorism. In addition, three more
 army officers and two police officials were under
 investigation by the Attorney General's office for human
 rights abuses.
 In October Amnesty International (AI) issued a report on
 Colombia in which it charged that government security forces
 were directly responsible for thousands of extrajudicial
 killings and also suggested that the traffickers and their
 allies operate with government support. Clearly, Colombia,
 whose democratic system is under assault by narcotics
 traffickers and political extremists, has a serious human
 rights problem. Al's assertion that the high command of the
 security forces has adopted a deliberate policy of gross human
 rights violations was rejected as inaccurate and misleading by
 Colombians with a wide variety of political views as well as
 by local and international human rights groups. Two other
 reports issued in late 1989, one by the Lawyers Committee for
 Human Rights and the other by the Washington Office on Latin
 America (WOLA), assert that persons connected to the
 Government or security forces have links to violence. An
 Americas Watch (AW) report of April 1989 was "certain" that
 the Government was not behind any of the killings but was not
 prepared to absolve the military or political leadership. In
 any case, AW held the Government indirectly responsible for
 the murders by failing to fully protect all its citizens.
 In 1989 senior military and police officials initiated a
 campaign to expel officers believed to be cooperating with
 armed rightwing groups. While never condoning such
 cooperation, in previous years the highest officials of the
 Government had not taken effective steps to recognize and stop
 it. In the first 8 months of 1989, however, 84 officers were
 dismissed from the armed forces, according to Attorney General
 Alfonso Gomez Mendez, most of them for association with
 narcotics traffickers, cooperation with armed rightist groups,
 and violations of human rights. In one of the most publicized
 cases, the army high command removed and retired Lieutenant
 Colonel Luis Bohorquez, the top military commander in the
 Magdalena Medio region, who was accused of supporting the
 armed rightwing groups which dominate the region. In April
 the Government announced the formation of a 1,000-man special
 police force devoted exclusively to combating rightist
 
 
 514
 COLOMIA
 groups. Despite the Government's efforts, however, there
 likely are members of the police and army who continue to
 participate in extrajudicial killings. Punishment for human
 rights abuses within the military.judicial system seldom
 extends beyond dismissal from the service. In 1989 the
 Supreme Court upheld the right of civilian courts to try
 military personnel in a wide variety of situations. In the
 immediate future, however, there appears to be little prospect
 of effective action by judges of the weak civilian judicial
 system.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of disappearances in Colombia appears to have
 declined in 1989. CINEP reported 101 disappearances in the
 first 8 months of 1989 compared to 192 during the same period
 in 1988. Most disappearances take place in areas of active
 guerrilla insurgency as a result of forced recruitment by the
 guerrillas, flight from such recruitment, executions by either
 the guerrillas or rightist groups, or common kidnaping.
 Despite efforts by the security forces to dismiss human rights
 abusers over the past year, there continue to be reports that
 individual military and police personnel are also involved in
 specific disappearances.
 Kidnapings by guerrillas and common criminals remained
 prevalent in 1989. The kidnapings of wealthy persons for
 ransom is an important source of revenue for the guerrillas,
 but they also kidnap for political reasons, sometimes
 executing their victims after mock trials. Reliable
 statistics on kidnaping are unavailable because friends and
 relatives ..often fear that the victim's life will be endangered
 if his situatiQL its publicized or reported to the authorities.
 The AttorqeyGeneral's Human Rights Office was created by
 President Barco in 1986 specifically-to investigate
 allegations of disappearances in which government officials
 are suspected to have been involved. The Human Rights Office
 receives complaints from the public, and the Attorney General
 has the power .to impose administrative sanctions and recommend
 dismissal of officials involved in violations of the law,
 although he cannot bring criminal charges. This is the
 responsibility of a judge acting on a complaint which may be
 filed by the person against whom the crime was committed'or
 anyone else who has knowledge )f the offense.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. There are reliable reports,
 however, that police frequently beat and torture
 detainees--whether arrested as- common criminals or as
 suspected guerrillas--especially during the first 24 hours of
 detention. The rightwing groups which operate in the
 countryside frequently torture their victims cruelly before
 killing them, as evidenced by the condition in which their
 bodies have been found. The guerrillas also mistreat their
 captives. In one early May incident, a guerrilla group
 tortured and subsequently executed two-soldiers captured in
 the department of Meta. In October the National Liberation
 Army (ELN) kidnaped and tortured the Bishop of Arauca before
 murdering him.
 
 
 515
 COLOMBIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The right to challenge the legality of detention is generally
 respected. A person may be arrested if apprehended in the act
 of committing a crime or if an appropriate order of capture
 has been issued by a judge. The police must inform a judge of
 a person's detention within 24 hours. Within a specified
 time, depending on the circumstances of the case, the judge
 must decide if there is enough evidence to pursue the case.
 If there is, he issues an order of detention under which bail
 is possible, or an order of preventive detention, under which
 the person is incarcerated until trial. However, there are
 occasional instances of arbitrary arrest or detention for
 political purposes, and the police sometimes arrest persons of
 modest economic means on charges of dubious validity in an
 effort to extort money for their release.
 In response to the wave of apparently narcotics-inspired
 assassinations which culminated in the August murder of
 presidential candidate Galan, President Barco issued a state
 of siege decree which provides for 7 days of incommunicado
 detention of those suspected of narcotics trafficking.
 Detainees must then be turned over to the civilian judicial
 system. In practice, those arrested under the decree are
 often turned over to a civilian judge or released before the 7
 days have expired.
 There are no legal provisions for exile. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. The rights of public trial and due
 process are provided for in the Constitution. Accused persons
 have the right to representation by counsel; if they do not
 have an attorney, the court will appoint one. However, due to
 an overburdened judicial system and a traditional reluctance
 to grant bail, most prisoners incarcerated for common crimes
 never come to trial but are simply released after serving the
 minimum sentence applicable to the crimes alleged. Only about
 25 percent of prison inmates have been convicted of crimes.
 Bail is prohibited during the first 210 days of detention for
 suspected terrorists arrested under an antiterrorist decree of
 1988.
 When a narcotics-related case does come to trial, the judicial
 system is usually so intimidated that it is unable to conduct
 it impartially. Many magistrates, judges, jurors, and
 attorneys have been threatened with death, killed, or had
 family members killed because they were investigating or
 prosecuting narcotics traffickers or their associates.
 Following the Galan assassination, the President issued a
 decree abolishing the easily intimidated three-person juries
 which had been used in murder cases.
 A system of specialized judges to investigate and prosecute
 narcotics cases has existed since 1987. A system of public
 order judges was created in August 1987 to investigate and
 prosecute public order crimes (terrorism, torture, personal
 injury, narcotics trafficker violence, etc.). In January 1988,
 the Government established the Tribunal of Public Order as a
 court of appeal for the above crimes. These officials
 expedite legal proceedings because they both investigate and
 prosecute. (Normal legal procedures in Colombia involve
 
 
 516
 COLOMBIA
 separate judges for the investigation and prosecution stages
 of the judicial process.)
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A judicial order is constitutionally required for authorities
 to enter a private home, except in the case of hot pursuit.
 While Colombian human rights organizations report widespread
 violations of this requirement in the more remote regions of
 the country, government forces in urban areas generally
 respect the sanctity of the home and the right of privacy.
 Persons from rural areas frequently claim that they have been
 forced to leave their farms by military counterinsurgency
 operations, guerrilla conscription and confiscation, and by
 armed thugs hired by narcotics traffickers and local
 landowners.
 Telephone taps and mail intercepts are normally allowed only
 under close judicial supervision. Nevertheless, a 1988 state
 of siege decree allows police to use such measures without
 judicial authorization if it is deemed necessary to facilitate
 an investigation into terrorism or related activities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally assured rights are respected, and the
 press often vigorously criticizes the Government and its
 leaders. The privately owned print media are under no
 governmental restraints and publish a wide variety of
 political views, including public calls for the President's
 resignation. Television frequencies and transmission
 facilities are controlled by the State, which leases time to
 private television production companies and imposes some
 guidelines relating to the coverage of terrorism. Under a
 1988 stateof siege decree, television and radio programs are
 prohibited from identifying witnesses to terrorist acts and
 from broadpasting live transmissions of ongoing terrorist
 incidents; During a crisis, the Government reserves the right
 to prohibit the broadcast media from covering certain news
 events. This right was not exercised in'1989; All
 significant candidates for public office generally receive
 unbiased coverage on television and radio newscasts.
 The most serious threat to freedom of expression comes from
 the narcotics traffickers, who both threaten and kill
 journalists and others who publicly support extradition or
 strong antinarcotics measures. In September a truck bomb
 severely damaged the offices of the Bogota daily El
 Espectador, which has long been a vigorous critic of the
 traffickers. Later that month Guillermo Gomez Murillo, a
 correspondent for the newspaper, was assassinated in his
 home. Gomez was one of more than a dozen journalists who have
 been assassinated in recent years, most of them by trafficker-
 affiliated rightwing extremists. In mid-October a car bomb
 almost completely destroyed the offices of La Vanguardia
 Liberal, the principal newspaper of the eastern city of
 Bucaramanga. Narcotics interests have threatened advertisers
 in the press as another part of their effort to halt the press
 campaign against them.
 
 
 517
 COLOMBIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly is respected. Public meetings
 and demonstrations are normally held without interference.
 Under the state of siege, prior permission is required for
 demonstrations and is usually granted, except when the
 Government believes there is a clear and imminent danger to
 public order. Following the August murder of Luis Carlos
 Galan, which was followed by a wave of terrorist actions
 directed by the narcotics traffickers, the mayor of Bogota
 temporarily banned all demonstrations in the city.
 Colombians have the constitutional right to form political
 parties, trade associations, unions: clubs, or groups of any
 type which do not advocate violence. Theoretically, the
 Government can deny legal status to newly formed groups, but
 this power is almost never used. Any organization is free to
 associate with international bodies in its field.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. According
 to official statistics, 217 different religious sects are
 registered in Colombia. Although the predominant position of
 the Catholic Church is established by a treaty between the
 Government and the Vatican, and the overwhelming majority of
 Colombians are Catholic, no legal discrimination exists
 against any religious group, and there is little or no
 religious discrimination in practice.
 The Government permits proselytizing among Indians as long as
 the Indians welcome the missionaries and are not induced to
 adapt changes that inhibit their survival on traditional
 lands. The Government requires all missionary groups (both
 Catholic and non-Catholic) to keep it informed of their
 activities and expects them to respond to guidance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel domestically and.to leave and
 return to Colombia. In traveling through areas where
 operations against rural guerrillas are under way, civilians
 require safe conduct passes from the military; guerrillas
 reportedly use a similar means to restrict travel in areas
 under their control. There are no restrictions on
 emigration. Colombians who have sought and been granted
 diplomatic asylum in foreign embassies have always been
 allowed to depart the country. Expatriates can, by law,
 repatriate. Colombia uses accepted United Nations standards
 to determine the status of refugee and asylum seekers and does
 not turn away those who qualify.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a democratic system of government, and elections
 have been conducted fairly and openly for the past 30 years.
 Persons are enfranchised by the Constitution at age 18.
 Public employees are forbidden by law to participate in
 political campaigns but, with the exception of military
 personnel, may vote.
 
 
 518
 COLOMBXA
 Colombian politics are dominated by the Liberal and the Social
 Conservative Parties. Both include elements with widely
 divergent poliftical views. All parties operate freely without
 government interference. The UP, which participated in
 national elections for the first time in 1986, is the third
 strongest party. It received 3.1 percent of the total vote
 cast in city council elections in 1986, and less than 1
 percent of the vote in the 1988 mayoral elections. Elections
 will be held in 1990 for the presidency, the Congress, and
 local offices.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Colombia is sensitive to its human rights image abroad and
 cooperates with investigations by international and
 nongovernmental human rights groups based "broad. AW's
 factfinding missions which visited Colombia in December 1988
 and in February 1989 were able to interview a number of
 government officials. WOLA also cited interviews with
 government and party officials in its 1989 report on
 Colombia.
 The two most respected human rights organizations within
 Colombia are CINEP and the Permanent Committee for the Defense
 of Human Rights. Information compiled by these groups has
 been used extensively by International organizations such as
 AI, AW, and WOLA. CINEP, the Permanent Committee,
 universities, and other groups regularly sponsor conferences
 to analyze violence in Colombia. Colombia is an active
 participant in international and regional human rights bodies.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Sociai Status
 The law provides women equal civil and property rights. Women
 comprise just over 25 percent of the country's economically
 active population. Women are legally entitled to remuneration
 equal to that of their male counterparts, a law generally
 respected more by the Government than private industry. Forty
 percent of the university population is female.
 Violence directed against women appears to be disturbingly
 common, especially in the countryside and in lower income
 strata in'the cities, but a lack of reliable statistical data
 makes it impossible to gauge its true extent. Victims of
 domestic violence such as wife beating often are reluctant to
 file reports or to press charges, thus leading to the
 liklihood that such abuse is significantly underreported.
 There is a code of family law to protect the interests of
 mothers and children, and women who are the victims of
 domestic violence can bring charges brought against their
 assailants.' The Government does not condone such abuse.
 Domestic violence, however, is not treated as a serious crime
 in Colombia.
 There are womens' associations active in Colombia which work
 for the rights of women in the workplace, in the home, and in
 public life. Through the Colombian Institute of Family
 Welfare, the Government provides education in domestic
 relations and personal behavior, primarily to families in
 lower income levels. Churches are also active in this
 domestic education of their parishioners. Because the
 
 
 519
 COLOMBIA
 judicial system in Colombia is weak, the police and courts are
 no more effective in enforcing laws relating to the treatment
 of women than they are in enforcing other parts of the law.
 Several million black Colombians comprise the country's
 largest racial minority. They enjoy the full legal rights of
 all other citizens.
 Colombian Indians also legally enjoy all the rights and
 privileges of full citizenship. Nevertheless, Indian rights
 groups protest that they suffer a variety of abuses, and they
 are seeking to'promote improvements through community action,
 public education, and legal aid. Their most common complaint
 continues to be that Indians are forced off contested land by
 armed thugs hired by landowners. When the Indians retaliate,
 the landowners call on local police and military forces for
 protection. There were no incidents of this nature reported
 in 1989. In an effort to protect Indian culture, the
 Government in 1989 designated certain land in southern
 Colombia for the use of the Indians.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize labor unions and to strike is
 recognized specifically in the Constitution, although public
 service unions may not strike. Law 26 of 1976 affirms the
 autonomy of labor organizations to produce their own statutes
 and rules-, to elect trade union officials, and to administer
 their own activities. Law 26 also prohibits the dissolution
 or suppression of trade unions by administrative fiat and
 allows the almost automatic granting of official status to
 labor organizations which have the requisite number of members.
 While the right to strike is guaranteed, the steps required
 before a legal strike may be called include direct
 negotiations, followed by conciliation, and only then may the
 problem advance to the stage of-either a strike or arbitration
 by the Ministry of Labor. Arbitration is compulsory in the
 public service sector and for official employees who legally
 do not have the right to strike. In the private sector the
 Minister of Labor may intervene in a dispute at the stage of
 conciliation and when it affects the national economy.
 Almost half of the country's 1.2 million unionized workers
 belong to the CUT, formed in 1986. Although the CUT is not
 officially a member of the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions, it is heavily influenced by an
 element that has retained strong links to the international
 Communist labor movement. The rest of Colombia's organized
 workers belong to three long established confederations, two
 of which are affiliated with the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions and the third with the World
 Confederation of Labor.
 In its 1989 report, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) expressed deep concern at the
 violent situation in Colombia which creates hardship for the
 population and prevents the exercise of union activities. The
 COE also cited a number of provisions in the labor law which
 it said were incompatible with Convention 87 because they
 allowed the Government to interfere with the internal
 administration of unions and inhibit the right of unions to
 further and defend the interests of their members. The COE
 
 
 520
 COLOM IA
 asked the Government to make the necessary modifications in
 the legislation.
 At its May-June 1989 session, the'ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) expressed its deep concern over the large
 number of trade union leaders and members who had been
 murdered or had disappeared since 1986. The Committee recalled
 that it had considered allegations concerning the murder or
 disappearance of more than 200 trade unionists at its November
 1988 meeting and that, since that time, complaints of an
 additional 46 murders and one disappearance'of trade unionists
 had been received. The CFA noted important government
 measures to fight the death squads and hired assassins but
 regretted that there was no indication of steps taken to
 strengthen the judiciary.
 The CFA's May-June 1989 session also considered a complaint
 filed by several Colombian and international trade union
 organizations alleging that the Government violated Convention
 87 on Freedom of Association by arresting four trade union
 leaders and 80 workers, searching and closing the trade union
 premises, and arbitrarily discharging 50 trade union officials
 and 350 workers because they had engaged in a strike for wage
 increases. The Government contended that its actions were
 based on common crimes and sabotage committed by the workers
 and their union, which resulted in the cutoff of electric
 power throughout the country for a 24-hour period. The
 Government alleged further that the actions of the union had a
 political motivation relating to a coup attempt which occurred
 at the same time. The CFA asked the Government to provide
 information on the charges against the detained unionists and
 workers, and to reply to the allegations of arbitrary
 discharge.
 The observations of the two committees were the subject of a
 "special paragraph" in the 1989 report of the ILO Conference
 Committee on the Application of Conventions and
 Recommendatibns (CACR), urging the Government to take the
 necessary steps to bring its law and practice into line with
 ILO Conventions and guarantee the safety of trade unionists.
 (See Section l.a. for a discussion of violence directed
 against unions.).
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize labor unions and to engage in
 collective bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. At
 the present time, unions have been successful in organizing
 only the largest firms and the public services, which include
 from 9 to 11 percent of Colombia's economically active
 population.
 In the private sector, workers have the right to bargain
 collectively; however, because of high unemployment, they have
 limited bargaining power. The use of strikebreakers is
 prohibited by law, and generous severance benefits tend to
 discourage management from firing union militants. However,
 this provision, like other provisions of labor law, is
 effectively ignored by small and medium-size enterprises.
 Colombian labor law is applied uniformly throughout the
 country, including the export processing zones.

 The COE report cited above also urged the Government to take
 steps to provide public employees the right to bargain
 collectively, and to protect them from antiunion
 discrimination in accordance with Convention 98 on Organizing
 and Collective Bargaining.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited, and the
 prohibition is respected in practice. The COE report, cited
 above, requested the Government to bring certain provisions of
 law relating to prison labor into conformance with ILO
 Convention 29 on Forced Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly where such employment might
 interfere with schooling. This provision is respected in
 larger enterprises and major cities. However, the extensive
 informal economy is effectively outside government control.
 Approximately 2.5 million children under 15 years of age work
 in the informal sector for low pay under poor conditions with
 little protection from the labor code, according to a 1987
 study.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government annually sets a national minimum wage which
 serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 minimum wage (about $100 per month as of December 1989) is
 insufficient to maintain an acceptable standard of living.
 One report noted that 60 percent of the work force is paid the
 minimum wage or less.
 The labor code regulates the hours of labor and other work
 conditions. While the a-hour day is standard in larger
 companies, the workweek for most Colombians generally exceeds
 40 hours. A standard week of five 8-hour days remains an
 important long-term goal of Colombian trade unions.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively
 regulated, including the use of protective clothing and
 ventilation, first aid and fire fighting equipment at the job
 site, sanitary facilities and potable water, and compensation
 for injuries. These regulations apply to the larger
 agricultural enterprises as well as industry and mining.
 However, exemptions for small companies, the frequent use of
 workers as subcontractors rather than employees, and general
 enforcement difficulties leave large numbers of workers
 outside the protection of the law. The Government is
 endeavoring to improve regulatory enforcement, and improved
 working conditions are a priority goal of trade unions.
 Violations appear to be more frequent among the newer, smaller
 industries. More than half of all the violators are
 concentrated in the commercial sector and in the restaurant
 and hotel industries, while almost one-fourth are in the
 manufacturing sector. Labor regulations most frequently
 violated by management are mandatory affiliation of workers to
 the Social Security Institute, observance of minimum salary
 levels, timely payment of salaries, and maintenance of
 hygienic conditions and occupational safety standards.
