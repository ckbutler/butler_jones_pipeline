 MOROCCO
 Morocco has existed as a political entity for 1200 years.
 Since 1666 the Alaouite dynasty has reigned in the coun-
 try. The Treaty of Fez (1912) made Morocco a protectorate
 of France with Spain assuming a protectorate position over
 the extreme northern and extreme southern portions. The
 Kingdom of Morocco recovered its political independence
 from France on March 2, 1956 following the 1955 return
 from exile of Mohammed V (venerated as the father of
 Moroccan independence) and Crown Prince Hassan. Hassan II
 succeeded his father to the throne in 1961. Spanish
 zones (except for two small enclaves) were restored in-
 crementally to Morocco in 1956, 1958 and 1969.
 Moroccan society traditionally has been fragmented polit-
 ically. Just after the removal of political controls
 of the protectorate at independence, the country experi-
 enced rural rebellions, and later border clashes with
 neighboring states, two attempted military coups, the
 promulgation of several constitutions, and the invoca-
 tion of temporary "states of exception" in response to
 civil unrest by workers and students in several major
 cities.
 The present ruler, Hassan II, exercises his considerable
 authority through his influence with elective legislative
 bodies at the city, provincial, and national levels. The
 country's democratic institutions and the civil rights
 of the people are guaranteed by a written constitution.
 The constitution, in detailing the responsibilities of
 the King as head of state, strongly reinforces his role
 as both. secular and religious leader of Morocco. The
 constitution also provides for a Prime Minister appointed
 by the-King to be head of government; a unicameral parlia-
 ment (264 members elected for six-year terms, two-thirds
 ,of whom are directly-elected by community councils and
 by business, labor and farmer groups); and a judicial
 structure of which the highest court is the supreme court
 of appeals whose judges are appointed by the King. Civil
 and criminal codes combine both French and the traditional
 Islamic law.
 Moroccans enjoy considerable civil liberties and freedom
 of expression. The constitution forbids the establish-
 ment of a single party system. In addition to nine
 political parties including two key oppositionist parties
 (the socialist and the communist), three trade union
 federations, two student unions, nine daily newspapers
 of varying political persuasions and two human rights
 organizations connected to political parties operate in
 the country. The Moroccan parliament and local municipal
 councils, since assuming their functions in 1976 and
 1977, have strengthened democratic institutions in.the
 country.
 Some infringements against the rights of the person still
 occur, but there have been improvements in 1980. Decrees
 issued in 1980 ordered the reinstatement of teachers and
 
 
 1050
 health workers fired following strikes in the spring of
 1979. Some 140 prisoners convicted in absentia or served
 with warrants for politically-related crimes (high treason,
 personal criticism of the royal family, incitement to
 riot) were pardoned in 1980.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In early 1980, the Belgian Association of Jurists charged
 that Moroccan prisoners were beaten and tortured. In-
 quiries have developed no subsequent corroboration of
 those charges. While there continue to be reports of
 instances of harsh interrogation methods by local law
 enforcement officials, the Moroccan government does not
 appear to condone such methods.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Following a hunger strike in one Moroccan prison, an effort
 was made by Moroccan and European human rights groups to
 bring prison conditions and the state of health of some
 detainees to the attention of the government. As a result
 the Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in 1980 ordered
 an investigation of sanitary and health conditions at
 several Moroccan prisons. The results of that investiga-
 tion were not revealed, but -in March and
 July of 1980 the government announced the release of about
 140 prisoners. In December, 1980, 50 wives, mothers or
 sisters of Moroccan political prisoners peacefully oc-
 cupied the United Nations Agencies headquarters building
 in Rabat to protest the continuing incarceration of ap-
 proximately 150 political prisoners. The opposition
 socialist (USFP) newspaper criticized unhealthful con-
 ditions in the prison and published a petition allegedly
 signed by 104 prisoners complaining of unsanitary condi-
 tions.
 No instances of discrimination among prisoners based on
 sex, race, nationality, or class have been reported.
 Since 1973-74, when approximately thirty persons were
 tried and executed for high treason and crimes against
 the state, no persons have been executed for crimes
 against the state.
 The government does not use exile as a punishment, but
 some political dissidents are in self-imposed exile. In
 August, 1980, clemency was accorded to twenty-four
 Moroccans residing outside the country who were under
 sentence or for whom warrants had been issued.
 c. Disappearances
 While pretrial detention is common there is no hard evi-
 dence that Moroccans are abducted or secretly arrested
 or that clandestine detention is used by officials of
 the government. The socialist opposition party (USFP)
 claims that some members have disappeared while in prison
 but there is no confirmation of these allegations.
 
 
 1051
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 10 of the Moroccan constitution provides that
 no one shall be arrested, detained,. or punished other
 than as prescribed under the law and in accordance with
 its provisions.
 As many as several thousand Moroccans were arrested or
 detained during the period after the coup attempts of
 1971 or 1972 and disturbances of early 1973. Most of
 those accused in the coup attempts were military person-
 nel tried in military tribunals. Many of those civilians
 implicated in the 1973 disturbances were held for pro-
 longed periods without trial. The number of detainees
 was reduced by trials, releases and amnesties between
 1974 and 1980.
 In July 1980 the government announcedzthe release of 90
 prisoners who had been convicted of politically related
 offenses. Most of them were affiliated with the socialist
 opposition party (USFP), although about sixteen were in-
 dividuals with no close connection to legal political
 parties who had been convicted for undermining the secur-
 ity of the state. Most prominent of those released was
 Abdellatif Laabi, poet and founder of the political-
 literary magazine Souffles, who had been arrested
 in an earlier allege-d treason plot. His release had been
 championed by European and Moroccan civil rights groups.
 There are probably no more than 150 remaining prisoners
 in Morocco who have been convicted of illegal political
 activity. Estimates centered around 300 political
 prisoners at the end of 1979. Most of the present pris-
 oners were convicted in the Casablanca trials of 1977.
 Few, if any, of the political prisoners now held in
 Morocco were arrested or imprisoned arbitrarily.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Some persons engaged in or directly implicated in the
 1971 and 1972 attempts against the life of the King were
 summarily executed. An undetermined number of military
 personnel accused in these incidents are still held in-
 communicado. Most were tried in military courts; there
 may be a small number of others-who have never been tried.
 With the principal exception of. some of the 100 young
 persons arrested-in June 1977 (most have been released),
 -persons detained for anti-government activities since
 1972 have been tried in open court.
 Following the last large-scale trial for politically-
 related offenses in Casablanca in-late 1976-early 1977,
 an Amnesty International report alleged that the
 defendants' right to testify, to be informed of the
 charges against them, and to receive unimpeded represen-
 tation by counsel were not respected.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Article 10 provides that the home is inviolable and that
 there shall be no search or investigation without due
 process. There have been some press reports of intru-
 sions into private homes by officials without observance
 
 
 1052
 of legal safeguards protecting individuals from arbitrary
 searches.
 2. Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Although per capita GNP in 1979 was $808 it is estimated
 that 40 percent of the population--mostly in the rural
 areas--have a yearly per capita income of less than $250.
 Moroccan society shares many of the problems of poorer
 third world countries: high infant mortality rate, lack
 of access to potable water, high illiteracy and stagnat-
 ing agricultural production. Morocco, however, has taken
 major steps in developing its health and educational
 infrastructures. Access to these services has increased
 steadily, with impressive advances in the participation
 rate of females at all levels of the educational system.
 Morocco has effected these improvements while pursuing an
 austerity program since 1978 to address serious prob-
 lems of foreign exchange and balance of payments.
 Morocco's rapidly increasing import bills for energy and
 foodstuffs over the past few years, intermittent crop
 failures, widely fluctuating phosphate prices, and the
 substantial cost of the war in the western Sahara, have
 created a serious drain on the country's foreign re-
 serves and forced cutbacks in government spending for
 social services. The 1980 national budget allocated
 twenty-eight percent of funds to education, 5 percent to
 health, 4 percent to agricultural projects and 1 percent
 to housing and urban development.
 While six years of public education are compulsory, in-
 adequate educational facilities that cannot keep up with
 Morocco's rapidly expanding youthful population (birth-
 rate--3 percent), have contributed to Morocco's difficul-
 ties in raising its literacy rate of 24 percent for men
 and 15 percent for women. New educational facilities have
 been constructed throughout the country, particularly
 in rural areas, to keep pace with growing enrollment
 levels. These have included vocational and training
 schools. A large number of public health centers are
 also under construction, again largely in the rural areas,
 primarily to benefit the poor. At the end of 1979,
 Morocco had almost 23,000 hospital beds, or one for every
 780 people. Both educational and health care programs
 are hampered by inadequate professional and administra-
 tive staffing which has not kept pace with the rapid
 growth in physical plant, but the government is training
 medical workers.
 While nearly 40 percent of the population lives in the
 urban areas, the nation is still largely rural with an
 agriculture-based economy (approximately 50 percent of
 the population is engaged in agricultural production;
 25 percent in comerce and industry; and 15 percent in
 services).
 There are growing social tensions resulting from three
 years of economic stagnation, mounting unemployment
 (about 20 percent), continuing rural underemployment,
 and inflation, officially estimated at 11 percent.
 
 
 1053
 
 Increasing emphasis on the development of labor-intensive
 small and medium-size business enterprises and social
 services is stressed in the upcoming five year plan as
 well as priority for the health, education and agricul-
 tural sectors.
 Females now make up 36 percent of all primary school students,
 37 -percent of those in secondary schools, and almost 25 per-
 cent of university enrollees. School enrollment of women and
 girls in rural areas, however, remains the exception rather
 than the rule. Although the government has made educational
 facilities available to a large percentage of rural females,
 traditional attitudes of their families often prevent their
 enrollment and attendance in school. Employment opportuni-
 ties for women are expanding in the modern sector and the
 government takes particular interest in training its own
 female workers. Sex discrimination is prohibited by law,
 but traditional attitudes toward women result in some inform-
 al bias.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed under the 1972
 constitution. Internal press censorship was lifted in 1977.
 Criticism in the media of the administration of social con-
 ditions and of all institutions--with the notable exception
 of the monarchy and Islam--is comonplace. While advance
 censorship is forbidden, distribution of publications con-
 taining articles critical of the monarchy occasionally has
 been prevented. While foreign journals are available, they
 are upon occasion withheld from distribution, and the govern-
 ment apparently has prevented or inhibited the distribution
 of certain critical academic or artistic works.
 The government encourages.a wide range of political groups.
 All major parties are represented in the legislature and in
 municipal councils. A large number of parties participated
 actively in two nationa referenda which were held in May
 1980. In November 1978, a six.year old ban on the National
 Student Union was lifted and that organization has been
 active in 1980. Professional, academic and scientific
 groups are numerous. -Two human rights groups, the-Moroccan
 Leaguefor the Defense of Human Rights and the Association
 for Human Rights in Morocco, exist and function with
 effectiveness.
 The constitution guarantees to citizens the right to join
 trade unions and the right to strike. The Moroccan Confed-
 eration of Trade Unions (UMT) is one of the oldest labor
 movements in Africa. Several union confederations are
 involved in labor activities in competition with the URT,
 the largest of which (the Confederation Democratique du
 Travail) is allied with the chief socialist opposition
 party (USFP).
 Strike activity in 1980 as in 1979 has been conducted--with
 a few notable exceptions-rwithout government interference.
 Strikes appear to have declined in number and duration; this
 decrease may be temporary, reflecting a depressed economy
 and a more wary attitude toward possible governmental inter-
 vention such as that which followed an April 1979 strike.
 In April 1979, government authorities acted under a 1958
 decree to declare public sector strikes illegal and against
 the national interest, and fired over 1,000 teachers and
 
 
 1054
 health workers. Some 230 were tried and given sentences
 averaging one to two months. Their union, the Democratic
 Confederation of Labor (CDT), protested both in Morocco
 and to the International Labor Organization (ILO) that
 the 1958 degree was invalid since it antedated the present
 constitution which is silent about strike rights of civil
 servants. The constitution stipulates that "an organic
 law shall specify when and how the right to strike can be
 exercised" but no law has ever been passed defining a
 legal strike. The CDT protest to the ILO proved ineffec-
 tual as the latter organization determined that Morocco's
 internal court system was competent to judge the issue.
 In July 1980 the government announced the lifting of sanc-
 tions against teachers and health workers who had been
 dismissed from their jobs following the April 1979 strikes.
 Article 6 of the constitution states that "Islam is the
 religion of the state. The state guarantees the indivi-
 dual's freedom of worship." Islam does not differentiate
 between church and state. Political, social, economic,
 and religious affairs are intertwined. While religious
 freedom for other faiths is guaranteed, proselytizing is
 not permitted. The King, who claims descent from the
 Prophet Mohammed, is the supreme representative of Islam
 in Morocco. He is also responsible for safeguarding the
 rights and liberties of all citizens including religious
 minorities. While Morocco has a unique history of
 religious toleration, large numbers of its Jewish community
 left the country after the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli
 wars; about'20,000 remain in the country and the govern-
 ment has urged others to return. Relations with Christian
 churches are cordial. The government has encouraged them
 to operate schools, hospitals and other institutions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco,
 except in those areas of the western Sahara administered
 by Morocco and contested by Polisario forces. Travel
 outside Morocco is generally permitted, although persons
 without means or influence within the government encounter
 delays in obtaining passports. Also, difficulty in ob-
 taining foreign currency imposes practical limitations on
 potential travellers. There are no restrictions on emigra-
 tion except in rare cases.
 Morocco has encouraged voluntary repatriation in two
 important instances. The government has encouraged members
 of the Moroccan Jewish community, who departed the country
 following the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars, to return to
 Morocco. Those members of the Sahraoui population who
 migrated to Algeria following the 1975 Spanish evacuation
 of the western Sahara also have been encouraged to return.
 Morocco has a policy of accepting refugees, although no
 refugee communities exist. The United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees assists individuals who seek
 political asylum.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is considerable opportunity for participation in
 Morocco's political life, given the diverse and well-
 organized groups now functioning. Suffrage is universal.
 Five major political parties plus smaller groups are
 represented in the national legislature: the dominant
 
 
 1055
 government coalition parties (the majority Independents, the
 Nationalist Istiqlal and the Berber "Mouvement Populaire")
 and two opposition parties (the socialist USFP and a communist
 party). The opposition vigorously criticizes the government's
 policies in the parliament, in local municipal councils and in
 its press. The May 30 national referendum, which extended by
 two years the term of the legislature from four to six years,
 was hotly contested. Opposition parties hope to gain seats in
 the national elections that may be scheduled for 1981. The
 measure passed by 96 percent and the opposition parties
 questioned the accuracy of the vote count.
 The role of women in the predominantly rural and traditional
 environment remains restricted by custom. No woman has ever
 held a cabinet position in Morocco, and there are no women in
 the 264 member parliament. The constitution reaffirms the
 equality of all Moroccans before the law and provides that
 "men and women enjoy equal political rights" and that "every
 citizen, male and female, has the right to vote...." While
 exposure to education has opened some doors to Moroccan women,
 this partial liberalization is limited for the most part to
 urban areas.
 The parliament has passed legislation protecting women's
 rights after divorce.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International and other civil and human rights groups
 have been permitted to send observers to trials, and these
 observers have been received by officials of the Moroccan
 government.
 Two human rights associations, the League for the Defense
 of Human Rights (affiliated with the Istiqlal party) and
 the Association for Human Rights (affiliated with Socialist
 USFP) now operate in Morocco. Due to their efforts, in 1980
 the government undertook an investigation of health and sani-
 tary conditions at several Moroccan prisons. It subsequently
 released some 140 prisoners. The two organizations consistently
 have condemned all forms of human rights violations and have
 called for observance of rights defined in the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights.
 Western Sahara
 No conclusive information on the human rights situation in the
 Saharan provinces is available. Foreign visitors to the region
 have reported no incidents of maltreatment of the populace by
 Moroccan authorities, although an international human rights
 organization has received reports alleging preventive detention
 practiced both by Moroccan forces and by the Polisario.
 Under Moroccan administrative control since the Madrid Accords
 of 1975 and Mauritania's renunciation of its claims and with-
 drawal from the southern third of the territory in 1979, the
 Moroccan government has integrated the former Spanish Sahara
 into the political life of the country. Municipal, provincial
 and parliamentary elections were held in the area controlled
 
 
 1056
 by Morocco in 1977, when polling took place throughout the
 country. The native Moroccan Saharans elected to the ten
 seats in parliament allotted to the four Saharan provinces
 include the present Secretary of State for Saharan affairs
 and two vice presidents of parliament.
 Three of the royally-appointed provincial governors are
 Sahara natives. In consultation with the elected municipal
 and provincial councils, the four governors administer
 their Saharan provinces in the same manner as Morocco's
 36 provinces are governed. The Moroccan armed forces, a
 sizeable portion of which are stationed near Saharan towns
 play no role in the civil administration. The governors'
 principal functions are accelerated development of economic
 infrastructure and delivery of social services in the Sahara,
 a high priority of the Moroccan government.
 Morocco has agreed to cooperate with the efforts of the
 Organization of African Unity (OAU) peacefully to resolve
 the Sahara conflict on the basis of a ceasefire in place
 and referendum; the modalities remain to be determined.
 Neither the OAU recommendations nor the UN resolutions
 calling for direct negotiations between Morocco and all
 interested parties including the Polisario have yet been
 implemented.
