 KUWAIT
 Amirs, or princes, from the Al-Sabah family have ruled Kuwait in consultation
 with prominent community figures for over 200 years. The Constitution, adopted in
 1962 shortly after independence, provides for an elected National Assembly. It also
 permits the Amir to suspend its articles during periods of martial law. The Amir
 twice suspended constitutional provisions, from 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992,
 and ruled extraconstitutionaily during these periods. Kuwait was occupied by Iraq
 
 
 1730
 from August 1990 to February 1991, when Iraqi forces were expelled by an inter-
 national coalition. The National Assembly resumed functioning after the 1992 elec-
 tions. National Assembly elections were held again in 1996. The Constitution and
 law provide for a degree of judicial independence, but the Amir appoints all judges,
 and renewal of many judicial appointments is subject to government approval.
 The Ministry of Interior supervises the security apparatus, including the Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two agencies
 that, in addition to the regular police, investigate internal security-related offenses.
 Members of the security forces committed a number of human rights abuses.
 Richly endowed with oil, in 1998 the country's estimated per capita gross domestic
 product (GDP) was approximately $14,846. The decline in per capita GDP from pre-
 vious years reflects a significant increase in resident foreign workers and lower oil
 revenues. Due to high oil revenues in 1997, Kuwait recorded a $1.3 billion budget
 surplus for fiscal year 1996-97, but returned to deficit in 1997-98 due to lower
 world oil prices. Budget sources projected a $5-6 billion deficit for the current fiscal
 year. Despite its emphasis on an open market,-the Government continues to domi-
 nate the local economy through direct expenditures and government-owned compa-
 nies and equities. The Government has initiated a program of disposing of its hold-
 ings of stock in private companies. According to government statistics, 92 percent
 of the indigenous work force is employed by the Government. Foreigners constitute
 98 percent of the private sector work force.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, although problems
 remain in certain areas. Citizens cannot change their head of state. Although under
 the Constitution the National Assembly must approve the Amirs choice of Crown
 Prince (i.e., the future Amir), this authority is limited; if the National Assembly re-
 jects the Amir's nominee, the Amir then submits three names from which the as-
 sembly must choose the new Crown Prince.
 The Government bans formal political parties, and women do not have the right
 to vote or seek election to the National Assembly. Some police and members of the
 security forces abuse detainees during interrogation. Although prisoners remain
 overcrowded, cooperation between executive and legislative leaders led to improve-
 ments in prison conditions with the closure in June of the Talha deportation center
 and the resolution of numerous deportation cases by allowing deportees to legalize
 their status. The Amir commuted the sentences of 286 prisoners on February 25,
 Kuwait's national day, including those of six Jordanians, three Iraqis and one Ku-
 waiti who were held as state security prisoners. On April 27, the Amir pardoned
 and returned to Jordan an additional 13 Jordanian state security prisoners. The
 Government infringes on citizens' privacy rights in some areas. Security forces occa-
 sionally monitor the activities of individuals and their communications. Males must
 obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women. The Government re-
 stricts freedom of assembly and association. Journalists practice self-censorship, and
 the Government uses informal censorship. The Government places some limits on
 freedom of religion and movement. The Government prevents the return to Kuwait
 of stateless persons who have strong ties to the country. Deportation orders may be
 issued by administrative order, and between 110 and 120 persons are estimated to
 be held in detention facilities, some for up to 1 to 2 years. Discrimination and vio-
 lence against women are problems. The Government restricts some worker rights.
 Domestic servants are not protected by the Labor Law, and unskilled foreign work-
 ers suffer from the lack of a minimum wage in the private sector and from failure
 to enforce the Labor Law.
 Although the Government has not found a solution to the human rights problems
 of the approximately 114,000 stateless persons residing in Kuwait known as the
 "bidoon," it continued to naturalize small batches of the bidoon population via piece-
 meal legislation that -addressed the marginal aspects of the bidoon problem, but left
 the core complexities untouched.
 Executive and legislative leaders continued to strengthen political institutions by
 resolving major disagreements within the framework of the Constitution and with-
 out recourse to extrajudicial measures.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were no developments in the investigations into the extra-judicial killings
 that occurred during the chaotic period after Kuwait's liberation in February 1991.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 1731
 There have been no developments since 1994 in the cases of disappearance that
 occurred following Kuwait's liberation in 1991.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Iraqi authori-
 ties have not yet accounted for 598 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait, including 8
 women, who were taken prisoner during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. The Govern-
 ment of Iraq has refused to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687,
 which stipulates the release of the detainees. Iraq denies that it holds Kuwaiti de-
 tainees.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture; however, there continue to be credible reports
 that some police and members of the security forces abuse detainees during interro-
 gation. Reported abuses include blindfolding, verbal threats, stepping on toes, and
 slaps and blows. Police and security forces were more likely to inflict such abuse
 on non-Kuwaitis, particularly citizens of other non-Gulf Arab nations and Asians,
 than on citizens.
 The Government states that it investigates all allegations of abuse and that it has
 punished at least some of the offenders. However, the Government does not make
 public either the findings of its investigations or what, if any, punishments are im-
 posed. This omission creates a climate of impunity, which diminishes deterrence
 against abuse.
 Defendants have the right to present evidence in court that they have been mis-
 treated during interrogation. However, the courts frequently dismiss abuse com-
 plaints because defendants are unable to substantiate their complaints with phys-
 ical evidence. Members of the security forces routinely do not reveal their identity
 during interrogation, a practice that further complicates confirmation of abuse.
 Prison conditions, including conditions for those held for security offenses, meet
 minimum international standards in terms of food, access to basic health care,
 scheduled family visits, cleanliness, and opportunities for work and exercise. Con-
 tinulng problems include overcrowding and the lack of availability of specialized
 medical care. Approximately 1,800 persons are serving sentences or awaiting trial
 in the central prison. An additional 250 prisoners arebeing held at the state secu-
 rity facility in Shuwaikh.
 The central prison faced charges of corruption after seven prisoners escaped and
 the former director was implicated in drug and alcohol smuggling as well as running
 a prostitution ring in the prison. In response to these allegations, the Ministry of
 Interior made sweeping changes aimed at tightening access to the prison and in-
 creasing oversight of prison officials and employees. The most visible sign of these
 changes was the assignment of special Interior Ministry soldiers with an independ-
 ent chain of command to control access to the central prison and search all correc-
 tional officers entering the facility.
 The Government closed the Talha deportation center, a long-time target of criti-
 cism by human rights groups, and deportees are now housed at the state security
 facility in Shuwaikh. This closure improved prison conditions and led to the review
 and resolution of numerous deportation cases (see Section 2.d.).
 The National Assembly's Human Rights Committee closely monitored prison con-
 ditions throughout the year, and the Government allowed the ICRC access to all de-
 tention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention. There were no reports of arbitrary arrest dur-
 ing the year, although there were incidents of prolonged detention.
 Police officers must obtain an arrest warrant from State Prosecutors before mak-
 ing an arrest, although in misdemeanor cases the arresting officer may issue them.
 Security forces occasionally detain persons at checkpoints in Kuwait City (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 Under the Penal Code, a suspect may not be held for more than 4 days without
 charge. Security officers sometimes prevent families from visiting detainees during
 this confinement. After 4 days, prosecutors must either release the suspect or file
 charges. If charges are filed, prosecutors may remand a suspect to detention for an
 additional 21 days. Prosecutors also may obtain court orders for further detention
 pending trial.
 Of the 2,050 persons serving sentences or pending trial at the security prison or
 the state security facility in Shuwaikh, approximately 170 are being held on security
 grounds. The Government may expel noncitizens (including "bidoon", i.e., stateless
 residents of Kuwait, some of whom are native born or long-term residents), if it con-
 siders them security risks. The Government also may expel foreigners if they are
 unable to obtain or renew work or residency permits. Between 110 and 120 persons
 are estimated to be held in detention facilities, some of them pending deportation.
 Some of these detainees have been held for up to 1 to 2 years. Many deportation
 
 
 1732
 orders are issued administratively, without the benefit of a trial. However, the Gov-
 ernment does not forcibly return deportees to their countries of origin, allowing
 those who object to remain in detention. This practice leads to prolonged detention
 of deportees, particularly Iraqis, who do not wish to return to their own countries.
 It also plays a role in the complex problem faced by bidoon deportees, who essen-
 tially remain in detention because their stateless condition makes the execution of
 the deportation order impossible.
 With the closure of the Talha deportation center, and the decision to allow a sig-
 nificant number of stateless persons and potential deportees to legalize their status,
 the deportee problem was alleviated temporarily. Remaining deportees are now
 housed in an existing state security facility (see Section 2.c.). However, human
 rights groups and government officials agree that, without further action, new cases
 are likely to arise.
 The law protects citizens from exile, and there were no reports of this practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution states that "judges shall not be
 subject to any authority;" however, the Amir appoints all judges and renewal of
 many judicial appointments is subject to government approval. Judges who are citi-
 zens have lifetime appointments, but the Government also employs many nonciti-
 zens as judges. These non-Kuwalti judges work under 1- to 3-year renewable con-
 tracts, which undermines their independence. The Ministry of Justice may remove
 judges for cause, but rarely does so. Foreign residents involved in legal disputes
 with citizens frequently complain that the courts show a pro-Kuwaiti bias.
 One court system tries both civil and criminal cases. The Court of Cassation is
 the highest level of judicial appeal. Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have recourse to courts
 of their respective denominations for family law cases; however, there is no Shi'a
 appellate court. Shi'a cases are referred to the Sunni court on appeal.
 Defendants have the right to confront their accusers and appeal verdicts. The
 Amir has the Constitutional power to pardon or commute all sentences. Defendants
 in felony cases are required by law to be represented in court by legal counsel,
 which the courts provide in criminal cases. In misdemeanor cases, defendants have
 the right to waive the presence of legal counsel, and the court is not required to
 provide counsel to indigent defendants.
 Both defendants and prosecutors may appeal court verdicts to the High Court of
 Appeal, which may rule on whether the law was applied properly, as well as on the
 guilt or innocence of.the defendant. .Decisions of the High Court of Appeal may be
 presented to the Court of Cassation, which conductsa limited, formal review of
 cases to determine only-whether the law was applied properly.
 In the regular court system there are no groups, including women, who are barred
 from testifying or whose testimony is given lesser weight. However, the Islamic
 courts, which have jurisdiction over family law, apply Shari'a (Islamic law), which
 states that the testimony of two women equals that of one man.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The Government continues to incar-
 cerate persons convicted of collaboration with Iraq during the occupation. By law
 such collaboration is a felony. Most of the persons convicted in the Martial Law
 Court in 1991, and the Special State Security Court, which- was abolished in 1995,
 did not receive fair trials. However, the Amir commuted the sentences of 19 Jor-
 danians, 3 Iraqis, and 1 Kuwaiti who were convicted previously by the Martial Law
 and State Security Courts. At year's end, 57 persons (29 Iraqis, 7 Jordanians, 17
 bidoon, and 4 Palestinians) convicted by these now-abolished courts remained in
 prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home; however, the
 Government infringes on these rights in some areas. The police must obtain a war-
 rant to search both public and private property unless they are in hot pursuit of
 a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, or if alcohol or narcotics are suspected on
 the premises. The warrant may be obtained from the State Prosecutor or, in the
 case of private property, from a judge. The security forces occasionally monitor the
 activities of individuals and their communications.
 By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born.women. Al-
 though the Government may advise against marriage to a foreign national, there
 are no known cases of the Government refusing permission to marry. The Govern-
 ment advises women against marrying foreign nationals and forbids marriage be-
 tween Muslim women and non-Muslim men.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution states that "freedom of the
 press, printing, and publishing shall be guaranteed in accordance with the condi-
 tions and manner specified by law," and with a few exceptions citizens are free to
 
 
 1733
 criticize the Government at public meetings and in the media; however, journalists
 practice self-censorship. Several laws empower the Government to impose restric-
 tions on freedom of speech and the press. During the year, there was an increase
 in the actual application of these laws. The Government, through the Ministry of
 Information, practices informal censorship by placing pressure on individual pub-
 lishers and editors believed to have "crossed the line" in attacking government poli-
 cies and discussing issues deemed offensive to Islam, tradition, or the interests of
 the State.
 Newspapers are privately owned and free to publish on many social, economic,
 and political issues, and frequently criticize government policies and officials, in-
 cluding the Crown Prince.
 The Government ended prepublication censorship in 1992, but journalists still
 censor themselves. The Press Law prohibits the publication of any direct criticism
 of the Amir, official government communications with other states, and material
 that serves to "attack religions" or "incite people to commit crimes, creates.hatred,
 or spreads dissension among the populace."
 In June the Court of First Instance issued an unusually strong sentence against
 two daily newspapers accused of publishing items that were deemed to be blas-
 phemous and obscene. The Court sentenced the Arabic language daily Al-Seyassah-
 to a 1-week closure and a nominal fine, while sentencing another Arabic language
 daily, Al-Qabas, to a 1-week closure, a nominal fine, and a 6-month jail term for
 the paper's editor-in-chief. A higher court later lessened the sentence against Al-
 Seyassah, but the appeal of the Al-Qabas case was delayed while the Court consid-
 ered the paper's countercase challenging the constitutionality of the Press Law. Fol-
 lowing the Constitutional Court's rejection of the A1-Qabas countercase, the Court
 of Appeals set a new date of January 3, 1999 to hear the A1-Qabas appeal. In the
 interim, neither paper was closed and the Ai-Qabas' editor has not yet been incar-
 cerated.
 On December 27, the Court of First Instance sentenced a newspaper columnist
 to a 3-month prison term for having criticized the public prosecutor's role in an em-
 bezzlement case. The public prosecutor pressed charges after the journalist wrote
 an article in June 1997 that implied that there were irregularities in the embezzle-
 ment investigation. In addition to sentencing the journalist to 3 months' incarcer-
 ation, the Court of First Instance also fined the editor in chief of his newspaper,
 Al-Atwan, $330 (100 dinars) for publishing the article.
 In order to begin publication of a newspaper, the publisher must obtain an operat-
 ing license from the Ministry of Information. Publishers may lose their license if
 their publications do not appear for 6 months. This 6-month rule prevents publish-
 ers from publishing sporadically-it is not used to suspend or shut down existing
 newspapers. Individuals also must obtain permission from the Ministry of Informa-
 tion efore publishing any printed material, including brochures and wall posters.
 The Government does not censor foreign journalists and permits them open access
 to the country.
 The Government owns and controls the radio and television companies. The Gov-
 ernment does not inhibit the purchase of satellite dishes, which are widely avail-
 able. Citizens with such devices are free to watch a variety of programs, including
 those that broadcast from Israel and Iraq.
 The Ministry of Information censors all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and
 other imported publications deemed morally offensive. In January the Ministry an-
 nounced plans to censor the Internet, but indicated that the methods of enforcement
 and technical issues still must be worked out. The Ministry has censored political
 topics as well and does not grant licenses to magazines with a political focus. The
 General Organization of Printing and Publishing controls the printing, publishing,
 and distribution of informational materials. In March the Parliament formally ques-
 tioned the Minister of Information concerning his Ministry's role in the inclusion of
 previously banned books in an exhibition held in November 1997. Ultimately, the
 questioning led to a serious threat of a successful no-confidence vote against the
 Minister, a senior member of the ruling family, and precipitated a cabinet reshuffle.
 There is no government censorship of university teaing, research, or publica-
 tion. However, academics are subject to the same restraints as the media with re-
 gard to criticism of the Amir or Islam.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution af-
 firms the right to assembly, the Government restricts this right in practice. Public
 gatherings must receive prior government approval, as must private gatherings of
 more than five persons that result in the issuance of a public statement. Political
 activity finds its outlet in informal, family-based, almost exclusively male social
 gatherings known as diwaniyas. Practically every male adult, including the Amir,
 hosts and attends diwaniyas, at which every possible topic is discussed. The
 
 
 1734
 
 diwaniya contributes to the development of political consensus and official decision-
 making.
 Although the Constitution affirms the right of association, the Government re-
 stricts this right in practice. The Government bans political parties. Several infor-
 mal blocs, acting much like parties, exist and were active during the 1996 National
 Assembly elections. The Government has made no effort to constrain these
 roupings, which are organized on the basis of common ideological goals. Many may
 e categorized as "opposition" groups.
 All nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) must obtain a license from the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Labor. The Government uses its power to license as a
 means of political control.-The Ministry has registered 55 NGO's, including profes-
 sional groups, a bar association, and scientific bodies. These groups receive govern-
 ment subsidies for their -operating.expenses-Their members must obtain permission
 from the Ministry before attending international conferences. However, since 1985
 the Ministry has issued only three licenses. The Ministry has disapproved other li-
 cense requests on the grounds that previously established NGO's already provide
 services similar to those proposed by the petitioners (see Section 4). In June the
 Government licensed the Prisoners of War Families Organization, an NGO origi-
 nally established in 1997.
 The Government generally overlooks the activities of many unlicensed NGO's, de-
 spite a 1993 decree ordering unregistered NGO's to cease activities. No organization
 has challenged the 1993 decree in court.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion, and the Government places
 some limits on freedom of religion. The Constitution states that Shari'a, or Islamic
 law, is "a-main source of legislation." The ruling family and many other prominent
 families belong to the Sunni denomination of Islam. However, 30 to 40 percent of
 the population belong to the Shi'a denomination. Shi'a-are free to conduct their tra-
 ditional forms of worship without.government interference. However, Shi'a figures
 claim that the Government has not approved the construction of new Shi'a mosques
 in recent years.
 The Constitution states that "all people are equaLin ... public rights and duties
 before the law, without distinction as to . . . religion," and that "freedom of belief
 is absolute. The State protects-the freedom to-practice religion in accordance with
 established customs; provided that it does not conflict with public policy.or morals."
 There are several legally recognized -foreign congregations and churches, including
 a Catholic diocese and several Protestant churches. Foreigners who are members of
 religions not sanctioned in the Koran, e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, may not
 build places of worship but may worship privately in their homes. The Government
 prohibits missionaries from proselytizing among Muslims; however, they may serve
 foreign congregations. The-law prohibits religious education for religions other than
 Islam, although this law is-not enforced rigidly. The Government does not permit
 the establishment of non-Islamic publishing companies or training institutions for
 clergy.
 Although there is a small community of Christian citizens, the law prohibits the
 naturalization of non-Muslims. A non-Muslim male must convert to Islam when he
 marries aMuslim woman if the wedding is to be legal in -Kuwait. A non-Muslim
 female does. not have to-convert to Islam .to marry-a Muslim -male, -but it is to her
 advantage- to do so- Failure .to convert may mean that, should the couple later di-
 vorce, the Muslim-father would be granted custody of any children.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely within the. country and to
 change their work place as desired. Unmarried women 21 years old and, over are
 -free to obtain-a passport and travel abroad at any time. However, married women
 who apply for passports must obtain their husbands' signature on the application
 form. Once-she has a passport, a married woman does not need her husband's per-
 mission to travel, but he may .prevent her departure from the country by placing
 -a 24-hour travel ban on her. He can do-this by contacting the immigration authori-
 ties. -After this 24-hour period, -a court order is.required if the husband still wishes
 to 7prevent his wife from leaving the country. All minor children, must have their
 father's permission to travel -outside of-the country. Citizens-are free to emigrate
 and to xeturn. Security forces in Kuwait City occasionally.set up checkpoints where
 -they may detain individuals. -The checkpoints are mainly for. immigration purposes
 and-are used to apprehend undocumented aliens.
 The Government has the.right to place a-traveh ban on any citizen or foreigner
 - who has a legal case pending-before the courts.-The Government restricts the ability
 of members of NGO's-to attend-conferences abroad (see Section 2.b.).
 I A. serious -problem  exists in .the case of the bidoon, stateless persons of mainly
 Iraqi or Iranian descent, who resided.in Kuwait prior to the. Iraqi invasion. Some
 
 
 1735
 
 bidoon (the term means "without") have had residency ties to Kuwait for genera-
 tions. Others entered Kuwait during the oil boom years. There are an estimated
 114,000 bidoon, down from a pre-war level of 220,000. The bidoon issue remains the
 subject of nearly continuous press commentary and political discussion. While many
 citizens count bidoon among their family members, a significant number believe
 that bidoon should not be eligible for citizenship and the benefits that it conveys.
 The Government maintains that many bidoon are concealing their true citizenship
 in order to remain in Kuwait, become citizens, and enjoy the generous benefits pro-
 vided to citizens. The Government has made only slight progress towards solving
 the longstanding issue of the bidoon. In May parliamentarians passed a bill that re-
 sulted in the naturalization of only 732 bidoon. The Government does not wish the
 return of the bidoon who departed the country during the Gulf War and frequently
 delays or denies issuing them entry visas. This policy imposes serious hardships, in-
 cluding family separations.
 The Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the presence of nation-
 als from those countries that supported Iraq during its invasion of Kuwait. The
 number of such residents is now only about 10 percent of its prewar total. The Gov-
 ernment instituted a policy in 1996 to route the residence permit renewals of these
 nationals through the State Security Service. As a result, there has been a sharp
 increase in the number of renewal denials for these nationals, many of whom, such
 as Palestinians and Iraqis, have no country to which they may return, or have fears
 of persecution upon return.
 While the Government permits the ICRC to verify if deportees object to returning
 to their countries of origin, it detains those with objections in the state security de-
 tention facility in Shuwaikh until they either change their mind or succeed in mak-
 ing alternative arrangements for travel to a third country (see Section 1.d.).
 There is no legislation governing refugees, asylees, or first asylum, and no clear
 standard procedure for processing a person's claim to be a refugee. The Constitution
 prohibits the extradition of political refugees. The Government states that it does
 not deport anyone who claims a fear of persecution at home, but it often keeps such
 persons in detention rather than grant them permission to live and work in Kuwait.
 The United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) maintains an office in
 the country and has access to refugees in detention.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot change their head of state. Although under the Constitution the
 National Assembly must approve the Amir's choice of Crown Prince (i.e., the future
 Amir), this authority is limited. If the Assembly rejects the Amir's nominee, the
 Amir then submits three names from which the Assembly must choose the new
 Crown Prince. Women and citizens naturalized less than 20 years earlier may not
 vote or seek election to the National Assembly. In addition, members of the armed
 forces, police, and other uniformed personnel of the Ministry of Interior are prohib-
 ited from voting.
 Under the Constitution, the Amir holds executive power and shares legislative
 power with the National Assembly. The Prime Minister presides over a 16-member
 Cabinet. In accordance with the practice of the ruling family (but not specifically
 the Constitution), the Prime Minister always has been the Crown Prince. The Con-
 stitution empowers the Amir to suspend its provisions and to rule by decree. The
 Amir dissolved the National Assembly from 1976 to 1981, and in 1986 the Amir ef-
 fectively dissolved the Assembly by suspending the constitutional provisions on the
 Assembly's election. The Assembly remained dissolved until 1992, when elections
 were held. Members serve 4-year terms, and National Assembly elections were held
 on schedule in 1996. The elections were conducted freely and fairly among the mi-
 nority of citizens who are permitted to vote. Since the Government prohibits politi-
 cal parties, Assembly candidates must nominate themselves. Nonetheless, informal
 political groupings are active in the Assembly. The Constitution empowers the Na-
 tional Assembly to overturn any Amiri decrees made during the dissolution, and the
 Assembly has done so in some cases.
 In March the formal questioning (interpellation) of the Information Minister con-
 cerning his Ministry's decision to include previously-banned books for display and
 sale at an Arab book fair led to a crisis between executive and legislative authori-
 ties. Despite fears that the crisis would lead to the dissolution of the Parliament
 and the return to extraconstitutional rule, both the executive and the legislative
 branches of the Government managed to resolve it within the framework of the Con-
 stitution. This move generally was interpreted as indicating a growing commitment
 to resolve disputed within the framework of the country's political institutions, while
 simultaneously increasing the pressure for censorship.
 
 
 1736
 Women are disenfranchised and have little opportunity to influence government.
 In the past, a majority of the members of the National Assembly have expressed
 opinions favoring women's rights to vote, but in March members of the Assembly's
 Legal and Legislative Affairs Committee voted down a bill (originally submitted in
 September 1997) which was aimed at giving women the right to vote and run for
 office. Women's rights activists used the occasion of International Women's Day
 (March 8) to attempt to register as voters in two districts; they were unsuccessful.
 In a-positive development, the Ministry of Planning appointed the country's second
 female undersecretary.
 Members of the Shi'a minority generally are underrepresented in high govern-
 ment positions. There is only one Shi'a member of the Cabinet, the Minister of Plan-
 ning. Five of 50 National Assembly members are Shi'a, as is the armed forces chief
 of staff.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government continued its practice of preventing the establishment of local
 human rights groups by not approving their requests for licenses (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government permits international human rights organizations to visit the coun-
 try and to establish offices. Several organizations conduct field work and report ex-
 cellent communication with and reasonable cooperation from the Government.
 The National Assembly has an active Human Rights Committee, which takes tes-
 timony from individuals about abuses, investigates prison conditions, and makes
 nonbinding recommendations for redress. Despite its designation as an advisory
 body, the Human Rights Committee has shown that, in practice, it is able to mobi-
 lize government agencies to address egregious human rights problems, as evidenced
 by its role in helping to bring about the closure of the Talha deportation center (see
 Section 1.d.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on -race, national origin, lan-
 guage, or religion. However, laws and -regulations discriminate in some cases
 against women and noncitizens, who face widespread social, economic, and legal dis-
 crimination.
 Women.-According to some local experts, domestic abuse of women occurs in an
 estimated 15 percent of all marriages. -Each of the country's 50 police-stations re-
 ceives approximately 1 to 2 complaints of spousal abuse each week, though this may
 be understated. Of the complaints received, approximately 60 percent involve spous-
 al abuse of noncitizen women. The police and the courts generally seek to resolve
 family disputes informally and may ask the offending spouse to sign a statement
 affirming that he agrees to end the abuse. The police refer serious cases to the Psy-
 chiatric Department at the Ministry of Health. The courts have found husbands
 guilty of spousal abuse.
 Some employers physically abuse foreign women working as domestic servants,
 and there are continuing reports of rape of these women by male -employers. The
 local press gives the problem considerable attention, and both the police and the
 courts have taken action against employers when presented with evidence of serious
 abuse. In June a 26-year-old Sri Lankan maid died after suffering physical and
 mental abuse at the hands of her Egyptian employers. While her employers initially
 claimed that her death was the result of a 1-day hunger strike, investigators linked
 her death to a series of severe beatings and filed a case against the employers with
 the office of the Public Prosecutor. In another case, the court sentenced a Kuwaiti
 national to death for having raped and strangled his Filipino maid. Foreign-born do-
 mestic employees have the right to sue their employers for abuse, but few do so due
 to both fear of deportation and fear that the judicial system is biased against them.
 The Government has designated a police station to investigate complaints and pro-
 vide some shelter for runaway maids.
 Runaway servants often seek shelter at their country's embassy for either repatri-
 ation or a change in employers. On several occasions, the Philippine and Sri Lankan
 embassies have each sheltered nearly 300 women. Although most of these women
 sought shelter due to contractual or financial problems with their employers, many
 also alleged physical and sexual abuse. The Sri Lankan, Indian, and Philippine em-
 bassies all continue to report the steady occurrence of physical abuse and mistreat-
 ment involving domestic servants.
 Women experience legal and social discrimination. Women are denied the right
 to vote (see Section 3). Their testimony is not given equal weight to that of males
 in the Islamic courts (see Section I.e.). Married women require their husbands' per-
 
 
 1737
 mission to obtain a passport (see Section 2.d.). By law only males are able to confer
 citizenship; therefore, children born to Kuwaiti mothers and stateless fathers are
 themselves stateless. The Government forbids marriage between Muslim women
 and non-Muslim men (see Section 1.f.). Inheritance is governed by Islamic law,
 which differs according to sect. In the absence of a direct male heir, Shi'a women
 may inherit all property while Sunni women inherit only a portion, with the balance
 divided among brothers, uncles, and male cousins of the deceased.
 Women traditionally are restrained from choosing certain roles in society, and the
 law restricts women from working in "dangerous industries" and trades "harmful"
 to health. However, almost all citizens work for the State in office jobs and women
 are allowed into most areas of the bureaucracy, including even oil well firefighting
 units. Edicated women maintain that conservative religious trends limit career op-
 portunities. Nonetheless, an estimated 28 percent of women of working age are em-
 ployed. The law promises "remuneration equal to that of a man provided she does
 the same work." This promise is respected in practice. Women work as doctors, engi-
 neers, lawyers, bankers, and professors. A few have been appointed to senior posi-
 tions in the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Planning and the state-owned
 Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation. However, there are no female judges or prosecutors.
 In cases of divorce, the Government makes family entitlement payments to the
 divorced husband, who is expected by law and custom to provide for his children
 even though custody of minor children usually is given to the mother. The law dis-
 criminates against women married to foreign men. These women are not entitled
 to government housing subsidies, which are available to male citizens. The law also
 requires women to pay residence fees for their husbands and does not recognize
 marriage as the basis for granting residency to foreign-born husbands. Instead, the
 law grants residency only if the husband is employed. By contrast, Kuwalti men
 married to foreign-born women do not have to pay residency fees for their spouses,
 and their spouses' right to residency derives from marriage.
 Polygyny is legal, and is more common among tribal elements of the population.
 A husband is obliged to inform his first wife that he is taking a second wife. The
 husband is obligated to provide the first wife a separate household if that is her
 preference. It is the second wife's choice to get married. A first wife who objects to
 a second marriage can request a divorce, but the court's determination of divorce
 and child custody would be made on grounds other than the fact of the second mar-
 riage itself.
 There are several women's organizations that follow women's issues, among the
 most active of which are the Women's Socio-Cultural Society (WSCS) and the Wom-
 en's Affairs Committee (WAC).
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Both boys
 and girls receive a free education up to the university level. The Government pro-
 vides free health care and a variety of other services to all children.
 Marriage of girls under the age of 17 is uncommon among the urban population,
 but remains a practice of the Bedouins in outlying areas.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no institutionalized discrimination against dis-
 abled persons in employment, education, or in the provision of state services. Legis-
 lation passed by the National-Assembly in 1996 mandates accessibility for the dis-
 abled to all facilities frequented by the public, and provides an- affi-mative action
 employment program for the disabled. However, this law has not been implemented
 fully. The Government pays extensive benefits for disabled citizens, which cover
 transportation, housing, job training, and social welfare.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government's failure to improve the
 plight of the 114,000 bidoon remains a significant problem. The bidoon have been
 the objects of hostile government policy since the mid-1980's. Since 1985 the Gov-
 ernment has eliminated the bidoon from the census rolls, discontinued their access
 to government jobs and free education, and sought to deport many bidoon. In 1993
 the Government decreed that bidoon males no longer would be allowed to enlist in
 the military service. Those presently in the armed forces gradually are being re-
 placed, although 736 bidoon sons of citizen mothers were allowed to enlist during
 the year. The Government does not issue routinely travel documents to bidoon, and
 if bidoon travel abroad, they risk being barred from returning to the country unless
 they receive advance permission from the immigration authorities. Marriages pose
 special hardships because the offspring of male bidoon inherit the father's undeter-
 mined legal status.
 In May the National Assembly passed a government-sponsored bill that resulted
 in the naturalization of 732 bidoon (a tiny fraction of the country's approximately
 114,000 bidoon population). The newly passed legislation, part of government pro-
 posals made in 1997, granted citizenship to those individuals who were adults (i.e.,
 
 
 1738
 over the age of 21) when their fathers were naturalized. The bill also confers citizen-
 ship on the minor grandchildren of naturalized citizens provided that the child's fa-
 ther is deceased. Further piecemeal legislation has been proposed that, if passed,
 would lead to the naturalization of an additional 10,000 bidoon, but there has been
 no significant progress in regard to this issue.
 The Government claims that it issues a residency visa, and legal status, to any
 bidoon who presents a passport, regardless of the country of issuance. This has led
 some bidoon to acquire passports from countries with which they have no tie, but
 which have liberal "economic citizenship" programs, although this practice has de-
 clined sharply since 1997. Unlike in previous -years, there were no reports that the
 Government denied residency visas to-bidoon who obtained passports or that it had
 unilaterally decided the nationality of any stateless residents without a hearing.
 Since the end of the Gulf-War, government policy has been targeted against work-
 ers from those nationalities whose leaders supported Iraq, especially Palestinians,
 Jordanians, and Yemenis. The Government argues that during the Iraqi occupation,
 many of these workers' governments sided with the Iraqi forces. The Government
 has delayed or denied the issuance of work and residency permits to persons in
 these groups, and in many cases has hindered those workers who are permitted to
 reside in the country from sponsoring their families to join them. Many of these na-
 tionals also have resorted to the purchase of third country passports in order to gain
 entry to, or legalize their status in, the country. A government policy to route the
 residency visas of these nationals through the State Security Service has led to a
 sharp increase in.renewal denials (see Section 2.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, but are not required, to join
 unions. Nonetheless, the Government restricts the right of association by prohibiting
 all workers from freely establishing trade unions. The law stipulates that workers
 may establish only one union in any occupational trade, and that the unions may
 establish only one federation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has long
 criticized such restrictions.
 Approximately 50,000 persons (less than 5 percent) of a total work force estimated
 at 1,100,000 are organized in 14 unions, 12 of which are affiliated with the Kuwait
 Trade Union Federation (KTUF), the sole, legal trade union federation. In June the
 KTUF elected a new board of directors. The board stressed the urgency of getting
 the Labor Law for the private sector passed and setting the minimum wage to im-
 prove the lives of domestic laborers and low-income laborers. The KTUF also em-
 phasized its support for the privatization of industry. In November the KTUF filed
 a complaint with the ILO to protest what it characterized as government stalling
 in passing the new Labor Law. The Bank Worker's Union and the Kuwait Airways
 Workers Union, which consist of approximately 4,500 workers, are- independent of
 the KTUF. The Government has shown no sign that it would accept the establish-
 ment of more than one legal- trade union federation. The law stipulates that any
 new union must include at least 100 workers, of whom at least 15 are citizens. Both
 the ILO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) have
 criticized this requirement because it discourages unions in sectors that employ few
 citizens, such as the construction industry and the domestic sector.
 The Government's pervasive oversight powers further erode union independence.
 The Government subsidizes as much as 90 percent of most union budgets, may in-
 spect the financial records of any union, and prohibits any union from engaging in
 vaguely-defined political or religious activities. The law empowers the courts to dis-
 solve any union for violating labor laws or for threatening "public order and morals."
 Such a court decision may be appealed. The Amir also may dissolve a union by de-
 cree. By law, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is authorized to seize the as-
 sets of any dissolved union. The ILO has criticized this aspect of the law. Although
 no union has been dissolved, the law subordinates the legal existence of the unions
 to the power of the State.
 Approximately 1,271,000 foreign workers are employed in the country. They con-
 stitute most of the work force but only 10 percent of the unionized work force. The
 labor law discriminates against foreign workers by permitting them to join unions
 only after 5 years of residence, although the KTUF states that this requirement is
 not enforced and that foreigners may join unions regardless of their length of stay.
 In addition, the law stipulates that foreigners may participate only as nonvoting
 members. Unlike union members who are citizens, foreign workers do not have the
 right to elect their leadership. The law requires that union officials must be citizens.
 The ILO has criticized the 5-year residency requirement and the denial of voting
 rights for foreign workers. The KTUF administers an Expatriate Labor Office, which
 is authorized to investigate complaints of foreign laborers and provide them with
 
 
 1739
 free legal advice. However, these services are not utilized widely. Any foreign work-
 er may submit a grievance to the labor office regardless of union status.
 The law limits the right to strike. It requires that all labor disputes must be re-
 ferred to compulsory arbitration if labor and management cannot reach a solution
 (see Section 6.b.). The law does not have any provision ensuring strikers freedom
 from any legal or administrative action taken against them by the state. However,
 the Mimstry of Labor and Social Affairs has proved responsive to sit-ins or protests
 by workers who face obvious wrongdoing by their employers.
 In April approximately 500 Bangladeshi cleaners went on strike because they had
 not been paidin 6 months. The workers, after unsuccessfully a ppealing to their em-
 ployer, finally appealed to the Bangladeshi Embassy and the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs. The Ministry acted decisively and quickly resolved the issue by seiz-
 ing a bond that the employer had posted as a condition to import foreign labor.
 In July over 300 Chinese workers began striking in protest against delinquent
 payment of their salaries. An investigation by the Ministry of Labor and Social Af-
 fairs revealed that the company had acted in good faith, making timely payments
 to the Chinese company that held the subcontract. The investigation further re-
 vealed that the Chinese company had not forwarded payment to its employees. In
 the end, the Ministry left the workers to resolve the matter through the Chinese
 Embassy and a special labor team that was sent from China.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. The KTUF belongs to the Inter-
 national Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the formerly Soviet-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, subject to certain restrictions (see Section 6.a.).
 hese rights have been incorporated in the Labor Law and, according to all reports,
 have been respected in practice.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers
 or their representatives" in the private sector. Most agreements are resolved in such
 negotiations; if not, either party may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Labor for mediation. If mediation fails, the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration
 board composed of officials from the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law makes no provision for collective bargaining between gov-
 ernment workers and their employer. Technically, wages and conditions of emp loy-
 ment for civil service workers are established by the Government, but in practice,
 the Government sets the benefit scales after conducting informal meetings with offi-
 cials from the civil service unions. Union officials resolve most issues at the working
 level and have regular access to other senior officials.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against employees based on their affiliation with a union.
 Employers found guilty ofantiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for
 union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor "except in cases specified by law for national emergency and with just remu-
 neration," however, some foreign workers are treated like indentured servants. The
 Government does not prohibit specifically forced and bonded labor by children, but
 such practices are not known to occur.
 Foreign workers may not change their employment without permission from their
 original sponsors unless they have been in the country for over 2 years. Domestic
 servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses from this practice because they are
 not protected by the Labor Law. In many cases employers exercise control over their
 servants by holding their passports, although the Government prohibits this prac-
 tice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in disputes.
 Some foreign workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled South Asian workers,
 live much like indentured servants. They frequently face poor working conditions
 and some physical abuse (see Section 6.e.).
 Domestic servants who run away from their employers may be treated as crimi-
 nals under the law. However, the authorities usually do not enforce this provision
 of the law. In some reported cases, employers illegally withheld wages from domes-
 tic servants to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. There are also
 credible reports of widespread visa trading, a system by which sponsors agree to ex-
 tend their sponsorship to workers outside of the country in exchange for a fee of
 $1,500 to $1,800. Middlemen, generally foreigners, use the promise of Kuwaiti spon-
 sorship to attract workers from economically depressed countries, taking a commis-
 sion and remitting the rest to the nominal Kuwaiti sponsor. Once in Kuwait, such
 
 
 1740
 workers are farme&out to-the informal sector or find employment with parties that
 would otherwise be unable to sponsor them. However, foreign workers who are re-
 cruited with these traded visas not only face possible prosecution for being 'engaged
 in illegal employment (i.e., working for an employer other than their sponsor) but
 also leave themselves extremely vulnerable to extortion by employers, sponsors, and
 middlemen. Government efforts to crack down on such abuses have failed to realize
 significant progress.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age is 18 years for all forms of work, both flal- and part-time. Employers
 may obtain permits from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor to employ juve-
 niles between the ages of 14 and 18 in certain trades. Education is compulsory for
 children between the ages of 6 and 15. The Government does not prohibit forced and
 bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur (see Section
 6.c.). Some small businessmen employ their children on a part-time basis, and there
 have been confirmed reports that some South Asian and Southeast Asian domestic
 servants are under age 18, but falsified their ages in order to enter the country.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours a day on the condition that they work
 no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a 1-hour rest period.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. An informal two-tiered labor market ensures
 high wages for Kuwaiti employees, most of whom are in government white collar
 or business executive positions, while foreign workers, particularly unskilled labor-
 ers, receive substantially lower wages. There is no legal minimum wage in the pri-
 vate sector. In the public sector, the effective minimum wage is approximately $774
 (226 dinars) a month for citizens and approximately $301 (90 dinars) a month for
 non-citizens. The public-sector minimum wage provides a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. Wages of unskilled workers in the private sector do not
 always permit a decent standard of living. To be eligible to sponsor family members
 for residency, government workers must receive a minimum wage of $1,530 (450 di-
 nars) a month, and private-sector workers must make at least $2,210 (650 dinars)
 a month.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. The Labor Law limits the
 standard workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, provides for a mini-
 mum of 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule
 for industrial accidents. Domestic servants, who are excluded specifically from the
 private sector Labor Law, frequently work long hours, greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged the Government to ensure the weekly 24-consecutive-hour rest
 period to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and work-
 ers in enterprises employing fewer than five persons. The law pertaining to the oil
 industry provides for a 40-hour workweek, 30 days of annual leave, and sick leave.
 Laws establishing work conditions are not applied uniformly to foreign workers. The
 labor law also provides for employer-provided medical care and compensation to
 workers disabled by injury or disease due to job-related causes. The law also re-
 quires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers exposed to
 environmental hazards on the job, such as chemicals and asbestos. The Government
 has issued occupational health and safety standards; however, compliance and en-
 forcement appear poor, especially with respect to unskilled foreign laborers. Employ-
 ers often exploit workers' willingness to accept substandard conditions. Some foreign
 workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled South Asian workers, live much like in-
 dentured servants, are unaware of their legal rights, and generally lack the means
 to pursue a legal remedy. They frequently face contractual disputes, poor working
 conditions, and some physical abuse. Most are in debt to their employers before they
 arrive in the country and have little choice but to accept the employer's conditions,
 even if they contradict the contractual terms. It is not uncommon for wages to be
 withheld for a period of months. Many foreign workers are forced to live in 'ousing
 camps," which generally are overcrowded and lack adequate cooking and bathroom
 facilities. The workers only are allowed off the camp compound on company trans-
 port or by permission of the employer.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protection exist for work-
 ers who file complaints about such conditions. Figures available for roughly the first
 half of the year indicate that the Government registered about 800 cases involving
 occupational injuries. To cut accident rates, the Government periodically inspects in-
 stallations to raise awareness among workers and employers, and to ensure that
 they abide by the safety rules, control the pollution resulting from certain dangerous
 
 
 1741
 industries, train workers who use new machines in specialized institutes, and report
 violations.
