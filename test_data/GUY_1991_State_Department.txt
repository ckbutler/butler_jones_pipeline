 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations, is a small, multiracial developing
 nation with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election
 in a-multiparty political system. The leader of the party
 obtaining a plurality of seats in Parliament is elected as
 Executive President. Under the 1980 Constitution,
 parliamentary, regional, and municipal elections are held at
 least every 5 years. National elections were to have been held
 before May 1991; however, the government-controlled Parliament
 introduced legislation allowing the elections to be postponed
 to allowfor the development of a new voters' list based on a
 house-to-house enumeration. The People's National Congress
 (PNC), currently led by Hugh Desmond Hoyte, has dominated
 political life since the 1964 elections. In each subsequent
 election, opposition leaders have charged the PNC with
 electoral fraud.
 Guyanese social and political life is influenced by the
 polarization of the two main ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese
 and the Indo-Guyanese. Urban Afro-Guyanese dominate the ruling
 PNC, the Guyana Police Force (GPF), and the other security
 forces; the Indo-Guyanese predominate in the agricultural and
 business sectors and in the chief opposition political party,
 the People's Progressive Party (PPP). The GPF has primary
 responsibility for maintaining law and order throughout
 Guyana. The police and security forces are responsible to the
 civilian Government. Police were responsible for instances of
 brutal treatment of detainees and prisoners.
 As part of its Economic Recovery Program approved by the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, the
 Government made major efforts to encourage private investment
 in state-owned corporations. Discussions during 1991 were
 focused on the Government's divestment program which included
 its sugar and bauxite industries and state-owned rice mills,
 three of Guyana's most important export earners. The recovery
 program included the privatization of state-owned entities,
 currency devaluations, and budgetary restraints. Despite these
 efforts, the economy continued to be plagued by high external
 debt, shortages of skilled labor, and a deteriorating
 infrastructure. Devaluation severely reduced the real wages of
 workers.
 Human rights problems in Guyana continued to include police
 abuse of detainees and prisoners, retaliation against union
 organizers, societal violence against women, and continuing
 credible charges of election manipulation in preparation for
 the next election. During 1991 the Government made further
 concessions on several electoral issues, but some opposition
 groups remain skeptical about the implementation of these
 reforms. The 1988 split between the government-linked unions
 and the more independent unions remained unresolved, a
 situation which continued to undermine labor's independence and
 strength.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No politically motivated or governmentally sanctioned
 extrajudicial killings are known to have occurred. Summary
 
 
 626
 GUYANA
 executions do not take place.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While torture is prohibited by the Constittition, the Guyana
 Human Rights Association (GHRA) noted continuing problems with
 police brutality in 1991. The number of allegations of
 brutality by policemen involved in criminal activity, including
 extortion, intimidation, and assault, diminished during 1991,
 but claims of brutality resulting from efforts to extract
 confessions continued to be noted. Officers charged as a
 result of complaints to the Police Complaints Authority are
 routinely suspended for a few days and sometimes fined but are
 rarely jailed for their alleged offenses. The case against
 five police officers charged with the death of a criminal
 suspect in December 1990 was dismissed for lack of evidence.
 Prison conditions continued to deteriorate in 1991. The GHRA
 called for the suspension of the mandatory prison sentence for
 narcotics offenses, citing it as the primary cause of severe
 prison overcrowding. Disease, including acquired
 immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and lack of adequate
 nutrition were prevalent throughout the penal system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person may be deprived of
 personal liberty except as authorized by law and also requires
 judicial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate
 that was generally respected in practice in 1991.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official,
 only the presumption of guilt by the police officer. If a
 person is arrested and held for more than 24 hours, the law
 requires that he be brought before a court of law to be
 charged. Parliament repealed the National Security Act in
 1991, but the GHRA points out that many provisions were
 modified and are now covered under antinarcotics legislation,
 in effect limiting possible rights infringements for criminal
 activities other than narcotics trafficking.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under Guyana's British common law system, the Constitution
 provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is
 respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system.
 Defendants are granted fair public trials, and appeal may be
 made to higher courts.
 There are no political prisoners or special courts for
 political security cases. Several leaders of an alleged
 aborted coup attempt in 1990 are awaiting trial on treason
 charges. No judge has been selected to try the defendants, one
 of whom returned to Guyana voluntarily from Canada and was
 arrested at the airport on arrival.
 In the past, some opposition figures have expressed concern
 over court rulings in certain cases involving government
 
 
 627
 GUYANA
 interests, such as in libel suits brought by government
 officials; there were no cases of this nature in 1991.
 Opposition lawyers do complain that the judiciary is prone to
 grant lengthy postponements in trials affecting the Government
 or law enforcement officials; however, postponements are
 routinely granted to both the defense and the prosecution.
 Other delays in judicial proceedings are often caused by
 shortages of trained court administrative personnel and
 magistrates.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the right to privacy,
 although some opposition politicians have alleged instances of
 government surveillance, particularly at meetings and rallies.
 Uniformed police officers routinely monitor such rallies. The
 laws requiring judicially issued warrants for searches were
 generally respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The constitutional provision for freedom of speech is generally
 respected,  nd Guyanese freely criticize their Government and
 its policies but sometimes suffer retaliation for such
 criticism. Guyana has two private television broadcasting
 stations. The two stations carry a variety of public affairs
 and news programming with a broad range of views and opinions.
 Government-owned Guyana Television (GTV) continued to produce a
 10-minute daily news show which provided relatively evenhanded
 reporting of local events. The government-owned Guyana
 Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) generally takes a more
 aggressive progovernment position, offering live coverage of
 PNC political activities while ignoring many opposition events.
 In past years, the Government exercised varying degrees of
 control over the media through ownership of the country's only
 daily newspaper (the Guyana Chronicle), the communications
 agency, the Tadio station, and the issuance of import licenses
 for newsprint and printing presses. 'This control, however,
 continues to lessen. The independent Stabroek News expanded
 its publication to six times a week in 1991. The PPP-owned
 Mirror imported new presses and expanded its weekly newspaper
 from 4 to 16 pages per issue.
 The Government continued to take retaliatory action against
 persons perceived to be in the political opposition. It was
 quick to remove a well-known critic of its electoral policies
 from a senior position in the government-owned bauxite industry
 after the publication of a report suggesting reforms of the
 electoral regulations. Members of the Government have
 sometimes brought libel suits against publishers, which critics
 claim were aimed at discouraging press criticism. A lawsuit
 filed in 1988 by individual police officers against the GHRA
 over its Brief of Police Violence was postponed indefinitely
 due to the lack of interest on the part of the Government in
 pursuing the issue at the time.
 The Government's record on academic freedom was mixed in 1991.
 On the one hand, the President promised a return to an
 educational system that offered a choice of both public and
 private schools. On the other, the President named a PNC
 political adviser as vice-chancellor to the University of
 
 
 628
 GUYANA
 Guyana in a move that many viewed as limiting the ability of
 the University to operate independently.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Public Order Act requires police permits for mass political
 meetings, but the police commissioner, at his discretion and
 without explanation, may refuse permission for a public
 meeting. During 1991 all political parties held regular public
 meeting� and rallies at locations throughout the country
 without incident. However, the opposition continued to cite
 instances of local police surveillance and harassment at a
 number of rallies.
 "c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and members
 of all faiths are allowed to worship freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is provided for in the
 Constitution. Travel to certain Amerindian areas requires
 government permission, a regulation dating from colonial times
 designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation.
 The GHRA, opposition politicians and some clergy contend that
 permits are sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC
 politicians and that the regulations are being used to maintain
 PNC influence among the Amerindians.
 Guyanese are free to travel abroad, emigrate, and to return.
 Guyana neither received nor generated refugees in 1991.
 However, the Government has agreed in principle to accept a
 small number of Haitian refugees under the auspices of the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees for future repatriation or
 placement in receiving countries. There are no forced
 resettlements or displaced persons, and citizenship is-not
 denied on political grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guyanese are free to join or support political parties of their
 choice, but it is unclear whether citizens have the ability to
 change their Government. The ruling PNC has won every election
 since 1964, but the results of every election since 1968 have
 been tainted by opposition charges of electoral fraud.
 However, opposition groups were able to keep pressure on the
 Government to reform the electoral process in 1991. The
 President agreed to a reorganization of the Elections
 Commission, to the use of metal ballot boxes, and to granting
 more authority to the Elections Commission. However, the
 Commission has failed to produce an acceptable voter's list,
 causing the President to declare a state of emergency and
 postpone elections until 1992, reconvening Parliament to deal
 with necessary changes to the Constitution and to electoral
 regulations.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The GHRA, the most active local human rights group, functions
 without government interference. The GHRA is a nongovernmental
 
 
 629
 GUYANA
 organization, formed in 1979 with support from trade unions,
 professional organizations, and churches, that issues periodic
 press releases and publishes an annual report on human rights
 in Guyana. Some leaders of GHRA were instrumental in forming
 the Guyanese Action for Reform and Democracy (GUARD) in 1990.
 After a series of well-attended public-rallies in 1990, GUARD
 split from the GHRA to pursue a political agenda, planning to
 nominate a list of candidates in the upcoming elections.
 The Government usually regards outside criticism of its human
 rights practices as interference in its internal affairs.
 However, during 1991 the Government entertained follow-up
 visits from the Commonwealth's election observer team and
 missions from the U.S.-based Carter Center to monitor progress
 towards upcoming elections. In September the Carter Center
 opened a field office. A representative from the
 Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems
 traveled to Guyana regularly to assist with the logistical
 planning for elections.
 Representatives from the National Democratic Institute, based
 in Washington, met with a less-than-enthusiastic reception by
 the Government but were not prohibited from meeting with a
 broad spectrum of Guyanese.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons in
 Guyana regardless of race, sex, religion, or national origin.
 Guyanese society and political life continue to be influenced
 by ethnic differences between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese.
 Guyana has a small ethnic Amerindian population, composed of
 nine tribal groups, living in reservations scattered throughout
 the country. Their standard of living is lower than that of
 most Guyanese. The GHRA has charged, that the Government
 controls Amerindian leaders and land titles and places
 limitations on access to their reservations by clergy and other
 outsiders. The Government exerts influence over the selection
 of their leaders, but all are free to criticize the Government
 and many actively and openly oppose government policies. While
 government restrictions exist on travel into Amerindian areas,
 these are largely on paper and are ignored in practice by many
 persons traveling into the interior of Guyana. The GHRA
 charges that expanding mining operations by the private sector
 has prevented the Government from fulfilling its legislatively
 mandated land distribution to the Amerindians. However, the
 President recently awarded titles to the villages which were
 identified in the original legislation in 1976.
 In principle, the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the
 basis of sex and establishes a commitment to ensure equal pay
 for equal work. A 1988 government-sponsored constitutional
 amendment rendered the equal pay provision unenforceable except
 in cases in which equal pay for equal work is provided for by
 specific statute. No such statutes have been passed. In 1990
 the Parliament passed legislation granting equal rights to
 women and legislation that protects women's property rights
 under common law marriage, entitling a woman who separates or
 divorces to one half of the couple's property if she had been
 working and one third of the property if she had been a
 housewife. Additionally, the legislation gave authority to the
 court to overturn a man's will in-the event it does not provide
 for the wife. There are no organizations, other than those
 
 
 630
 GUYANA
 sponsored by political organizations, that focus primarily on
 women's rights.
 Violence against women, includiig domestic violence such as
 wife beating, is considered a significant problem. Victims of
 such abuse often are reluctant to report it to the authorities
 or to press charges, and underreporting of incidents of such
 violence makes it impossible to estimate its true extent.
 While it provides victims access to the courts for redress, the
 Government has not recommended additional legislation or other
 remedial action.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 which specifically enumerates a person's right to 'form or
 belong to trade unions." Approximately one quarter of Guyana's
 total work force of about 250,000 are formally organized. Most
 union members work in the public sector and in government-owned
 corporations.
 There is a tradition of close ties between Guyana's trade union
 movement and political parties, particularly the PNC which has
 controlled the Government (and thus public sector employment)
 for 25 years. Many of the 24 unions in the Guyana Trades Union
 Congress (TUC) are formally affiliated with the PNC. In
 theory, unions are free to choose their own officials, but
 political parties, including both the PNC and the opposition
 parties, wield significant influence over the leadership of a
 number of unions. Trade unionists often have dual roles as
 officials in political parties. President Hoyte is the
 honorary president of the Guyana Labor Union, a member of the
 TUC. Opposition leader Cheddi Jagan holds the same position in
 the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers Union (GAWU), which
 represents 14,000 sugar workers.
 Six unions belong to the Federation of Independent Trade Unions
 of Guyana (FITUG), which was originally formed when these
 unions walked out of the September 1988 TUC conference to
 protest heavy-handed electioneering tactics by the PNC.
 Leaders of the TUC and FITUG continued efforts to negotiate a
 reconciliation during 1991, but efforts at formal reunification
 of the two bodies continued to be blocked by unionists with
 ties to political parties.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike. Public
 employees providing essential services are under normal
 circumstances forbidden to strike, but a procedure exists for
 the review of grievances by a tribunal appointed by the
 Minister of Labor. A Public Utilities Undertakings Act was
 introduced but not enacted by this year's Parliament after
 widespread criticism by labor and civic leaders. The Act
 threatened severe penalties for strikes by workers in essential
 services such as health, electricity, and water. During the
 year, nurses at the public hospitals and workers at the
 municipal power plant staged strikes. It is unlikely that the
 Public Utilities Act would have prevented these strikes. Labor
 disputes are frequently settled through consultation and dialog
 without resorting to strikes or other industrial action. A
 bill that would have introduced standards for union
 recognition, a longstanding demand of labor leaders, was not
 passed in 1991 due to objections by the TUC.
 
 
 631
 GUYA
 Unions freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean and
 international trade union and professional groups. All three
 of the trade union internationals have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Public and private sector employees possess and utilize the
 generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Labor Ministry must certify all collective
 bargaining agreements but has never refused to do so. This
 right is not codified, however, and employers are not legally
 required to recognize unions. Increasingly, unions of public
 sector corporations are bargaining directly with employers
 rather than through TUC/government negotiations, but bargaining
 for public servants remains highly centralized, and wage
 negotiations take place betweenthe TUC and the Ministry of
 Finance.
 The TUC's traditional ties (through individual unions) to the
 PNC-controlled Government reduces the unions' ability to
 negotiate effectively on behalf of workers with the result that
 salaries are often set, solely by the Government. After the
 announcement of the 1991 budget in February, the FITUG and the
 TUC formed a joint committee to-negotiate with the Government
 on behalf of workers. FITUG leaders continue to charge that
 TUC officials are unwilling to make militant demands of the
 Government, precluding the possibility of an effective wage
 settlement.
 The Chief Labor Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labor
 provide consultation, enforcement, and conciliation services.
 In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, 23
 collective bargaining agreements were concluded and certified
 by the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry has a backlog of cases,
 and insufficient manpower and transportation severely limit the
 Ministry's ability to comply with its mandate.
 The Ministry of Labor reported no cases of antiunion
 discrimination during 1991. However, union leaders make
 credible charges that workers attempting to unionize workplaces
 are harassed and intimidated and that the Ministry does not
 expeditiously pursue complaints that employers are allowed to
 dismiss workers when confronted with union recognition claims.
 For example, public sector nurses involved in last year's
 strike have still not been paid benefits promised them in the
 agreement that ended the strike. Other unions have complained
 of retaliation against union organizers at worksites, including
 a dredging firm, a shipping company, and a textile mill.
 Guyana has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and it
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Minimum age laws are set out in the Factories Act and the
 Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act. Legally,
 no person under 14 years of age may be employed in any
 industrial undertaking, and no person under 16 may be employed
 at night, except under regulated circumstances. The terms
 "industry" and "factory" as used .in the law have been
 interpreted by the Ministry of Labor to encompass nearly all
 
 
 632
 GUYANA
 workplaces except offices and retail shops. According to the
 law, children under age 14 may be employed only in enterprises
 in which members of the same family are employed. The local
 economic situation has forced more and more young children into
 the work force, however, and it is common to see children under
 14 selling candy, cigarettes, and other items along the roads
 throughout the country. While cognizant of the situation, the
 Ministry of Labor lacks sufficient inspectors to enforce
 existing laws effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government legislates a public sector minimum wage and
 private employers generally pay a higher rate. The minimum
 wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and his family. Hours of employment are set under
 the Factories Act and vary by industry and sector. Work in
 excess of an 8-hour day and a 40-hour week receives payment at
 an overtime rate.
 The Occupational Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of
 Labor is charged with conducting factory inspections and
 investigating charges of substandard workplaces and
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate
 resources have prevented the Ministry from effectively carrying
 out this function. Occupational health and safety standards
 are also prescribed in the Factories Act.
