 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated territory that reverted from British to Chi-
 nese sovereignty on July 1, remains a free society with legally protected rights. Its
 constitutional arrangements until June 30 were defined byLetters Patent and Royal
 Instructions from London; thereafter, Hong Kong became a Special Administrative
 Region of the People's Republic of China as prescribed by a 1985 Sino-British Joint
 Declaration and the Basic Law, a "mini-constitution" approved in 1990 by China's
 National People's Congress. Executive powers, until June 30 were vested in a gov-
 ernor appointed by Britain; after July 1, such powers were vested in a chief execu-
 tive selected by a 400-person selection committee chosen by a China-appointed pre-
 paratory committee. Fundamental rights before June 30 ultimately rested on over-
 sight by the British Parliament. Thereafter, such rights were provided by the Basic
 Law, under which Hong Kong is to have a high degree of autonomy except in de-
 fense and foreign affairs. In practice, Hong Kong has largely controlled its internal
 affairs. The judiciary is an independent body adhering to the Basic Law and to Eng-
 lish common law.
 In 1995 Hong Kong completed the process of moving from an appointed to an
 elected legislature, and all 60 seats in the Legislative Council, which served until
 June 30, were open to direct or indirect balloting for the first time. The elections
 were widely considered to be fair and open. The Legislative Council served as a
 forum for vigorous debate and planning- for the period after retrocession. However,
 China, objecting to the electoral rules institutedby Governor Patten and the Hong
 Kong Government for the Legislative Council, district board, and municipal council
 
 
 elections, dissolved these bodies at midnight on June 30. The selection committee
 that named the Chief Executive also chose a 60-member provisional legislature to
 take office after the handover. Of the elected legislative councilors, 33 of 34 who
 sought seats were named to the Provisional Legislature. No Democratic Party legis-
 lators, who as a group had drawn the most popular support in the 1995 elections,
 sought seats on the Provisional Legislature. many popular independent legislators
 joined the Democrats in refusing to serve on an appointed provisional legislature.
 Critics contended that the selection of the Provisional Legislature had no basis in
 law was unnecessary lacked transparency, was not based on open elections, and
 excluded groups or inividuals critical of China. Court cases challenged the constitu-
 tionality of the Provisional Le islature and the validity of its laws, but the High
 Court upheld the authority of the National People's Congress to establish the legis-
 lature and the laws.
 China promised that the Provisional Legislature would serve no more than a year
 and committed to legislative council elections before July 1, 1998, based on a new
 election law. It also said that a broad spectrum of candidates and parties could par-
 ticipate in the elections. In September the Hong Kong Government introduced an
 election bill based on recommendations by the Preparatory Committee. As specified
 in the Basic Law, 20 seats are to be elected on a geographic basis through universal
 suffrage, 30 seats through functional (occupational) constituencies, and 10 seats
 through -indirect election. The Preparatory Committee and Hong Kong administra-
 tion decided that the 20 geographic seats should be chosen by a proportional rep-
 resentation system and redefined 9 of the functional constituencies, reducing the
 number bf voters in these constituencies from over 2.5 million to less than 200,000.
 Some observers criticized the proportional method as favoring pro-China parties in
 the geographic races, and they also criticized curtailment of the franchise for func-
 tional constituencies. However, as of year's end, all political parties have indicated
 that they expect the elections to be democratic, and none has said that it would boy-
 cott the elections, which the Government has set for May 1998. In December the
 Democratic Party chose 19 candidates to run in the elections, while leaders of other
 p rodemocracy parties made glans to give up their British passports in order to qual-
 ify as candidates in geographic constituencies.
 A well-organized police force maintains public order under the firm control of ci-
 vilian authorities. Fears that Chinese troops sent to Hong Kong to replace the Brit-
 ish military garrison after the handover would intervene in poice duties have thus
 far proved to be unrounded. There were reports that some members of the police
 committed human rights abuses.
 Hong Kong is a major regional and international trade and finance center. It is
 the principal gateway for trade and investment with China. A thriving free market
 economy operates with minimal government interference (a system provided for by
 the Basic Law for 50 years). Per capita gross domestic product surpassed $24,000
 in 1996 and continued to grow in 1997. After reversion, Hong Kong continues to
 enjoy economic autonomy and to function as a separate customs territory from
 mainland China.
 Human rights problems before and after the July 1 reversion included excessive
 use of force by some members of the police against persons in custody, some in-
 stances of media self-censorship, limitations on citizens' ability to change their gov-
 ernment, violence and discrimination against women, and discrimination against
 the disabled and ethnic minorities. The human rights community criticized the out-
 going colonial government for opposing proposals to enact laws against discrimina-
 tion based on race, age, and sexual orientation. However, the Legislative Council on
 June 26 passed the government-sponsored Family Status Discrimination Ordinance,
 which protects people who have children, whose marital status changes, or who are
 responsible for caring for a particular family member. Human rights observers were
 concerned that revisions to the Public Order and the Societies ordinances would un-
 dermine fundamental human rights; however, to date these fears have been un-
 founded.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In 1997 there were 10 instances of death of detainees in police custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other extreme forms of abuse by the police; however,
 there were reports that police at times used excessive force. The law stipulates pun-
 
 
 ishment for those who break the law, and disciplinary action can range from
 warnings to dismissal. Criminal proceedings may be undertaken independently of
 the disciplinary process of the police force. Allegations of excessive use of force are
 investigated by the Complaints Against Police Office, whose work is monitored and
 reviewed by the Police Complaints Council, a body composed of public members ap-
 pointed by the Chief Executive.
 Although excessive use of force by police is not widespread, there are occasional
 complaints of force being used to coerce information or confessions during interroga-
 tions. Some human rights monitors are concerned that this may be a growing prob-
 lem and have documented complaints of beatings. In 1996 the Government reported
 1,600 assault complaints, of which 3 were substantiated by the Complaints Council.
 From January to June, there were 521 assault complaints; 4 were substantiated.
 Critics contrast the relatively large number of complaints with the very small num-
 ber substantiated and urge changes to a system whose review process appears to
 favor the police. The Complaints Council in May announced that the force had
 agreed to a lower standard of proof for less serious complaints. However, many ob-
 servers criticized the Government for withdrawing on June 23 a bill to strengthen
 the Complaints Council after the legislature added an amendment expanding the
 Council's oversight of the Complaints Against Police Office to include investigative
 powers. The Government argued that the amendment would have severely dis-
 rupted effective operation of the police complaints system.
 The Basic Law provides that military forces stationed by China in Honfg Kong for
 defense purposes "shall not interfere in the local affairs of the region. Although
 many persons worried about the dispatch of 4,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA)
 troops to Hong Kong at the time of handover to replace British forces, the Govern-
 ment pledged that they would play no police role. The PLA troops have assumed
 a very low profile. Under the authority of the Basic Law the Chief Executive may
 request their assistance in cases of natural disaster or civil disturbance that local
 forces cannot handle.
 Although conditions vary among facilities, prisons conform to international stand-
 ards.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors. After one such
 visit in June, Human Rights Watch/Asia and Human Rights Monitor noted that the
 system "had much to recommend it," although also noting that it showed the strains
 of overcrowding. Terming the visit a benchmark of prison conditions just before re-
 version, these groups recommended that an independent prisons inspectorate pro-
 vide future outside oversight of conditions in Hong Kong's penal and detention fa-
 cilities. The Government, however, decided against establishing such an inspection
 system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Until reversion, British legal practice
 and common law traditions governed the process of arrest and detention to ensure
 substantial and effective protection against arbitrary arrest or detention.
 After reversion, common law, precedents previously in force, and the Basic Law
 (which incorporates the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights) pro-
 vides such protections. The Government has stated that these protections are equal
 to those applicable prior to July 1, 1997.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Until June 30, the judicial and legal systems were
 organized by principles of British constitutional law and legal precedent and pro-
 vided for an independent judiciary, which the Government respected in practice. An
 independent judiciary endured after Hong Kong's reversion, underpinned by the
 Basic Law's provision that Hong Kong's common law tradition be maintained.
 Hong Kong's ultimate judicial body, the Court of Final Appeal, was established
 on July 1, inheriting, in large part, the power of final judgment formerly held by
 the Privy Council in Lndon. Incoming government officials were responsible for set-
 ting up the court. Judges are nominated by an independent commission; the Chief
 Executive is required to appoint those nominated, subject to endorsement by the leg-
 islature. By late July, the Chief Executive had appointed a chief justice, three other
 permanent justices, and several nonpermanent jurists from Hong Kong and other
 Commonwealth~ jrisdictions to serve on a case-by-case basis.
 Beneath the Court of Final A ppeal is the High Court, composed of the Court of
 Appeal and the Court of First instance. Lower judicial bodies include the district
 court (which has limited jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters), the magistracyr
 (exercising jurisdiction over a wide rang of criminal offenses), the coroner's court,
 the juvenile court, the lands tribunal, the labor tribunal, the small claims tribunal,
 and the obscene articles tribunal.
 Acordingto the Basic Law, the Hong Kong ourts have "no jurisdiction over acts
 of state such as defense and foreign affairs." The Basic Law also vests in the Stand-
 
 
 ing Committee of the National People's Congress the power to interpret the Basic
 Law on matters that are the "responsibility of the Central People's Government or
 concern the relationship between the central authorities and the Special Adminis-
 trative Region." If broadly applied and loosely interpreted, these exceptions to the
 Court of Final Appeal's power of final jurisdiction could be used to limit the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary. No such limitations have occurred.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and this is respected in prac-
 tice. Trial is by jury.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally respects this right
 in practice. For more than 20 years, the Independent Commission Against Corrup-
 tion was vested with powers, including the right to authorize searches and detain
 suspects, that are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordi-
 nances governing the Commission were enacted in July 1996 and took effect on
 June 20, depriving the Commission of the independent authority to issue arrest or
 search warrants (it must now go to the courts). However, it still does not apply the
 p resumption of innocence in corruption cases, and criminal convictions are obtained
 by regarding any excessive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants as ill-gotten
 until proven otherwise.
 In December 1996, the Government established a privacy commission under the
 Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance to prevent misuse and disclosure of data such
 as medical and credit records. By May 9, the commission had received 3,800 inquir-
 ies and 70 complaints. In August the commission proposed a code to prevent banks
 and other companies from keeping photocopies of customers' identity cards. A new
 clause in the ordinance also prohibited matching sets of personal data without the
 consent of the subject individual or the commissioner, although some government
 departments were exempt in order to combat social welfare abuse and tax evasion.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Hong Kong has a tradition of free speech and
 of a free press, and there was little apparent change in these freedoms after rever-
 sion. However, some journalists practiced self-censorship for fear of running afoul
 of the new authorities. People continued to speak freely to the media. Political de-
 bate remained vigorous. Numerous viewpoints, including stories and opinions criti-
 cal of the Hong Kong and Chinese Governments, were aired in the mass media, in
 public forums, and by political grups. International media organizations operated
 freely. Hong Kong's 16 major aly newspapers, 2 commercial television stations,
 and 2 commercial radio stations functioned with virtually no government control.
 There were no special visas needed for foreign reporters to work in Hong Kong, and
 no government-issued press cards.
 The media continued to operate as they had earlier. Newspapers published with-
 out obvious reprisals. There was neither a sharp increase nor decrease of critical
 coverage. Some stories that were sensitive for China, such as a bombing in Xinjiang,
 were first reported in the Hong Kong newspapers. However, China continued to re-
 quire 1ournalists-both foreign and those from Hong Kong-to apply for permission
 to make reporting trips to the mainland. Those who bypassed official channels-
 which many felt they must do to get the stories they wanted-ran a risk of violating
 Chinese regulations. At least one Hong Kong publication, Apple Daily (whose owner,
 Jimmy Lai, offended China's leadership several years ago) subsequently was unable
 to get officialpermission for his reporters to cover events on the mainland. Lai also
 ran into problems in arranging for an initial public offering of stock in his compa-
 nies. Investment banks and brokerage firms, wary of offending Beijing, reportedly
 refused to handle Lai's stock floatation. For the most part, however, Hong Kong re-
 porters continued to enter China to cover sensitive stories related to Hong Kong,
 Taiwan, or the mainland.
 The Basic Law provides for freedom of speech, of the press, and of publication,
 but it also directs Hong Kong to pass laws prohibiting "treason, secession, sedition,
 subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets." The
 Hong Kong administration has said it does not plan to submit proposals for such
 legislation until after the election of a new legislature next year. On October 10,
 which was National Day in China before 1949 and continues to be observed in Tai-
 wan, police removed flags of the pre-1949 Chinese government (still used by the
 Taiwan authorities) that appeared in public places, and the Chief Executive warned
 that laws would be enacted making it a crime to advocate Taiwanese or Tibetan
 independence. Hong Kong observations of the October 10 National Day were allowed
 and were held without incident. Stories about removal of the flags, as well as photos
 of flags that were not removed, ran prominently in the media. Shortly after rever-
 
 
 sin, the Hong Kong Journalists Association criticized the Government for giving
 China Central Television favorable treatment in covering handover events and spe-
 cial access to the Chief Executive's early official appearances.
 Some polls suggest that both journalists and the public believed that there was
 self-censorship: Over one-third of journalists interviewed in May said that they
 practiced self-censorship in muting criticism of China or large Hong Kong compa-
 nies. According to a September poll, nearly half the public thought that the media
 practiced self-censorship, and two-thirds believed that the media were reluctant to
 criticize China. However, it was difficult to verify specific instances in which self-
 censorship killed a story. The pressures on journalists were subtle-there were no
 direct orders to refrain from writing, but there was a wide perception of a need for
 special care toward topics of particular sensitivity to China: Leadership dynamics,
 military activity, or advocacy of Taiwanese or Tibetan independence. Chinese-lan-
 guage journalists reported a pervasive, if tacit, understanding that editors expected
 those reporting on China to be particularly certain of their facts and careful in their
 wording. Another source of pressure came from the belief by some publishers and
 editors that advertising revenues could suffer if they were seen to be too antagonis-
 tic to China in their editorial judgments. In spite of censorship concerns, the film
 "Gate of Heavenly Peace," banned in China because of its graphic and critical cov-
 erage of the Tiananmen incident, continued to play in Hong Kong after June.
 In 1994 Ming Pao journalist and Chinese national Xi Yang was taken into custody
 in China for reporting economic data that China deemed state secrets. His arrest
 was widely cited as having had a chilling effect on Hong Kong media. He was re-
 leased from prison in February, 9 years before the end of his sentence. The next
 day, Ming Pao ran an editorial thanking China for showing "leniency" and added
 that Xi Yang's release "has dispelled misgivings." However, local newspapers re-
 ported that after a document leaked from the 15th Chinese Communist Party Con-
 gress in September, two Beijing correspondents for HongKong newspapers were de-
 tained. One, a Hong Kong resident reporting for MingPao was reportedly held for
 2 days, and the other, a mainland resident with Ta Kung Pao, for 2 months. The
 stories were not confirmed by the reporters' employers. However, journalists ex-
 pressed concern about continuing control of Hong Xong-affiliated reporters working
 on the mainland, and abeut Hong Kong self-ensorship in reporting on the Septem-
 ber incident.
 In 1995 the Government introduced a code on access to information to govern the
 provision of information by government agencies. The code was extended to the en-
 tire Government in December 1996. It specifies what information must be made
 available routinely to the public and provides rules for dealing with requests for ac-
 cess to government information. Previously, no laws existed to clarify what informa-
 tion would be made available. The code requires that government departments re-
 lease information to the public unless there is a valid reason to withhold it. A de-
 partment may withhold "sensitive" information in such areas as defense, security,
 external affairs, or law enforcement. Guidelines for access to information are pro-
 vided to the public on an Internet web page.
 Delays in sreening three commercial films critical of China led some observers
 to cite the local movie industry for cultural self-ensorship--a charge the industry
 denied. A distributor said on December 3 that the film "Red Corner" would play in
 Februay or March 1998, and the Motion Picture Industry Association, stressing
 that decisions were made on a commercial basis, stated that distributors were also
 making bids to bring in "Seven Years in Tibet" and "Kundun" by March. Secretary
 for Broadcasting, Culture, and Sport Brian Chau stated in October that there was
 nothing to prevent these movies from being shown in Hong Kong.
 The Government respects academic freedom. There is a wide range of opinions in
 lively   r debate on campuses, and the issue of academic freedom has not generally
 caused much public comment. Prior to reversion, Professor Nihal Jayawickrama,
 chairman of the Hong Kong section of the International Commission of Jurists and
 an eminent authority on human rights law, applied to extend his appointment at
 Hong Kong University beyond retirement age but his request was rejected. Some
 persons suggested that Jayawickrama was denied because of his political activism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and of
 association arepracticed without significant hindrance.
 In March under a provision of the Basic Law, the Standing Committee of the Na-
 tional People's Congress made a determination as to which existing Hong Kong laws
 were contrary to the Basic Law and would notap a   fter July 1. Its move to alter
 the 1991 Bill of Rights Ordinance and scrap recently liberalized laws on demonstra-
 tions and political parties caused an outcry. After public consultations, the Chief Ex-
 ecutive-designate announced proposals for amending the ordinances concerned in a
 manner less restrictive than in initial plans or older colonial laws. The Public Order
 
 
 Ordinance reintroduced licensing for demonstrations and empowered the police to
 raise objections on national security grounds, but in practice it resembled a notifica-
 tion system. The Societies Ordinance reintroduced registration of parties and
 banned ties between them and foreign political groups. Critics acknowledged the im-
 provement on earlier plans but attacked the ban on foreign funding of political par-
 ties and the inclusion of national security grounds for prohibiting demonstrations
 or parties. They also faulted changes in the Bill of Rights Law stripping it of its
 overriding status in jurisprudence, although lawyers noted that it and the common
 law would still protect civil rights.
 Many persons feared that the Government might use the Public Order Ordinance
 to curtail freedom of assembly. However, demonstrations continued to take place
 regularly after July 1. The night of the handover, the Democratic Party organized
 a speech from the balcony of the legislative council building, and nobody was de-
 tained. The Government noted on September 15 that 150 demonstrations had oc-
 curred since reversion, averaing 2 a day, without any arrests. There was some
 scuffling with police and five demonstrators were arrested during World Bank meet-
 ings on September 22. Some Hong Kong activists note that police personnel some-
 times outnumber demonstrators at a demonstration. However, residents continued
 to exercise their right of assembly.
 Many persons also feared that the Government would use the Societies Ordinance
 to restrict political activity by forcing parties to sever ties with political groups
 abroad or curtailing activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). In turn,
 Chief Executive Tung expressed concern lest Hong Kong be used by foreign groups
 as a base of subversion against China. After the handover, however, the Govern-
 ment took no action to restrict the operations of parties, other political organiza-
 tions, or NGO's. Freedom of association continues.
 However, Democratic Party officials independent politicians, and human rights
 advocates continued to be concerned that restrictions in the revised statutes could
 later be used to curtail freedom of assembly and association, particularly in dealing
 with critics of the Government or of China.
 The Basic Law provides that Hong Kong shall enact laws on its own to prohibit
 subversion, secession, treason, and sedition against the Chinese government. In No-
 vember 1996, the Government introduced an amendment to the Crime Ordinance
 addressing these infractions. China objected because it had not agreed to the lan-
 guage, adding that the new government, not the pre-handover government, should
 enact the new provisions. The outgoing Legislative Council on June 23 defeated
 crime ordinance provisions on subversion and sedition, but on June 24 passed lan-
 guage on treason. The Chief Executive-designate said that the new government
 would not accept the legislation, and that the potentially controversial task of
 amending the Crime Ordinance to comply with the Basic Law would fall to the Leg-
 islative Council elected in May 1998.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Bill of Rights Ordinance prohibits religious discrimi-
 nation. Following the handover, the Basic Law provides that the Government re-
 spect religious freedom and activities. Government policy and general practice en-
 sure freedom of religion. The Chief Executive has pledged that the Government
 would restrict neither religious belief nor religious social and educational activities.
 Some religious leaders noted that the Basic Law, which calls for ties between
 Hong Kong and mainland religious organizations to be based on "nonsubordination,
 noninterference and mutual respect," could be used to limit such contacts. Following
 a visit to China in June, local Catholic leaders expressed increased confidence in the
 situation in Hong Kong and hoped for closer ties with the church on the mainland.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within Hong Kong, and travel docu-
 ments are freely and easily obtained. The Special Administrative Region passport
 became Hong Kong's official passport on July 1. Demand for the passport far out-
 strips the Government's output, but every effort is made to fill applications for pass-
 ports for emergency travel and priority is given to applicants whose previous travel
 documents have expired. Present production is 2,000 pass prts a day. The British
 National Overseas passport is still valid. However, the British Dependent Terri-
 tories Citizen passport ceased to be valid on June 30. Those holding that document
 were advised to apply for British National Overseas Passports before July 1. Indi-
 viduals eligible to receive the British document but who missed the deadline and
 are Chinese nationals with the right of abode in Hong Kong may apply for the Hong
 Kong Special Administrative Region passport.
 Persons from Taiwan must apply to Hong Kong immigration through specified air-
 lines for an entry permit valid for 1 year or 3 years. Those persons from Taiwan
 but residing elsewhere must secure a declaration of identity issued by a notary pub-
 lic or apply to a Chinese diplomatic or consular mission for a Chinese travel permit;
 
 
 748
 Chinese missions issue visas to those with either of these documents. Procedures
 are the same for official and nonofficial travelers from Taiwan. As was the case be-
 fore July 1, the Taiwan passport is not recognized as valid for visa endorsement
 pur ses.
 Chinese authorities do not permit a number of Hong Kong human rights activists
 to visit the mainland. A well-known Chinese labor organizer and political dissident,
 Han Dongfang, remains in Hong Kong. The Chinese Government continues to refuse
 him entry into China as it has ever since his expulsion from China in 1993.
 On July 9, the Provisional Legislature passed a bill requiring mainland-born chil-
 dren claiming the right of abode through their parentage to obtain prior endorse-
 ment by China. About 2,000 minors in this category were already in Hong Kong;
 an estimated 66,000 remained in China. Human rights activists claimed that the
 statute violated the Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Basic Law. The Government
 responded that the issue was at the heart of Hong Kong's immigration policy and
 orerly admission program, and that the Basic Law gives China tha duty of screen-
 ing all mainland Chinese admitted to Hong Kong. The High Court found for the
 Government on October 9; further appeal is expected.
 Hong Kong has never refused first asylum to Vietnamese boat people. Prior to
 June 1988, refugee status was automatically accorded them. Since then asylum
 seekers have been screened to determine their status and held in detention centers
 awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to Vietnam. From October
 1996 to September 1997, 6,225 persons were voluntarily repatriated to Vietnam
 through the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There
 were 4,887 people repatriated under the (involuntary) Orderly Return Program from
 October 1996 to September 1997.
 Some 2,350 Vietnamese remained in Hong Kong camps in October. 1,300 were
 screened-in as refugees who, mostly for reasons of health or criminal acts, had not
 been resettled. Over 1,000 are Vietnamese illegal migrants who are not screened-
 in and thus awaiting rpatriation.
 There are also 288 Vietnamese illegal migrants who were formerly in Chia in
 Hng Kong. Ten of them sued against their detention; on September 26, a Hong
 Kong udge ruled in their favor. Another court ruling on October 15 freed the other
 278. Their future is uncertain because the Government wants to repatriate them to
 the mainland, but China has said it would not take them back. The number of ille-
 al mainland Chinese immigrants has been estimated to be at least 15,000. During
 997 the Government returned illegal Chinese immigrants to China at the rate of
 54 per day. Only rarely, when a person qualifies as a refugee under the inter-
 national agreement on the status of refugees, is permission to remain in Hong Kong
 granted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the prehandover Government moved to democratize district and munici-
 pal boards and the Legislative Council, residents did not have the right to change
 the government. Residents ability to exercise this right remained limited after the
 handover. In the prehandover Government the governor was appointed by and
 served at the pleasure of the British Crown. He was advised on plicy by an Execu-
 tive Council, which he appointed. Until 1985 the Legislative Council was also an
 advisory body whose members were either appinted by the Governor or served in
 their capacity as senior civil servants. Hong Kong remains a free society with most
 individual freedoms and rights protected by law and custom.
 The Legislative Council enacted and funded legislation and also debated policy
 and questioned the administration. Although the Legislative Council's power to i-
 tiate legislation was limited (all bills with budgetary implications had to be ap-
 p roved by the Government before introduction), it became increasingly assertive.
 The Go vernor had ultimate control of the administration of Hong Kong but, by con-
 vention, rarely exercised his full powers. In practice, decisions were reached by con-
 sensus. Political parties and independent candidates were free to contest seats in
 free and fair elecons. Representative government employing universal franchise ex-
 isted at the local district bard level.
 China oppsed the Hong Kong Government's 1994-95 election reforms, through
 which all district and municipal bead members were chosen by direct elections, and
 all seats in the Legislative Council were chosen by direct or indirect balloting. Cit-
 ing Britain's unilateral decision on the reforms, China said that the Legislative
 Council would "terminate" on June 30, along with the district and municiar boards.
 In March 1996, China's Preparatory Committee said that a prvisional eglature
 would be formed to serve for up to 1 year after reversion until a new legislature
 could be elected. In December 1996, a selection committee of 400 named C.H. Tung
 
 
 749
 as Chief Executive and chose a 60-seat provisional legislature, including 33 of 34
 sitting lawmakers who sought inclusion. Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which de-
 dined to seek seats in what it deemed an illegitimate body, believed that the proc-
 ess did not have a legal foundation, lacked transparency, was not based on a free
 and fair election, and excluded groups, parties, and individuals critical of China.
 In April the Provisional Legi sature began working across the border in Shenzhen.
 The Preparatory Committee and Chief Executive-designate directed it to focus on
 urgent transition business: To organize 1998 legislative elections, determine nation-
 ality and right of abode, and enact the new versions of laws voided by the Standing
 Committee of the National People's Congress (Societies and Public Order statutes).
 The period from April to June saw much political tension and legal uncertainty as
 the Legislative Council, the Provisional Legislature, the prehandover government,
 and the Chief Executive-designate's office contested these issues, as well as legisla-
 tion concerning labor, subversion, secession, and treason.
 The Legislative Council was dissolved at midnight on June 30. The Provisional
 Legislature, sworn in shortly after midnight, passed an Omnibus Reunification Or-
 dinance before dawn on July 1 to enact new laws that it had drafted and passed
 earlier and to provide for administrative and legal continuity. Court cases chal-
 lenged the constitutionality of the Provisional Legislature and the validity of its
 laws, but the High Court on July 23 upheld the new government's position that the
 legislature and laws were valid. The Court of Final Appeal is also expected to rule
 on the case.
 The Chief Executive pledged to hold elections in May 1998 for a new legislative
 council, and the Provisional Legislature in September passed a bill based on govern-
 ment proposals. As in 1995, 20 seats are to come from geographic districts through
 universal suffrage, 30 from functional (occupational) constituencies, and 10 from
 votes by a committee of local elected officials. Hong Kong's Democratic Party and
 independents criticized the bill for replacing the 1995 single-vote, single-seat system
 for geographic seats with a proportional system which they claim will cut down on
 the number of their members elected and help smaller, pro-China parties win seats
 in the geographic constituencies. They also criticized the replacement of nine broad
 1995 functional constituencies with more narrowly drawn groups akin to pre-1995
 groups, cutting the total number ofptential voters in functiona constituencies from
 2.7 million to 180,000. However, the Chief Executive's appointment in September
 of an electoral affairs commission to supervise the elections was well received; two
 of the three nominees, including a distinguished jurist as chair, had served on the
 Election and Boundary Commission for the previous government. Similarly, there
 was general acceptance of the electoral districts proposed in October by the Commis-
 sion. The Constitutional Affairs Bureau prepared for May elections and initiated a
 campaign to increase voter turnout, which had been just below 1 million in Septem-
 ber 1995, well below the more than 4 million potential voters. Under this system,
 and in the current circumstances, it is unlikely that any single party could win con-
 trol of the legislature through the electoral process.
 The Basic Law provides for elections for chief executive in 2002 and 2007, by a
 "broadly representative election committee" of 800 local residents appointed by
 China. The Basic Law also permits amendment of the chief executive selection proc-
 ess after 2007 by a two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council, with the consent
 of the Chief Executive and the Standing Committee of the National People's Con-
 gress, with a goal of universal suffrage.
 The prehandover Government continued efforts to place local persons in senior
 government positions and fulfilled its commitment to fill all "principal official" posts
 with local officers by 1997. All 23 principal officer posts (Chief Secretary, Financial
 Secretary, Secretary for Justice, 15 branch secretaries, Commissioner of the Inde-
 pendent Commission against Corruption, Director of Audit, Commissioner of Police,
 Director of Immigration, and Commissioner of Customs and Excise) are now filled
 by local officers. The last expatriate principal officer (Attorney General) was re-
 placed by a local resident on July 1. All other principal officers continued in their
 positions through July 1. As of July 1, 82 percent of the top directorate-level jobs
 and 93 percent of administrative and other senior management positions were filled
 by local staff.
 Nevertheless, expatriates remain in key positions in the Legal Department and
 the judiciary-, at the same time, 76 percent of the government counsel positions and
 83 percent of the police positions (police inspector and above) are filled by local offi-
 cers.
 Women are playing a larger role in politics, with larger numbers running for pub-
 lic office in 1996 and 1997 than ever before. In early 1997, women constituted 12
 percent of the Legislative Council; they make up 15 percent of the Provisional Legis-
 
 
 750
 lature. Women account for 25 percent of the to p government directorate-level posts,
 and 46 percent of government administrative officers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Until reversion, the international covenants on civil and political rights, and on
 economic, social, and cultural rights applied, with certain restrictions, to Hong Kong
 through the United Kingdom. The Basic Law provides that these covenants continue
 to apply to Hong Kong. China stated in October 1996 that it did not consider itself
 obligated to file reports to the United Nations on implementation of the agreements
 i Hong Kong because China is not a signator. However, on October 27, 1997,
 China signed the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and, on No-
 vember 22, China announced that it would submit reports under both Covenants to
 the United Nations under the principle of "one country, two systems." Procedures
 for preparation and submission of the required reports are unclear. Hong Kong resi-
 dents have expressed interest in participating in the drafting process and have ex-
 pressed concern about the possible role of the National People's Congress in the
 process.
 The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women
 was extended to Hong Kong in October; HongKong and China have agreed on re-
 porting under both this convention and the Convention on the Elimination of All
 Forms of Racial Discrimination.
 Dozens of local and international NGO's operated freely in Hong Kong before re-
 version, and, despite earlier concerns about possible restrictions under the revised
 Societies Ordinance, continued to operate without hindrance after the handover.
 These organizations have thriving contacts with the Hong Kong community and
 with groups overseas. Government officials are cooperative and responsive to their
 views. In September China denied accreditation to attend the World Bank meeting
 in Hong Kong to two international human rights organizations that had been criti-
 cal of its human rights record.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 After the passage of laws in 1995 banning discrimination on the basis of sex and
 disability, an Equal Opportunities Commission was established. The Commission
 began its oversight of nonemployment and employment-related provisions in 1996.
 Women's groups and others have criticized the Commission for passivity in combat-
 ing discrimination and for emphasizing conciliation instead of acting as a watchdog
 or pursuing court cases. However, the Government has begun to bring cases against
 discriminatory employment advertisements.
 On June 26, the Legislative Council enacted the Family Status Discrimination Or-
 dinance, which protects people whose marital status changes, who have children, or
 who are responsible for caring for another family member, such as a child or elderly
 person; enforcement began in November. However, the Legislative Council voted
 down bills banning discrimination on grounds of age, race, and sexual orientation-
 the second time such legislation has been defeated since 1995.
 Chinese has equal status with English in most government operations but not in
 judicial proceedings, where almost all civil cases and most criminal cases are heard
 in English. To help remedy this, the Government has increased the number of offi-
 cers in the Legal Aid Department proficient in Chinese from 3 (of 9) to 10 (of 11).
 A 1996 pilot scheme for simultaneous interpretation in some court proceedings
 failed, but the Government extended the use of bilingual prosecution documents and
 indictments. All laws were translated into Chinese by the time of the handover, and
 the High Court in August heard the first jury trial ever conducted in Cantonese.
 By September 30, about 180 law clerks and legal aid counsel had attended Chinese
 writing courses; training has also stressed advocacy in Chinese. According to the
 Basic Law, English may be used as an official language by the executive authorities,
 legislature, and judiciary.
 Women.-Violence against women remains a significant problem. The only law to
 protect battered women is the 1987 Domestic Violence Ordinance, which allows a
 woman to seek a 3-month injunction against her husband (extendible to 6 months).
 Domestic violence may also be prosecuted as common assault. The Government en-
 forces the laws and prosecutes violators. It also funds programs such as family life
 education counseling, a hot line service, temporary housing, legal aid, and child pro-
 tective services.
 Many women do not seek help when subjected to violence; it goes unreported be-
 cause of cultural factors and inadequate information about available assistance and
 resources. To address this, the Government set up a working group on battered
 
 
 spouses in 1995; crafted multidisciplinary procedural guidelines on handling bat-
 tered spouse cases in 1996; and initiated public education and media programs. A
 statistical information system began in April to collect data on battered spouse cases
 from concerned departments and NGO's. Women's action groups continue to urge
 better legal protection for battered wives. A total of 334 new battered spouse cases
 were handled by the Social Welfare Department and NGO's in 1996.
 The general incidence of rape is low. There were 100 cases in 1994, 103 in 1995,
 86 in 1996, and 56 from January to September.
 Women have faced significant discrimination in employment, salary, welfare, in-
 heritance, and promotion (see Section 6.e.). An October survey found that although
 most employers no longer specify sex in recruitment advertising, they often reject
 applicants of both sexes based on job stereotypes. According to government statistics
 for 1996, unemployment in all age groups among female workers was lower than
 for male workers. As a result of 1994 revisions to traditional inheritance statutes,
 the law treats men and women equally in inheritance matters.
 During 1991-95, the number of female secondary student candidates who took
 university advanced-level examinations accounted for between 51 and 55 percent of
 the total, and the number of female candidates who matriculated at universities ac-
 counted for between 52 and 56 percent of all matriculating candidates. Women are
 also entering fields such as medicine in greater numbers; at the University of Hong
 Kong, the proportion of female medical students in 1996-97 was 41 percent, up from
 32 percent the year before, although there continued to be few women in specialties
 like surgery.
 Children.-The Government is firmly committed to children's rights and welfare
 through well-funded systems of public education, medical care, and protective serv-
 ices. It supports programs for custody, protection, day care, foster care, shelters,
 small group homes, and assistance to families.
 Child abuse and exploitation have not been considered widespread. However, the
 Government said in 1996 that the number of child abuse cases had almost doubled
 in 2 years. In 1995 the police set up a child abuse investigation unit to improve
 treatment of victims, and legislation was passed making it easier for abused chil-
 dren to testify in court. Legal penalties for mistreatment r neglect of minors were
 also substantially increased. In 1996 the Government set up an interviewing suite
 for recording statements in a child-friendly environment a a  adopted multidisci-
 plinary measures for child sexual abuse cases. A witness support program was also
 launched in 1996 to help child witnesses in need. A child witness information kit
 in Chinese, with books explaining legal and court proceedings was published in
 April to help reduce anxit and a Child Care Center Bill was passed in May to
 prevent unsuitable persons from providing child care services and to facilitate the
 formation of mutual help child care groups.
 People With Disabilities.-Advocacy groups claim that discrimination against the
 physically and mentally disabled persists in employment, education, and the provi-
 sion of some state services. Access to public buildings and transportation is a prob-
 lem; a spot survey in 1996 found tha of 20 footbridges, only 3 had ramps on bth
 sides, and that of 100 commercial buildings, half had inadequate facilities. Advo-
 cates have urged the Government to do more to encourage greater public acceptance
 of the physically and mentally disabled. The Government has been responsive,
 suing programs to promote public awareness. The 1995 Antidiscrimination w
 called for improved building access and sanctions against those who discriminate.
 An amended buildings ordinance in 1997 updated design requirements. In October
 the Government ordered a large shopping center to reinstate facilities for the dis-
 abled after inspectors found handrails removed, a ramp blocked, and toilets locked.
 The Government has also begun an integrated work extension program in sheltered
 workshops, increased funding for the mentally disabled, expanded vocational assess-
 ment and training, and conducted education programs on rehabilitation. There are
 about 4,600 disabled persons employed as civil servants of a total civil service work
 force of 184,638-about 2.5 percent; there are approximately 9,000 disabled persons
 in school of a total student population of 919,620-just under 1 percent. In 1997 the
 Government started a special university admission scheme for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Racial, sex, and class discrimination against
 Filipino women, 136,000 of whom work under contract in Hong Kong, has been the
 focus of news reports. In May the Asian Migrants' Coordinating Body, a newly
 formed group representing Asian domestic workers, sought assurances of continued
 protection for foreign workers' rights after the handover. The Chief Executive stated
 that Filipino domestic workers would continue to be welcome members of Hong
 Kong's work force, and no change in their status took place after reversion.
 
 
 Ethnic Indians without Indian citizenship had been concerned about their future
 nationality and right of abode status; however, the United Kingdom decided to issue
 British citizenship and passports to several thousand stateless Hong Kong residents.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right of association and the
 right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. Trade
 unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic pre-
 condition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same oc-
 cupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1996, 22 new trade unions were registered. By the end of 1996, there were
 552 trade unions: 535 employees' unions and 17 mixed organizations of employees
 and employers. By year's end, over 22 percent of Hong Kong's 3.1 million salaried
 employees and wage earners belonged to a labor organization.
 Work stoppage and strikes are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. In 1996 there were 17 strikes involving 1,763 work-
 ers. Even though employees have the freedom to strike and there is no legislative
 prohibition of strikes, in practice, most workers must sign employment contracts
 that typically state that walking off the job is a breach of contract and can lead to
 summary dismissal.
 To date, Hong Kong has amended labor legislation and taken administrative
 measures to apply 49 International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions. In the
 Basic Law, China committed to adhere to these conventions.
 Labor unions may form federations and confederations. In the past such affiliation
 could not be cross-industry in scope. However, on October 29, the Provisional Legis-
 lature passed a government-proposed legislative amendment lifting that prohibition.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies although limitations exist. A bill
 passed in the final days of the prereversion legislature removed a long-standing re-
 quirement that unions must seek the Government's approval prior to affiliating with
 foreign organizations. However, the Provisional Legislature on October 29_passed
 government-proposed amendments requiring unions to notify the Labor Depart-
 ment's Registrar of Trade Unions within 1 month of joining a foreign labor organiza-
 tion and to seek approval of the majority of their voting members before establish-
 ing links to foreign labor organizations. The amendments also require that a union
 first receive the approval of the Chief Executive before becoming a member of a for-
 eign organization other than those for workers, employers and relevant professional
 organizations. Finally, the amendments require that labor unions obtain the Chief
 Executive's approval to contribute or donate funds to any trade union outside of
 Hong Kong and prohibit the use of trade union funds for political purposes.
 b. 7he Right to Organize and Bargain Colletively.-The ILO Convention on the
 Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively has been applied to Hong Kong without
 modification since 1975. Labor union representatives in the prehandover legislature
 sought, shortly before the handover, to make collective bargaining-not a statutory
 requirement under the onvention-and related practies in Hong Kong a right of
 labor unions for the first time, by passing an ordinance requiring that unions rep-
 resenting 15 percent or more of a company's total work force in companies with over
 50 employees have a right to collective bargnining procedures.
 On October 29, the  rvision  Legislature passed government-sponsored legisla-
 tion to repeal the ordinance, which it ared was not conducive to industrial har-
 mony andwa hastily passed with out adequate onsultation with affected parties.
 The ILO has warned that it would look into any formal complaints lodged by union
 members over government actions to repeal or amend collective bargaining and
 other labor laws. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions also criti-
 cized the Government's actions.
 With the repeal of the short-lived collective bargaining legislation, the
 prehandover framework continued: There were no laws that stipulated collective
 bargaining on a mandatory basis. Wage rates in a few trades like tailoring and car-
 pentry were determined collectively in accordance with established trade practices
 and customs rather than as a statutory mechanism.
 In practice, collective bargaining is not widely practiced. Unions generally are not
 powerful enough to force management to engage in collective bargaining. The Gov-
 ernment does not encourage it, since the Government itself does not engage in col-
 lective bargaining with civil servant" unions but merely "consults" with them. Free
 nonbinding conciliation services are afforded by the Labor Relations Division of the
 Department of Labor to employers and employees involved in disputes that may in-
 volve statutory benefits and protection in employment as well as arrears of wages,
 wages instead of notice or severance pay. The Department of Labor takes a positive
 atti9tude towards the participation of trade unions in such dispute negotiations. In
 
 
 1996 the Labor Relations Division handled 226 trade disputes and 22,840 claims,
 more than half of which arose from termination of contract or dismissal cases. About
 65 percent of these trade disputes and claims were settled through conciliation by
 the-Labor Relations Division.
 The Employment Ordinance includes provisions protecting against antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employees who allege such discrimination have the right to have their
 cases heard by the Department of Labor's Labor Relations Division. Violation of the
 antiunion discrimination provisions is a criminal offense carrying a maximum fine
 of $2,564. However, employers are not required to reinstate or compensate employ-
 ees.
 Another law passed by the prereversion legislature shortly before it was dis-
 banded sought to strengthen the antidiscrimination clauses within the Employment
 Ordinance. On October 29, however, the Provisional Legislature passed a govern-
 ment-proposed bill to repeal the measure. The Government argued that existing law
 already offered adequate protection against unfair dismissal arising from antiunion
 discrimination.
 Critics also point to a lack of protection for over 164,000 Filipino, Thai, Indo-
 nesian, and other foreign national domestic workers who face deportation if dis-
 missed by their employers and are thus vulnerable to abuse.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The use of forced labor is prohib-
 ited in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. While this legislation does not spe-
 cifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, there are no reports of such
 practices in Hong Kong.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Em-
 ployment of Children Regulations prohibit employment of children under the age of
 15 in any industrial establishment. Children 13 and 14 years of age may be em-
 ployed in certain nonindustrial establishments, subject to conditions aimed at ensur-
 ing a minimum of 9 years' education and protecting their safety, health, and wel-
 fare. In 1996 the Labor Department conducted 115,877 inspections of industrial
 workplaces and only 5 cases of underage workers were discovered. A total of 33,892
 inspections of nonindustrial workplaces uncovered only 11 cases of child employ-
 ment. While provisions against forced or compulsory labor do not specifically refer
 to children, such practices appear not to exist (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage except
 for foreign domestic workers. As of December 1996, the minimum wage for such
 workers is about $500 (HK$ 3,860) a month. Because the law also requires employ-
 ers to provide foreign domestic workers with housing, worker's compensation insur-
 ance, travel allowances, and meals or a meal allowance in addition to the minimum
 wage, foreign domestic workers have a decent standard of living.
 Aside from a small number of trades where a uniform wage structure exists, wage
 levels are customarily fixed by individual agreement between employer and em-
 ployee and are determined by supply and demand. Some employers provide workers
 with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment and free subsidized trans-
 port.
 In order to omply with pro visions in the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, as of
 mid-July prvisions in the Women and Young Persons (Industry) Regulations that
 had prohibited women from joining dangerous industrial trades and limited their
 working hours, including compulsory weekly rest days, were dropped. Work hours
 for young people 15 to 17 years of age in the manufacturing sector remain limited
 to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 n.m. and 11p.m. Overtime is prohibited
 for all persons under the age of 18 in industrial establishments. Employment in
 dangerous trades is prohibited for youths except in the case of males 16 to 17 years
 of age. The Labor Inspectrate conducts workplace inspections to enforce compliance
 with these regulations.
 Hong Kons Factory Inspectorate Division was restructured in May 1996 as part
 of a government effort to strengthen its safety and health promotion and enforce-
 ment program. The new division-part of a new occupational safety and health
 branch of the Labor Department--comprises four units: An operations division cov-
 ering field services such as safety and health advice; a support services division re-
 sponsible for technical support services; a planning and training division; and a
 legal servies division charged withprocessing and conducting prosecutions.
 The Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance adits 27 sets of subsidi-
 ary regulations regulate safety and health conditions. The Labor Department con-
 ducted nearly 150,000 inspections of industrial and nonindustrial workplaces in
 1996 as part of its enforcement efforts. In 1996 a total of 40,251 industrial accidents
 were reported, of which 66 were fatal. Employers are required under the Employee's
 Compensation Ordinance to report any injuries sustained by their employees in
 
 
 work-related accidents. There is no specific legal provision allowing workers to re-
 move themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued em-
 ployment.
