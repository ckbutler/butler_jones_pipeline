 WESTERN SAMOA
 
 The South Pacific Island state of Western Samoa
 has attempted to maintain its strong Polynesian cultural
 traditions by blending its traditional system of authority
 (through family and clan titled heads) with an overlay
 of democratic practices and principles. The result is
 a modified parliamentary democracy with suffrage limited
 to approximatgely 10,000 matais (elected heads of ex-
 tended family groups). As with other South Pacific states,
 extensive authority is vested in village and local govern-
 ments. Consequently the expression of political and
 personal freedoms is greatest at the village level, where
 family members have the opportunity to express their
 views, but is more restricted at the national level
 where access is granted only to those who hold titles.
 Nevertheless the constitution guarantees broad individual
 rights which are respected within the framework of the
 traditional system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and custom.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 is illegal and not practiced or condoned. There are no
 summary executions. Treatment of prisoners is fair and
 humane.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Western Samoa.
 Preventive detention does not exist. Persons are not
 held clandestinely and do not disappear.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by
 law and is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel and may consult freedly and in private with
 counsel. Most cases are heard by the Magistrate's
 Court, and appeals are heard by the Court of Appeals,
 which follows procedures similar to most British courts.
 Western Samoa's courts are free of executive or military
 control, and there are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home both
 in constitutional and customary law.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Village agriculture is the predominant economic
 activity of Western Samoa. Both subsistence agricul-
 ture and cash cropping have provided most Western Samoans
 with adequate food and shelter. The national education
 system is supplemented by mission schools. District
 hospitals and rural health centers are supported by govern-
 ment. These services are provided to the maximum extent
 possible under the modest national budget.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed and observed in practice.
 There are both private and government-published newspapers.
 Radio is government-owned and operated. Television pro-
 grams Broadcast in American Samoa can be received in Western
 Samoa. There are no impediments to assembly or to freedom
 of association.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Western Samoans are free to travel within the country
 and abroad. Passport fees are not excessive.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As previously noted, major political decisions in
 Western Samoa are made by the'titular family heads, rep-
 resenting the rest of the population. Membership in the
 legislative assembly (47 members) is similarly limited
 to family heads, although there are two at large seats
 whose members are selected by universal suffrage by those
 Western Samoans who do not have traditional family ties.
 At independence in 1962 the two holders of the highest
 ranking traditional titles were made joint Heads of State
 for life, subject to resignation or removal from office.
 One of the two has since died, and the surviving sole
 head of state continues to hold his largely ceremonial
 office. His successors will be elected to five year
 terms by the legislature. The head of government is
 a prime minister elected by the legislature from its
 membership. Elections were last held in 1979. Women
 hold chiefly titles and are elected to high office.
 They play a significant role in the political arena.
 There is no organized labor movement in Western
 Samoa.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 We are unaware of any such allegations against the
 Western Samoa Government or of any requests for inves-
 tigation.
