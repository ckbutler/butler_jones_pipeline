 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been dominated by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 1929. Periodic
 political reform has expanded the opposition's role and stake
 in the political system. PRI has, nevertheless,continued its
 preponderant political control throughout the Republic through
 a combination of voting strength, organizational power and,
 some opposition parties and observers allege, by electoral
 fraud.
 Mexico has a "mixed economy," which combines elements of
 domestic market capitalism with state ownership of major
 industries. Through a program of divestiture of some
 parastatals, the Government may be increasing the role of the
 private sector in the economy.
 The 1917 Constitution stipulates that powers be divided among a
 bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive. The
 President's powers, however, far outweigh those of the other
 branches in Mexico's highly centralized system. Despite the
 tendency toward centralization of authority, municipal, state
 and federal police exercise authority only in their respective
 areas of jurisdiction.
 A high degree of individual freedom,-regardless of race, creed,
 color or sex, is both guaranteed by Mexico's 1917 Constitution
 and honored in practice. Freedom of association is
 demonstrated by the existence of numerous political parties as
 well as civic associations. Freedom to pursue private
 interests and hold private property is virtually unrestricted
 for Mexicans.
 Mexico is currently experiencing human rights difficulties
 principally but not exclusively in those areas of law
 enforcement involved with drug trafficking. Human rights
 violations have occurred in some instances, including torture,
 to which U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent
 Victor Cortez was subjected in August in Guadalajara. In
 addition, the perennial rural conflicts over title to land
 continue to result in the deaths of peasants who confront
 local landowners and their employees. While serious human
 rights abuses continue in a number of areas, the Government
 has taken steps to improve the human rights situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In Mexico's rural states, especially Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz,
 Hidalgo, and Guerrero, disputes over land take place and
 violence sometimes occurs. The Federal Government is
 continuing its efforts to curb such violence. Attorneys
 General from the various states meet frequently with national
 law enforcement and Secretariat of the Interior officials to
 pursue this goal. Local municipal leaders, especially those
 beholden to influential private landowners, allegedly place a
 low priority on the protection of human rights.
 During 1986 peasant organizations charged that at least 42
 peasants were killed in confrontations in the above states.
 Such charges have come not only from independent peasant
 organizations, but also from the PRI-affiliated National
 
 
 560
 MEXICO
 Confederation of Peasants (CNC). The independent groups
 attribute the killings to persons employed by local landed
 political bosses (caciques), as well as to members of the CNC
 and to local police. For its part, the CNC blames fatalities
 in its ranks to independent unions, encouraged, it says, by
 leftist political activists. Others, however, suggest that
 most CNC casualties stem from internal CNC power struggles.
 Amnesty International detailed various alleged instances of
 political killings in Oaxaca and Chiapas in its May 1986
 publication, "Mexico: Human Rights in Rural Areas." In its
 official response to Amnesty's charges, the Mexican Government
 was critical of what it said was false reporting. The
 Government asserted its willingness to investigate fully those
 allegations which are substantiated with details. As an
 example of government efforts to curb rural violence, on
 January 3, 1987 the private Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Jalapa announced that a powerful landowner in the
 northern mountainous area of Veracruz, Luis Mendoza Rivera,
 had been placed in prison and was to be held answerable for
 incidents of rural violence which allegedly took place in
 December.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1986 Federal Deputy Rosario Ibarra continued to focus
 attention on Mexico's disappeared, especially those from the
 administrations of former Presidents Echeverria (1970-76) and
 Lopez Portillo (1976-82). She claimed that of the 59 persons
 who had apparently disappeared for various periods during the
 current administration, 11 remain unaccounted for.
 The Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the Persecuted,
 Disappeared Persons and Political Exiles of Mexico, a local
 human rights organization, stated at the end of 1986 that,
 since the beginning of the administration of President Miguel
 de la Madrid, there have been 21 disappearances of persons
 whose whereabouts remain unknown. For each year they are as
 follows: 1982, 7; 1983, 6; 1984, 5; 1985, 2; and 1986, 1. Of
 the 21 alleged disappearances, 11 involved residents of the
 Federal District, 4 of the state of Mexico, 1 of Morelos, 3 of
 Puebla, 1 of Tamaulipas and 1 of Veracruz. The single
 disappearance in 1986 counted by the Committee was that of
 Gerardo Lopez Chavaria, a 28-year-old teacher who allegedly
 disappeared in the Federal District in January 1986. The
 Committee states he was taken from his home by agents of the
 Federal Security Directorate. The Federal Government has
 responded to the committee's allegation, stating that it
 believes Lopez was kidnapped by narcotics traffickers.
 Lopez's father discounts the government's allegation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, human
 rights organizations continue to charge that law enforcement
 officials employ psychological and physical abuse, most often
 in the period immediately following arrest and especially
 during interrogation.
 The Attorney General of Mexico has stated that the use of
 torture to extract confessions is an illegal and unacceptable
 substitute for investigative work. Accordingly, the
 Administration has recruited new personnel into the various
 police forces and emphasized education and training in
 
 
 561
 MEXICO
 legitimate investigative skills. In addition, the Attorney
 General's office has contracted with human rights organizations
 to provide courses designed to sensitize law enforcement
 personnel to the need to respect human rights.
 In June Mexico stiffened the penalties against officials who
 have used torture. Under the new law, jail sentences of up to
 10 years and fines of up to 18 months' salary per offense can
 be imposed. As there were no known cases of the new law being
 applied to a specific case as of the end of 1986, its efficacy
 cannot yet be determined.
 On August 13, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Special
 Agent Victor Cortez was arrested by Jalisco State Judicial
 Police, interrogated and tortured over a period of several
 hours. He was blindfolded, severely beaten, and subjected to
 electric shocks. In responding to a U.S. Government protest
 note, the Mexican Government justified the arrest of Cortez,
 while not directly addressing the issue of torture.
 Subsequently, 11 members of the Jalisco police were charged in
 conjunction with the torturing of Cortez. In response to a
 formal request from the Mexican Government, the U. S.
 Government has identified a U.S. Court before which Cortez is
 ready to give a statement and answer questions concerning his
 mistreatment. Cortez has taken certain legal steps as agreed
 to by Mexican authorities for the purpose of filing the
 complaint so that the Government of Mexico can proceed with
 the case.
 In 1986 the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City lodged formal
 diplomatic protests with the Mexican Government concerning the
 cases of 11 American citizens, including Cortez, who stated
 that they had been physically mistreated while in the custody
 of Mexican Law Enforcement Officials. In an additional
 77 cases, Americans reported mistreatment but requested the
 Embassy not file formal protests on their behalf. The
 allegations of mistreatment made by the Americans included
 denial of food and water, being forced to kneel on rocky
 ground, being blindfolded, and being beaten and tortured with
 electric cattle prods. Mexican officials have been responsive
 to official protests and inquiries in many cases, but in some
 instances have failed to respond to inquiries, and abuses have
 continued. Furthermore, on several occasions local police
 authorities have neglected to inform Embassy officials of
 arrests of American citizens on several occasions.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and there are complaints about lack
 of trained personnel, a high turnover rate of both prison staff
 and administrative personnel, and corruption among prison
 officials. Since the current administration took office,
 reforms have been carried out in the prisons of the Federal
 District, and new prison construction has taken place.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mexican citizens are guaranteed the right of Amparo, a
 constitutional protection provided against "coercive and
 abusive acts of authority." Incidents of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment occur most frequently in criminal cases. The
 Mexican Senate has recently approved reforms to the amparo
 system, establishing categories of persons who would
 automatically be granted amparo petitions.
 In the state of Guerrero, several peasant groups have charged
 that the Governor is utilizing the Army to conduct "sweep
 
 
 562
 MEXICO
 checks" of villages and to arrest any opposition figures or
 activists they locate. The Government has responded that, due
 to criminal activity in the mountains of Guerrero and
 neighboring states, such measures are required to protect the
 public. Groups of farmers briefly occupied the Danish, Greek,
 Portuguese, and Swedish Embassies in Mexico City in April to
 protest the alleged illegal detention of peasant activists and
 to call attention to their complaints against the Government.
 Human Rights activists allege that there are currently 130
 "political prisoners" in the country, the majority arrested in
 disputes over land, some of whom have been held for extended
 periods. The Government has consistently denied that it holds
 political prisoners. For example, officials point out that in
 the state of Chiapas seven persons listed among these
 political prisoners are charged with terrorism, criminal
 association, and damage to property, all violations of the
 state penal code. The Government maintains their arrest was
 under warrant and that they have had the opportunity to file
 for relief under the amparo process. Legal procedures against
 them are still in process. In many such cases, especially
 those involving land tenure, persons termed political
 prisoners are, according to the Government, actually guilty of
 common crimes.
 There are legal prohibitions against forced or compulsory
 labor. There are reports that, in remote areas where illegal
 drugs are cultivated, campesinos and indigenous peoples have
 been forced to labor for drug traffickers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed
 within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at
 least a 2-year sentence. Despite efforts at reform, this
 standard is often not met because of delays caused by
 cumbersome court procedures and case backlogs.
 The political opposition alleges that the judiciary, with
 judges placed in office by renewable appointments, is
 dependent on the executive branch. The Government denies that
 personal political beliefs have any bearing on the impartial
 administration of justice. However, factors such as low pay
 for judges and law enforcement officials and high caseloads
 contribute to widespread corruption in the judicial system.
 As in most civil law systems, trial by a judge is favored over
 trial by jury. Defendants have a right to counsel and public
 defenders are available.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Article 16 of the Constitution guarantees the privacy of
 individuals. Although the Government generally does not
 intrude on this right and search warrants are required by law,
 opposition political figures believe their movements are
 monitored. In conflicts over land titles, peasants and urban
 squatters have charged that local landowners, accompanied by
 police, have entered their homes without appropriate judicial
 orders, and that these incidents are sometimes accompanied by
 violence.
 
 
 563
 MEXICO
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press is guaranteed by law.
 During the course of the current administration, the Government
 has appeared to tolerate more direct public criticism, and
 bolder press articles have appeared. Mexico's press is a
 primary source for reporting allegations of human rights
 violations.
 Despite the trend towards press liberalization, the Government
 closed the magazine Impacto in May on the grounds of alleged
 pornography. Impacto had been outspokenly critical of the
 Government. The magazine later resumed publication under new
 ownership, and appeared careful to avoid criticism of the
 Government and the PRI.
 According to the media, during 1986 several journalists died
 violently or under suspicious circumstances in which
 retaliation for coverage of local problems may have been a
 motive.
 Jose Luis Nava Linda, editor of the Guerrero periodical
 Expresion Popular, was allegedly assassinated in May shortly
 after running a series of anti-PRI articles. Court records
 indicate that the victim quarrelled with Javier Ibanez and
 that Nava was shot while attempting to draw his own gun on
 Ibanez. Ibanez was arrested for homicide in June and an
 interim prison sentence was handed down July 4. However, he
 appealed and on August 25 the sentence was revoked.
 In Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Ernesto Flores and Norma Moreno,
 respectively editor and reporter of the newspaper El Popular,
 were killed by unknown gunmen in July. Their publication was
 noted for highly personal but apparently documented attacks on
 local officials. The investigation under the direction of the
 head of the State Judicial Police is continuing.
 In October, Sinaloa reporter and columnist Odilon Lopez Urias
 was found dead after having been kidnaped 2 days before by
 eight armed men. Lopez was well known in Sinaloa for his
 reporting on various drug and criminal figures in the state
 and for his contentions that government figures were involved
 in drug trafficking.
 In February Carlos Loret de Mola, a former governor and a
 political columnist for Excelsior newspaper, died in an
 automobile accident in the state of Guerrero; officials report
 his car went over a cliff on a dangerous stretch of highway.
 However, based on anomalies in the chronology of events, doubts
 persist whether De Mola actually died in the accident or if it
 was staged after his death.
 Jorge Brenes, a newspaper publisher in Reynosa, was killed in
 July by two men. The motive is unknown but there is
 speculation the murderers were hired.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right of peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose throughout the country. A government permit is
 generally required for major demonstrations. Within the
 Federal District, opposition political groups, as well as
 peasant and indigenous organizations, are allowed frequent
 
 
 564
 MEXICO
 access to both main boulevards and the city's large central
 square for demonstrations. In rare instances, unauthorized
 marches, sit-ins, and other forms of protest are broken up
 forcibly by police and security forces, especially outside the
 capital. However, even this type of demonstration is usually
 tolerated.
 Basic trade union, worker, and employer rights are protected
 under Mexican law. The rights of workers to organize trade
 unions, to bargain collectively, and to strike are guaranteed
 in Article 123 of the Constitution.
 Mexico has a multiplicity of trade union organizations, most
 but not all of which are affiliated with the PRI. By far the
 largest of these are Mexican Workers Confederation (CTM) and
 the Federation of Government Workers Unions (FSTSE), which
 includes most government workers. The CTM and FSTSE, along
 with smaller federations and independent but PRI-affiliated
 unions, all belong to a loose umbrella labor organization
 known as the Congress of Labor. Independent unions outside
 the Congress of Labor, some with a conservative orientation
 and others of a pronounced leftist or radical orientation,
 also exist. The majority of organized peasants belong to the
 PRI-affiliated CNC.
 Unions in Mexico are permitted to maintain relations with
 recognized international labor bodies. The CTM is affiliated
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) and is a leading member of the ICFTU's Interamerican
 Regional Organization of Workers, headquartered in Mexico
 City. The CTM always provides the Mexican Worker delegate to
 the International Labor Organization
 A number of Congress of Labor independent unions are also
 affiliated with various international trade secretariats. The
 Communist World Federation of Trade Unions' regional
 Interamerican Organization maintains its headquarters in
 Mexico City.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, individuals are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. However, no religious body has -
 legal standing. The Constitution prohibits the clergy from
 participating in politics, voting, owning real estate, or
 wearing religious habits in public. Some of these prohibitions
 are not strictly enforced; neither is a constitutional
 restriction against pre-university religious schools, many of
 which exist.
 A law passed in 1986 subjects clergy to stiff fines if they
 are found guilty of inducing the electorate to vote for or act
 against a candidate or foment abstention and disorder.
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic. Protestant, Mormon,
 Jewish and other religious communities also exist and are free
 to practice their forms of worship. Protestant evangelists
 and Mormons, principally from outside Mexico, are active and
 especially successful in certain rural, largely indigenous
 communities. Some critics have stated that the Government is
 selectively enforcing the anti-clerical laws in favor of the
 predominant Roman Catholic Church. Other critics have
 asserted that, in some outlying areas, the laws are not being
 enforced against the evangelists so as to reduce the influence
 of the Catholic Church.
 
 
 565
 MEXICO
 Catholic and private educators have criticized the Government
 for forcing them to use government mandated textbooks in
 religious and private schools. Critics have complained of the
 textbooks' treatment of businessmen and free enterprise.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted, except for some areas along the Guatemalan
 border which have been closed to the public by the military.
 Mexico has traditionally followed a liberal asylum policy
 concerning Central American refugees and asylum-seekers from
 other countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1929 Mexico has been ruled by the PRI, the dominant
 party. To secure its continuance in power, the PRI has relied
 on extensive public patronage, massive government and party
 organizational resources and, opposition parties charge,
 electoral fraud in all contests where there is developed
 opposition party strength. President de la Madrid, in all
 four of his annual reports to the nation, has emphasized his
 commitment to political pluralism in Mexico.
 The President and Senate are elected for 6-year terms. The
 lower house is elected for a 3-year term, 1 during the
 election of the President and thereafter midway through the
 presidential term. State governors are elected for 6-year
 terms, with elections staggered in the various states
 throughout the course of the presidential term. Members of
 the unicameral state legislatures and all mayors are elected
 for 3-year terms. These'elections are also staggered.
 In January 1986, the official announcement of the results of
 the election for the mayoralty of the state capital of San
 Luis Potosi declared the PRI candidate the winner, in spite of
 opposition claims that the PAN candidate had won. In the July
 1986 Chihuahua state elections, the opposition parties charged
 the PRI with electoral fraud. Similar claims of fraudulent
 PRI electoral victories have also been lodged in the states of
 Durango, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. These charges have been
 leveled by both Mexican and foreign investigative journalists
 as well as by opposition party activists. In addition,
 following the Chihuahua State elections, prominent leftist
 intellectuals in Mexico as well as members of the Mexican
 Catholic Church hierarchy publicly denounced what they believed
 to be blatant electoral frauds in those elections. The
 Government has consistently defended the official party's
 victories and has specifically denied allegations of fraud,
 while admitting that the electoral system is an imperfect one
 which could and should be improved.
 Opposition parties are guaranteed access to the public media
 and seats in state and federal legislatures are reserved for
 them. However, the opposition charges access to the media is
 highly unbalanced compared to the day-to-day exposure of the
 PRI. In December, the Congress passed a major reform to the
 nation's electoral law. New procedures to be followed in
 elections have been designed to provide for representatives
 from all political parties being present at polling places, as
 well as independent poll watchers. Also, the number of seats
 reserved for minority parties in the Chamber of Deputies has
 
 
 566
 MEXICO
 been increased from 100 to 150, with the total number of seats
 in the chamber having been expanded from 400 to 500. The
 electoral reform law also directs that one-half of the
 nation's senators be elected every three years to 6-year
 terms.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government allows both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment, and has pledged its full cooperation in efforts by
 Amnesty International to monitor human rights violations in
 Mexico. Various ranking Mexican officials have met with
 Amnesty International representatives, as well as with
 domestic human rights activists and the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) to discuss allegations of human
 rights violations.
 The Government has publicly committed itself to periodic
 inspection by the UNHRC and other human rights organizations,
 and has pledged its complete cooperation with any such
 investigations.
 In its report, "Mexico: Human Rights in Rural Areas," Amnesty
 International noted its "appreciation for the cooperation of
 the Mexican authorities, both for the facilities placed at the
 disposal of the members of its delegation which visited Mexico
 in January 1985, and for the commendable speed and efficiency
 with which they have responded to Amnesty International's
 communications."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mexico takes pride in its multiracial origins and in the
 success the country has achieved in fostering a climate of
 racial harmony. Indigenous groups, many of which do not speak
 Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political life and
 the Government is respectful of the desire of these groups to
 retain elements of their traditional lifestyle. These groups,
 however, remain largely outside the country's mainstream
 political and economic life; this is not the result of
 conscious policy but rather of historic patterns of economic
 and social development which have evolved over centuries.
 Discrimination based on religion is generally nonexistent
 except for sanctions contained in the Constitution barring
 the clergy from participating in politics, voting, owning real
 estate and wearing religious garb in public. With time, the
 prohibitions seem to be relaxing. The role of women in
 Mexican society is in transition, and women are beginning to
 move into areas traditionally reserved for men. The number of
 women's actions groups is increasing and they are aggressively
 pushing women's issues over a broad front. Women comprise
 approximately 28.6 percent of the work force but continue to
 work predominately in nonsupervisory jobs with few at the
 executive level. During 1986, the ruling PRI party has
 pursued a policy of increasing the role of women in the
 political process. One of the party's 13 gubernatorial
 candidates in 1986 was a women. Seven of the Mexican Senate's
 64 senators are women, and 43 of the 400 member Chamber of
 
 
 567
 MEXICO
 Deputies are women, an increase of 8 over the previous
 legislature. The Secretary-General of the PRI party is 'a
 woman.
 Men and women are equal in principle under Mexican law. Women
 have the right to file for divorce and seperation. There is
 no restriction against their traveling on their own, They can
 also own property in their own name.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Mexican law sets the minimum age for the employment of children
 at 14 years; children over 14 but under 16 years of age may
 work but are subject to special legal protections and shorter
 working hours than adults and cannot be employed in certain
 jobs. Child labor laws in Mexico are observed fairly strictly
 in medium sized and large manufacturing and commercial
 establishments, but less so in small shops and in such
 occupations as street vending, where child labor is difficult
 to control. The law also provides for a minimum wage. Labor's
 real purchasing power has been eroded considerably in recent
 years even though it is revised at least semiannually. The
 principle of equal pay for equal work prevails in the treatment
 of foreign workers, but preference is given to Mexicans over
 foreigners in hiring and foreigners are not allowed to form a
 part of union leadership. The maximum legal work week is
 48 hours with a maximum workday of 8 hours.
 Extensive regulations pertaining to occupational health and
 safety exist. Industrial safety laws are less frequently
 observed in practice, particularly in the heavy industrial
 sector and in the construction industry.
