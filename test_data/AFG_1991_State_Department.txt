 AFGHANISTAN*
 The current regime in Kabul derives its political power from a
 coup in 1978, the 1979 Soviet invasion, and--following the
 withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1989--massive military and
 economic support provided by the U.S.S.R. through the end of
 19917. The regime continues to face armed opposition from
 mujahidin guerillas, supported by most of the population. The
 regime controls the capital, Kabul, other major urban centers,
 and garrisons to protect them. Some roads are open to military
 movement by well-protected convoys. Over the past year the
 regime has lost military control of some territory.
 The keystone of President Najib's control is the Ministry of
 State Security (WAD), which he headed before taking supreme
 power. WAD is responsible for internal security functions in
 regime-controlled areas. Besides its intelligence and secret
 police functions, WAD controls sizable military forces. It is
 responsible for serious, widespread human rights abuses.
 Since 1978, over 1 million people have been killed and many
 more maimed and wounded in the war, principally by regime and
 Soviet air strikes, artillery and missile bombardment, and
 landmines. Five million people, one-third of Afghanistan's
 prewar population, have become refugees, primarily in Pakistan
 and Iran, with at least a million more displaced internally.
 During 1991 the regime stepped up its practice of bombing
 civilian areas in response to mujahidin attacks.
 The Afghanistan resistance political leadership is fragmented
 among several major groups; most power in the countryside is
 held by local military commanders and traditional leaders who
 are nominally affiliated with these groups but not answerable
 to them. The resistance continues to be plagued by
 occasionally bloody rivalries. The Afghan Interim Government
 (AIG), composed of the heads of some resistance parties, has
 ceased to have any credibility or effectiveness.
 Continuing international efforts to promote a settlement of the
 Afghan conflict, the U.N. Secretary General on May 21 issued a
 Statement of Principles for a political settlement that was
 acceptable to outside interested powers, the regime, and many
 resistance groups. It calls, inter alia, for a transition
 process leading to a broad-based government for Afghanistan.
 In a joint statment on September 13, the United States and the
 Soviet Union pledged to discontinue arms supplies to all sides
 by January 1, 1992, and to support U.N. efforts to promote a
 political solution to the war.
 The Afghan economy is agricultural, with land tenure in the
 hands of individuals or family/tribal groups. An
 entrepreneurial/trading class and some small-scale
 manufacturing exist. The regime attempted, unsuccessfully, to
 impose a centralized, planned economy in the Communist mode
 until 1990, when it modified its Constitution to allow economic
 liberalization. In resistance-controlled areas, economic
 activity continues along traditional lines, but it has been
 greatly affected by the devastation of the war.
 *Since the staff of the American Embassy in Kabul was withdrawn
 for security reasons in January 1989, the United States has had
 no official observers in Afghanistan. This report therefore
 draws to a large extent on unofficial sources.

 AFGHANISTAN
 In practical terms, despite some largely cosmetic reforms in
 the laws and Constitution adopted in 1990, virtually all of the
 main categories of human rights remain restricted by the
 regime. The number of political prisoners remains at about
 3,000. In areas outside regime control, there are somewhat
 fewer restrictions on personal freedoms, although there have
 been credible reports that some resistance groups have
 attacked, tortured, killed, or imprisoned persons, Afghan and
 foreign, opposed to their programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected
 opponents of the Kabul regime continue to be reported. Regime
 forces and some resistance groups execute prisoners in the
 field. Attempts, some of them successful, were made on the
 lives of prominent Afghans in Pakistan during 1991, continuing
 a practice of previous years. Some of those attacked were
 political figures, while others were involved in refugee
 assistance programs. These attacks have been ascribed to WAD
 agents as well as to some resistance groups, particularly
 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami party, trying to intimidate
 their opponents. Threats directed at moderate Afghans and
 Afghans working for Western organizations in Pakistan increased
 in 1991.. Pakistani authorities investigated these cases but
 have not made arrests.
 b. Disappearance
 Afghans arrested by the regime for political offenses in effect
 "disappear" as their families are usually not informed and
 often do not receive official notice for months. Frequently,
 young malds are impressed into the military service off the
 street without notification of families. Some persons also
 disappear as a result of the action of resistance groups, who
 have abducted or captured regime military and civilian cadre,
 suspected regime collaborators, and Western aid workers,
 several of whom were kidnaped and held for extended periods in
 Afghanistan in 1991. Kidnapings of refugees in Peshawar,
 Pakistan, continued during 1991. Most prominent was that of
 Abdul Rahim Chenzai who was abducted in broad daylight on July
 9 and was still unaccounted for at the end of the year.
 Chenzai was a vocal supporter of a renewed political role for
 former King Zahir Shah and a critic of Hekmatyar's
 Hezb-i-Islami party, which is widely believed responsible for
 this and other kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 As in previous years, there were reports of torture by regime
 authorities to extract information or confessions, although
 such activity is forbidden by the Constitution. Techniques
 include beating, electric shock, and immersion in water.
 Threats of abuse against family members and prolonged sleep
 deprivation are typical forms of psychological torture. Some
 victims of regime torture, later freed, have reported mental
 disturbances resulting from their treatment in regime prisons.
 The various resistance groups maintain prisons, both inside
 
 
 1328
 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan, reportedly
 holding several thousand people. There are repQrts that some
 groups keep their prisoners in overcrowded conditions and
 routinely subject them to tortuie. There is no access for
 Westerners to these facilities in Pakistan. The resistance
 groups most frequently linked to these prisons and cited for
 poor prisoner treatment are Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar),
 Hezb-i-Islami (led by Yunis Khalis), and the Ittihad-i-Islami.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the state of emergency has been lifted by the regime,
 legal safeguards to prevent arbitrary arrest or detention in
 regime-controlled areas are weak, and are ignored in state
 security cases. Afghans continue to face seizure by regime
 security personnel for vaguely defined antistate activities.
 Often, arrests are made without warrants, although the
 Constitution forbids detention without permission of the
 court. Detainees often are held incommunicado. Although bail
 is sometimes granted, it is not a standard feature of the
 regime's legal procedures. Formal charges may come only after
 months of interrogation. The regime now permits the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit
 convicted prisoners. The ICRC does not yet have access to
 detainees awaiting trial or under interrogation who are under
 the authority of WAD.
 Resistance groups detain regime personnel for extended periods,
 and several groups operate prisons inside Afghanistan or within
 refugee camps in Pakistan, which are used to hold political
 opponents. The ICRC has tried to reach agreement with
 resistance commanders to allow for visits to prisoners held in
 Afghanistan. Some commanders, but not all, permit ICRC visits
 to prisoners. The ICRC has had some access to Soviet and
 regime prisoners of war held by the mujahidin.
 The regime does not use exile as a form of punishment. In 1991
 it restored the citizenship of former King Zahir Shah, who has
 been living in Rome since he was deposed by a coup in 1973, and
 several of his family members.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most persons accused of nonpolitical crimes are tried in the
 ordinary criminal court system under the provisions of judicial
 codes in existence before the coup of 1978. Those political
 detainees who are charged and brought to trial are usually
 arraigned on allegations of antistate activities and are tried
 and sentenced in secret. Political prisoners are held in
 isolation for an initial period of interrogation lasting up to
 several months. As a rule, the accused must provide their own
 defense, without benefit of counsel.
 The Constitution calls for presidential review of death
 sentences. There is no judicial procedure to appeal a death
 sentence. In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and
 criminal cases are tried.by Islamic judges (qazis) and
 community elders under Shari'a (Islamic) law and according to
 Afghan custom. There are credible reports that trials of
 Afghan prisoners by resistance parties do not conform to
 internationally recognized standards of fair trial.
 An unknown number of Soviet prisoners, captured prior to the
 withdrawal, are still being held by the resistance in the hope
 of exchanging them for prisoners held by the regime and,
 
 
 1329
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 resistance groups claim, by the U.S.S.R. The Soviets deny
 holding any mujahidin prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution forbids arbitrary search of residences.
 However, regime forces routinely'sweep through residential
 areas to arrest suspected resistance members and confiscate
 property, including homes. Telephones are frequently tapped
 and correspondence monitored.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 During 1991 the Kabul regime continued high altitude bombing,
 artillery bombardments, and frequent launches of powerful but
 inaccurate Scud and Frog surface-to-surface missiles. Attacks
 were particularly heavy in areas in the northeast and around
 the town of Khost, which fell into resistance hands during the
 year. There were substantial but unknown numbers of civilian
 casualties. significant civilian casualties also have resulted
 from rocket attacks by the resistance against targets in
 regime-controlled urban areas. Resistance leaders assert that
 they strive to minimize civilian casualties.
 Millions of landmines emplaced by the Soviets or regime forces
 remain around fortifications or scattered near roads and in the
 countryside. Mines have also been sown by resistance groups.
 There is a U.N.-sponsored program to detect and remove mines,
 but the devices will pose a significant hazard to civilians for
 years to come. In spite of regime media campaigns, little has
 been done by the Soviets or the regime to remove mines or help
 the U.N. accomplish the task.
 Regime forces and some resistance groups have been reported in
 the past to execute prisoners in the field. During 1991 this
 practice was not reported after resistance defeats of regime
 forces, although prisoners numbered in the thousands in some
 cases. There were reports of execution of prisoners taken
 during fighting between mujahidin factions in Konar province.
 There were increased security problems for humanitarian
 assistance workers inside Afghanistan, including kidnapings,
 attacks, and hijacking of goods, which forced most humanitarian
 assistance organizations to reduce their programs in
 resistance-controlled areas of Afghanistan.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are indications of some marginal improvement in press
 freedom under the Kabul regime. While the Constitution
 contains provisions for freedom of expression, the regime
 tolerates little criticism in the public media, and private
 criticism can result in detention and arrest. Most media are
 owned and controlled by the regime. Those that are not are
 closely regulated, although criticism of the Government, within
 very narrow limits, is increasingly allowed. The regime's
 determination to keep the press under its control was
 demonstrated in July when it closed a biweekly newspaper and
 arrested its editor, Ghulam Sakhi Ghairat, for attempting to
 publish an interview with a resistance commander. He
 reportedly was released following protests and appeals by other
 
 
 1330
 AFGHANISTAN
 writers. The major media, including all broadcast outlets, are
 devoted to conveying the regime's policy and interpretation of
 world events. Although resistance groups have little ability
 to control media content, some Afghans in Pakistan avoid public
 criticism of fundamentalist groups for fear of being attacked.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In spite of constitutional guarantees,, there is no effective
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association in regime-
 controlled areas. The Constitution was amended in 1990 to
 allow a multiparty political system, but genuine opposition
 groups still have not emerged. Nine parties registered in
 coalition with the ruling party are, by and large, front
 organizations and are not taken seriously by Afghans. The
 Kabul-based National-Salvation Society, formed in 1989 by
 former high-rankitg officials of pre-1978 governments,
 continues to seek international support for a peace
 settlement. However, it remains a small, poorly funded
 interest group, neither possessing nor seeking mass support
 among Afghans in regime-controlled areas. In September a party
 called the Movement for the Freedom, Democracy, and Unity of
 Afghanistan was established. A rally it held in support of an
 open political process in November was broken up by security
 forces. Political demonstrations are occasionally staged by
 the regime on behalf of its positions. The regime strictly
 controls any other type of assembly, forbidding criticism of
 the President or the Constitution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population of Afghanistan is overwhelmingly Muslim.
 Afghans' constitutional right to worship in regime-controlled
 areas is normally honored. The Constitution was amended in
 1990 to identify Afghanistan as an Islamic state. The regime
 seeks to broaden its popular support through evocation of
 Islamic themes and symbols and support for mosques and
 religious schools, although this is seen by most Afghans as a
 cynical ruse. Members of minority religions are generally
 allowed to worship freely in both resistance and
 regime-controlled areas, but proselytizing is not allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The turmoil in Afghanistan has generated the world's largest
 refugee population, which is predominately women and children.
 Over 3.2 million refugees are registered with the U.N. in
 Pakistan, where they reside in approximately 350 camps. At
 least another 2 million live in Iran, where they have been
 largely integrated into local village and urban life. Up to
 200,000 Afghans may have voluntarily returned since 1989,
 although the porous borders and continued conflict make it
 difficult to determine accurate numbers.
 Domestic travel remains severely restricted by wartime
 conditions. However, civilian travel between areas controlled
 by the regime and by the resistance does occur. In many cases,
 resistance groups allow the movement of goods, particularly
 food, into regime-controlled areas. Both the regime and
 resistance groups establish arbitrary checkpoints along
 highways at which travelers are screened and frequently
 required to pay fees. The large-scale Soviet and regime mining
 of the principal overland routes and passes as well as the
 smaller number of mines sown by resistance groups create
 
 
 . 1331
 AFGHANISTAN
 serious risks for travelers as well as for returning refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Afghan citizens do not have the ability peacefully to change
 their government. Regime-controlled areas continue to be ruled
 by a nondemocratic party kept in power by military force. This
 is unacceptable to the vast majority of Afghans. In the past
 regime officials stated their support for an election process
 but insisted it remain under their control. However, the Kabul
 regime has endorsed the U.N. Secretary General's five-point
 statement on Afghanistan, which calls for "free and fair
 elections." The ruling party, in spite of a name change and
 "reorganization" in 1990, remains a centralized organization.
 Despite constitutional amendments ostensibly designed to permit
 a multiparty system, no genuine political opposition has
 emerged. Of the parties or political groupings allowed to
 form, none has been allowed to display genuine independence or
 to criticize strongly the Najibullah regime.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known domestic human rights organizations in
 Afghanistan and it is unlikely that any independent group would
 be permitted to function.
 The ICRC continues to visit convicted persons detained by the
 Government. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan, Felix
 Ermacora, during his September 1991 visit to Kabul, received
 full cooperation from the authorities as he prepared his sixth
 report on human rights in Afghanistan. Other than Mr.
 Ermacora, there were no other known visits to Kabul in 1991 by
 international observers of human rights practices.
 During 1991 the ICRC and journalists occasionally were
 permitted to visit Afghans and Soviets held by the resistance
 in Afghanistan. Security incidents forced the ICRC to curtail
 its activities in Afghanistan in 1991, which reduced its
 ability to visit prisoners  Soviet and resistance officials
 held direct talks at a senior level over the prisoner-of-war
 issue in 1991 and some prisoners were exchanged, although the
 regime again failed to deliver all the prisoners it agreed to
 release.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In traditional rural Afghan society, the participation of women
 in activities beyond the home and fields is limited by long
 established beliefs, customs, and religious practices.
 However, beginning in the late 1950's, Afghan governments
 officially sanctioned a wider public role for women. Upper-
 and middle-class women began working in the government and
 private sectors in the 1960's. While this practice was
 generally limited to Kabul, girls from elsewhere in the country
 attended secondary schools and sought admission to institutes
 of higher education to pursue careers, including teaching and
 nursing, which in some cases permitted employment in the
 provinces. The social position of women in regime-controlled
 areas has continued to improve over the past decade, and the
 role of women in some nontraditiohal occupations has expanded.
 
 
 1332
 AFGHANISTAN
 The war has significantly affected women, physically and
 socially. In the refugee community in Pakistan, the freedoms
 women were allowed have been greatly circumscribed, in part
 because they have been removed from the familiar, village
 environment. Women's roles are a subject of serious debate
 within the resistance, and some fundamentalist parties seek
 further restrictions on women.
 Violence against women is known to occur in Afghanistan, but
 little is known about its extent. Abuse within the family is
 seldom mentioned publicly, and there are no official statistics
 on the subject. The regime has discussed this problem in the
 press and made some very preliminary efforts to deal with it.
 The regime announced in 1990 the opening of a facility in Kabul
 to counsel women who are in abusive relationships.
 The campaign of intimidation against Western assistance
 programs for women which was initiated in 1990 was not repeated
 in 1991, but there were isolated incidents of harassment and
 intimidation directed against these programs. The basic debate
 over women's rights remained unresolved.
 Afghanistan is home to several Muslim religious traditions and
 a number of ethnic, tribal, aid linguistic groups whose
 relations to one another have historically been marked by
 rivalry and occasionally by hostilities. Local loyalties often
 override those to the nation as a whole. A particularly strong
 line of cleavage along religious, ethnic, and geographic lines
 lies between the minority Shi'a and the traditionally dominant
 Sunni Afghans. Relations between resistance groups and within
 the Kabul regime reflect these ethnic and religious rivalries.
 The regime manipulates these rivalries for its own purposes.
 One practice is to use troops from one ethnic group in parts of
 the country where that group is not-normally present. This
 tactic predates the Communist takeover and is designed to
 repress local populations with greater ease and prevent
 military defections. However, it also heightens hostilities
 between groups and sparks frequent violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution and the Labor Law (enacted in 1987) assert
 workers' right to form trade unions, and such unions are
 theoretically independent of state organs. In fact, however,
 union organization follows traditional practice of official
 unions under Communist systems. Individual unions are
 supervised by the Central Council of Trade Unions, controlled
 by the ruling party, and there is no evidence of worker
 participation in decisionmaking. The Central Council of Trade
 Unions is affiliated with the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The regime does not allow the
 existence of independent trade union organizations. The
 Constitution allows the right to strike. No strikes were
 reported in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the theoretical right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The labor law applying to large economic
 organizations stipulates that, at the end of each Afghan year,
 a new collective contract is negotiated between management and
 trade union representatives and signed with the consensus of
 the workers' collective. In practice, there is no genuine
 
 
 1333
 
 AFGHANISTAN
 labor-management bargaining. The workers' collective
 rubberstamps decisions taken by officials. Progress in
 establishing labor courts and other mechanisms for the
 resolution of disputes is unknown.
 There is no indication that there are any special economic or
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids the imposition of forced labor but
 notes that the "performance of compulsory labor in wartime,
 natural calamity, and other states of emergency which threaten
 public life and order shall be excluded from this." Given that
 wartime conditions exist, this constitutional provision can be,
 in effect, ignored. The most frequent manifestation of the use
 of forced labor is the "voluntary" labor engaged in by students
 for short periods on construction projects during their annual
 vacations, when they are seconded to the military.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Law specifies the conditions of work for adolescents,
 noting that persons aged 13 to 15 may work a maximum of 30
 hours a week, and those aged 16 to 17 should not work more than
 35 hours a week. The law also specifies that adolescents
 should receive the same pay as persons 18 and older. In fact,
 children of all ages work without regard to conditions or law.
 Economic circumstances for most Afghans are so harsh that many
 families have no choice but to have every member work. There
 is no evidence that the regime enforces labor law as it relates
 to children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No information on any statutory minimum wage is available. The
 Labor Law stipulates that the usual hours of work on average
 should not exceed 40 hours a week, and 'that on Thursdays
 working time should not exceed 5 hours. Provision is made for
 time off for prayers, meals, holidays, weekends, annual leave,
 sick leave, and emergency leave. There are general provisions
 which set out the employer's responsibility to ensure healthful
 and safe conditions of work and accident compensation. There
 appear to be no effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair
 and safe labor practices. The State Committee on Labor and
 Social Security remains understaffed and not very active.
