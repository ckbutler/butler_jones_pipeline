 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde continued to become more democratic and to strengthen the protec-
 tion of human rights in 1992. The country's first free legislative and presidential
 elections took place in early 1991 and were followed in December by' further demo-
 cratic elections to choose local government officials. The new Constitution, adopted
 by the National Assembly and signed into law by the President, was a major step
 toward consolidating democracy.
 Reorganization and democratization of the security forces, including disbanding
 the secret police, continued with the creation of the Coast Guard as nucleus of a
 reorganized military establishment. The police force was demilitarized and pat-
 terned after such forces in Western democracies. Total military expenditures for
 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency con-
 ducted a detailed analysis, were roughly estimated to be between $11 million and
 $18 million. There are plans to reduce the size of the military establishment, but
 they will not be fully implemented until the Coast Guard is further developed.
 Cape Verde has few exploitable natural resources except for an attractive climate,
 a hardworking population (350,000), and a strategic geographic position. Cape
 Verdeans have a long history of economically driven emigration, primarily to West-
 ern Europe and the United States. Cape Verde can produce food for only 20 percent
 of its population, even in years of optimum rainfall. Because of continuing severe
 drought in 1992, Cape Verde needed more international food aid than usual. The
 National Assembly adopted legislation to privatize Cape Verde's state-owned enter-
 prises and to facilitate foreign investment by streamlining the process for approval
 of investment proposals.
 In 1992 the human rights climate was good. The Constitution provides strong
 guarantees for human rights, and it includes the principle of separation of powers,
 
 
 a political system based on individual rights and liberties, and a market-based econ-
 omy.
 RESPET FOR HUMAN RIGM
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reported instances of
 political or other extra udicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations or reported occurrences of torture or other cruel, inhu-
 man, or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Cape Verdean law reqaires that an ac-
 cused person be brought before a judge to be charged within 24 hours of arrest. A
 person may not be arrested without court order unless caught in the act of commit-
 ting a felony. In exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, the
 formal charge process may be delayed up to 5 days after the arrest. These laws are
 observed in practice.
 For crimes against state security, the Justice Ministry has 40 days to prepare the
 case for a trial, and the accused can be incarcerated until the trial or for a period
 not to exceed 1 year. There is a functioning system of bail. Everyone is entitled to
 representation by an attorney in civil or criminal cases.
 There were no known instances of security detentions or forced exile for political
 or other reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is composed of the Supreme
 Court and the regional courts. There are 5 Supreme Court judges, including one
 who is appointed by the President of the Republic, one appointed by the National
 Assembly, and three ajppointed by the High Council of Magistrates. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence. Trials are public; they are conducted by one judge
 and without a jury. Evidence suggests that the courts protect individual rights in
 criminal cases. The autonomous Institute for Judicial Support, to which most pri-
 vate lawyers belong, provides free counsel for indigent defendants. The defense can
 p resent witnesses andhas access to government evidence. Verdicts can be ap pealed.
 Regional courts adjudicate minor disputes on a local level in rural areas.The local
 judges, appointees of the Ministry of Justice and Labor, usually are prominent local
 citizens. As older judges retire, the Government is appointing local judges with high-
 er levels of education. Regional court decisions can be appealed to the Supreme
 Court.
 Despite changes in the courts system, it has been described as still "hopelessly
 overburdened". In May, when the Supreme Court was attacked in the press, all of
 its judges resigned. The President declined to accept their resignations. It was wide-
 ly believed that the press attack was linked to a dispute over the new Constitution
 and that the Minister of Justice was responsible for the press article.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the inviolability of domicile, correspond-
 ence, and other means of communication. These rights are respected. The law re-
 quires that warrants be issued by a judge before homes may be searched.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press without censorship and for freedom of citizens to express ideas by words, im-
 ages, or any other means. These freedoms are respected in practice. Journalists are
 independent of gvernment, public administration, and other public powers. While
 journalists must be granted access to sources of information, they are not obliged
 to reveal their sources. No authorization is needed to create newspapers, other pub-
 lications, or electronic media.
 Throughout 1992 the most widely read newspaper, the radio, and the television,
 all government owned, gave balanced coverage to domestic and internationa events
 and to opposition viewpints. In November the Minister of Communication and Cul-
 ture announced that the la  t government-owned newspaper, Vozdipovo, was dis-
 continuing publication for an unspecified period because of mismanagement, low
 professional quality, and overstafling. Although rumors circulated that the nws-
 paper's suspension was politically motivated, it was known that the paper had fi-
 nancial difficulties. Opposition newspapers also enjoyed full freedom of the press
 without censorship. National Assembly sessions were broadcast live in their en-
 tirety.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The new Constitution provides
 for freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by authorities. The nation's first reported student demonstration took
 place peacefully in January. No one is obliged to associate with or belong to any
 organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution requires separation of church and state
 and prohibits the imposition of religious beliefs and practices on others. It guaran-
 tees freedom to exercise individual or group religion and to express faith. About 80
 to 90 percent of the population is nominally Catholic, including much of the gvern-
 ment leadership. There are no restrictions on resident foreign clergy or on t e nu-
 merous and diverse religious groups represented in Cape Verde.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions on trav-
 el or residence in Cape Verde. Historically, emigration has been an important and
 recognized means to escape frbm harsh economic conditions, and the Government
 maintains an office to serve intending emigrants. The Government maintains close
 ontact with emigre communities and encourages Cape Verdeans living abroad, in-
 cluding dual nationals, to maintain ties with their homeland. Repatriation is a con-
 stitutional right and not discouraged by the Government. The Constitution grants
 unlimited right to dual nationality. The law does not allow for revocation of citizen-
 ship.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In January 1991, after 15 years of one-party rule, power was transferred peace-
 fully through democratic elections to an opposition party. Promulgation of the new
 Constitution was the major political event during 1992. The major issue was presi-
 dential powers, although there were also accusations that supporters of the Prime
 Minister sought to politicize the Supreme Court. Compromises were reached and the
 new Constitution provides strong protection for individual rights. Despite the gen-
 erally open atmosphere, there were accusations of petty harassment of supporters
 of the former ruling party.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or mi-
 norities to vote or to participate in politics. The Constitution protects the principle
 of separation of powers. Members of the Government are not required to be mem-
 bers of the National Assembly, but they are subject individually to parliamentary
 overview; collectively, they must retain the support of a arliamentary majority. The
 Government may be dismissed by the President of the epublic, with the approval
 of the Presidential Council. This Council is composed of the President of the Na-
 tional Assembly, the Prime Minister, the President of the Supreme Court, the Attor-
 ney General, the President of the Council of Regional Affairs, and four private mem-
 bers. Two of the private members are appointed by the President of the Republic,
 and two are appointed by the National Assembly.
 Referendums may be held under specified circumstances; they may not challenge
 the basic principles upon which the Republic rests, as set out in the first section
 of the Constitution. They may not question individual political rights and liberties
 or the right of opposition parties to exist and function freely. Referendums may not
 be held on financial or budgetary questions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Cape Verde's Government traditionally has cooperated fully with private human
 rights organization representatives who visit periodically to investigate alleged vio-
 lations. In late 1991 the Government established a human rights commission with
 the objective of raising popular consciousness about human rights and the need for
 respect for them at the institutional level. The commission was largely inactive in
 1992.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde where the vast majority of
 the population shares mixed Portuguese and African ancestry. The Constitution pro-
 hibits sex discrimination and guarantees full equality of men and women, including
 equalapay for equal work. However, traditional male-oriented Portuguese and Afri-
 can values predominate; women are, in fact, excluded from certain types of employ-
 ment and are often paid less than men. In 1992 there were slight signs that such
 attitudes and practices are changing. For example, for the first time two women
 were named to Cabinet posts, and the Nautical School (a male bastion of higher
 education) admitted women.
 Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains common, par-
 ticularly in the rural areas. Crimes such as rape and spouse abuse are rarely
 brought to the attention of the police or tried in the courts. While neither the Gov-
 ernment nor the women's organizations have addressed directly the issue of violence
 against women, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs has undertaken, with US.
 financial assistance, to publicize civil and human rights of both women and children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assoiation.-All workers are free to form and to join unions of
 their own choosing without authorization. In 1992 seven new trade unions were
 formed, including unions of professors, fishermen and public administrators. The
 new unions nonprtian and independent of Government, joined the Coordinated
 Council of Free Labor Unions (CCLS). The National Union of Cape Verde Workers
 (UNTC-CS), formed and controlled by the former government, continued as an inde-
 pendent labor movement. However, it suffered serious financial problems and a de-
 cline in membership as Cape Verde continued to privatize the economy; in particu-
 lar, there was a loss of patronage jobs in the heavily staffed public sector of the
 economy.
 The new Constitution provides union members the right to strike; there are no
 restrictions on this right. There were periodic strikes throughout 1992, most fre-
 quentlyin state-owned enterprises. Unions are free to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides to
 unions the right to organize and operate without hindrance. Workers and manage-
 ment in the small private sector, as well as in the public sector, reach agreement
 through collective bargaining. The Constitution specifically gives unions the right to
 sign collective work contracts. As the country's largst employer, the Government
 continues to play a dominant role in setting wages. 1t does not, however, fix wages
 in any other way except to set minimum wages for civil servants.
 ALegislative Decree of November 1991 bans antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers and provides that fines may be levied on offenders. There were no reported cases
 of such discrimination in 1992.
 Cape Verde has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14. Children under 16 are prohibited from working at night, for more than 7
 hours per day, or in establishments where toxic products are produced. The Director
 General of Labor of the Ministry of Justice and Labor is responsible for enforcing
 minimum age laws. In practice, however, minimum age laws are enforced only in
 the mainly urban formal sectors of the economy. Efforts are made to enforce this
 requirement with only limited success.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. In practice, large urban private employers link their minimum
 wage rates to those paid to civil servants. The majority of jobs pay insufficient
 wages to provide a worker and his family a decent standard of living, therefore,
 most workers must rely on a combination which includes second jobs, extended fam-
 ily help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal worweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many employed in domestic service or by small em-
 ployers in rural areas do not enjoy legally mandated work conditions.
 Rural laborers are largely uninformed of workers' rights, and these rights fre-
 quently are not respected. In 1992 the Director General of Labor established a small
 epartment in the Ministry of Justice and Labor dedicated to protection of rural la-
 borers.
 All enterprises must submit a yearly report to the Director General of Labor with
 information on the wages and vacation of each employee. The reports provide the
 Government with current information on employment practices only- they are not
 used as a control mechanism. Nevertheless, the Director General does carry out
 
 
 periodic inspections to assure that employers adhere to correct labor practices and
 dimpose fines on private enterprises which were not in onformity with the laws.
 There does not appear to be an overall safety and health code, although some regu-
 lations exist in this area. The Director General of Labor is responsible for enforcing
 labor regulations. However, Cape Verde has few industries which employ heavy or
 dangerous equipment, and work related accidents are uncommon. Consequently,
 there is no systematic government enforcement of labor laws.
