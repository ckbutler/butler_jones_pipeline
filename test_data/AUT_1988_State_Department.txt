 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A
 coalition government (Socialist Party and People's Party),
 formed after the November 1986 national election, continued in
 office in 1988. The loosely united Green Party and the
 liberal/nationalist Freedom Party comprised the opposition.
 The police and security organs are effectively subordinated to
 the executive and judicial authorities.
 Austria has a developed economy, and Austrians enjoy a high
 standard of living. Since World War II, Austria has served as
 a country of first asylum for nearly 2 million refugees from
 Eastern Europe. In 1988, in response to large numbers of
 refugees (primarily from Eastern Europe) accumulating in
 Austrian transient facilities, the Government established a
 program for stricter adherence to its asylum policy and a more
 rapid resolution of individual cases.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria, and individual
 rights and political freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings either
 by government authorities or by opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no political abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is banned by article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution. In 1988 no
 allegations concerning torture or other acts of official
 brutality came to public attention. The rights of persons
 under arrest are respected in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention and exile. In
 criminal cases, the law provides for investigative or pretrial
 detention for up to 48 hours, by which time an investigative
 judge must decide on the legality of continuing the detention.
 Provided the investigative judge agrees, the accused may be
 held, pending completion of an investigation, for a maximum of
 2 years. Grounds for investigative detention are enumerated
 in the law, as are conditions for release on bail. Domestic
 critics of the use made of pretrial detention point to the
 fact that, of those so detained in Vienna, for example, only
 57 percent were eventually found guilty of crimes justifying
 prison sentences. In 1987 the average duration of pretrial
 detention ranged between 41 and 67 days in different
 provinces.

 AUSTRIA
 The number of persons held in investigative detention and
 serving prison sentences has steadily declined in recent
 years, reaching a low of 7,337 in February 1988 (of whom 1,616
 were in investigative detention). As part of a comprehensive
 reform of the law governing detention for infractions of
 administrative law, an amendment which went into effect on
 July 1 aims at further reducing the number of such detentions
 and at strengthening the rights of those detained. When
 concluded, this reform will bring Austria into compliance with
 Article 5 of the European Convention. (Since, in noncriminal
 cases, Austrian law allows an administrative authority rather
 than an independent judge to order detention, Austria signed
 the convention with an exception clause for Article 5.)
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. Trials are public. Judges are
 appointed for life and may not, in principle, be removed from
 office. Jury trials are prescribed for major offenses, and
 those convicted have the right of appeal. Written charges
 must be presented to the accused, who has the right to be
 represented by a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone.
 The privacy of family life is respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and-Press
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and
 multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected. Austria's
 well-established democratic political system, its active and
 independent press, and its effective judiciary combine to
 assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Public demonstrations require a permit from the
 police authorities, who may consider only the public safety
 aspect of the proposed demonstration and not its political
 purpose. Permits are routinely issued.
 The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 makes an exception to
 freedom of association in the case of Nazi organizations and
 activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945, as amended in
 1947, also prohibits Nazi organizations and activities. A
 
 
 981
 AUSTRIA
 constitutional court decision in 1988 further specified that a
 group with a neo-Nazi program could not register as a
 political party. The law on the formation of associations
 stipulates that permission to form an association may be
 denied if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the
 illegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is provided for in the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, religious groups register with the Government.
 Although 88 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, most
 of the world's major religions are represented.
 Overt and explicit expressions of anti-Semitism are not part
 of public discourse in Austria, but several surveys have
 indicated that such sentiments are latent among some
 Austrians. These came to the surface when allegations
 concerning the wartime activities of Kurt Waldheim (elected
 President of Austria in June 1986) elicited a disturbing
 anti-Semitic reaction on the part of individual Austrian
 citizens. The Government has condemned this phenomenon in
 very strong terms and has recommitted the country to combating
 all its manifestations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel abroad and
 to emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the
 right to return.
 Austria serves as a country of first asylum for refugees from
 Eastern Europe and as a transit point for Soviet Jewish
 emigrants on their way to Israel or other countries. Between
 January and August 1988, 11,334 persons applied for asylum in
 Austria. As of August, 15,644 asylum applicants were being
 cared for by the authorities. Of these, some 2,000 have been
 recognized as refuqees under the Geneva Convention. About
 3,500, however, have not been granted refugee status. Most of
 the remaining cases are still pending. In 1988 the government
 budget for refugee reception, care, and maintenance totaled
 $44.6 million.
 Because of the current influx of asylum seekers, the Austrian
 authorities instituted an accelerated procedure for
 distinguishing between legitimate political asylum seekers and
 "economically motivated" immigrants. Those arriving from
 Poland and Hungary are informed that they have very little
 chance of receiving asylum. A handful of those denied
 Austrian asylum under this procedure have reportedly been
 deported to their country of origin, but the majority have
 been allowed to remain in Austria pending their requests for
 resettlement in third countries.

 AUSTRIA
 In recent years, the Government has drastically limited the
 issuance of work permits to non-Austrians in an effort to
 reduce domestic unemployment. Austria's foreign worker
 population, which averaged 226,400 in 1973, stood at 146,000
 in 1986 and 156,800 as of August 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary system.
 Under the Constitution, national elections must be held at
 least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly draw
 high levels of participation. The most recent national
 elections (1986) resulted in a change of government. No party
 won an absolute majority. The Socialist Party, which won 80
 seats in Parliament, went into coalition with the People's
 Party, which won 77 seats. Two other parties are represented
 in Parliament: the liberal/nationalist Freedom Party won 18
 seats, and the Greens won 8. Several small parties
 participated in the elections, including the Communist Party,
 which did not receive sufficient support to elect candidates
 to the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the
 authorities are discussed and investigated by press, public
 groups, and private persons without government hindrance.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Representatives of
 oppressed groups frequently visit Austria and meet with
 government officials and political leaders to explain their
 views. Because of Austria's geographic position, such
 meetings frequently focus on the human rights situation in
 Eastern Europe.
 Amnesty International is the major nongovernmental human
 rights organization active in Austria. Austrians also provide
 financial support to the Bruno Kreisky Foundation, which was
 formed in 1976 to honor distinguished human rights activists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. In employment and in other areas, there is extensive
 legal protection against discrimination because of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status, and, in practice, there
 is no pattern of such discrimination.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been abolished.
 Women are entering the work force in increasing numbers and
 have made substantial progress toward economic equality in the
 postwar era. Nevertheless, inequality in practice still
 exists in political, economic, and social fields despite
 legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979 to reform family law. In
 1988, 39 percent of the labor force was composed of women;
 women's average income was 23 percent below that of men. In
 recent years this income disparity has declined.
 
 
 983
 AUSTRIA
 Women participate fully in the electoral process and
 constitute 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. Since 1983
 a state secretary, a woman in the Chancellor's office, has
 been responsible for women's issues within the Government.
 The present coalition Government has two women cabinet members
 (Education and Family; Sports and Environment).
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are fully respected;
 however, in 1988 the Slovenian-speaking minority in the
 province of Carinthia continued to be concerned about the
 future of instruction in the Slovenian language in local
 elementary schools. The Slovenes feared that changes in the
 province's bilingual education system, which some German-
 speaking groups advocated, might tend to curtail the use of
 Slovenian in many provincial elementary schools. In 1988 a
 compromise solution was adopted which, while not entirely
 satisfactory to either of the sides, promised to retain
 Slovenian/German bilingual education in a majority of
 instances.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 Their right to join trade unions and to engage in activities
 in pursuit of trade union aims is protected under general
 constitutional guarantees of freedom of association. In
 practice, Austrian trade unions have an important and
 independent voice in the political, social, and economic life
 of the country.
 Strikes in the postwar period have been comparatively few and
 usually of short duration. High on the list of reasons for
 Austria's record of labor peace is the system of "social
 partnership"--a nearly unique unofficial forum for cooperation
 among labor, management, and government. At the center of the
 system is a commission on wages and prices which has an
 important voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 Nearly 60 percent of the work force is organized in 15
 national unions, each of which is a member of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organization has a
 strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual unions
 and the federation are independent of government or political
 party control (although there are formal factions within these
 organizations that are closely allied with political
 parties). The labor movement enjoys widespread acceptance and
 almost all large companies, private and state owned, are
 strongly organized.
 Workers are further protected by membership in the Austrian
 Chambers of Labor--compulsory for all employees except civil
 servants. The Chambers of Labor provide legal representation
 for workers in their relations with employers and, most
 importantly, vis-a-vis government agencies and in legislative
 and social security matters. While there is some overlap in
 the functions of the Chambers of Labor, on the one hand, and
 the ATUF, on the other, it should be- noted that the latter is
 exclusively responsible for collective bargaining and wage
 policy issues. The leaderships of both institutions are
 elected democratically.
 
 
 984
 AUSTRIA
 The ATUF is a member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, and also provides the worker delegate for
 Austria's delegation to the International Labor Organization.
 Austria has no export processing zones; labor law and practice
 are uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Austria.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age in Austria is 15. The law is
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage in Austria, but a worker
 whose annual income falls below the official poverty line
 (approximately $5,386 at the current exchange rate) is
 eligible to receive social welfare benefits. It should also
 be noted that, typically, nationwide collective bargaining
 agreements set minimum wage rates by job classification for
 each industry. The average Austrian has a high standard of
 living by international comparison, and most of the least
 well-paid workers still enjoy a decent minimum standard.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours
 since 1975, more than 50 percent of the labor force enjoys
 collective bargaining agreements setting a maximum workweek of
 38 or 38.5 hours. Legislation under which a labor
 inspectorate.attached to the Ministry of Justice conducts
 inspections of occupational health and safety conditions
 ensures the effective protection of workers in these areas.
