 ANDORRA
 Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in March 1993 when a popular ref-
 erendum approved its Constitution. Two Co-Princes--the President of Fance and
 the Spanish Bishop of Seu d'Urgell (each represented in Andorra by a delegate)-
 serve coequally as-Heads of State, with limited powers- they have no veto over the
 Government. The Executive Council, composed of the Aead of Government (elected
 by the Parliament) and seven ministers, implements the Constitution and the laws.
 The Parliament is popularly elected. The judiciary functions independently.
 Andorra has no military forces. The small internal police force respects constitu-
 tional rights and individual freedoms.
 The market-based economy is dependent on those of neighboring France and
 Spain. In 1994 it showed recovery from the recent recession, with tourism becoming
 an increasingly important source of revenue. Owing to banking secrecy laws, the fi-
 nancial-services sector is also growing in importance.
 There were no reports of human rights abuses. The 1993 Constitution provides
 for "respect and promotion of liberty, equality, justice, tolerance, defense of human
 rights and dignity of the person," and the Government respects this. The adoption
 of the Constitution led to formation of political parties, which participated in the
 first democratic elections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or 1Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution guarantees all persons the "right to physical and moral integrity"
 and states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. There were no reports of violations. Penal conditions
 are exemplary. Persons convicted of crimes with a penalty of more than one year
 must serve out their terms either in France or in Spain.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the authorities respect this provision. Police must obtain a
 court warrant prior to making an arrest or within 48 hours of it, and must lodge
 
 
 729
 a charge within 48 hours of it. A detainee has the right to be informed of charges,
 to choose a lawyer (or if indigent, have one provided at no cost), and to have access
 to family members. The judge may decide to grant release on bail. Pretrial detention
 is limited to 3 months.
 The law does not provide for exile and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Fhe judiciary is independent and free of inter-
 ference from the Government. The highest body is the five-member Superior Council
 of Justice. One member each is appointed by. the two Co-Princes; the Head of Gov-
 ernment; the President of the Par i   nt; and, collectively, members of the lower
 courts.
 The Constitution provides for the presumption of innocence. The defendant has
 the right to confront and present witnesses, to avoid self-incrimination, and to ap-
 peal the verdict.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides safeguards against arbitrary interference with "privacy,
 honor, and reputation," and the authorities honor these. No searches of any private
 premises may be conducted without a juridically issued warrant. The law also pro-
 tects private communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion of communication, and of access to information, and it expressly prohibits cen-
 sorship and any other means of ideological control. The Government fully respects
 these provisions.
 There are two radio stations, one public and one private. Two newspapers and
 three magazines are published locally. Publications from abroad enter and circulate
 freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to meet and assemble for any lawful purpose. The Government does not
 restrict this freedom. Organizers of a public event need no permit for it.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. The Government
 pays Roman Catholic priests a monthly stipend at the level of the minimum wage.
 Religion is not a required subject in the nonparochial schools, including those spon-
 sored by France or Spame.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel, on emigration,
 or on repatriation.
 The Government has no formal asylum policy; it evaluates asylum requests on a
 case-by-case basis. While Andorra has a long tradition of providing asylum to politi-
 cal refugees, none are resident at present.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 All adult citizens enjoy the right to vote by secret ballot. If the Head of Govern-
 ment loses a vote of confidence-as happened in December-the Parliament chooses
 a replacement, failing which, new elections are held.
 The two Co-Princes are each represented by a delegate in Andorra who holds the
 rank of Ambassador.
 The unicameral Parliament is composed of four to six representatives from each
 of the seven parishes. Elections are-held at 4-year intervals. Half of the 28 rep-
 resentatives are elected on the basis of 2 per parish, and half on the basis of the
 size of population per parish.
 Women have enjoyed full suffrage since 1970, but they continue to play a rel-
 atively minor role in politics. Notwithstanding the absence of formal barriers, few
 women have run for office; only 1 of the 28 Members of Parliament is a woman,
 and only 2 women have occupied cabinet-level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no legal or informal restrictions, no human rights organizations
 operate in this tiny nation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that all persons are considered equal before the law,
 and it prohibits discrimination on grounds of "birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opm-
 ions, or any other personal or social condition: The Government fully respects these
 
 
 730
 
 provisions, which apply not only to citizens but also to legal residents (who con-
 stitut a large majority of the population of Anidorra).
 Women.-The law does not discriminate against women. It treats sexual violence
 as a criminal offense. Data on violence against women are not available, but police
 sources say there is no pattern of abuseby spouses or other family members, and
 they have no recorded cases of battery of women or of rape. The Government has
 no shelters for abused women, and asserts there is no need for such facilities.
 Children.-The law does not explicitly provide for children's rights. There is a
 public shelter for abused or abandoned children. Over the past 12 years there has
 been just one known case of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-Not all public buildings and public places provide access
 for physically disabled persons. The Parliament approved legislation in 1985 that
 mandates accessibility for the handicapped in public places and buildings, but it ap-
 plies only to new construction.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1993 Constitution recognizes the right of all per-
 sons "to form and maintain managerial, professional, and trade union associations
 without prejudice." However, as of the end of 1994, no labor unions were registered.
 Strikes were illegal under the old system; the Constitution does not explicitly per-
 mit them, but so long as there are no labor unions, the question of their legality
 is moot.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The new Constitution states
 that both "workers and employers have the right to defend their own economic and
 social interests." It charges the Parliament with devising legislation to regulate the
 exercise of this right in ways that guarantee the functioning of essential public serv-
 ices. Workers are loath to complain or organize, meanwhile, because they fear dis-
 missal in this traditionally tight job-market where no unemployment insurance is
 available. The law does not prohibit antiunion discrimination.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-No law expressly prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but such offenses do not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 youths less than 18 years of age, except that 16- and 17-year-olds may work under
 certain specified circumstances. Child-labor regulations are enforced by the Labor
 Inspection Office (within the Ministry of Social Welfare, Public Health, and Labor),
 which does not routinely inspect workplaces, but responds to specific complaints.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal standard workweek is capped at 40
 hours, and overtime is limited to 66 hours per month and 426 hours per year.
 The minimum wage, set by law and revised twice a year, is about $4.50 per hour
 (600 Spanish pesetas) In principle, the Labor Inspection Office enforces it, but self-
 enforcement is customary. The minimum wage does not afford a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family.
 Workers may be dismissed without notice, and the unemployed receive social se-
 curty and health benefits for only 25 days. Foreign workers who contribute to the
 social security system are ineligible for retirement benefits if they do not remain in
 Andorra after retirement, but they are eligible for lump-sum reimbursement when
 they leave the country. There is no special court or board of appeals for labor com-
 plaints.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, but enforcement
 is very loose, as there are no routine inspections. There is no legislation Fiving
 workers the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to their continued employment.
