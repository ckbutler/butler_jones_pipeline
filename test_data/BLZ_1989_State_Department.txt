 Belize is a parliamentary democracy organized under a
 Constitution enacted in 1981 upon independence from the United
 Kingdom. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet of
 Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General
 represents Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role
 of Head of State. Both local and national elections are
 scheduled on a regular, constitutionally prescribed basis, and
 the two national political parties--the People's United Party
 (PUP) and the United Democratic Party (UDP)--!field competing
 slates of candidates. The Government changed hands, for the
 second time since independence in 1981, when the PUP won a
 majority of National Assembly seats on September 4, 1989.
 The security forces of Belize consist of the Belize National
 Police (BNP) and the Belize Defence Force (BDF). They are
 responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities. During
 1989, narcotics producers and transshippers in Belize
 continued to tax the scarce resources of the security forces.
 A developing nation with an estimated population of 203,000,
 Belize has an open market economy. The Government favors free
 enterprise and actively encourages increased private
 investment, both foreign and domestic. In 1988 the gross
 domestic product increased 7.6 percent, and per-capita gross
 domestic product was an estimated $1,284.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of all Belizeans are upheld by an independent
 judiciary. Persons may freely associate, hold pyivate
 property, speak freely, and pursue private interests. An
 active and unconstrained press buttresses these civil and
 political rights. The country's overall human rights record
 remains good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Such treatment is
 expressly forbidden by the Constitution.
 Occasional allegations of police misconduct have led to prompt
 investigations, followed, when necessary, by disciplinary
 action or dismissal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention, and
 these provisions are respected in practice. A person must be
 
 
 472
 informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of arrest
 and must be brought before a court within 72 hours. The
 Constitutional Affairs Committee in the House of
 Representatives has recommended that the maximum allowable
 time for informing a detainee of the cause of his arrest be
 shortened from 48 to 24 hours. In practice, all detainees are
 informed immediately. Bail is granted in all but the most
 serious cases. Exile is forbidden by the Constitution and
 does not occur.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of criminal activity have constitutional
 rights to presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, defense by counsel, public trial, and
 appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases.
 Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme
 Court of Belize may appeal to the Court of Appeal.* In some
 cases, including those resulting in a capital sentence, the
 convicted party may make a final appeal to the Queen's Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom. In 1989 these constitutional
 guarantees were respected by a judiciary which is independent
 of the executive and is an effective guarantor of an equitable
 system of justice. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional provisions for the protection of personal
 property, privacy of home and person, and recognition of human
 dignity are generally honored by the Government. A search of
 private premises may be undertaken only if a warrant is
 obtained in advance, except in the case of suspected
 possession of illegal firearms, and search of the person may
 be effected only with just cause.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are protected under the
 Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints
 are publicly presented without government interference. Five
 privately owned weekly newspapers, three of them fiercely
 partisan, engage in lively debate of public issues. The
 opposition press is a frequent critic of government officials
 and policies. All newspapers are subject to the constraints
 of libel laws.
 Before winning the September 4 election, the opposition PUP
 accused the Government of censorship because the Belize
 Broadcasting Authority (BBA), a government agency, screened
 all advertisements submitted for television broadcasting and
 rejected several PUP submissions on grounds that they were not
 factual. The PUP played the rejected advertisements at
 rallies. Other PUP ads were aired on television. The PUP
 turned down an offer from the BBA to participate in a
 televised debate between leading candidates of the two parties.
 Fourteen privately owned television broadcasting stations,
 including several cable networks, operate throughout Belize
 under the authority and regulation of the BBA. The BBA bans
 
 
 473
 BELIZE
 such programming as pornography, requires that a minimum of
 2 percent of programming be locally produced, and must
 authorize certain broadcasts, such as those with political
 content. The BBA continues to assert its right to edit any
 defamatory or personally libelous material from the political
 broadcasts of both parties before these are aired. For lack
 of privately owned commercial radio stations, the BBA'has a de
 facto monopoly on radio broadcasting.
 Academic freedom is vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is constitutionally assured and is honored
 in practice. Political parties and other groups with
 political objectives freely held rallies and mass meetings in
 1989, especially before the September elections. The
 intelligence service, dissolved in 1989, at times observed and
 monitored public political meetings, but no instance of
 harassment or interference has been reported. Under the
 Constitution Belizeans are free to form and join associations
 of their choice, both political and nonpolitical. The
 Government officially charters those associations which wish
 to benefit from legal provisions, such as tax-free status for
 charitable and nonprofit organizations, but less formal,
 unchartered associations also exist. The organizers of public
 meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the
 meetings, and such permits are rarely denied.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Belize. All groups may worship
 as they choose, and all groups and churches may establish
 places of worship, train clergy, and maintain contact with
 coreligionists abroad. There is an active missionary
 presence. In church publications and from the pulpit, church
 leaders comment on government and political policies as these
 affect the social welfare of the country. A broad-based
 partnership of the Government and several different churches
 active in education successfully operates and administers most
 of Belize's primary and secondary schools. No political party
 is affiliated with any particular church or religion, and no
 church or religious affiliation gives political advantage or
 disadvantage to its adherents.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 unrestricted. The Constitution mandates forfeiture of
 Belizean citizenship for those who knowingly and willingly
 accept citizenship of another country.
 While emigration is widely accepted, a wave of immigration
 from neighboring Central American countries has proven
 controversial. Estimates of the number of aliens living in
 Belize since 1980 continue to hover around 40,000. There are
 no exact numbers for alien arrivals or departures. In 1990,
 however, the Government of Belize is scheduled to undertake a
 census which may yield a more accurate tally of aliens. The
 original government enthusiasm for, and assistance to, the new
 
 
 474,
 arrivals waned as public resentment of their increasing
 presence spread. The Government has worked closely with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
 planning a wide variety of future'assistance projects which
 will benefit both Belizeans and aliens, thereby defusing
 potential resentment toward the aliens and helping to minimize
 the chance that they will suffer discrimination. In 1989 no
 refugees were either forced or pressured to return to their
 countries of origin. The UNHCR maintains an office in Belize,
 but the Government has not ratified the United Nations
 Convention on Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy governed by a fairly
 elected Legislative Assembly, with executive direction coming
 from a cabinet of ministers headed by Prime Minister George
 Price. By constitutional mandate, the Governor General
 instructs the leader of the majority party of the National
 Assembly to form a Government following national elections,
 which must be held at least once every 5 years. Municipal and
 town board officials are elected in local contests at 3-year
 intervals. Belize experienced a peaceful and orderly transfer
 of power from the UDP to the PUP in the national elections of
 September 1989, when the PUP won 15 of the 28 seats in the
 British-style House of Representatives in an election in which
 73 percent of the electorate voted.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal
 for Belizean citizens 18 years and older. Observers of the
 polling in each of Belize's six regions during the September
 1989 national elections found procedural safeguards to be
 fully functioning. There were no allegations of electoral
 fraud despite the narrow margin of the popular vote (50.2
 percent) by whfch the Government changed hands.
 The two main parties dominate Belizean political life, and
 each party's membership cuts across all segments of Belize's
 diverse ethnic groupings. The ruling party's narrow
 parliamentary majority suffices for setting policy, but
 Belize's democratic heritage and the forces of public opinion,
 an independent judiciary, and a free press ensure that public
 policy making remains open.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no known requests by international human rights
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Belize, and no international human rights organization
 maintains an office in Belize. Senior government officials
 state that the Government would cooperate with any reputable,
 internationally recognized human rights organization which
 wished to establish an office in Belize.
 The Human Rights Commission of Belize, a nongovernmental
 organization that opened offices in late 1987 maintained a low
 profile throughout the year and issued few public statements.
 
 
 475
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds.
 All Belizeans have equal protection under the law.,
 Despite constitutional provisions of equality, Belizean women
 face some prejudices rooted in social and economic practice.
 The Government worked to overcome this problem by funding a
 Women's Bureau charged with developing programs to improve the
 status of women in Belize. Founded in 1981, the Women's
 Bureau was upgraded in 1986 to a government department within
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Services. A number of
 officially registered women's groups work closely with various
 government ministries in promoting social awareness programs.
 Women have access to education and are active in all spheres
 of national life. Women generally receive the same wage as
 men for similar work.
 Domestic violence against women is a chronic cultural
 problem. In 1985 a group of Belize City residents began the
 Belize Women Against Violence movement (WAV) which now has
 branches elsewhere in Belize. The group operates a shelter
 for battered wives and a hotline for rape victims, and has
 obtained cooperation from the Ministries of Home Affairs and
 Education. The Government is committed to increasing the
 safety of women; it has imposed a minimum sentence for rape
 convictions of 7 years' actual custody.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By statute and in practice Belizean workers and employers are
 free to establish and join labor organizations, and the labor
 union movement is a significant factor in Belize's economy.
 Eleven active unions, with an estimated 30 percent of the
 labor force on their rolls, effectively represent a broad
 cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and professional
 workers, including most civil service employees. The unions
 are considered official by the Ministry of Labor when they
 have filed with the Office of Registry. Members are empowered
 to draft the by-laws and constitutions of their unions, and
 they are free to elect officers from among the membership at
 large. Unions which choose not to hold elections can act as
 representatives for their membership, but only unions which
 hold free and annual elections of officers are permitted to
 join the national Trade Union Congress of Belize (TUC), which
 is affiliated with the Caribbean Congress of Labor and,
 through the Inter-American Organization of Workers, with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). By
 both law and precedent, unions are effectively protected
 against dissolution or suspension by administrative authority.
 Unions are legally permitted to strike, but unions
 representing essential services may strike only after giving
 21 days of notice to the ministry concerned. Only employees
 providing "essential services" must accept conciliation by the
 Labor Commissioner before going on strike. In practice, the
 Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked
 collective bargaining negotiations between labor and
 management, offering nonbinding counsel to both sides.
 Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily
 accepted. However, should either union or management choose
 not to accept the conciliator's decision, both are empowered
 
 
 476
 BE~LIZE
 to a legal hearing of the case, provided that it is linked to
 some valid provision of civil or criminal law. There were no
 strikes during 1989. No union is officially affiliated with
 any political party, although sevetal unions are clearly
 allied to one or the other of the two main parties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Legally, all unions may freely organize. Union activities are
 protected from antiunion interference by article 13 of the
 Constitution which specifically prohibits antiunion
 discrimination both before and after the union is officially
 registered. Cases of antiunion discrimination can be brought
 to the Supreme Court for Constitutional redress. The last
 such case was brought to the Court 5 years ago. Virtually
 every sector of the economy has been unionized to some
 degree. Established unions are effectively protected from
 antiunion interference by both precedent and law, and union
 officials and membership rarely, if ever, encounter
 discrimination. Collective bargaining is the rule rather than
 the exception in most labor negotiations, and workers are
 fully represented in negotiations for the prevention or
 settlement of disputes with employers.
 There are no export processing zones or other areas where
 union organization or collective bargaining are impeded or
 discouraged.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is forbidden by the Constitution and does not
 occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age of employment in Belize is 14 years, or 17
 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors of
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation,
 although in recent years school truancy officers, who have
 historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have
 been less active.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No set minimum wage covers all Belizeans, but some categories
 of service employment, such as retail, restaurant, domestic,
 and health care jobs have minimum hourly wage standards of
 approximately $0.75 per hour. Although unemployment is
 widespread, the conjunction of wage rates and hours worked has
 normally been sufficient to provide employed Belizeans and
 their families with an adequate standard of living. No worker
 is obliged to work more than 6 days or 45 hours per week.
 Payment of overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual paid
 holiday of 2 weeks. A patchwork of health and safety
 regulationq covers numerous industries, and these are enforced
 to varying degrees of effectiveness by the Ministries of Labor
 and Public Health. Enforcement is not universal countrywide,
 and in 1989 limited inspection and investigative resources
 were committed principally to urban and more accessible rural
 areas where labor, health, and safety complaints had been
 registered.
