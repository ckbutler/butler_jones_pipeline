 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state built
 upon the principle of the rule of law. Supreme executive
 power is vested in the President. A cabinet, consisting of a
 prime minister and 16 ministers responsible to Parliament,
 works with the President in governing the country. Judicial
 power is exercised by an independent judiciary consisting of
 the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. The
 Finnish people freely choose a 200-member unicameral
 parliament by direct election every 4 years. They also choose
 electors every 6 years who in turn elect the President.
 Reform of the presidential election system to introduce a more
 direct popular vote is expected to be implemented in 1988. At
 present, there are nine political parties represented in
 Parliament, four of which form a center-left coalition
 government.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and
 supervised by courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state, private, and publicly
 owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue private
 interests, hold private property, and engage in economic
 activity without government interference, Aliens generally may
 own real property only with the Government's permission and
 are prohibited from engaging in political activity.
 During 1986 there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. National minorities enjoy the same
 economic and political rights as the Finnish majority, and
 women have' equal legal status with men.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and observed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A suspect may be
 detained by the police for questioning for 3 days, but for
 special reasons not specified in the law this period may be
 extended by 14 additional days. A suspect may, in the latter
 case, be kept-in custody only on order of an authority with
 the right to remand a person for trial. That authority must
 immediately notify the court of the extension. The accused is
 permitted free access to a lawyer both during investigation
 and following formal arrest. The State pays legal fees for
 the indigent. A court hearing must take place within 8 days
 
 
 909
 FINLAND
 of notification of the arrest, if in a city, or within 30 days
 in rural areas.
 The circumstances of arrest are subject to judicial review
 when the accused is brought to trial. Should the arrest be
 shown to have been incorrect, or should the accused be found
 innocent, he may apply to the same court for civil damages for
 loss of freedom.
 The Government introduced legislation in 1985 to change the
 pretrial procedure. The detention period would be shortened
 to 7 days, and the accused would have access to a lawyer
 during that time. The purpose is to achieve uniformity with
 the practice of other Western countries. Parliament's
 Legislative Committee has proposed some changes in the bill to
 ensure that the detention period will under no circumstances
 exceed the maximum of 7 days.
 The institutions of habeas corpus--a judicial determination of
 the legality of a person's detention--and bail do not exist as
 such in Finland. Those accused of serious crimes must by law
 remain in custody. Those accused of minor offenses may be
 released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses, such as treason,
 mutiny, and trafficking in arms. Supervisory personnel from
 the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, as
 well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of
 Justice, have authority to enter prisons and to order the
 release of prisoners held without charges. By law, Finnish
 citizens cannot be exiled.
 Legislation on the status of conscientious objectors to
 Finland's obligatory military service was passed in 1985. It
 took effect at the beginning of 1987 for a trial period of 5
 years. Giving the individual the option of serving in the
 military or becoming a conscientious objector, the law
 abolishes the investigative board which previously decided
 whether to confer the status of conscientious objector or
 not. The new law also lengthens the alternative civilian
 service for conscientious objectors to 16 months, twice the
 minimum length of military service. Jehovah's Witnesses are
 exempt from military service altogether under the law.
 There is no compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and legal aliens have
 the right to counsel. Charges must be clearly stated.
 Civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time
 of war. There are no separate security courts. Local courts
 may conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when publicity would
 offend morality or endanger national security. In national
 security cases, the judge may withhold from the public any or
 all information pertaining to charges against individuals,
 verdicts, or sentencing. Sanctions may be imposed if such
 information is made public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 
 
 910
 FINLAND
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Security police
 are subject by law to judiciary scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a, Freedom of Speech and Press
 Legal protection, an effective judiciary, an independent
 press, and a functioning democratic political system assure
 freedom of speech and press. The media occasionally exercises
 restraint in treating issues deemed to be potentially harmful
 to the national interest.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution. However,
 if the purpose of association is to influence political
 issues, only Finnish citizens may participate. Public
 demonstrations require notification to the police.
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike. They enjoy a
 protected status and play an important role in political and
 economic life. Over 80 percent of the labor force is
 organized in unions. A one million-member blue collar
 confederation, the Central Organization of Finnish Trade
 Unions (SAK), dominates the trade union movement. Three other
 central organizationb cover white collar, professional, and
 technical employees. Trade unions are independent of the
 Government. Most unions maintain relations with Nordic
 counterparts. The four confederations also have bilateral
 contacts with the Soviet All-Union Central Council of Trade
 Unions. SAK and one white-collar confederation are members of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Two
 affiliates of SAK have ties to Communist-dominated
 international trade union organizations. Finnish trade unions
 participate in the International Labor Organization.
 The Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes private groups formed to achieve a public purpose.
 They are permitted to maintain relations with other
 international groups in both Communist and Western countries.
 If the membership of such an organization is more than
 one-third foreign, the group requires the Government's
 permission to operate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: the Lutheran and the
 Orthodox. Taxes are collected by the Government from members
 to support these churches. Other Christians, Moslems, and
 Jews enjoy unrestricted freedom of worship. Approximately 90
 percent of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the area of the Nordic
 countries--Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and
 Iceland--without passports and need not apply for exit visas
 for travel to other countries. Over 200,000 Finns emigrated
 to Sweden in the past two decades to seek employment, and over
 
 
 911
 FINLAND
 one-half that number have returned. No restrictions have been
 placed on emigration or repatriation.
 The criteria which the Government applies when deciding to
 grant political asylum are periodically debated. The
 Government maintains that, "in accordance with the Geneva
 Agreement, Finland gives asylum to individuals arriving (in
 Finland) who have the characteristics of refugees determined
 by the agreement." Eighteen persons applied for political
 asylum in 1985, and in only one case was it granted; the other
 17 persons, however, were granted the right to stay in Finland
 for an unstipulated period of time. There were no documented
 cases of forced repatriation of people claiming to be
 refugees, although the Finnish press interviewed human rights
 activists in 1986 who said that some people claiming to be
 Soviet refugees were sent back to the Soviet Union. Finnish
 Government spokesmen denied the reports. The Government has
 categorically denied the existence of any agreement with the
 Soviet Union regarding repatriation of Soviet refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 freely elect their representatives
 from among multiple lists of candidates representing a wide
 spectrum of political ideologies. The country has the longest
 tradition of women's suffrage in Europe, and there are at
 present 62 women representatives in Parliament and 3 women
 cabinet ministers.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations. It has not been the subject of an international
 investigation of alleged human rights violations. Within
 Finland, several organizations monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the government-
 sponsored Council for Equality, the Women's Rights Union, and
 Amnesty International. A Finnish Helsinki Watch group was
 established in July 1985 but has not been active.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 To redress existing inequities between the sexes, the Council
 for Equality coordinates and sponsors legislation to meet.the
 needs of women. A comprehensive Equal Rights Bill, which
 ensures equal treatment for women in the workplace, will take
 effect in 1987. An Equal Rights Ombudsman is to take office
 at the same time. A new surname law, permitting women to
 retain their maiden names after marriage as their only
 surname, took effect in January 1986. It also makes it
 possible for a husband to take his wife's surname.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Finland rigorously upholds international standards on working
 conditions, child labor, and occupational safety and health.
 
 
 912
 FINLAND
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16 years.
 However, the law permits youths of 14 and 15 years of age to
 spend up to two-thirds of their school holidays at work up to
 a maximum of 7 hours per day and 36 hours per week. Workers
 under 18 years of age also work less than a standard workweek,
 and night work is prohibited.
 The minimum wage varies according to the industry but averages
 approximately US$3.57 per hour.   A 40-hour workweek is
 standard, although persons in straight shift work have a
 36-hour workweek, and those in certain occupations can work
 longer in a week, subject to an 80-hour or 120-hour maximum in
 2 or 3 weeks respectively.
 Several laws protect workers while on the job and in transit
 to and from their work. Enforcement machinery includes the
 National Board of Labor Protection and labor protection
 delegates elected by the workers themselves. Cooperation
 between labor and management has been mandatory by statute
 since 1974.
