 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates established in
 1971. None have democratically elected institutions or political parties. Each emir-
 ate retains extensive control over mineral wealth (including oil  and some aspects
 of defense and internal security. Most emirates are governed through traditional
 tribal mechanisms, relying heavily on the open majlis or meeting wherein citizens
 may express their concerns directly to their leaders. In accordance with the 1971
 Constitution, the seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council, the
 UAE's highest legislative and executive body. The Supreme Council selects a Presi-
 dent and Vice President from its membership; the President in turn appoints the
 Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Supreme Council meets officially only occasionally,
 although the leaders meet frequently in more traditional settings. The Council of
 Ministers (Cabinet) manages the federation on a day-to-day basis.
 In February the Federal Supreme Council revived the Federal National Council
 (FNC), a 40-member body of prominent citizens appointed by the leaders of the
 seven emirats in ratios reflecti~ng the size of each emr"ate. The FNC had been inac-
 tive since the Gulf war. It has no legislative authority but can question Cabinet
 ministers and make recommendations to the Supreme National Council. Each emir-
 ate maiins its own police force, but only the Federal Government and the Emir-
 ate of Dubai have independent internal security organizations.
 The UAE has a largely free market economy based on oil and gas production,
 trade, and light manu acturing. The Government owns the majority share of the oil
 enterprise in the largest Emirate, Abu Dhabi, with the other shares held by various
 private oil company equity partners. The four emirtes with small or nonexistent
 petroleum resources are dependent on federal government subsidies for such essen-
 
 
 1302
 tial services as health, electricity, water, and education. The economy, which pro-
 vides the UAE with one of the world's highest per capita incomes, is heavily depend-
 ent on foreign labor, which makes up 80 percent of the population. These workers
 primarily from Asian or other Arab countries, perform most manual and technical
 laor.
 A number of human rights remained closely restricted in 1993. The principal
 problems continued to be the denial of the right of citizens to change their govern-
 ment, incommunicado detention, and restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and worker rights. Women continue to make progress in edu-
 cation and in the work force, but certain types of discrimination persist. Although
 there had been a trend toward somewhat freer expression in 1991 and 1992, there
 was no significant progress in 1993. The press continued to avoid direct criticism
 of the Government and exercised self-censorship on topics sensitive to the Govern-
 ment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-There were no reports of political
 or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment, and there were no re-
 ports of such abuse in 1993. In the past, Shari'a courts were known to sentence
 Muslims and non-Muslims to flogging for crimes related to alcohol abuse and adul-
 tery. The Federal Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that Shari'a punishments may not
 be imposed on non-Muslims.
 In 1993 there was a trend toward harsher sentencing. In March a UAE national
 and a foreign national convicted of piracy were each sentenced to the amputation
 of a hand and a foot; this followed the sentencing of another foreign national to the
 amputation of his hand for stealing. However, in both of these cases higher authori-
 ties are said to have ordered lighter sentences. No amputation sentences were
 known to have been carried out.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws of each
 emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code the police must report any arrest to the At-
 torney General within 48 hours, and he must determine within the next 24 hours
 whether to charge, release, or, with sufficient police justification, allow limited fur-
 ther detention pending an investigation. Once charged, detainees are brought to
 trial reasonably expeditiously, although the Code includes no specific right to a
 speedy trial. There is no formal system of bail, but detainees sometimes are released
 upon the deposit of money or an important document such as a passport. The laws
 of the UAE allow incommunicado detention until the accused has been formally
 charged, and it is practiced.
 Exile of citizens is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a (clerical)
 and civil courts, each of which deals with both criminal and civil cases. The civil
 courts are usually part of the federal system and are answerable to the Federal Su-
 preme Court in Abu Dhabi. The Shari a courts are administered by each individual
 emirate, though they are ultimately answerable to the Federal Supreme Court. The
 court systems in the Emirates of Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah are independent of the
 federal system, although they do apply the Civil Procedure Code. Each court system
 has a multilevel appeals process, and verdicts in all capital cases are appealable to
 the President. The nature of the case determines which court system hears a par-
 ticular case, but most cases fall under the jurisdiction of the civil courts. Due proc-
 ess rights are uniform under both Shari'a and civil court procedure. There is a pre-
 sumption of innocence unless guilt is proven.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent a defendant in both
 court systems. The court may appoint legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide serv-
 ices free; only Dubai has an office of public defender. The losing party may be re-
 quired to pay the winner's legal fees. The judge is responsible for looking after the
 interests of a person not represented by counsel. Under the new Criminal Proce-
 dures Code, the accused has a right to defense counsel at trial in cases that involve
 a capital crime or possible life imprisonment. If the defendant is indigent, the Gov-
 ernment will provide counsel. The Federal Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that a de-
 fendant in an appeal case has a "fundamental right" to select his attorney and that
 this right supersedes a judge's power to appoint an attorney for the defendant.
 
 
 1303
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security cases and those
 deemed by the judge likely to harm public morality, are open to the public. Most
 judges are foreign nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. In 1993 the Min-
 istry of Justice initiated a program to train and develop UAE national judges and
 prosecutors.
 There is no separate national security court system. The military has its own
 court system based on Western military judicial practice. Military tribunals try only
 military personnel.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission, except in
 accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without a warrant
 and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in searching prem-
 ises are subject to review, and he is subject to discipline if he acts irresponsibly.
 Anyone other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a private home.
 Local custom and practice place a high value on privacy, and entry into private
 homes without the owner's permission is rare. There is no surveillance of private
 correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although UAE citizens are constitutionally as-
 sured freedom of speech, in practice there is censorship, and most inhabitants, espe-
 cially foreign nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive olitical
 topics or in criticizing the Government. In 1993 an American citizen was detained
 briefly but not arrested, for allegedly profaning the President in conversation with
 a thirdl party.
 Many of the local English- and Arabic-language newspapers are privately owned
 but all receive government subsidies. All foreign publications are routinely subjected
 to censorship reviews before distribution. Domestic publications practice self-censor-
 ship, making formal censorship rare. Journalists also practice self-censorship in ar-
 ticles concerning the UAE destined for publication abroad.
 In 1993 memhers of the newly revived FNC were often quite critical of govern-
 ment policies in their discussions during FNC sessions. Their criticisms were cov-
 ered in the press.
 The UAE press continues to be cautious in reporting on government policy, the
 ruling families national security, religious matters, and relationships with neigh-
 boring states. A trend toward more open expression of opinion on subjects sensitive
 to the Government that began during the Gulf war did not continue in 1993. There
 were credible reports that the Government temporarily revoked the passport of an
 intellectual who published a newspaper article advocating democratic election of the
 Federal National Council members. Yet the Arabic press also carried articles writ-
 ten by non-UAE Arabs calling for greater democracy in the region.
 All television and radio stations are government owned and conform to govern-
 ment reporting guidelines. However, television stations in Abu Dhabi and Dubai
 continue to broadcast the programs of the Cable News Network (CNN), with no ap-
 parent censorship.
 The Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information and Culture reviews
 all imported newspapers, periodicals, books, films, and videos, and bans items con-
 sidered pornographic, violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly criti-
 cal of friendly countries, or critical of the Government or the ruling family. Wide-
 spread legal ownership of satellite dishes has undermined the Government's censor-
 ship efforts. Authorities confiscate material written in Hebrew. The small publishing
 industry is subject to government censorship in accordance with the above criteria.
 In 1993, after an appeal, 2 of the 10 Indian expatriates convicted in 1992 of blas-
 phemy for producing and performing in a play that was critical of Islam and Chris-
 tianity had their sentences extended from 6 to 10 years. Six of the convictions were
 upheld and six were overturned.
 The unwritten but widely accepted ban on criticism of the Government also re-
 stricts academic freedom. However, the trend observable over the last several years
 toward more overt criticism of the Government by academics continued to be evi-
 dent in 1993. In December 1992, a seminar entitled "Human Rights in the World
 and in the Arab World" was held by the UAE Bar Association and the UAE Associa-
 tion of Sociologists in Dubai. The participants presented papers containing rec-
 ommendations on monitoring human rights both inside and outside the UAE.
 Though the Government did not allow the publication of a key paper on human
 rights in the UAE, the seminar received extensive coverage in the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are tightly r-
 stricted. Political organizations are prohibited. Organized public gatherings require
 
 
 1304
 a government permit. Each emirate determines its own practice on public gather.
 ings, with some emirates taking a more liberal approach to seminars and con-
 ferences on sensitive subjects (see Section 2.a.). Citizens normally confine their po-
 litical discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies" (majlises) held in private
 homes, which are a local tradition. There are no restrictions on the iormation of pri-
 vate associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. UAE citizens are predomi-
 nately Sunni Muslims, but Shi'a Muslims are also free to worship and maintain
 mosques throughout most of the UAE. However, Shi'as are not permitted mosques
 in the Emirate of Ras al Khaimah. According to a press report, the Emirate of
 Dubai has placed private mosques under the control of its Department of Islamic
 Affairs and Endowments. This move gives the Government greater control over the
 appointment of preachers and was reportedly taken by the Government to prevent
 the pread of what it considers religious extremism. By tradition and social custom,
 non-Muslims are free to practice their religion but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. A British Christian was recently arrested and sen-
 tenced to 6 months in prison for proselytizing. There are Christian churches and
 Hindu and Sikh temples, some built on and onated by the ruling families, in the
 major cities. Foreign clergymen are allowed to minister to expatriate congregations.
 Christian teaching is permitted in private schools for Christian children. Religious
 groups are allowed to engage in private charitable activities.
 (See Section 2.a. on the appeal of Indian nationals charged with blasphemy.)
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation within
 the country, except for security areas such as defense and oil installations. Unre-
 stricted foreign travel and emigration are permitted to male citizens except those
 involved in financial disputes under adjudication. However, a husband may bar his
 wife and children from leaving the country without his permission. All citizens have
 the right to return. There is a small population of stateless residents, many of whom
 have lived in the UAE for more than one generation. They are Bedouins or the de-
 scendants of Bedouins who are unable to prove that they are of UAE origin. Since
 they do not hold passports, they may not travel abroad.
 During and immediately after the Gulf war, the authorities revoked the residence
 permits and employment visas of some long-term residents of Palestinian, Iraqi,
 Yemeni, Jordanian, and Sudanese origin. In 1993 fewer of these residents had their
 residence permits or visas revoked, particularly those in highly technical profes-
 sions. The Government reportedly asked known dissidents of Syrian and Egyptian
 nationality to leave the country; they were not forcibly repatriated but were told to
 find another country of residence.
 UAE nationals are not restricted in seeking or changing employment. However,
 only foreign netionals in specific occupations, primarily professional, may change
 employers without first leaving the country for 6 months. This law is often not en-
 forced.
 There are no formal procedures for accepting refugees, and persons who seek mfu-
 gee status are routinely jailed or detained while awaiting resettlement in a third
 country. Although one may acquire a UAE passport through marriage or presi-
 dential fiat, there is no formalized procedure for naturalization. Noncitizens are ex-
 pected to leave the country at retirement age but may remain if sponsored by their
 children.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The UAE has no formal democratically elected institutions, and citizens do not
 have the right to change their government or even to form political parties. Al-
 though there are consultative councils at the federal and national levels, most exec-
 utive and legislative ower is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers, their ex-
 tended families, and those persons and families to whom they are allied by histori-
 cal ties, marriage or common interest. These emirate political leaders constitute the
 dominant political force at the national level.
 Members of the Federal National Council (FNC) are appointed by the rulers of
 each emirate in a ratio depending on the size and wealth of the emirate. The FNC
 has no legislative authority but may summon ministers, criticize government poli-
 cies, and make recommendations to the Cabinet. Its sessions are open to the public.
 Decisionmaking at the federal level is through consensus of the seven emirates
 and their leading families. This need for consensus tends to slow decisionmaking at
 the federal level. Citizens have the opportunity to make their views and grievances
 heard through attendance at majlises held by the rulers of each emirate. Women
 may attend women's majlises presided over by the wives of the rulers.
 
 
 1305
 Although the rulers and ruling families by tradition are presumed to have the
 right to rule, their incumbency ultimately depends on the quality of their leadership
 and their responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are accessible, in
 varing, degrees, to citizens who have a problem or a request. The choice of a new
 emurate ruler falls to the ruling family in consultation with other prominent tribal
 rulers.
 Women are free to hold government positions, but there are few women in senior
 positions because they are relatively new to government service and because there
 continues to be strong family pressure against women entering the workplace. Al-
 though the UAE's Shi a minority has enjoyed commercial success, few of their mem-
 bers manage to reach top positions in the Federal Government.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined with their substan-
 tial involvement and influence in economic life. The ruling families and their close
 allies control and profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life. A complex system of dis-
 tribution of wealth, including through the federal and emirate governments, ensures
 generous subsidies and a high standard of living for most UAE citizens.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The UAE d'nes not have any internal groups that monitor human rights. Govern-
 ment prohibitions on freedom of press and association would make it very difficult
 for a private group to investigate and publicly criticize the Government's human
 rights restrictions. The Human Rights Seminar held in December 1992, which was
 covered by the UAE press, has led to a small increase in public awareness of human
 rights issues. There were reports that a group of citizens has begun to meet irregu-
 larly to discuss human rights and democracy in the UAE. In December the Abu
 Dhabi Government sponsored a human rights symposium attended by foreign and
 domestic academics jurists, and government officials. A representative of an inter-
 national human rights organization attended and delivered a paper at the seminar.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Most women play a family-centered, subordinate role in UAE society be-
 cause of the frequency of early marriage and tradi!ional attitudes about women's
 activities. As noted earlier, husbands may bar their wives and children from leaving
 the country without their consent, and married women may not take employment
 without their husbands' written consent. In cases of divorce, Islamic law is observed.
 The woman receives custody of children until they are 7 years of age. After that,
 a child usually lives with his or her father unless there are circumstances that con-
 vince judicial authorities that custody should be given to the mother. In divorce
 cases in which the mother is a non-Muslim or a foreigner, the court usually rants
 custody to the father regardless of the child's age. A woman who remarries forfeits
 her right to the custody of children from a previous marriage. Polygyny, in accord-
 ance with Islamic law, is permitted for men. In practice, few UA men have mre
 than one wife. Women are restricted from holding majority shares in most major
 types of businesses. UAE women employed outside the home generally receive equal
 ay for equal work. A woman's property is not commingled with that of her hus-
 band.
 Women's education continues to advance rapidly. Female enrollment at the UAE
 University, for example, now constitutes 70 percent of the student body, though this
 is partially attributable to the fact that UAE women rarely study abroad, as many
 UAE men do. Opportunities for women are also   win in government service and
 in traditional occupations such as education and health. Women are officially en-
 couraged to continue their education, and government-sponsored women's centers
 provide adult education and technical training courses .The UAE military service
 accepts women volunteers in the officer corps and as enlisted personnel. A special
 military trining course for women, started ater the Gulf war, continues.
 Spouse abuse is rarely reported in the UAE. Knowledgeable sources report a low
 incidence of medical cases rsulting from spouse abuse. However, when reported,
 the local police authorities take action to protect women from abuse. UAE laws also
 protect women from verbal abuse or harassment from men, and violators are subject
 to criminal action. There continue to be credible reports of abuse of female domestic
 servants by both UAE and foreign employers, but the authorities do take action
 against the offender when an incident is reported.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Figures on
 federal and emirate expenditures on children are not available, but UAE children
 receive free health care, free education, guaranteed housing, and the other per-
 
 
 1306
 quisites of UAE citizenship. Expatriate workers are not permitted to bring their
 families to the UAE unless they make a sufficient wage to provide for them. They
 must pay for the schooling of their children, but health care charges are negligible.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Discrimination based on national origin,
 while not legally sanctioned, is prevalent in the UAE (see Section 2.d.). Employ-
 ment, immigration, and security policy as well as cultural attitudes towards foreign
 workers are conditioned by national origin. There is some discrimination against the
 Shi'a minority, based on their national origins rather than on their religious affili-
 ation.
 People with Disabilities.-The UAE has no federal legislation requiring accessibil-
 ity for the disabled. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs sponsors the
 UAE Handicapped Centers which provide facilities and services to the disabled.
 Services range from special education and transportation assistance to sending a
 team to the Special Olympics.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-UAE law does not grant workers the right to orga-
 nize unions and to strike. It is a criminal offense for public sector workers to strike.
 In practice, there are no unions and no strikes. Foreign workers who might attempt
 to organize a union risk deportation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-UAE law does not grant
 workers the right to engage in collective bargaining, and it is not practiced. Most
 of the work force is com posed of foreign nationals. Workers in the industrial and
 service sectors are normally employed under contracts that are subject to review by
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The purpose of the review is to ensure that
 the pay offered is enough for the employee's basic needs and to secure a means of
 living. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers must rely on conciliation
 committees organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or on special labor
 courts. Domestic servants and agricultural workers are not covered by UAE labor
 laws and thus have great difficulty in obtaining any assistance in resolving labor
 disputes. In the free port where manufacturing takes place, the same laws and regu-
 lations apply as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced. However, foreign workers are often recruited in their own
 countries by unscrupulous agents who bring them into the UAE under conditions
 approaching indenture.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor regulations prohibit employ-
 ment of persons under age 15 and have special provisions for employing those aged
 15 to 18. Laws prohibiting the employment of children are enforced by the Depart-
 ment of Labor. Labor regulations allow contracts only for adult foreign workers. In
 January the Government announced new regulations prohibiting the employment of
 young children as camel jockeys and decreed that camel jockeys should weigh no
 less than 45 kilograms. It also created a Camel Racing Association which has effec-
 tively enforced the new rules during the 1993 racing season. Small children who
 were employed as jockeys were returned to their parents.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administrative mini-
 mum wage. Supply and demand determine compensation. However, according to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, there is an unofficial, unwritten minimum
 wage rate which would afford a worker and family a minimal standard of living.
 As noted in Section 6.b., the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor con-
 tracts and does not approve any contract that stipulates a clearly unacceptable
 wage
 The standard workday and workweek are set at 8 hours per day, 6 days per week,
 but these standards are not strictly enforced. The law provides for a minimum of
 24 days per year of annual leave plus 10 national and religious holidays.
 Most foreign workers receive either employer-provided housing or a housing allow-
 ance, medical care, and homeward passage through their employers. The vast ma-
 jority of such workers, howevwr, do not earn the minimum salary ($1,000 per month)
 required for them to sponsor their families for a UAE residence visa. Employers
 have the option to petition for a ban from the work force of 1 year for any foreign
 employee who leaves his job without fulfilling the terms of his contract.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, which are enforced by the Min-
 istry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities, and Civil
 Defense. Every large industrial concern is required to employ an occupational safety
 officer certified by the Ministry of Labor. if an accident occurs, a worker is entitled
 to fair compensation. Health standards are not uniformly observed in the housing
 camps provided by employers. Workers' jobs are not protected if they remove them-
 selves from what they consider to be unsafe working conditions. However, the Min-
 
 
 1307
 istry of Labor may require employers to reinstate workers following an investigation
 of the alleged unsafe working conditions. All workers have the right to complain to
 the Labor Ministry, whose officials are accessible to any grievant, and an effort is
 made to investigate all complaints. The Ministry, which oversees worker compensa-
 tion, is, however, chronically understaffed and underbudgeted so that complaints
 and compensation claims are backlogged.
 Foreign nationals from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Sri
 Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in large numbers. There are many com-
 plaints that recruiters in the country of origin use unscrupulous tactics to entice
 manual laborers and domestics to come to the UAE, promising unrealistically high
 salaries and benefits and at times bring them in illegally. The workers must prm-
 ise the recruiters several months of future wages to secure their passage. When they
 come there are often no jobs waiting for them so they must find jobs as undocu-
 mented workers, accepting wages farbelow the accepted minimum wage. Such cases
 may be appealed to the Labor Ministry and, if this does not resolve the issue to
 the courts. However, many laborers choose not to protest or to engage in such a
 lengthy process for fear of reprisals by their employers. Moreover, since the UAE
 tends to view foreign workers through the prism of their various nationalities, em-
 ployment policies, like immigration and security policies, have at times been condi-
 tioned upon national origin.
