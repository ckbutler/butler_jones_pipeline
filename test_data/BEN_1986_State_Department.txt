 BENIN
 Following independence from France in 1960, Benin experienced
 political instability and numerous changes in government until
 1972, when the army staged a decisive coup that brought the
 present Government, headed by President Mathieu Kerekou, to
 power. In 1974, the new leadership declared the establishment
 of a Marxist-Leninist Government under the direction of a
 single political party, the People's Revolutionary Party of
 Benin. Despite the imitation of certain political structures,
 Benin's Marxism thus far bears little resemblance to that of
 the Soviet Union. The party itself is directed by a small
 leadership group in which the influence of the military
 remains important. It controls the selection of candidates
 for the National Revolutionary Assembly and local government
 bodies. The military hold 9 out of 15 cabinet positions.
 Early efforts at radical political and social transformation
 in the mid-1970's encountered widespread resistance and
 resulted in significant erosions of political and personal
 liberties. An unsuccessful coup attempt in 1977 was followed
 by a period of intense suspicion toward foreigners and
 domestic critics. In recent years, however, the authorities
 have exhibited greater tolerance of divergent social and
 political views.
 Benin is ranked as one of the world's 35 poorest countries;
 its underdeveloped economy is largely supported by subsistence
 agriculture (80 percent of the population lives in rural
 areas), a small commercial sector, and recently oil
 production, located offshore near Cotonou. Economic activity
 has been hampered by the Government's efforts to institute
 centralized controls. In 1985 mounting balance of payments
 problems and rising debt service costs led the Government to
 enter into negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
 to reduce the number of state enterprises and to encourage
 foreign private investment.
 The human rights situation improved somewhat in 1986. There
 was an absence of incidents which might have caused the
 Government to use repressive measures. There were, however,
 credible reports that approximately 15 students were arrested
 at the National University in order to forestall anticipated
 demonstrations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In its 1986 Report, Amnesty International noted reports that
 soie persons detained on political grounds in 1985 had been
 tortured or ill-treated.

 BENIN
 Prison conditions in Benin are very poor. Sanitation
 facilities are inadequate, there is overcrowding, and the food
 supply is inadequate unless supplemented by food from friends
 or relatives. Physical punishment reportedly occurs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Benin's legal system provides for the review of detentions by
 a court of law in all but a few sensitive political cases.
 The Constitution states that no citizen may be arrested
 without an order of arrest by an established judicial body.
 In practice, however, persons have been detained, some for
 extended periods, without charge and without recourse to legal
 assistance or judicial hearing. For example, the American
 Association for the Advancement of Science has reported that a
 Beninese physician, Afolabi Biaou, was arrested in November
 1984 and has been detained without charge since that time.
 Biaou was previously involved with the "Support Committee for
 Former Political Prisoners" in Benin and was allegedly arrested
 en route to the presidential palace where he had been summoned
 for a meeting. Most of these arrests have occurred during
 periods of political tension. Prior to his departure in
 October to meet with Western European leaders, President
 Kerekou ordered the release of about 50 prisoners held since
 1985 for having participated in strikes. Lengths of
 incarceration before trial are at the discretion of the
 authorities. Although arrests are not publicized, no special
 attempt is made to keep them secret.
 There were no reports alleging the use of forced labor, which
 is prohibited under Beninese law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's judicial system is allowed to function independently
 in all but sensitive political cases. In such instances,
 detainees may or may not be permitted legal counsel or granted
 a public hearing. There is no time limit with respect to
 charging a defendant or bringing the accused to trial. In
 recent years, the Government has used only the established
 civilian "revolutionary court" system. These courts are
 organized on provincial and national levels, and there are
 plans for courts at the district level once sufficient judges
 have been trained. The highest court of appeal is the Central
 People's Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family,:Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although Benin's Constitution guarantees the inviolability of
 the home and requires a warrant from a judge before the police
 can enter a residence, there have been occasional unconfirmed
 reports of forced entries in sensitive political cases. Other
 reports indicate that security police monitor telephones and
 the mail of suspected persons. There are no other known types
 of interference with the home or family.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With two exceptions, the local press, radio, and television
 are all government owned and operated. The exceptions are a
 weekly paper published by the Catholic church and Echo, a
 monthly journal of opinion circulated throughout West Africa.

 BENIN
 While both deal with political issues, they do so with
 circumspection. The official media carry only those stories
 that are approved by or serve the interests of the
 party-state. Opposition to government policies and open
 criticism of the Government are not tolerated. Academic
 freedom on nonpolitical issues, however, is permitted, and
 there is normally no censorship of foreign books and artistic
 works. Foreign radio broadcasts are readily available to much
 qf the population through shortwave radio. No attempt is made
 to interfere with radio reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All meetings of a political nature must be sponsored by the
 single political party. Although organized public opposition
 to the Government itself is not permitted, there are numerous
 examples of groups which have organized to protest specific
 government policies or actions. In recent years, the
 Government has welcomed the formation of a wide variety of
 private social, service, and professional organizations
 (including Lion and Rotary clubs), many of which maintain
 active international affiliations. There is no known
 persecution of professional groups.
 Labor unions are organs of the party and unified under a
 general labor organization, the Union Nationale des Syndicats
 des Travailleurs du Benin (UNSTB). Although controlled by the
 Government, individual local unions negotiate with individual
 employers on labor matters and represent workeLs' grievances
 to employers and to the Government. The Government often
 plays the role of arbiter.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly denied or
 protected, it is clear that labor strikes are not sanctioned.
 The Constitution of 1977 states that "union activities are
 guaranteed to workers" but "must be used for the elevation of
 the conscience of the proletarian class and for the
 augmentation and continued development of production." When
 labor actions occasionally occur in Benin (usually by students
 rather than workers), they take the form of brief work
 stoppages to protest such things as late salary or scholarship
 payments.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. With the exception of one group,
 Celestial Christianity, which has been declared illegal by the
 Government, there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies
 or teachings, and religious conversion is freely permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. International movement
 is controlled in that a passport and exit permission must be
 obtained for travel to other than West African countries;
 obtaining these documents, however, is not difficult.
 Economic rather than governmental constraints usually preclude
 travel outside the region. There are no restrictions placed
 on residence within Benin, except for recently released
 prisoners who may be subject to travel restrictions.
 
 
 BENIN
 Emigration is common in Benin. Many Beninese move to
 neighboring countries to earn a livelihood without jeopardizing
 their citizenship. Beninese living abroad are encouraged by
 the Government to return home to help develop their country,
 but only a small number have done so. By far the largest
 group of displaced persons in Benin is Chadians who have fled
 the fighting in their country. There are, according to the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, about 3,300
 displaced Chadians in Benin. Many of these are now
 permanently settled in Benin, although they are free to return
 to Chad if they wish.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Leadership is exercised by President Kerekou and a small group
 of senior party officials, many of whom hold positions in the
 Government. The electoral process allows for citizen
 participation in the nomination of candidates for the National
 Revolutionary Assembly, in theory the principal decisionmaking
 body of the Government. Party membership is neither a
 requisite for participation in this process nor for high
 office or civil service employment. The final selection of
 candidates for the single national slate, however, is made by
 the party leadership. No opposition parties or slates are
 permitted. The Assembly itself rarely takes issue with
 policies formulated by the party leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers any outside attempt to investigate
 human rights practices to be interference in its internal
 affairs.
 On February 25, 1986, the Government of Benin deposited
 instruments of ratification for the Organization of African
 Unity Charter on Human and People's Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Historically, Beninese women have played a major role in the
 commercial sector as well as in small-scale family farming.
 Women have not had the same educational opportunities as men.
 Most boys now attend primary school, but only about one out of
 every two girls is in the primary grades. Nevertheless, the
 Government officially encourages new opportunities for women
 and, while there are no women in ministerial positions, a
 number of women figure prominently in executive level positions
 in the presidency and in the various ministries. There are
 two women on the central committee of the party. The ruling
 party has a women's organization -- the Organisation des
 Femmes Revolutionnaires du Benin (OFRB). As do other
 specialized party organizations, the OFRB serves to transmit
 party policy to its members. It also provides a channel for
 women's views to be made known to the party leadership.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Government has given vigorous support to policies designed
 to improve the conditions of average workers in both the
 industrial and agricultural sectors. It has, for example,
 committed itself to the gradual extension of free or low-cost
 
 
 16
 BENIN
 medical care and social services; legislated minimum wage
 levels and occupational safety conditions; and established
 procedures and mechanisms for the protection of worker rights,
 including legislation prohibiting child labor. The Beninese
 labor code establishes a 40-hour workweek and implicitly
 defines a "minimum age" by authorizing participation in the
 social security system beginning at age 14. The civil service
 administration will not hire persons under 18. In many
 instances, however, the Government's ability to enforce these
 policies and regulations is limited by a shortage of
 administrative and financial resources and by the need for the
 entire family to farm subsistence plots of land.
