 DOMINICA
 Independent since 1978, Dominica is a parliamentary democracy and a member
 of the Commonwealth of Nations. Prime Minister Eugenia Charles' Dominica Free-
 dom Party, in office since 1980, was reelected in 1985 and 1990 in free and fair elec-
 tions.
 The Defense Force was disbanded in 1981 following two violent coup attempts.
 Since then the Commonwealth of Dominica police have been the only security force.
 The police force, supervisedby the Commissioner of Police, includes a Coast Guard
 unit and a Special Services Unit (SSU)-a small, paramilitary unit established in
 1983 by the Regional Security System of the Eastern Caribbean states. There are
 no instances on record of human rights violations by the SSU. The police are con-
 trolled by and responsive to the democratically elected Government.
 Dominica's mountainous terrain and periodic devastation by hurricanes make it
 one of the least developed nations in the Eastern Caribbean. The primarily agrarian
 economy depends upon earnings from banana exports to the United Kingdom. Sev-
 eral small industrial plants operate, but unemployment and underemployment are
 high. Per capita gross domestic product at current prices was estimated at $2,233
 in 1992. The Government is attempting to develop its tourist industry, to diversify
 
 
 agricultural production, and to promote e-.-ports of raw fruits, vegetables, and coco-
 nut products both within and outside the region.
 Human rights were generally well respected in Dominica, although overcrowding
 and unsanitary conditions continued in the prison, and there were charges of
 searches without cause of young men in drug-related inspections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and there were no reports of such practices. Prominent
 nongovernmental organizations, trade unions, and the press reported that allega-
 tions of harsh treatment by law enforcement officials made in previous years have
 diminished. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions continue to be problems in
 Dominica's only prison facility. An addition to the prison is under construction, and
 during the past 2 years, the prison instituted work therapy, sports programs, edu-
 cational opportunities, and counseling to offset the poor conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that persons arrested
 or detained be charged with a crime within 24 hours or be released from custody.
 This is honored in practice except in rare cases in which, for example, persons can-
 not afford legal counsel.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Dominican law provides for public trial before an
 independent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the right to appeal. Indigents are
 provided free legal counsel only in capital cases.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and seizure. Search warrants are re-
 quired by law. While there were no official reports of arbitrary government intru-
 sions into the private lives of individuals, most human rights groups allege that
 young men are often searched with little or no probable cause in drug-related in-
 spections.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The right of free expression is provided in the
 Constitution and adhered to in practice. The political opposition openly criticizes the
 Government. Dominica's main radio station is state owned but offers ample access
 for citizens to express their views. There is also an independent radio station owned
 bythe Catholic Church which broadcasts, although it has not yet been granted an
 official operating license.
 Dominicans also enjoy good access to independent news sources through cable tel-
 evision and radio reception from neighboring islands. The principal newspaper was
 founded by the Catholic Church, but the Church divested its interest in it in 1990.
 The editorial stance of the newspaper remains progovernment, but opposition view-
 points are prominently reported. During the intraparty leadership campaign of
 1993, a second weekly newspaper, the Tropical Star, was inaugurated. It published
 its political views without interference.
 Political parties publish their own journals, and the opposition United Workers'
 Party prints a weekly newsletter. The Dominica Labour Party complained that a
 ban on live broadcasts of parliamentary sessions, which continued in 1993, is a form
 of censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government respects the
 constitutionally mandated freedoms of association and assembly and does not hinder
 opposition groups from holding political meetings or public demonstrations. Such
 meetings and gatherings were held frequently throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism is the predominant faith, and there
 are various Protestant denominations. There are also small Muslim and Rastafarian
 communities. While Rastafarians are not banned from entering Dominica, they are
 not always looked upon kindly by Dominican immigration officials. A "dread law"
 forbidding dreadlocks (braided hair) was repealed over 10 years ago, but harassment
 of Rastafarians still occurs occasionally. Outside religious groups are not restricted
 in their activities.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -These rights are provided for by law and respected in practice. The
 Government may revoke passports if subversion is suspected but has not done so
 in recent times.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Dominica, independent since 1978, had a prior long historical tradition of democ-
 racy and home rule. Power is exercised by a Cabinet appointed by the Prime Min-
 ister. Elections are by secret ballot and held every 5 years or earlier, at the discre-
 tion of the Prime Minister. Elections in 1980, 1985, and 1990 were free and fair,
 and voter participation was high. The 1990 elections were contested by the incum-
 bent Dominica Freedom Party (DFP) the Dominica Labour Party (DLP), and the
 United Workers Party (UWP). The DPP won 11 of the 21 parliamentary seats, the
 UWP 6, and the DLP 4. As a result of a December 20 by-election, the UWP holds
 seven seats and the DLP three, Prime Minister Charles plans to remain in office
 until the next general election (due before 1995), but the DFP has already chosen
 Foreign Minister Brian Alleyne to be Charles' eventual successor as party leader.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local human rights orga-
 nizations, although no such groups exist at present. Several advocacy roups such
 as the Association of Disabled People and a women and children self-help organiza-
 tion operate freely and without government interference. There were no requests for
 investigations of human rights abuses from international or regional human rights
 groups during 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution includes provisions against racial and sexual discrimination,
 which are adhered to in practice.
 Women.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, women do not benefit
 from any specific civil rights legislation. There is little open discrimination, yet sex-
 ual harassment is common. Both the police and the courts prosecute cases of rape
 and sexual assault. Under the law, victims may report sexual and other violent
 abuse to the Welfare Department or to the police, but there is no specific recourse
 for women who are abused by their husbands. There is no shelter for battered
 women, but a hotline manned by volunteers is available. The Welfare Department
 often provides assistance to victims of abuse by finding them temporary shelter, pro-
 viding counseling to both parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare De-
 partment reports all cases of abuse to the police, alt ough the police are often reluc-
 tant to interfere in domestic quarrels.
 Women's rights organizations advocate adoption of eight gender-neutral draft laws
 developed by the Caribbean Community Secretariat for Women's Rights. These pro-
 posals cover domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual offenses, inheritance, and
 other matters but have not been introduced in Parliament. Property ownership is
 deeded to "heads of households," who are usually males. When the husband head
 of household dies without a will, the wife cannot inherit the property or sell it, al-
 though she can live on it and pass it to her children.
 In the workplace, young women often are able to obtain jobs because they are con-
 sidered more reliable than their male counterparts, who are often unemployed. The
 law permits unequal pay for men and women in daily paid employment. In the civil
 service, pay is attached to a specific job and is fixed, whatever the gender of the
 incumbent. In the private sector, there is no law requiring equal pay for equal work
 by salaried workers.
 Children.-Legislation covering children's rights in Dominica includes the Chil-
 dren and Young Person's Act, the Legitimation Act, the Infants' Protection Act, and
 the Adoption of Infants Act. Enforcement of these laws falls under the Welfare De-
 partment, police, court system, and prison director. However, there is no enforce-
 ment arm for the Children and Young Person's Act, and the training school it man-
 dated has not been established. The Government lacks the resources, organizations,
 and skills needed to effect much positive change in the area of children's rights.
 There were 210 reported cases of child abuse during 1992, compared to 174 in 1991
 and 127 in 1990. It is likely that this represents an increase in reporting cases rath-
 er than an actual increase in child abuse.
 Women's advocacy arioups have also called for programs to supportpregnant school
 children and those with babies. During 1992 the age of consent to sexual relations
 was raised from 14 to 16.

 Indigenous People.-There is a significant Carib Indian population in Dominica,
 estimated at 3,000 out of a total population of 72,000. Most live on a 3,700-acre res-
 ervation created in 1903. School, water, and health facilities available on the Carib
 reservation are similar to those available to other rural Dominicans. Caribs partici-
 pate in national political life and enjoy the same civil rights accorded other Domini-
 can nationals. Worrell Sanford, a Labour member of Parliament who resigned De-
 cember 20,is a Carib, and Carib Chief O'Gustie is a nationally respected leader.
 People with Disabilities.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, the
 disabled do not benefit from any specific legislation. There is no requirement man-
 dating access for those with disabilities. Fiscal considerations limited action to adopt
 legislation covering the disabled. Dominica lacks trained specialists, roads inhibit
 mobility of shut-ins, and wheelchairs are unaffordable. There is no rehabilitation
 center.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to organize, to choose
 their representatives, and to strike. Less than 10 percent of the work force is orga-
 nized; two unions disbanded in 1992, and there was only one significant stre,
 which lasted 1 day. The Civil Service Association, which had instigated demonstra-
 tions against the Public Service Act of 1991, continues to press for changes in areas
 of concern to civil servants. Among other provisions, the law sets a limit on the pe-
 riod for wage negotiations. (In the past, civil servants traditionally received large
 back-pay awards after marathon negotiations.) This Act also bars civil servants from
 speaking in public on controversial national political issues, except when it is in line
 with their duties. There is no restriction on forming a national labor federation. All
 the unions are independent of the Government and political parties and are affili-
 atd with various international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have legally defined
 rights to organize workers and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread i n the nonagricultural sectors of the economy,, including the government
 service, and there is also recourse to mediation and arbitration by the Government.
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by law, and union rights are
 enforced by, judicial and police authority. In addition, workers fired for union activi-
 ties must be reinstated. Enforcement mechanismsare the responsibility of Depart-
 ment of Labour inspecors under the supervision of the Labour Commissioner. How-
 ever, the small Labour Inspection Office lacks qualified personnel to carry out its
 duties under existing labor legislatiotions and practice governing
 Dominica's industriadaras and other exprt firms do not differ from that prevailing
 in the rest of the economy. It is legally compulsory for employers to recognize unions
 as bargaining agents once both parties have followed appropriate procedures.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.- The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 15 years. Employers generally observe this law without government en-
 forcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minium wages for various categories of work-
 ers are set by statute and were last revised in November 1989. The minimum wage
 rate for most categories of workers is $0.56 (EC$1.50) per hour and is not sufficient
 to provide a decent standard of living for a household. However, most workers earn
 more than the legislated minimum wage. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours
 in 5 days. The law provides for a minimum of 2 weeks' paid vacation. The Employ-
 ment Safety Act, an occupational health and safety law, is considered by a major
 union and by local nongovernmental organizations to be consistent with inter-
 national standards. The Advisory Committee on Safety and Health is an established
 body but has never met. The enforcement mechanism consists af inspections by the
 Department of Labour, which can and does prescribe specific compliance measures,
 impose fines, and prosecute offenders. In practice, however, inspections  earely
 made.
