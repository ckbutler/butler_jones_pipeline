 ALGERIA
 According to its Constitution, Algeria is a Socialist, Islamic
 state in which ultimate power is vested in a single political
 party, the Front de Liberation Nationa.e (FLN). As Secretary
 General of the Party, President of the Republic, and Minister
 of Defense, Chadli Bendjedid holds the key decisionmaking
 positions. Nonetheless, most important decisions are taken by
 consensus involving the military, the Government, and the
 party elites. These elites are bound together by the common
 experience of a harsh struggle for independence, obtained from
 France in 1962. A sense of "revolutionary, anti-colonial
 mission" is basic to their self-perception of what Algeria is
 and ought to be. This revolutionary consensus is the
 principal source of popular legitimacy for the Government and
 the nation.
 Urban policy and the rural-oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. Military security forces, in practice, are
 given greater leeway to make arrests, but there are no
 documented cases of abuse or torture.
 The Government has made efforts to reduce tensions in recent
 years with Berbers, who constitute from one-fourth to
 one-third of the population, by some accommodation of Berber
 cultural demands. Berber-government confrontation over
 political rights increased during 1985, however, when members
 of two illegal, predominantly Berber organizations with
 political overtones were arrested for staging unauthorized
 ceremonies in several Algerian cities during the country's
 July 5 National Day celebrations.
 The economy is Socialist and largely under state control. The
 private sector is, however, increasingly recognized as a
 valuable participant in many sectors of the economy. The
 development of extensive hydrocarbon resources allowed Algeria
 to undertake ambitious industrialization programs in the past
 two decades. The current 5-year plan (1985-1989) emphasizes
 revitalizing agriculture, creating jobs, developing rural
 areas, and meeting social needs by building houses, schools,
 and hospitals. Major problem areas include underemployment,
 lack of productivity, and gaps in the supply and distribution
 system.
 Although the Constitution contains human rights guarantees,
 civil liberties remain restricted and political rights, in
 particular, are circumscribed by the party and the Government
 which limit electoral choices and restrict public debate to
 officially sanctioned forums and issues. The favorable trend
 observed in previous years was continued when, in April 1985,
 139 Islamic fundamentalists arrested in late 1982 and early
 1983 were tried and received relatively lenient sentences.
 The Government demonstrated its willingness to suppress
 opposition elements, however, with the arrest in the late
 summer of 1985 of several well-known and internationally
 recognized Algerian activists for human and Berber rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings in 1985.
 
 
 1175
 ALGERIA
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 neither condoned nor practiced. There were no accusations of
 such practices in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and in 1985 there were no
 confirmed reports of torture.
 Persons convicted of civil crimes are sent to provincial civil
 prisons, while those found guilty of more serious crimes
 against the State, such as treason or terrorism, or who have
 committed crimes which carry the death penalty, such as
 murder, kidnapping, or rape, are sent to one of three
 penitentiaries. Conditions in both types of institutions
 range from primitive to modern; conditions in penitentiaries
 are reportedly worse than those found in the more numerous
 civil prisons. In the primary civil prison in Algiers,
 prisoners are often crowded together and sanitary arrangements
 are poor. Better conditions are found in some outlying
 prisons. Although all prisons have medical facilities, and
 each prison has a contract with a local doctor who visits the
 prison regularly to treat ill prisoners, medical care is
 generally rudimentary. Seriously ill prisoners may be sent to
 local hospitals. Prisoners in both civil prisons and
 penitentiaries are fed a bland, starchy diet, and long-term
 prisoners rely on family support to augment this diet.
 Families are allowed to visit civil prisons once a week; it is
 considerably more difficult to visit prisoners held in
 penitentiaries. At the discretion of local prison
 authorities, conjugal visits are sometimes permitted in civil
 prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted,
 arrested, or held except as provided by law. It also provides
 that detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 charged or released. The penal code provides for informing
 detainees immediately of charges against them. Algerian law
 does not include a bail system. Lawyers are allowed 24-hour
 access to their clients. Meetings take place under visual
 supervision of a guard.
 Despite these constitutional safeguards, military security has
 held suspects up to a month before releasing or charging
 them. In 1985, several members of an illegal group, the Sons
 of Martyrs of the Revolution, were arrested during the July 5
 National Day celebrations. Many of them were detained for
 several days, in one case several weeks, before being charged.
 In addition to military offenses, military security is
 authorized to investigate cases involving internal security
 and espionage. In cases that involve subversion, military
 security may also investigate civil crimes.
 Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive
 detention while his case is investigated. This detention can
 last years: 139 Islamic fundamentalists arrested in late 1982
 and early 1983 were not brought to trial until April 1985.
 
 
 1176
 ALGERIA
 Individuals arrested for the expression of views, critical of
 or different from those of the Government, are generally
 charged with disturbing the public order, associating with
 illegal organizations, or, in extreme cases, threatening state
 security. Recent sentences of persons convicted of these
 crimes range from 1 year to life imprisonment. Amnesty
 International has noted its concern about cases of prolonged
 incommunicado detention. There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel.  As far as is known, defendants
 are made fully aware of the charges against them at the time
 they are bound over for trial. Trials are public, although
 not generally publicized, and defendants have the right to
 appeal. The judicial system is divided into three parts:
 civil courts, military courts, and the State Security Court.
 There are no Islamic courts in Algeria.
 The civil courts are generally independent of executive or
 military coptrol. Military courts deal directly with
 espionage and with offenses committed by military personnel.
 The State Security Court at Medea is not in permanent session
 but has jurisdiction over cases that are deemed "to endanger
 the national security." At least a ministerial-level decision
 is required to refer a case to the State Security Court which
 generally provides procedural protection similar to that of
 civilfan courts. Interested observers are allowed to attend
 trials held in this court.
 All political prisoners arrested prior to February 1979,
 including former President Ben Bella, have been released since
 President Bendjedid took office. Three exiled advisors of
 former President Ben Bella returned to Algeria in February
 1985 under a general amnesty granted on November 1, 1984.
 While the Government has encouraged additional supporters of
 Ben Bella to return, Ben Bella himself prefers to remain
 abroad and involve himself in opposition activity. Fourteen
 prisoners held for their connections with the illegal Sons of
 Martyrs of :he Revolution organization claim that they are
 political prisoners and have demanded to be treated as such.
 Algerian law does not recognize political prisoners.
 The State Security Court trial of the aforementioned 139
 Islamic fundamentalists lasted 22 days, after which the court
 acquitted 46. Fifty-six were sentenced to prison terms
 ranging from I to 3 1/2 years and 32 received 4 to 12 years.
 Five people were tried in absentia, with 2 receiving 20 years
 and 3 condemned to life imprisonment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except
 for senior government and military officials who must be
 members of the party. Occasionally, foreign publications are
 seized, but otherwise the Government does not interfere with
 the private lives of Algerians.
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution
 and generally is honored in practice except in rare cases
 involving military security. Police may not enter a house
 without a warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating
 magistrate, nor may they enter a residence during night hours.

 ALGERIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights. Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it
 also states that such freedom may not be used to "undermine
 the foundations of the Socialist revolution." All print media
 are published either by the Government or the party and all
 journalists are government employees. The distribution of
 foreign newspapers and magazines is controlled, but such
 publications are available in small quantities. The
 French-language weekly Jeune Afrique is proscribed, and the
 French daily Le Monde is occasionally seized. Radio and
 television stations are also government controlled. The
 Government does not permit criticism of its authority, of
 socialism, or of the one-party system. However, criticism of
 specific domestic programs and policies as well as the
 performance of government utilities and state enterprises is
 allowed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All nongovernment associations must be approved by state
 authorities who have traditionally refused to recognize groups
 with political, economic, or social views that differ from
 those of the FLN. There is only one legal political party and
 one labor union, the General Union of Algeria Workers (UGTA).
 These and other mass organizations for youth, women, farmers,
 veterans, and professional groups are all tightly controlled
 by the party and constitute the primary government-recognized
 associations. They play key political roles in mobilizing
 popular support for various government programs and elections
 and maintain relations with recognized international bodies in
 their fields, such as the International Labor Organization.
 Workers and employers do not have the right to organize
 independent unions. Strikes are illegal in the public sector,
 but workers have successfully used strikes and work stoppages,
 without sanction of the national union, to win more pay and
 protect benefits. Most labor-management disputes, however,
 are solved by union representatives and Labor Ministry
 inspectors meeting with managers. While collective bargaining
 in the strict Western sense is not practiced, the UGTA does
 engage in industry-wide negotiations on behalf of workers
 under its umbrella.
 Individuals are free to assemble, although security personnel
 watch public gatherings closely, and all nonparty associations
 must receive government recognition to exist legally. In
 1985, members of the Sons of Martyrs of the Revolution, a
 mostly Berber illegal organization founded in 1984, were
 arrested for laying wreaths at the tombs of revolutionary
 heroes without authorization during July 5 National Day
 celebrations. On June 30, 1985, another predominantly Berber
 organization, the Algerian Human Rights League, was created to
 monitor human rights practices in Algeria. It applied for,
 but has not received, official recognition. Many members of
 the Sons of Martyrs movement arrested in July were also
 founding members of the Human Rights League.
 In December, the State Security Court in Medea handed down
 prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 3 years for 23
 Algerians accused of belonging to illegal organizations. The
 
 
 1178
 ALGERIA
 defendants were members of the Human Rights League and Sons of
 Martyrs organization and were accused, among other charges, of
 "an attack on state authority by inciting a change in
 regime." The court later began a second trial of some 40
 persons accused of planning an armed insurrection.
 However, limited political opposition, such as student
 demonstrations, is tolerated. Opposition political tracts are
 sometimes circulated, almost certainly with official
 knowledge, but persons caught with them may be subject to
 arrest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state, Algeria protects the rights of the
 very small Christian and Jewish minorities to worship in their
 churches and synagogues. There is little evidence of
 individual prejudice. Proselytizing is not permitted. The
 Christian clergy directs its activities to the non-Muslim
 expatriate community.
 The Islamic "clergy" is government-trained. Friday sermons
 are not formally censored, but government monitoring
 constrains the clergy's freedom of expression. Religious
 travel such as the pilgrimage to Mecca is
 government-organized. Fundamentalists were implicated in an
 August attack on a police academy outside Algiers during which
 one policeman was killed and some small arms were stolen. The
 fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood is banned and its members
 are reportedly subject to police harassment. This group is
 rooted in a centuries-old tradition of North African mysticism
 and has been used as a vehicle for propagating fundamentalist
 ideas such as the creation of an Islamic state in Algeria that
 would subordinate secular authority to that of religious
 leaders.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One
 of the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to remove
 the exit visa requirement. Government permission is
 necessary, however, to travel to Morocco. Men who are 19
 years or older must have proof of completion of mandatory 2-
 year military service and employees of state organizations who
 are paying back educational scholarships through work must
 have valid leave papers to leave the country. Passports may
 sometimes take months-to acquire, although this situation is
 improving. The amount of hard currency which Algerians may
 carry abroad (the equivalent of $200) remains the primary
 limitation on foreign travel.
 Except for foreign diplomats, who must apply for permission to
 travel farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted. Visitors must register
 with the police if they are staying overnight in a locality.
 Gendarmerie checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect
 vehicle registrations and, occasionally, search vehicles.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 Perhaps 165,000 refugees from the Western Sahara conflict live
 in camps in southwestern Algeria. There also are about 45,000
 Sahelian drought victims from Mali and Niger located in four
 
 
 1179
 ALGERIA
 border camps. The Government contributes to the support of
 all the Saharan refugees and Sahelian drought victims as does
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of
 the party, Government, and military, all three headed by
 President Bendjedid. The political process is confined to the
 single party, which significantly limits deviation from the
 path prescribed by ruling authorities. Basic policy decisions
 are not strictly questioned, although there is considerable
 airing of popular aspirations and grievances within the party
 organization. Some diversity of views is also evident in the
 National Popular Assembly, the provincial and local councils,
 and the government-controlled press.
 There is universal adult suffrage. All candidates for public
 office are nominated by the party, but voters usually have a
 choice among two or more candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Algerian Government does not readily discuss its human
 rights problems with outside governmental or nongovernmental
 organizations. For the first time since independence, a
 nongovernmental organization calling itself a human rights
 league was established, but as yet has not gained government
 approval. It applied for official recognition on June 30,
 1985. Its reported purpose is to monitor and investigate,
 independently, human rights practices in Algeria. Several of
 its members, including its president and vice president, were
 arrested in early July in connection with their support of, or
 membership in, the illegal Sons of Martyrs organization. A
 representative of the French chapter of the International
 League of Human Rights visited Algeria in August 1985 to
 investigate charges that these prisoners and detainees were
 being ill-treated and tortured. He determined that the
 charges were unfounded.
 Algeria supports human rights initiatives in the U.N. and
 regional forums but usually does not take the lead.  Freedom
 House rates Algeria "not free." In its 1985 report, Amnesty
 International expressed its concern about long-term detentions
 without trial, prolong, incommunicado detention, and reports
 of ill-treatment of detainees.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Algeria's population of 22,100,00 is growing at the rate of
 3.2 percent a year. Per capita gross national product (GNP)
 in 1984 was $2,075.
 The Algerian economy is largely Socialist, with the main
 sectors run by increasingly decentralized state enterprises.
 The 1981 party Congress officially endorsed a larger role for
 the private sector and, in 1985, a law was passed easing
 private sector access to imported goods. At present, about
 half of the arable land remains with independent herders and
 farmers, most retail businesses and service firms are
 privately owned, and there are several thousand small private
 
 
 1180
 ALGERIA
 industrial firms in operation. About 16 percent of the active
 working population was unemployed as of 1983. A 1977 estimate
 put the urban population living below the absolute poverty
 level at 20 percent. The rate of investment of GNP is high,
 reflecting a conscious government policy, and the rate of real
 growth was estimated at 5.7 percent in 1984.
 The Government controls most food supplies, although the
 private sector is increasingly important. One-third of the
 nation's food must be imported because of inefficient
 agriculture, but the 1985-1989 5-year plan recognizes this
 deficiency and emphasizes increased agricultural production to
 reduce the need for food imports. While food supplies are
 adequate, the cost is high and supply is irregular.
 The fertility rate of 7.2 (1982), leading to rapid population
 growth, makes it difficult to meet all nutritional and social
 needs and to provide full employment, but minimum vital needs
 are being met. Housing is in extremely short supply. Most
 health care is rudimentary but free and widely available.
 Life expectancy was 57.9 years in 1985, compared with 47 in
 1960. Infant mortality is 101 per 1,000 live births.
 Although most of the population has access to safe water,
 waterborne diseases remain a serious problem, especially for
 young children and inhabitants of rural areas.
 Education is free through the university level and is
 compulsory between the ages of 6 and 16. Educational
 facilities have been vastly expanded since independence but
 are still insufficient in both rural and urban areas. The
 literacy level in Arabic or French (or both) is approximately
 52 percent of the population over 9 years of age (40 percent
 for women, 65 percent for men). It is steadily increasingly
 as the large majority of children, 81.7 percent in 1984-85,
 now attend school.
 Algeria's 1978 general workers' statute provides for a normal
 work week not to exceed 44 hours, a full 24-hour rest period,
 and a minimum wage. It prohibits employment of persons under
 16 years of age. The statute also sets out minimum worker
 safety standards and standardizes pay according to the work
 performed. Although the law has not yet been fully
 implemented in all economic sectors, most of its provisions
 are respected.
 Women enjoy equality under the law and their status is
 improving, but tradition and culture make it difficult for
 women to follow an independent path. The great majority
 remain in traditional roles, although their participation in
 public life is growing. Ten women are delegates in the
 National Popular Assembly, two are members of the party's
 central committee, one is a state minister, and women serve in
 the armed forces. During municipal elections in December
 1984, however, less than one percent of the candidates were
 women, and few of them were elected to office.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women from
 men in education. According to government statistics, 72
 percent of all school-age girls were enrolled in 1985.
 Algeria also has launched a nationwide program encouraging
 "birth spacing" as a means of safeguarding a mother's health,
 improving infant care, and reducing the high population growth
 rate. The program provides free access to contraceptives and
 counseling on a voluntary basis. Abortion is illegal.
 
 
 1181
 ALGERIA
 In the last few years, there have been demonstrations by the
 large Berber population, sometimes leading to violent
 clashes. The Government has shown more concern in recent
 years about reconciling its policy of developing Algeria's
 Arab identity with Berber desires to preserve their own
 culture and language, while retaining French as a language of
 work and education. The Government has given extra attention
 to building houses, schools, and municipal infrastructure in
 Berber regions. Berber particularism, however, remains an
 area of concern, as evidenced by continuing government
 confrontations with largely Berber organizations.
