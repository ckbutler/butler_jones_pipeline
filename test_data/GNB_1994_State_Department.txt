 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau held its first multiparty elections in July and Au-
 gust, electing Joao Bernardo Vieira President. Vieira has ruled the country since
 taking power in a 1980 coup. He is also the president of the African Party for the
 Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC) which was the only legal
 political party from independence in 1974 until the 1991 adoption of a multiparty
 Constitution. Despite a few minor iregularities in the first round, international ob-
 servers judged the elections free and fair. The PAIGC won 62 of the 100 seats in
 the new National Assembly where 4 other parties are represented. The Constitution
 provides for an independent judiciary.
 The police, under the direction of the Ministry of Internal Administration, called
 the Ministry of Interior until November, have primary responsibility for the nation's
 internal security; they committed human rights abuses in 1994. The armed forces
 are responsible for external security, and can assist the police in internal emer-
 gencies.
 The population of 1 million relies largely on subsistence agriculture. Guinea-
 Bissau has an annual per capita gross domestic product estimated at $200. The
 economy grew in 1994, with an emerging private sector leading the way. However,
 the economy remains precarious because of the heavy external debt burden and in-
 adequate tax revenues.
 The human rights situation continued to improve, with multiparty elections and
 the November installation of a pluralistic government. Nevertheless, the police en-
 gaged in intimidation, arbitrary detention, physical mistreatment of detainees, and
 occasional harassment of opposition parties. No members of the security forces were
 tried or punished for abuses. Societl discrimination against women continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 The 1992 death of Ussumane Quade, an army officer beaten to death while in po-
 lice custody, remains unresolved. Human rights monitors continue to press for a
 thorough and impartial investigation of his death, ostensibly a suicide, but the po-
 lice re use to cooperate.
 The March 17, 1993 assassination of the commander of an elite army unit re-
 sulted in conviction and a 15-year prison term for the confessed killer, Amadou
 Mane (see also Section 1.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or other coercion is invalid. However, the Government often ignores
 these provisions. Security and police authorities have historically employed torture
 and abusive interrogation methods, usually in the form of severe beatings or depri-
 vation. The Government rarely enforces legal provisions prescribing punishment for
 these abuses.
 Prison conditions are poor, but generally not life-threatening.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal system provides for procedural
 rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to release if no timely indictment is
 
 
 112
 brought, and the right to a speedy public trial. In practice, the judicial system gen-
 erally fails to provid these rights.
 Police detain suspects without judicial authority or warrants, occasionally through
 the device of house arrest. The Government holds detainees without charge or trial
 for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado. In February police de-
 tained the president of the National Teachers Union, Luis Nancassa for 3 days with-
 out charges; the police released him without charge after appeals from a variety of
 leaders and the threat of a prolonged teachers' strike.
 Human rights monitors estimate that pretrial detainees arrested without war-
 rants and imprisoned without charges make up 90 percent of the prison population.
 The authorities do not routinely observe bail procedures.
 There were no known cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas
 and urban dwellers often bring *udicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid
 the costs and bureaucratic impediments of the official legal system. Police often re-
 solve disputes.
 Because of low salaries and poor training, judges are sometimes subject to politi-
 cal pressures and corruption. In May, however, the Supreme Court resisted pressure
 from a number of parties and ruled that all eight presidential candidates were eligi-
 ble to run. The system is sometimes capable of providing fair trial, even in very con-
 troversial cases. For example, after the police arrested 49 persons, including two
 prominent members of opposition political parties for the 1993 assassination of an
 army officer, an investigation by a joint military/police commission of inquiry re-
 suited in the police charging 17 persons with a variety of offenses. The trials, in
 a military court, received wide media attention and were considered fair. The court
 exonerated the two politicians, sentenced most of the other detainees to terms of 2
 to 8 years, and sentenced the killer, Amadou Mane, to 15 years in prison. Mane tes-
 tified that senior security officials compelled him to accuse the politicians falsely of
 attempting a coup.
 Citizens who cannot afford an attorney have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.
 Under the new constitutional provisions which took effect in November, military
 tribunals will only try cases of a strictly military nature. Civilian courts will now
 try state security cases. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both ci-
 y-an and military cases. The President has constitutional authority to grant par-
 dons and reduce sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence,
 but the Government does not always respect these rights. The authorities examine
 international and domestic mail, the security forces seldom use judicial warrants,
 and the police sometimes force entry into private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. The Government owns and controls the only television station and
 the major radio station. In mid-1994 a station affiliated with Radio France Inter-
 national began broadcasting under a bilateral agreement. At least one opposition po-
 litical party has been seeking a radio license since 1993.
 There are two regularly published independent newspapers, which are often criti-
 cal of the Government, and several opposition parties and the Human Rights
 League produce monthly publications. However, journalists continued to practice
 self-censorship.
 Television, radio, and newspapers provided a relatively balanced selection of pub-
 lic opinion during the July and August electoral campaign. All opposition political
 parties took advantage of access to television and radio air time.
 Academic freedom is observed in schools and research institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The Government requires prior approval for
 all assemblies and demonstrations but permitted all opposition political rallies
 which were requested. In late July the Ministry of Interior attempted to constrain
 opposition efforts to support a single candidate in the second round of voting by pro-
 hibiting campaign assistance to third parties. The National Election Commission
 overruled the Ministry, and all opposition parties united behind the presidential
 candidacy of Dr. Koumba Yala. On February 8 police halted and dispersed a protest
 march organized by the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions (see Sec-
 tion 6.a.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right. While religious groups must be licensed by the Gov-
 
 
 113
 ernment, none were refused licenses. Jehovah's Witnesses began missionary activi-
 ties in 1994.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement within the country and
 generally does not restrict foreign travel and emigration. However, the Ministry of
 Interior used its authority to issue passports to deny temporarily freedom of move-
 ment to one opposition politician. Citizens have the right to return and are not sub-
 ject to political revocation of their citizenship. There are no provisions for asylum.
 The number of refugees decreased to an estimated 13,600 as peace in Senegal's
 Casamance region encouraged some Senegalese refugees to return. The Government
 continued its policy of placing no pressure on refugees to return to Senegal.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 For the first time in the country's history, voters were able to choose their govern-
 ment in multiparty elections judged by international observers to be free and fair
 although they acknowledged irregularities. The PAIGC the former ruling and only
 legal political arty, retained power by winning 62 of the 100 seats in the new Na-
 tional Assembly. There are 2 opposition blocs in the legislature, each with 19 seats.
 The Guinea-Bissau Resistance/Bafata Movement elected 19 deputies; 3 other parties
 joined together to form a second group of 19 deputies.
 Women are underrepresented in the political process. One of the eight candidates
 for President in the recent national elections was a woman. In the National Assem-
 bly 10 of the 100 deputies are women, and they have formed a caucus across party
 lines. Only 2 of the new Cabinet's 25 members are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally did not interfere with the Guinea-Bissau Human
 Rights League and international human rights groups, which continued to inves-
 tigate human rights abuses. However, the police did occasionally harass members
 the League. In addition, the League's conference on police and  risoner reform,
 which was to have featured Adama Dieng, secretary general of the International
 Commission of Jurists, was canceled when the Government prohibited security staff
 from attending.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Discrimination against women persists although officially prohibited by
 law. Women are responsible for most work on subsistence farms and have limited
 access to education, especially in rural areas. Women do not have equal access to
 employment. Among certain ethnic groups, women cannot own or manage land or
 inherit property.
 Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of settling domes-
 tic disputes. While police will intervene in domestic disputes if requested, the Gov-
 ernment has not taen any measures to counter socialpressure against reporting
 domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment of women.
 Children.-Although there is no pattern of societal abuse against children, within
 certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and Mandinkas, female genital mutila-
 tion (FGM) is widespread. Despite official prohibition of this practice which inter-
 national health experts have condemned as dangerous to both physical and psycho-
 logical health, the Government has not taken effective action to-halt FGM. The Min-
 istry of Public Health initiated a poster campaign against FGM in 1994. The Gov-
 ernment allocates only limited resources for children's welfare and education.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation mandating accessibility to build-
 ins or government services for people with disabilities.
 The law does not specifically prohibit discrimination against people with disabil-
 ities, and the Government does not ensure equal access to employment and edu-
 cation. The State has made some effort to assist disabled veterans through pension
 programs, but these programs do not adequately address veterans' health, housing,
 and food needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides to all civilian workers the
 freedom to form and join independent trade unions. However, the vast majority of
 the population works in subsistence agriculture; only a small percentage of workers
 are in the wage sector and are organized.
 The Government registers all [abor unions. There are 11 labor unions registered
 and operating. All unions are officially independent of the Government, but seven
 
 
 114
 unions are affiliated with the National Trade Union Confederation (UNTG) which
 retains informal ties with the PAIGC. The law does not favor UNTG.ahlliated
 unions over others. The Constitution provides for the right to strike and protection
 from retribution against strike activities.
 The only legal restriction on strikes is the requirement for prior notice, including
 the reasons for the strike and its expected duration. The National Teachers Union
 conducted the only legal strike; its grievances were never fully resolved, and despite
 laws prohibiting such practices, employers retaliated against the strikers. According
 to union and human rights monitors, several teachers supporting the strike lost
 their jobs or were transferred to positions of lesser responsibility. Several other
 labor disputes were resolved by nonbinding arbitration conducted by unions or the
 Ministry of Public Works, Civil Service and Administrative Reform.
 All unions are free to affiliate with national confederations and international
 labor organizations of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The Constitution does not
 provide for or protect the right to bargain collectively, and there were no instances
 of genuine collective bargaining. Most wages are established in bilateral negotia-
 tions between workers and employers, taking into consideration the minimum sala-
 ries set annually by the Government's Council of Ministers.
 The Government's provision for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination has little effect where union membership is low. The Government did
 not adopt any laws to establish penal sanctions against employers practicing such
 discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal, and it is not known to exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The General Labor Act of 1986 es-
 tablished a minimum age of 14 years for general factory labor and 18 years for
 heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age require-
 ments are generally followed in the small wage sector, but the Ministry of Civil
 Service and Labor does not enforce these requirements in other sectors. Children
 in cities often work in street trading, and those in rural communities do domestic
 and field work without pay. The Government does not attempt to discourage these
 traditional practices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government's Council of Ministers annu-
 ally establishes minimum wages for all categories of work but does not enforce
 them. The lowest monthly wage is less than $10 (140,555 pesos). This wage is inad-
 equate to maintain even a minimum standard of living, and workers must supple-
 ment their income through other work, reliance on the extended family, and subsist-
 ence agriculture. The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek
 without further compensation is 45, but the Government does not enforce this provi-
 sion.
 The Ministry of Civil Service and Labor establishes legal health and safety stand-
 ards for workers, with the cooperation of the unions, which are then adopted into
 law by the National Assembly. However, the Government does not enforce these
 stindards, and many persons work in conditions which endanger their health and
 safety.
