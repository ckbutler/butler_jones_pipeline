 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a multi-party democracy. Respect for human
 rights is guaranteed in the Constitution and observed in
 practice. In Africa, in regional organizations such as the
 Organization for African Unity (OAU) and the Commonwealth
 Summits, and in the United Nations, The Gambia has been in
 the forefront of those nations which seek to promote human
 rights. The Gambia sponsored proposals at the 1979 OAU and
 Commonwealth Summits to create commissions on human rights
 for each of the international organizations.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Statutory prohibitions against the use of torture are
 respected and enforced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman- or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are
 prohibited by law in The Gambia. There are no reports
 of arbitrary deprivation of life.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The right to freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are guaranteed by law and provided
 in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The home is not subject to arbitrary intrusion, either
 in law or in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 In this rural, agricultural nation with a small popula-
 tion and limited resources, the needs of the poor are
 the major focus of government activity. Some progress
 has been realized in improving the rural standard of
 living. The Gambian Government is concentrating on
 increased agricultural production and seeking eventual
 self-sufficiency through emphasis on food crops,
 better cultivation techniques, improved rural infra-
 structure and training. The Government also seeks to
 improve health services for the rural poor.
 Low income persons pay minimal or no tax while those with
 larger incomes carry the greater burden.
 There is some smuggling across the border from Senegal,
 which probably benefits the poor more than any other

 group. During the past year there were also allegations
 of corruption among some government officials. The President
 and the government moved swiftly to investigate these allega-
 tions and to take appropriate corrective measures. There is
 little difference in standard of living between Gambians of
 moderate wealth and the average Gambian citizen.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Gambia's record and practice reflecting these rights are
 excellent. These freedoms are protected under law. There is
 no discrimination based upon race, ethnic origin or religion,
 and there are no legal restrictions on press freedom.
 The status of women in The Gambia is improving. Women
 hold influential positions within the Government. A woman
 now holds the important position of Parliamentary Secretary,
 Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Welfare. An Assistant
 Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs is also a
 woman.
 Although labor unions are legal in The Gambia, there are
 presently none operating on any significant scale. The
 Gambia Workers Union, the largest and most influential, has
 been deregistered and has no legal status. The Gambian
 Workers Union was deregistered following an illegal strike in
 1977 or 1978. Its leader, Mr. Jallow, has not to date
 initiated the necessary legal and administrative steps for
 re-registration. The non-action in this respect may be due
 to a power struggle within the union as several challengers
 are trying to oust Mr. Jallow. Several smaller unions
 including the Dock Workers Committee, the Motor Drivers,
 Mechanics and Allied Workers, and The Gambian Teacher Union,
 are functioning normally.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on these freedoms.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy that is centered
 around a genuine multi-party system. There are four parties:
 the governing Progressive People's Party (PPP); the United
 Party (UP); the National Convention Party (NCP) and the
 National Liberation Party (NLP). The Gambia has no army and
 depends on a 775-member police force for law enforcement and
 internal security.
 There is full freedom, under the law and in practice,
 to participate in the political process. The Gambia has open
 and free elections in which the four political parties
 participate. Opposing political views are broadcast and
 published freely. There is universal adult suffrage.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, there has never
 been an allegation of human rights violations in The Gambia
 or a request by any international body to inspect or investi-
 gate human rights conditions in The Gambia.
 During the 1979 OAU and Commonwealth Summits, President
 Jawara was noteworthy in his call for strict adherence to
 human rights principles by black African leaders.
