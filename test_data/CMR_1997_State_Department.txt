 CAMEROON
 Cameroon is a multiparty republic that continues to be dominated by President
 -Paul Biya and a circle of advisers drawn largely from his own and related ethnic
 groups and from his party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).
 Since Biya won the highly flawed 1992 presidential election, elections have been
 tainted by an electoral process that is controlled by the Government's Ministry of
 Territorial Administration. International and local observers generally view the
 process as not free and fair. The CPDM continued to dominate the National Assem-
 bly after elections in May that were characterized by numerous irregularities. In Oc-
 tober Biya won reelection as the President in an election boycotted by the three
 main opposition parties, and generally considered by observers to be marred by a
 wide range of procedural flaws and not. free and fair. The President retains the
 power to control legislation or to rule by decree. According to the ratified amend-
 ments to the 1996 Constitution, the presidential term is 7 years, renewable once.
 Biya began his'first 7-year term on November 3. The amendments also provide for
 new legislative institutions, including a partially elected senate, elected regional
 councils, and an independent judiciary. The.Government took no action to establish
 these new institutions, although the President announced that most of these would
 be acted upon in the course of 1998. The judiciary is subject to political influence
 and, suffers from corruption and inefficiency.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national police, the National
 Intelligence Service (DGRE), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration, military intelligence, the army, and to a lesser extent, the Presidential Se-
 curity Service. The police and the gendarmerie have dominant roles in enforcing in-
 ternal security laws. The security forces, including the military forces, remain under
 the effective control of the President, the civilian Minister ofDefense, and the civil-
 ian head of police. The police and gendarmes continued to commit numerous serious
 human rights abuses.
 Following nearly a decade of economic decline and widening financial imbalance,
 economic performance has improved, with annual gross domestic product (GDP)
 growth averaging more than 5 percent over the last 2 years. The Government began
 in 1996 to implement a program of structural reforms. The majority of the popu-
 lation is rural. Agriculture accounts for 25 percent of GDP, -while industry and the
 services sectors account for 22 and 35 percent, respectively. The petroleum sector
 accounts for less than 10 percent of public revenues. Principal exports include tim-
 ber, coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, and rubber.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be generally poor, and gov-
 ernment officials continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens' ability to
 change their government remained limited. International observers deemed the May
 national legislative elections to be flawed. Legislative by-elections held after some
 150 legal challenges were submitted to the Supreme Court were also marred by
 charges of irregularities by opposition parties. Security forces committed several
 extrajudicial killings and often beat and otherwise abused detainees and prisoners,
 generally with impunity. Conditions remained life threatening in almost all prisons.
 Security forces continued to arrest and detain arbitrarily various opposition politi-
 cians, local human rights activists and other citizens, often holding them for pro-
 longed periods and, at times, incommunicado. Security forces conducted illegal
 searches, harassed citizens, infringed on their privacy, and monitored some opposi-
 tion activists. The judiciary is corrupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence.
 A 1996 law revoked formal press censorship and moved supervision of the press
 from the administrative authorities to the courts. However, the Government contin-
 ued to impose some limits on press freedoms. Although independent newspapers en-
 
 
 joyed considerable latitude to publish their views, journalists continued to be subject
 to official harassment, trial, and conviction under criminal libel laws. The authori-
 ties obtained convictions against several journalists under these laws; some received
 stiff fines and suspended prison sentences. The Government continued to seize pub-
 lications deemed threatening to the public order. On several occasions, the Govern-
 ment restricted freedom of assembly and association. At times, the Government
 used its security forces to inhibit political parties from holding public meetings. Gov-
 ernment security forces impede domestic travel. Discrimination and violence against
 women remain serious problems. Discrimination against ethnic minorities and Iyg-
 mies continues. The Government infringes on workers' rights, and slavery persists
 in isolated areas. Mob violence resulted in some deaths.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political killings. However, the security forces continued to use excessive, lethal
 force and committed several extrajudicial killings.
 On January 8, gendarmes used excessive force in arresting a tribal leader in
 Northwest province. Five women were hospitalized as a result of shotgun wounds
 or beatings. On January 31, security forces again used excessive force to disperse
 a group of 36 women who had gathered outside a gendarmerie facility in the North-
 west province town of Wum to await the tribal leader's release. All the women suf-
 fered injuries; one later died of her wounds. The Government took no action against
 security force members following the incidents.
 On February 9, a driver for the diocese of Yaounde, Faustin Betsogo, was arrested
 by plainclothes DGRE officers following a traffic altercation with them. He was
 taken to headquarters, beaten, and released, but he died shortly thereafter.
 On May 12, during the legislative electoral campaign, opposition candidate
 Koulagna Nana's campaign entourage had a violent encounter with the forces of a
 traditional ruler. A total of five persons died in the fighting, including two opposi-
 tion militants. After reporting the incident to the gendarmerie in Touboro, Koulagna
 Nana and 15 associates were arrested. Two were later released. No members of the
 traditional rulers militia were arrested. The gendarmerie is still investigating the
 incident.
 From March 27 to 31 in Northwest province, armed attackers launched raids
 against six government sites, including several gendarmerie stations. Security forces
 killed at least seven people in the raids; three gendarmes died. Security sweeps
 after these raids reportedly rounded up over 300 persons. The Government opened
 an inquiry but made neither a public report nor brought charges against the esti-
 mated 59 persons remaining in detention at year's end. Some critics believe that
 these incidents were instigated with government connivance to discredit the opposi-
 tion. In the wake of the attacks, three detainees (Mathias Gwei, Samuel Tita, and
 Richard Ngwa Formasoh) were reliably reported to have died from abuse inflicted
 by the authorities (see Section 1.c.). Other estimates indicated that there were from
 one to eight deaths from abuse or illness. The Government did not respond to these
 reports.
 Several prisoners died in custody due to abuse inflicted by members of the secu-
 rity forces or harsh prison conditions and inadequate medical treatment (see Section
 1.c.).
 The February 1996 incident in which an unarmed, unresisting taxi driver was
 shot and killed by a policeman near Bafut, Northwest province, in front of wit-
 nesses, was still pending in court.
 There were no developments in the 1996 killings of. Andre Tchieutcho, a sus-
 pected thief who was shot and killed inside the Mboppi gendarme headquarters; Jo-
 seph Desire Tuete Kuipo, a Douala taxi driver; or Haman Daouda, a member of the
 National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) party and a member of the Na-
 tional Assembly.
 Mob violence directed at persons suspected of criminal activity or witchcraft re-
 sulted in a number of deaths and injuries.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no credible reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence obtained
 thereby, and prohibits public servants from using undue force against any person.
 Although President Biya also romulgated a new law on January 10 that bans tor-
 ture by government officials, there were at least two reported cases of torture, and
 there were credible reports that security forces continued to inflict beatings and
 
 
 other cruel and degrading treatment on prisoners and detainees. The authorities
 often administer beatings not in prison facilities but in temporary detention areas
 in a police or gendarme facility.
 There are reliable reports that the "balancoire" torture technique is still in use
 in the interrogation of certain prisoners. In this technique, the prisoner, with his
 hands tied behind his back, is suspended from a rod and beaten.
 Security forces subject prisoner and detainees to degrading mistreatment, includ-
 ing stripp~ing, confinement in severely overcrowded celis, and denial of access to toi-
 lets or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes often beat detainees to ex-
 tract confessions and the names and whereabouts of alleged criminals. Reported
 sanctions against those responsible are rare. Such abuse was reportedly inflicted on
 those persons arrested in a security force dragnet following the March attacks in
 the Northwest province. At least three detainees are believed to have died from this
 abuse: Mathias Gwei and Samuel Tita died in May, and Richard Ngwa Formasoh
 died at Nkondengui Prison in the capital in early July (see Section L.a.).
 Ndifet Zacharia Khan, one of those detained at the gendarmerie legion in
 Bamenda was badly beaten, developed gangrene, and later had all his toes ampu-
 tated.
 Security forces arrested a local journalist, Christian Ngah Mbipgo, on February
 26 and severely beat him for writing articles critical of local authorities. Following
 his release he described how security forces beat the soles of his feet with "iron
 studded rubber truncheons." On July 31, Maroua prison authorities recaptured an
 escaped convict and severely tortured him. A local human rights official,
 Mohamadou Moustapha, who attempted to intercede was also badly beaten. There
 were no developments in this case.
 Prison conditions are generally life threatening, especially outside major urban
 areas. Serious deficiencies in food health care, and sanitation due to a lack of funds
 occur in almost all prisons, including those in the north operated by traditional rul-
 ers. In March six inmates died of tuberculosis in such facilities.
 In the Douala central prison of New Bell, families are permitted to provide food
 and medicine to inmates. Beatings are common.. Prisoners are reported to be
 chained or flogged at times in their cells and often denied adequate medical care.
 Juveniles and nonviolent prisoners are often incarcerated with violent adults. There
 are credible reports of sexual abuse of juvenile prisoners by adult inmates. Babies
 and small children are sometimes held in prison if their mothers are incarcerated
 there. Corruption among prison personnel is widespread. Some high-profile pris-
 oners are able to avoid some of the abuse that security forces routinely inflict on
 many common criminals. Some are held in elite wings of certain prisons where they
 enjoy relatively lenient treatment. A 1997 report on prison conditions indicates that
 Bertoua Prison, which was built to hold 50 detainees, currently houses 700 persons.
 In the north, the Government permits traditional Lamibe (chiefs) to operate pri-
 vate prisons outside the government penitentiary system. Private prisons in the
 chiefdons of Rey Bouba, Bibemi, and Tcheboa have the worst reputations. Members
 of the UNDP party alleged that their members have been detained in them and that
 some have died from mistreatment.
 Because of the Government's refusal to ensure that the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) has access to all detention centers, official as well as unoffi-
 cial, the ICRC has declined to visit any prisons since 1992, although both the
 Cameroonian Red Cross and the National Human Rights Commission make fre-
 quent visits. The ICRC was permitted to visit Nigerian civilian internees and sol-
 diers captured in the territorial dispute with Nigeria.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 be brought promptly before a magistrate; however, security forces continued to arbi-
 trarily arrest and detain citizens, although less frequently than in the past. Arbi-
 trary, prolonged detention remained a serious problem as security forces often failed
 to bring detainees promptly before a magistrate and held them-incommunicado.
 Police may detain a person in custody in connection with a common crime for up
 to 24 hours, renewable three times, before bringing charges. However, the law only
 provides for the right to a judicial review of the legality of detention in the few ma-
 jority Anglophone areas of the  country. Elsewhere, the Francophone legal tradition
 applies, precluding judicial authorities from acting on a case until the administra-
 tive authority that ordered the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. After
 a magistrate has issued a warrant to bring the case to trial, he may hold the de-
 tainee in administrative or "pretrial detention" indefinitely, pending court action.
 Furthermore, a 1990 law permits detention without charge for renewable periods of
 15 days, ostensibly in order to combat banditry and maintain public order. Persons
 taken into detention are frequently denied access to beth legal counsel and family
 members. The law permits release on bail only in the Anglophone provinces, where
 
 
 the legal system includes features of British common law. Even there, bail is grant-
 ed infrequently.
 Michel Atangana, a former presidential aide was arrested without warrant on
 May 12 by a police special operations team. He was held at a police station and
 later under administrative detention for 53 days before being transferred to
 Nkondengui prison. On May 21, former Minister of Health and longtime presi-
 dential official Titus Edzoa, who had declared himself a candidate in the fall presi-
 dential elections 1 month earlier, was questioned by the judicial branch of the police
 force and placed under house arrest on June 5. He was initially charged with "ac-
 tivities and statements likely to disrupt the public order." Meia attention to the
 case resulted in better treatment for Edzoa and pressure on the authorities to bring
 charges. Subsequently, both he and Atangana, who had become Edzoa's campaign
 manager, were charged with influence peddling and embezzlement. They were tried
 together and convicted on criminal charges by the High Court and sentenced to 15
 year's imprisonment. While appealing their sentences both men were held in con-
 finement at the gendarmerie headquarters, reportedly in cramped quarters with
 very limited access to visitors.
 Another declared presidential candidate, Albert Dzongang, was held in Douala po-
 lice station on July 11 and 12 on obscure charges concerning allegedly subversive
 tracts. No official charges were filed.
 On April 14, Paulinus Jua, an opposition party contender for a seat in the May
 legislative elections was arrested in connection with the March raids, together with
 about 50 ersons (see Sections L.a. and 1.c.). He was released without charge sev-
 eral days later and later won a seat in the Assembly.
 Before the results of the legislative elections were officially rendered,. police car-
 ried out a series of mass arrests, lasting from May 30 until June 3, allegedly to pre-
 vent violent incidents. Among those arrested were well-known opposition activists
 Mboua Massock and Brice Nintcheu. Massock was held in New Bell prison for 15
 days before being released without charge.
 A reliable Pans-based press monitoring group indicated that a total of 13 journal-
 ists had been imprisoned at one time or another over the past 18 months. In late
 December, the authorities detained again Pius Njawe, the well-known journalist-
 publisher of the publication L Messager, reportedly for publishing an article alleg-
 ingthat President Biya may have had a heart attack (see Section 2.a.).
 The courts punished some instances of arbitrary detention in 1996. At year's end,
 there were two cases under investigation following the deaths of two detainees in
 Yaounde prison in October. In one, a police commissioner and three colleagues were
 arrested pending trial.
 The Government does not practice political exile. Some opposition members who
 considered themselves threatened by the Government have voluntarily left the coun-
 try and declared themselves to be in political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial .-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary remains subject to political influence, with few signs
 that it is becoming more independent.
 The court system remains technically part of the executive branch, subordinate
 to the Ministry of Justice. The legal system is strongly influenced by the French
 legal system, although in the Anglophone provinces certain aspects of the Anglo-
 Saxon tradition apply. The court system includes the Supreme Court, a court of ap-
 peals in each of the 10 provinces, and courts of first instance in each of the country's
 56 divisions. Some politically sensitive cases are never heard.
 Traditional courts are important in rural areas. Their authority varies by region
 and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters of property and domestic disputes
 and may serve a probate function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of
 their decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 Corruption and inefficiency in the courts remain serious problems. Justice is fre-
 quently denied or delayed. Powerful political or business interests appear to enjoy
 virtual immunity from prosecution, while critics of the Government are sometimes
 jailed under libel statutes considered by observers as unduly restrictive of press
 freedom. Prisoners may be detained indefinitely during pretrial proceedings.
 The Constitution provides for a fair public hearing in which the defendant is pre-
 sumed innocent. Because appointed attorneys receive little compensation, the qual-
 ity of legal representation for indigent persons is often poor. The bar association and
 some voluntary organizations, such as the Cameroonian Association of Female Ju-
 rists, offer free assistance in some cases. Trials are public.
 There were no reliable estimates of the number of political prisoners held at the
 end of the year. The eight UNDP militants, convicted in a highly charged case with
 political overtones of participation in and abetting a riot, were provisionally released
 by the court of Maroua on December 17, pending decisions on their appeals. Credi-
 
 
 ble observers disagree as to whether these convictions were based on political or
 criminal grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Priva, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-The
 preamble of the Constitution provides or the inviolability of the home, for the pro-
 tection against search except by virtue of law, and for the privacy of all correspond-
 ence. However, there were a number of credible reports that police and gendarmes
 harassed citizens, conducted searches without warrants, and seized mail. Security
 forces frequently used roadblocks to extract bribes. There were credible reports that
 the Government kept some opposition activists and dissidents under surveillance.
 The law permits a police officer to enter a private home during daylight hours
 without a warrant if he is pursuing an inquiry and has reason to suspect that a
 crime has been committed. The officer must have a warrant to make such a search
 after dark. However, a police officer may enter a private home at any time in pur-
 suit of a criminal observed committing a crime. An administrative authority may
 authorize police to conduct neighborhood. sweeps in search of suspected criminals or
 stolen or illegal goods without individual warrants. Such roundups are conducted
 frequently.
 Sweeps involving forced entry into homes occurred in Yaounde and Douala on sev-
 eral occasions during the year. Typically, security forces seal off a neighborhood,
 search homes one after another, arrest persons without identification, and seize sus-
 picious or illegal articles. In January they carried out such sweeps in Yaounde fol-
 lowing a series of crimes there. The purview of a March order issued by Northwest
 province Governor Francis Fal Yengo restricting movement also included searches
 of individual premises and residences and imposition of a curfew.
 In August the press published transcripts of telephone conversations between sen-
 ior officials. It was unclear whether the taping constituted illegal surveillance.
 There was no information as to who authorized the surveillance or the release of
 this information.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of thre  se             Government continued to impose some limits on
 these rights. The Penal Code's libel laws specify that defamation, abuse, contempt,
 and dissemination of false news are offenses punishable by prison terms and heavy
 fines.
 These various criminal libel statutes are sometimes invoked by the Government
 to silence criticism of the Government and government officials. There are also in-
 stances of legitimate libel cases resulting from reporting by untrained and inexperi-
 enced journalists.
 The press enjoyed increased liberty to publish due to the 1996 repeal of a law that
 had authorized press censorship by the Government. Nevertheless, the Government
 arrested at least five members of the press and prosecuted four on criminal libel
 charges. The courts imposed stiff fines and jail terms, and one journalist reported
 being tortured during detention (see Section 1.c.). Some of these prosecutions appear
 to have been politically motivated. In addition, there were at least 10 instances in
 which the Government demanded that newspapers be seized under court orders, cit-
 ing laws authorizing preservation of public order. In the case of one newspaper,
 Mutations, seizures ordered by the Minister of Territorial Administration continued
 in certain provinces following a July 4 court ruling that they cease. Other cases in-
 volved the suspension or reassignment of public media reporters who displayed
 independence from the Government.
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, the Cameroon Tribune, and op-
 erates all radio and television broadcasting. Since 1990 the law has provided for the
 licensing of private radio and television stations, but the Government has not ap-
 proved implementing regulations. Government reporters rarely criticize the ruling
 party or portray government programs in an unfavorable light, but sometimes do
 so implicitly. The government-controlled broadcast media provide broad reporting of
 CPDM functions, while giving relatively little attention to opposition events.
 While 40 to 50 private newspapers are published sporadically, only about 15 were
 published on a regular basis during the year. These newspapers are often outspoken
 in their criticism of the President, the Government, corruption, and economic poli-
 cies. Because of the high cost of a newspaper to an average citizen, as well as dis-
 tribution problems, newspapers are not read widely outside the major cities.
 Television and radio programming includes a weekly progra that provides an op-
 portunity for political parties represented in the National Assembly to present their
 views. The program faced no arbitrary suspensions during the year. Eight opposi-
 tion candidates from nonparliamentary parties received limited access to the elec-
 tronic media during the 2-week presidential campaign.
 
 
 Christian Eyoum Ngange of Le Messager, who had been arrested in 1996 for writ-
 ing a satirical piece on President Biya that referred to him by an insulting name;
 was sentenced to 1 year in prison and fired $600. The appeals court upheld the rul-
 ing, and he was sent to prison on January 24. The Supreme Court then received
 an appeal based on procedural grounds and overturned the appellate judgment. He
 was released on Mardh 27 but faces the possibility of a new tral.
 On April 30, Jean-Boso Tchoubet, publisher of La Revelation, was arrested on
 libel charges for published insinuations that the finance minister was corrupt. On
 June 1, he was transferred to prison pending trial; on July 15, he was convicted,
 given a 6-month suspended sentence, and ordered to pay a $100 fine.
 On March 20, the publisher of L'Independant Hebdo, Evariste Menouga, was ar-
 rested along with several colleagues and detained for I month before being convicted
 for libel. He received a 6-month suspended sentence. He had reported that the army
 was on the brink of rebellion.
 In the most publicized case during the year, on December 24 the authorities de-
 tained Pius Njawe, the well-known human rights activist and publisher of Le
 Messager, reportedly for publishing an article alleging that President Biya may
 have had a heart attack. Njawe remained in prisoni at the end of the year and was
 scheduled for trial in early 1998. He had already spent 17 days in jail in 1966 under
 similar circumstances and was also awaiting review of the appeals of his two 1966
 libel convictions. Many national and international media organs condemned his de-
 tention.
 There were no developments in several 1996 cases. Journalists Tietcheu Kameni
 and Paul Nyemb, who had been convicted with Njawe in 1966, and Eyoum Ngangue
 remained at liberty awaiting the outcome of their appeals of their libel convictions.
 The conviction of Vianney mbey Ndzana, involving a suspension and a 5-month
 prison term remained under appeal.
 Patrice Ndedi Penda, publisher of Galaxie, was sentenced in 1996 to 2 years in
 prison and a large fine for having libeled the Minister of State in charge of agri-
 culture; the case remained under appeal.
 In the case of Samuel Eleme, publisher of the newspaper La Detente, and journal-
 ist Gaston Ekwalla, the newspaper remained under suspension, but Eleme and
 Ekwalla were not jailed. Their case remained under appeal.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, state security in-
 formants operate on university campuses. Many professors believe that adherence
 to opposition political parties can have an adverse effect on their professional oppor-
 tunities and advancement. Free political discussion at the University of Yaounde is
 dampened by the presence of armed security forces, as well as sometimes strident
 pro-opposition student groups. Other universities and educational institutions ap-
 peared to be relatively free of the coercive presence of armed security forces or stri-
 dent student groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associat on.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, but the Government sometimes restricts this right in practice. The
 Penal Code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior
 government approval.
 Following the attacks on government installations in the Northwest province in
 late March, Governor Francis Fai Yengo signed an order for a dusk-to-dawn curfew
 that was not lifted until late July.
 On April 2, South West province Governor Peter Oben Ashu banned the publica-
 tion ceremony of a book by the Government's ambassador to the Central African Re-
 public, Christopher Nsahlai, on the pretext that it would disrupt public order, al-
 though a similar ceremony had been held in Yaounde a few weeks earlier.
 On May 28, Governor Ashu signed an order banning all political and social meet-
 ings throughout the South    West province following   several incidents of
 postlegislative election violence. The ban was lifted on July 14.
 On June 6, Sani Alhadji, SDF provincial coordinator for the Center province and
 other opposition militants were arrested outside the Supreme Court while peacefully
 demonstrating against the Court's official rendering of the May 17 election results.
 On July 16, Center province governor Oumarou Koue issued an order banning all
 political gatherings in the province until July 25 in order to enable parliamentar-
 ians to return to their constituencies after the June session. This order prevented
 the opposition SDF party from holding a major rally at the national stadium on July
 19, for which the authorities had already granted permission.
 The law provides for freedom of association, but the Government sometimes re-
 stricts this right in practice. Over 140 political parties operated legally together
 with a growing number of civic associations. There were fewer government-imposed
 restrictions on these parties to assemble and operate than in years prior to 1996.
 
 
 c. Freedom of Reli ion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generaly does not restrict it in practice. Religious groups must be ap-
 proved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial Administration in order to
 function legally; there are no reports that the Government refused to register any
 Christian denomination. Christian churches of various denominations operate freely
 throughout the country. The Government verbally attacked the Catholic Church for
 being overly supportive of the political opposition through its forthright criticism of
 corruption and mismanagement in government. Muslim centers also operate freely
 throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law does not restrict freedom of movement within the country, but
 government security forces impede domestic travel. Police frequently stp travelers
 to check identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts as security
 and immigration control measures. Police commonly demand illegal payments from
 citizens whorn they stop at roadblocks or other points.
 The Government occasionally uses its passport control powers against those whom
 it considers potential threats. Victorin Hameni Bieleu, the president of the Union
 of Cameroonian Democratic Forces party, had his passport withdrawn 6 years ago.
 Following the legislative elections on May 17, he was issued a passport by frontier
 police authorities. Some student activists implicated in 1996 Yaounde clashes have
 also been unable to obtain passports.
 Following the March attacks on government installations in the Northwest prov-
 ince, Governor Yengo signed an order instituting controls and checks of all persons
 and goods moving through the province.
 Cameroon has long been a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees from
 nearby countries. Although the Government occasionally returns illegal immigrants,
 there were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees. Some illegal im-
 migrants have been subjected to harsh treatment, including imprisonment.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum to persons who arrive at the border without docu-
 mentation but can show a valid claim to refugee status. There are currently some
 47,332 refugees in the country for whom Cameroon is a country of first asylum. The
 majority of these persons-nearly 44,390-are Chadian. The remainder are prin-
 cipally from Liberia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, and the former Zaire, the
 Democratic Republic of Congo. There were 1,400 refugees who arrived in Cameroon
 as a country of first asylum in 1996 and 800 during the year. The Government ac-
 cepts for resettlement refugees who are granted refugee status by the UNHCR. In
 1996 Cameroon accepted approximately 30 Rwandan refugees from Tanzania for re-
 settlement, and in 1997 received 66 Rwandan refugees from Tanzania and the
 Democratic Republic of Congo. There were no reports of forced expulsion of persons
 having a valid claim to refugee status during the year.
 In response to a transfer order from the U.N. Tribunal in Arusha, the Govern-
 ment transferred four persons suspected of war crimes to Tanzania in February.
 The transfer of two more persons to the U.N. Tribunal occurred on November 19.
 In late August and early September, there were reports that about 500 Congolese
 refugees fleeing turmoil in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo and other parts of that
 country arrived at Mouloundou in East province. According to the UN-CR, only
 about 200 were actual Congolese citizens. The others, including Cameroonians,
 chose to return across the border after a brief stay. The remainder were brought
 to Bertoua, and voluntary repatriation began.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government, but dominance
 of the political process by the President and his party limit the ability of citizens
 to exercise this right. The President and his party have controlled the Government
 since 1982. The 1992 presidential election was highly criticized by international ob-
 servers and widely viewed as fraudulent. The 1996 nationwide multiparty municipal
 elections were judged to be generally free and fair by domestic and international ob-
 servers. However, the May 17 legislative elections, in which the ruling party ulti-
 mately won 116 of the 180 Assembly seats, were criticized by three international
 observer missions as flawed because of numerous irregularities in voter registration,
 counting procedures, and violation of certain other aspects of the electoral code.
 Following the May 17 balloting, 21 political parties submitted some 150 appeals
 to the Supreme Court; 4 parties demanded the annulment of the contest, and 19
 parties, including the ruling party, called for the elections to be annulled in 65 of
 74 constituencies. Some 600 local observers who received accreditation also reported
 
 
 43
 numerous anomalies leading to the disenfranchisement of a significant portion of
 the electorate. The Supreme Court demonstrated a modest degree of independence
 in dealing with these complaints and called for by-elections to be held in the case
 of seven seats, which the ruling party won on August 3. Citizens expressed their
 disapproval of the electoral process through a low-voter turnout. The registration
 process, which is open continuously except during elections, is hampered by officials
 who appear to apply the law irregularly and unevenly.
 The majority of international observers endorsed a reform measure espoused by
 the opposition that calls for the formation of a permanent and autonomous electoral
 commission to replace the present system of elections run by the Ministry of Terri-
 torial Administration. The opposition maintains that the Ministry's control leads to
 preelectoral manipulation of voter registration lists. In late August, the opposition
 rallied behind a proposed bill to amend the Constitution to allow-for an independent
 electoral commission, a second round runoff system for the presidential election, and
 a return to the 5-year term for president. The President's majority in the special
 session of the Assembly chose not to consider this bill, opting instead for the pas-
 sage of a few minor reforms to the 1991 electoral code, including increased discre-
 tionary power for the Minister of Territorial Administration to rule on the admissi-
 bility of candidacies.
 On October 12, President Biya won re-election in a process marred by serious pro-
 cedural flaws, and generally considered by observers as not free and fair. The three
 major oppositions parties boycotted the elections, and the election irregularities
 were especially egregious in opposition strongholds, with opposition activists not
 present to monitor the process.
 The Government's control over the country's administrative apparatus is broad
 and deep. The President appoints by decree the chief operating official (the govern-
 ment delegate) of Yaounde, Douala, Bamenda, and several other large cities. These
 delegates easily dominate the elected municipal councils, most of whose members
 belong to opposition parties. The President also directly appoints the governors of
 each of the provinces. The governors wield considerable power in the electoral proc-
 ess, interpreting the laws and determining how these should be implemented. Im-
 portant lower level members of the provincial administrative structures, including
 the senior divisional officers, the divisional officers, and the district chiefs, are all
 career civil servants appointed by the Prime Minister. The governors and senior di-
 visional officers wield considerable authority within the areas under their jurisdic-
 tion, including, significantly, the authority to ban political meetings that they deem
 likely to threaten public order. A majority of important political appointees are
 drawn from the President's own ethnic group.
 In 1995 the National Assembly passed a set of government-introduced amend-
 ments to the 1972 constitution, which established strongly centralized power. The
 amendments included a two-term limit for the President, the creation of a partially
 elected (70 percent) and partially appointed (30 percent) Senate, and the creation
 of a set of regional councils with limited power over local affairs. The amendments
 did not weaken presidential power, and the independence of the judiciary remained
 questionable. Although promulgated by the President in January 1996, most of
 ese amendments have not yetbeen implemented.
 There are no laws that specifically prohibit women or members of minorities from
 participating in government, in the political process, or in other areas of public life.
 Women are underrepresented in the Cabinet (3 of the 50 members), in the National
 Assembly (10 of the 180 members), and in the CPDM. Many of the key members
 of the Government are drawn from the President's own ethnic group. Members of
 other ethnic groups and regions hold 34 Cabinet seats, compared with 16 Cabinet
 positions held by members of the President's ethnic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights monitoring groups generally have con-
 siderable latitude to operate. A large number of independent human rights monitor-
 ing groups exist, although the activities of virtually all are limited by a shortage
 of funds and trained personnel. The Government did not generally prevent human
 rights monitors from operating, but on occasion used its authority to a pprove or
 withhold official recognition of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). This was
 the case with Conscience Africaine, an NGO that received international support for
 training election observers until the Government announced that it had not received
 official recognition, thus halting implementation of its program; however, the NGO
 continued to operate in practice. The Government sometimes impedes the effective-
 ness of human rights NGO's by limiting access to prisoners and refusing to share
 information.
 
 
 There were several cases of possible harassment of human rights monitors. On
 February 27, Abdoulaye Math, president of a human rights organization based in
 Maroua was arrested as he was preparing to go abroad to attend a human rights
 program. Charged with fraud, he was provisionally released pending trial. There
 were no further developments in that case, but he was arrested again in November,
 allegedly in connection with a fraudulent vehicle purchase. He was subsequently re-
 leased, and no charges were filed. Another member of this organization, lohamadou
 Moustapha, was severely beaten at Maroua prison on July 31 when he attempted
 to intercede on behalf of a prisoner being abused (see Section 1.c.).
 Human rights NGO's include the National League for Human Rights, the Organi-
 zation for Human Rights and Freedoms, the Association of Women against Violence,
 the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, the Cameroonian Association for
 Children's Rights, Conscience Africaine, the Movement for the Defense of Human
 Rights and Liberties, the Human Rights Defense Group, and the Human Rights
 Clinic and Education Center. A number of these groups issued press releases or re-
 ports detailing specific human rights violations.  any  eld seminars and workshops
 on various aspects of human rights.
 The governmental National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, al-
 thoughhampered by a shortage of funds, conducted a number of investigations into
 human rights abuses and organized several human rights seminars aimed at judi-
 cia officials, security personnel, and other government officers. The Commission has
 never, however, published any results of its investigations. Its reports have been
 submitted to the P rime Minister and President but never released.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and mandates that "every-
 one has equal rights and obligations." It does not explicitly forbid discrimination
 based on race, language, or social status. The Government does not effectively en-
 force these constitutional provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women remains at high levels. Women's rights advo-
 cates report that the raw does not impose effective penalties against persons who
 commit acts of domestic violence against women. There are no gender-specific as-
 sault laws, despite the fact that women are the predominant victims of domestic vio-
 lence. Spouse abuse is not a legal ground for divorce. In cases of sexual assault, a
 victim's family or village often imposes direct, summary punishment on the sus-
 pected perpetrator through extralegal means ranging from destruction of property
 to beatin g. While there are no reliable statistics on violene against women, the
 large number of newspaper reports--a fraction of actual incidents--indicates that it
 is common.
 Despite constitutional provisions recognizing women's rights, women do not, in
 fact, enjoy the same rights and prvileges as men. Polygyny is permitted by law and
 tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit from her
 husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will, and cus-
 toms vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants greater
 authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the hus-
 band's wishes determine custody of children over the age of 6. While a man may
 be convicted of adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may
 be convicted without respect to venue. In the northern provinces, some Lamibe re-
 portedly prevent their numerous wives from ever leaving the palaces.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for a child's right to education, and school-
 ing is mandatory through the age of 14. Nevertheless, rising school fees and costs
 for books have forced many families  orgo sending their children to school. Babies
 and small children are sometimes held in prison if their mothers are incarcerated
 (see Section 1.c.). The degree of familial child abuse is not known but is one of sev-
 eral targeted issues of children's rights organizations.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been condemned bK international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological heath, is not widely
 practiced, but it is practiced in some areas of Far North and Southwest provinces.
 It includes the most severe form of the abuse, infibulation, and is usually practiced
 on preadolescent girls. The Government sponsored several events directed at this
 problem in the capital during the year.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1983 law and subsequent implementing legislation
 provide certain rights for persons with disabilities. These include access to public
 institutions, medical treatment, and education. The Government is obliged to bear
 part of a disabled person's educational expenses, to employ disabled persons where
 possible, and, as necessary, to provide them with public assistance. However, these
 rights are in fact rarely respected. There are few facilities for disabled persons and
 
 
 little public assistance of any kind. Lack of facilities and care for the mentally dis-
 abled is particularly acute. Society tends to treat the disabled as tainted, leaving
 churches or foreign NGO's responsible for providing assistance. The law does not
 mandate special access provisions to buildings and facilities for people with disabil-
 ities.
 Indigenous People.-The population of indigenous Baka Pygmies, a term that fact
 encompasses several different ethnic groups, primarily reside in the forested areas
 of the South and East provinces. While no legal discrimination exists, other groups
 often treat them as inferior and sometimes subject them to unfair and exploitative
 labor practices.
 Religious Minorities.-There is some societal discrimination against Christians.
 Some Christians in rural areas of the north, a predominantly Muslim region, com-
 plain of discrimination by Muslims. Such discrimination appears to arise from cul-
 tural bias.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-There are frequent and credible allegations
 of discrimination among Cameroon's more than 200 ethnic groups. President Biya's
 Bulu ethnic group and members of closely related Beti gups hold key positions in
 government, the security forces, and the military forces. In other sectors, discrimina-
 tion by other ethnic grups is common. Virtually all ethnic groups provide pref-
 erential treatment to fellow members where the are able to do so.
 An important ethnic, political division falls along linguistic lines rooted in the co-
 lonial period. The Anglophone minority (20 percent) often charges that the
 Francophone majority does not share real power and that the Government provides
 fewer economic benefits to English-speaking regions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A 1992 Labor Code allows workers to form and join
 trade unions of their choosing. The Labor Code permits groups of at least 20 work-
 ers to organize a union but also requires registration with the Ministry of Labor.
 In practice, independent unions have found it extremely difficult to obtain registra-
 tion. Registered unions are invariably subject to government domination and inter-
 ference.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) noted that the Government has failed
 sine 1991 to reognize the National Union of Teachers of Higher Education.
 Provisions of the Labor Code do not apply to civil servants, employees of the peni-
 tentiary system, or workers responsible for national security. In lieu of strikes, civil
 servants are required to negotiate grievances directly with the minister of the con-
 crned department and with the Minister of Labor. Some sections of the Labor Code
 have never taken effect, as not all of the implementing decrees have been issued.
 No new implementing decrees were issued during the year.
 There are two trade union confederations. In 1995 the Government encouraged
 the creation of a new labor confederation, the Union of Free Trade Unions of Cam-
 eroon vUSLC), with which it maintains close ties. Previously, the sole labor confed-
 eration had been the Confederation of Cameroonian Trade Unions (CCTU), formeriy
 affiliated  with the ruling  CPDM   party under the    name   Organization  of
 Cameroonian Trade Unions. While both organizations appear to be dominated or at
 east thoroughly intimidated by the Government, the creation of the USLC was
 widely interpreted as an effort by the Government to create a rival trade union con-
 federation more firmly under its control.
 The Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only after man-
 atory arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are not legally enforceable and can be
 overturned by the Government. The Labor Code rovides for the protection of legal
 strikes and prohibits retribution against them. there were few strikes during the
 year.
 The CCTUp is a member of the organization of African Trade Union Unity
 (OATUU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The
 USLC filed applications for membership with these organizations in 1995. At year's
 end, the US    was stil awaiting a response to its bid to join the OATUU and
 ICFT'U.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining between workers and management in work places, as well as
 between labor federations and business associations in each sector of the economy.
 No sectoral collective bargaining negotiations were undertaken during the year. The
 Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such dis-
 crimination are subject to fines of up to $2,000. However, employers found guilty
 are not required to reinstate the workers against whom they discriminated. The
 Ministry of Labor reported no complaints of such discrimination during the year.
 
 
 There is an industrial free zone regime, but the Government did not grant ap-
 proval to any firms to operate under it during the year. Free zone employers are
 exempt from some provisions of the Labor Code but must respect all internationally
 recognized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, but it occurs in practice. Forced or bonded
 labor by children is not specifically prohibited (see Section 6.d.). The authorities con-
 tinued to allow prison inmates to be contracted out to private employers or used as
 communal labor for municipal public works.
 There are credible reports that slavery continues to be practiced in the Lamidat
 of Rey Bouba, an isolated traditional kingdom in the North province. In South and
 East provinces, Baka Pygmies are subjected to unfair and exploitative labor prac-
 tices (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Although
 the Constitution prohibits forced or bonded labor it does not specifically prohibit
 such labor by children (see Section 6.c.). Pygmy children are sometimes subject to
 unfair and exploitative labor practices. The Constitution declares that the nation
 shall protect and promote the family, with a specific reference to the young. It pro-
 vides for a child's right to education and makes primary education compulsory. The
 Labor Code forbids the employment of children under the age of 14. However, Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors responsible for enforcing the law lack resources for an ef-
 fective inspection progam. In rural areas, many children begin work at an early
 age on family farms. Often, rural youth, especially girls, are employed by relatives
 as domestic helpers, while many urban street vendors are under 14 years of age.
 There are no special provisions limiting working hours for children.
 In September the ILO's Africa Office held a workshop in Yaounde to develop an
 action plan against child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide .in all sec-
 tors. The minimum wage is approximately $40 (23,500 cfa francs) per month. It does
 not provide a decent standard of living for an average worker and family.
 The Labor Code establishes a stan ard workweek of 40 hours in public and pri-
 vate nonagricultural firms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The
 Code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest. The Govern-
 ment sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor inspectors and occu-
 pational health doctors are responsible for monitoring these standards. However,
 they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program. There is no specific
 legislation permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment.
