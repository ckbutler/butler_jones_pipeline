 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a 1947 Constitution. Sovereignty
 is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. Executive
 power is exercised by a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and ministers of
 state, responsible to the Diet, a two-house parliament. The Diet, elected by univer-
 sal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister, who must be a mem-
 ber of that body. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed the current Govern-
 ment in July. The judiciary is independent of the Government.
 A well-organized and disciplinedpolice force generally respects the human rights
 of the populace and is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be credible reports that police committed some human rights
 abuses.
 The industrialized free market economy is highly efficient and competitive in
 world markets and provides residents with a high standard of living.
 A just and efficient legal system generally assures observance of constitutionally
 provided human rights. There continue to be some credible reports that police phys-
 ically and psychologically abused prisoners and detainees. Officials are sometimes
 dismissed for such abuse but are seldom tried, convicted, and imprisoned. The
 Burakumin (a group historically treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indigenous
 people), women, and alien residents experience varying degrees of societal discrimi-
 nation, some of it severe and longstanding. The Ministry of Justice handles com-
 plaints of discrimination by issuing instructions recommending that such practices
 be avoided. However, the Ministry's Human Rights Defense Bureau has a small
 staff and limited investigative or enforcement powers. Since the administrative sys-
 tem for combating human rights violations is weak, many cases end up in court.
 Violence against women is a problem.

 The Justice Ministry's Human Rights Commission continued to work on a 5-year
 mandate to develop measures to educate citizens with regard to human rights ideals
 and to promote measures to ameliorate the effects of existing human rights viola-
 tions. The Commission is also tasked with advising the Education Ministry and
 Management and Coordination Agency on how to educate citizens about the impor-
 tance of respecting human rights. The Commission is to submit recommendations
 on rights-related education by 1999, and to submit recommendations on relief meas-
 ures by 2002.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 kilings.
 In Pebruary Tokyo police concluded that there was no criminal case against eight
 immigration officers under investigation for the 1997 death of an Iranian national
 being held in detention while awaiting deportation. In July the Osaka High Court
 upheld a lower court ruling sentencing a former police officer to 6 months in prison,
 suspended for 2 years, for beating a teenage suspect to death in 1988.
 In May a court sentenced Ikuo Hayashi, a leader of the Aurn Shinrikyo cult, to
 life imprisonment for the killing of 12 persons on the Tokyo subways in 1995. In
 October a court sentenced to death another leader of the Aur Shimrikyo cult
 Kazuaki Okazaki for the 1989 killings of four persons including an antisect lawyer,
 his wife, and their 1-year-old son. Cases still are pending in district courts against
 two dozen senior Aum members, including cult leader Shoko Asahara.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, reports by several Japanese bar associa-
 tions, human rights groups, and some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use
 physical violence, including kicking and beating, as well as psychological intimida-
 tion, to obtain confessions from suspects in custody or to enforce discipline. There
 were also scattered allegations of beatings of detainees in immigration detention fa-
 cilities.
 In Japan confession is regarded as the first step in the rehabilitative process. Al-
 though under the Constitution no criminal suspect can be compelled to make a self-
 incriminating confession, roughly 90 percent of all criminal cases going to trial in-
 clude confessions, reflecting the priority that the system places on admissions of
 guilt. The Government points out that the high percentage of confessions, like the
 high conviction rate, is reflective of a higher standard of evidence needed to bring
 about indictment in the Japanese system. Since a system of arraignment does not
 exist, a suspect, if indicted, is brought to trial even if that person has confessed to
 the crime. This process results in a higher conviction rate than would otherwise be
 the case. There are persistnt allegations of coerced confessions.
 Appellate courts have overturned several convictions in recent years on the
 grounds that they were obtained as a result of forced confession. In addition, civil
 and criminal suits alleging abuse during interrogation and detention have been
 brought against some police and prosecution officials. In February the Osaka High
 Court ordered the prefectural government to pay compensation to five persons
 forced by police to confess to the 1979 murder of a housewife. In June following a
 struggle between prison guards and an inmate in Oita prison, the Fukuoka regional
 correction headquarters of the Justice Ministry instructed facilities within the re-
 gion to prevent violence against prisoners.
 Some human rights groups allege that physical restraints, such as leather hand-
 cuffs, have been used as a form of punishment and that prisoners have been forced
 to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints. Ministry
 of Justice officials state that restraints are used inside the prison only when pris-
 oners have been violent and pose a threat to themselves and others, or when there
 is concern that a prisoner might attempt to escape. In June the Tokyo District Court
 ruled that the use of metal and leather handcuffs was not a violation of the Con-
 stitution. Prison conditions meet most minimum international standards. However,
 prisons in Japan are not heated and prisoners are given only minimal additional
 clothing to protect themselves against cold weather. There have been cases of frost-
 bite among the prison population. Many foreign inmates complain that the quantity
 'of food is insufficient and that they are constantly hungry. Prisoners may not pur-
 chase or be given supplementary food. Letters to and from prisoners may be read
 and censored, or confiscated. All visits from family and friends are monitored, and
 prisoners are strongly discouraged from complaining about conditions. Prison offi-
 
 
 939
 
 cials claim the "no complaining" rule is designed to keep family members from wor-
 rying about their loved ones. The Justice Ministry usually does not inform a death-
 row inmate's family prior to the execution.
 The Japanese Federation of Bar Associations and human rights groups have criti-
 cized the prison system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to nu-
 merous rules. Prison rules are confidential. Guards sometimes selectively enforce
 them and impose punishment, including "minor solitary confinement," which may
 be imposed for a minimum of I and not more than 60 days and in which the pris-
 oner is made to sit (for foreigners) or kneel (for Japanese) motionless in the middle
 of an empty cell.
 The Government restricts access to prisons and detention facilities by human
 rights groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional provisions for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are respected in practice. The law provides
 for judicial determination of the legality of detention. People may not be detained
 without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists in order to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours with-
 out judicial proceedings. Preindictment custody may be extended by a judge for up
 to 20 additional days. If an indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a crimi-
 nal detention facility. Bail is available in only about 25 percent of cases.
 The bar associations and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." Although the law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 '"ouses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police detention facility may
 be substituted at the order of the court. This provision was originally added to cover
 a shortage of normal detention facilities. According to the most recent Ministry of
 Justice White Paper on Crime, published in 1995, normal detention facilities were
 filled to 53 percent of capacity in 1994. Critics charge that allowing suspects to be
 detained by the same authorities who interrogate them heightens the potential for
 abuse and coercion. The Government counters that adequate safeguards to prevent
 abuse, including strong judicial oversight, have been built into the system.
 The length of time bore a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 3 months from the date of arrest; the average is 1 to
 2 months (see Section i.e.). Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in
 duration and frequency, although the Government denies that this is the case. The
 Criminal Procedure Code grants the prosecution and investigating police officials
 the power to control access to attorneys before indictment when deemed necessary
 for the sake of the investigation. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until
 after indictment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney be-
 fore indictment, although local bar associations may provide detainees with a free
 counseling session prior to indictment. An attorney is provided at government ex-
 pense after indictment if the arrested person cannot afford one. Counsel may not
 be present during interrogation at any time before or after indictment. With these
 exceptions, the Government affirms that the right of the accused to seek legal coun-
 sel is fully respected and that attorneys almost always are able to see clients with-
 out obstruction.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and free from execu-
 tive branch interference. The Cabinet appoints judges for 10-year terms, which can
 be renewed until judges reach the age of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can
 serve until the age of 70 but face periodic review through popular referendum.
 There are several levels of courts, high courts, district courts, family courts, and
 summary courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority.
 Normally a trial begins at the district court level, and a verdict may be appealed
 to a high court and then to the Supreme Court.
 The Government respects in practice the constitutional provisions for the right to
 a speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases. Although
 the Constitution also provides for a speedy trial and most criminal trials are com-
 pleted within a reasonable length of time (see Section 1.d.), cases also may take sev-
 eral years to work their way through the trial and appeals process. For example,
 more than 3 years after the Aur Shinrikyo cult's sarin gas attack in the Tokyo sub-
 way killed 12 people, cult leader Shoko Asahara's initial trial is still under way. In
 March, 24 years after the death of a child and more than 20 years after court pro-
 ceedings were first initiated, the Kobe District Court for the second time acquitted
 a former teacher accused of the child's murder. The teacher initially was indicted
 in 1977. The prosecution had appealed the first not-guilty verdict in 1985 and the
 Osaka High Court had ordered a retrial. Critics of the Kobe district public prosecu-
 tors' office, which is again appealing the verdict, note that the case has dragged on
 
 
 940
 longer than the 13-year prison sentence the prosecution originally sought, and
 longer than the 15-year statute of limitations on murder cases.
 There is no trial by jury. The defendant is informed of charges upon arrest and
 assured a public trial by an independent civilian court with defense counsel and the
 right of cross-examination. The Constitution provides defendants with the right not
 to be compelled to testifyagainst themselves as well as to free and private access
 to counsel. The Government contends that the right to consult with attorneys is not
 an absolute one, and can be restricted if such restriction is compatible with the spir-
 it of the Constitution. Access is sometimes abridged in practice. For example, the
 law allows prosecutors to control access to counsel before indctment, and there are
 persistent allegations of coerced confessions (see Section 1.c.). Defendants are pro-
 tected from the retroactive application of laws and have the right of access to in-
 criminating evidence after a formal indictment has been made. However,the law
 does not require full disclosure by the prosecutor, and material that the prosecution
 will not use in court may be suppressed. Critics claim that legal representatives of
 defendants -do not always have access to all relevant material in the police record,
 needed to prepare their defense. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision
 of a trial court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by law, appeal
 to a higher court.
 There are no guidelines mandating the acceptable quality of communications be-
 tween judges, lawyers, and non-Japanese speaking defendants, althofigh the Su-
 preme Court publishes handbooks explaining legal procedures and terms for court
 interpreters. There is no standard licensing or qualification system for certifying
 court interpreters, and a trial may proceed even if the accused does not understand
 what is happening or being said. In March the Takamatsu High Court dismissed
 the appeal of a Thai woman convicted in 1997 of murder, ruling that the verdict
 and the '8-year sentence should stand despite the fact that the presiding ower court
 judge had not allowed the interpreter to translate the reasons for the sentence to
 the defendant.
 There were no repors of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant
 issued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press.
 However, recent cases appear to indicate that certain types of professionals, such
 as teachers and jurists, are subject to limitations on their freedom of speech. In Feb-
 raryathe Fukuoka District Court rejected a primary school teacher's lawsuit to in-
 idte a reprimand he received 10 years earlier for expressing support for stu-
 dents who refused to sing the de facto national anthem at their graduation cere-
 mony in 1988. In August the Sendac High Court reprimanded an assistant District
 Court judge for speaking in an unofficial capacity at an April 18 meeting organized
 by citizens' groups opposing a controversial wiretapping bill. The Sendai High
 Court, at the recommendation of the Senda District Court, reprimanded the judge
 under the Court Law , which bans judges from engaging in "aggressive political ac-
 tivity," saying a judge's presence at the meeting "created a clear impression there
 is a judge opposing the bill." According to a Supreme Court official, this was the
 first case of a judge being reprimanded for political activity. The judge planned to
 appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
 Academic freedom is protected, except in the case of school textbooks. The Edu-
 cation Ministry has the authority to censor or order revisions to elementary, middie,
 and high school textbooks. In 1997 the Supreme Court ruled that state censorship
 of textbooks did not violate the constitutional provisions for freedom of expression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion and the separation of state and reli-
 gion are provided for in the Constitution and are respected in practice. While Bud-
 dhism and Shintoism are the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several Christian denominations. Some temples and shrines receive public support
 as national historic or cultural Sites However, this situation may change in the
 wake of a 1997 Supreme Court ruling that a prefectural government may not con-
 tribute public money to only one religious organization, if the donations supported,
 
 
 941
 
 encouraged, and promoted a specific religious group. In July the Kochi District
 Court ruled that using village government money to repair two Shinto shrines was
 tantamount to allocating public funds to a religious group, and therefore unconstitu-
 tional.
 The Government does not require that religious groups be licensed. However, to
 receive official recognition as a religious organization, which brings tax benefits and
 other advantages, a group must register with local or national authorities as a "reli-
 gious corporation." In practice, almost all religious groups register. In response to
 the Aum Shinrikyo terrorist attacks, a 1996 amendment to the Religious Corpora-
 tion Law gives governmental authorities increased oversight of religious groups and
 requires greater disclosure of financial assets by religious corporations. The Cultural
 Affairs Agency estimates that nearly 5,000 religious groups across the nation appear
 dormant. In May the Matsuyama District Court ordered the dissolution of a reg-
 istered Shinto religious group that had been dormant since 1982. This was the first
 time a court had accepted the Cultural Affairs Agency's request to dissolve a reli-
 gious body since the Religious Corporation Law went into effect in 1951. However,
 in June the Nagoya High Court upheld a lower court ruling ordering the Toyama
 prefectural government to pay monetary damages to 88 followers of a Buddhist sect
 or violating their rights by ignoring for more than 10 years their application for
 certification as a religious sect.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have the right to travel freely both within the country and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Citizenship may be lost by naturalization in a foreign country, or by failure of per-
 sons born with dual nationality to elect Japanese citizenship at the required age.
 The Government has granted asylum to those claiming fear of persecution if they
 return to their homeland in only a small number of cases. It believes that most peo-
 ple seeking asylum in the country do so for economic reasons. Between January
 1997 and July 31, 1998, only 4 of the 311 applicants met the required standard for
 asylum and were granted that status.
 The Government has shown flexibility in dealing with visa extensions for Chinese
 student dissidents, although it continues to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 The Government's 60-day rule requires applicants to appear at an immigration of-
 fice within 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of learning that they are likely to
 be persecuted in their home country. Individuals who do not present their applica-
 tions within the 60-day time frame due to extenuating circumstances may apply as
 an exception to the rule, even after the 60-day period had passed. An alien who is
 recognized as a refugee has access to educational facilities, public relief and aid, and
 social welfare benefits. An alien who is denied refugee status may appeal the deci-
 sion to the Ministry of Justice. Rejected applicants also may take their cases to
 court if ministry authorities do not recognize their objections. In an effort to make
 procedures clearer to applicants, the Government distributes an English-language
 pamphlet to those interested in the asylum process.
 While the Government sometimes grants first asylum, there are no standard pro-
 cedures established, and the Justice Ministry and the Foreign Affairs Ministry de-
 cide upon such grants jointly on a case-by-case basis. In August the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees asked the Justice Ministry to release two Burmese
 nationals who were taken into custody in July after having been denied refugee sta-
 tus. They were being held on suspicion of overstaying their visas, which had expired
 while their refugee applications were pending. In April a pregnant Chinese woman
 accused of illegally entering the country filed for refugee status on the grounds that
 she would be forced to undergo an abortion if she returned to China, in accordance
 with China's one-child family policy. In July the Matsue District Court rejected the
 prosecution's request that she be imprisoned for 1 year for illegal entry. Her asylum
 application was pending at year's end. There were no reports that persons were forc-
 ibly returned to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government and are able to ex-
 ercise this right in practice through frequent, free, and fair elections on the basis
 of universal suffrage by secret ballot. Under legislation passed in April, citizens liv-
 ing overseas may vote for proportional representation candidates in national elec-
 tions, but may not vote in single-seat races or local elections. Expatriates are press-
 ing for voting rights to be extended.
 A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed by the political party or parties
 able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. The Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party formed the current Government in July.
 
 
 942
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation. As of August,
 women held 23 seats in the 500-member lower house of the Diet (4.6 percent), and
 43 seats in the 252-member upper house (17.1 percent). There is 1 woman in the
 21-member Cabinet.
 There is one Ainu member of the Diet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local and international human rights organizations function freely,
 without governmental restrictions or impediments, investigating and publishing
 their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative
 and responsive to their views, although the Government restricts access to prisons
 and detention facilities by human rights groups (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, sex, social
 status, or family origin, and, in general, the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-According to a July report issued by the Prime Minister's Office of Gen-
 der Equality, there were 1,755 rapes and 4,398 indecent assaults reported in 1997.
 However, violence against women, particularly domestic violence, often may go un-
 reported due to social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family or endan-
 gering the reputation of one's spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women often
 return to the home of their parents rather than file reports with authorities. There-
 fore, National Police Agency statistics on violence against women undoubtedly un-
 derstate the scope of the current situation. Many local governments are responding
 positively to a need for confidential assistance by establishing special women's con-
 sultation departments in police and prefectural offices.
 According to the Ministry of Justice, the number of illegal female workers de-
 creased slightly from 127,047 at the end of 1996 to 126,982 at the beginning of 1998.
 Japan-is a destination country in the international trafficking of women for pur-
 poses of sexual exploitation. Brokers in source countries (e.g., the Philippines and
 Thailand) recruit women and "sell" them to Japanese intermediaries, who in turn
 coerce them into the sex trade by subjecting them to excessive debts and seizing
 their passports. Reliable statistics on the number and origin of women trafficked to
 the country are unavailable, but according to the Ministry of Justice 395 (2.5 per-
 cent) of the 15,823 women deported in 1997 were prostitutes.
 Sexual harassment in the workplace is widespread, as evidenced by a 1996 report
 compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO) in which 40 percent
 of working women reported that they had experienced some form of sexual harass-
 ment. Sexual harassment occurs in a range of actions, including sexually charged
 jokes, comments about physical features such as breast size, the display of porno-
 graphic photos, molestation, direct requests for sexual favors, and unwanted bodily
 contact. According to the survey, 2 percent of respondents said that they were forced
 to have a sexual relationship. A 1997 survey from the Ministry of Labor's working
 group on the implementation of the revised Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)
 Law reported that 62 percent of working women claimed to have experienced at
 least one act of sexual harassment.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women and sexual harassment has in-
 creased, but there is no indication that incidents of discrimination and sexual har-
 assment are decreasing. Women make up 40 percent of the labor force, and women
 between the ages of 15 and 64 have a labor force participation rate of 51 percent.
 According to a National Personnel Authority survey conducted in thewinter of 1997,
 roughly 36 percent of female civil servants reported being sexually harassed by their
 direct superiors, and over 50 percent reported being harassed by bosses of other sec-
 tions. One in six women said that their bosses had pressured them into a sexual
 relationship. More than 20 percent of the women surveyed said that they were un-
 able to work efficiently as a result of harassment and wanted to move to another
 office or change jobs. However, according to a Management and Coordination Agen-
 cy survey conducted in 1996, 93 percent of companes surveyed had not taken any
 preventive measures against sexual harassment. Seventy-five percent of the firms
 said that they felt no need to take such measures. In March the National Personnel
 Authority distributed 60,000 pamphlets to civil servants in all ministries and agen-
 cies in an effort to curb sexual harassment at government offices. A growing number
 of government entities are establishing hot lines and designating ombudsmen to
 handle complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment.
 
 
 The Constitution prohibits sexual discrimination and stipulates individual dignity
 and the essential equality of the sexes in the family. The Labor Standards Law for-
 bids wage discrimination against women. The Government passed several additional
 pieces of legislation designed to equalize emploeant and promotion opportunities
 and combat sexual harassment. In 1997 the Government passed a law allowing
 women to work overtime shifts for the first time. Under previous laws, in effect
 since 1947, women were prohibited from working between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.,
 with only a few exceptions. Also in 1997, the Government passed a new EEO Law
 banning" employers from discriminating against women. This law was designed to
 strengthen the 1986 EEO Law, which instructed employers to make efforts to stop
 discrimination in recruiting, hiring, assignments, and promotion of workers. The re-
 vised EEO Law is scheduled to go into full effect in April 1999. However, the new
 law's only penalty is that names of companies that practice sexual discrimination
 can be publicFed. The Ministry of Labor does not enforce compliance through fines
 or other punitive penalties. Also in 1997, the Government revised the Labor Stand-
 ards Law to allow an arbitration committee to initiate procedures to help ensure the
 rights of female workers at the worker's request, without first having to obtain ap-
 proval from both management and the worker's union.
 Although as noted the law prohibits discrimination against women in wages, fe-
 male workers on average earned only 63 percent of average male earnings. Much
 of this disparity results from the "two-track" personnel administration system found
 in most larger companies. Under this system, newly hired employees are put into
 one of two categories: Managerial track (those engaged in planning and decision-
 making jobs and with the potential to become top executives), or clerical track (those
 engaged in general office work). According to a 1995 Ministry of Labor survey, 72
 percent of companies responding said that they hired only male workers for mana-
 gerial track jobs. Female workers have suffered disproportionately from the contin-
 ued sluggishness of the economy. Because married women are designated as spouses
 on the family income tax return, women who earn more than $8,500 (1.03 million
 yen) per year face the loss of income tax benefits and their husbands may lose cor-
 porate family allowances.
 According to the National Personnel Authority, as of 1995 women made up 16 per-
 cent of all national government workers, but held only 4 percent of top (director
 level and higher) government posts. According to the Home Ministry, women con-
 stituted 31 percent of all local government workers, but held only 3 percent of top
 local government positions.
 In addition to discrimination, traditional male/female division of labor at home
 places disproportionate burdens on working women. According to a 1997 report from
 the Prime Minister's Office on Gender Equality, women do 90 percent of the house-
 work and child rearing, while men do 10 percent. The report found that there was
 little difference in the time spent on housework by men whose wives had jobs and
 those whose wives did not work outside the home. On March 3, women across the
 country participated in the second annual "women's general strike," taking the day
 off from work and domestic chores to promote equal rights for men and women.
 In 1997 the Government acknowledged that nearly 16,500 disabled women were
 sterilized without their consent between 1949 and 1992. In its acknowledgment the
 Government stated that it did not plan to apologize or pay compensation to these
 women, or to further investigate the program, despite the demands of National Fed-
 eration for the Mentally Handicapped and several other groups representing women
 and the disabled. A Ministry of Health official said that no apology was planned be-
 cause the procedure was legal at the time. The Eugenic Protection Law, revoked
 only in 1996, allowed doctors to sterilize people with mental or physical disabilities
 or certain hereditary diseases without their consent, after the approval of commit-
 tees appointed by local governments. Women's and disabled persons advocacy
 groups are still pressing for a government investigation into all sterilization cases
 and for a formal apology and compensation.
 In 1993 the Prime Minister publicly acknowledged and apologized for the former
 Imperial Government's involvement in the army's practice of forcing an estimated
 200,000 women (including Koreans, Filipinos, Chinese, Indonesians, Burmese,
 Dutch, and Japanese) to provide sex to soldiers between 1932 and 1945. The Gov-
 ernment consistently has refused to pay government compensation to individual vic-
 tims, arguing that postwar treaties already have settled all war claims.
 The Asian Women's Fund (AWF) was established in 1995 as a private, govern-
 ment-sponsored fund to compensate former "comfort women." The AWF supports
 three types of projects: Providing direct compensation payeats to individual vic-
 tims; providing medical and welfare assistance to individual comfort women; and
 funding projects to improve the general status of women and girls in Asia. Projects
 in the first category are funded by private donations, the second and third types of
 
 
 projects are financed by the Government and administered by the AWF. As of Au-
 gust, the AWF had collected donations totaling approximately $4.24 million (500
 million yen) and given lump-sum payments of almost $16,949 (2 million yen) each
 and a letter of apology signed by the Prime Minister to more than 70 women mostly
 from the Philippines. These women also received medical and welfare assistance
 from the AWF. In July the AWF reached an agreement with a Dutch affiliate to
 start compensation payments to former Dutch comfort women. Government officials
 estimate that up to 100 Dutch women- were forced to provide sexual services during
 World War II.
 The Government's refusal to take more than "moral responsibility" and the AWF's
 role resulted in considerable criticism during the year. In February five Fili pino
 women who previously had accepted money from the AWF rejected letters of apology
 from the Prime Minister, as well as the offer of government-funded medical and wel-
 fare assistance, saying that the letters were not sincere unless accompanied by di-
 rect government compensation. In April the Yamaguchi District Court ordered the
 Government to pay $2,542 (300,000 yen) in state compensation to three Korean
 former comfort women for neglecting its constitutional duty to enact compensation
 legislation following the Government's 1993 admission. However, the Court denied
 the plaintiffs demand for an official government apology. This was the first court
 judgment rendered in favor of foreign war victims. Five other cases concerning
 former comfort women are-pending in Tokyo District Court. The plaintiffs are seek-
 ing $169,492 (20 million yen) each in damages and an official apology from the Gov-
 ernment. In May the South Korean Government made a lump-sum payment of
 $27,072 (35.6 milion won) to over 130 documented Korean victims on condition that
 they not receive redress from the AWF (although more than 10 of these victims ac-
 cepted AWF money afterwards). The South Korean program excluded the seven Ko-
 rean women who had -already received compensation from the AWF. In June the
 AWF project was suspended in South Korea. As of July, the Government was con-
 sidering shifting compensation payments in South Korea to other types of programs,
 such as constructing medical and welfare facilities in Korea. In August the U.N.
 Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities issued
 a report that included a recommendation that the Government provide state com-
 pensation to these women and prosecute those responsible for setting up and operat-
 ing "comfort stations" during World War II.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, and in
 general, the rights of children are adequately protected. Boys and girls have equal
 access to health care and other public facilities. Education is free and compulsory
 through the lower secondary level. Education is free and universally available at the
 upper secondary level through the age of 18.
 Despite heightened media attention and public expressions of disapproval, the
 Government and society in general appear to take a lenient attitude toward teenage
 prostitution and dating for money, which may or may not involve sexual activities.
 Sex with" those under 13 years of age is prohibited, but consensual sex with a 13-
 year-old is not-prosecutable under the Criminal Code. According to the law, in order
 to prove rape and forcible sexual contact with a minor age 13 -or over, the prosecu-
 tion must prove that the attacker threatened or used violence against the victim.
 Only prefectural government ordinances cover prostitution with minors over 13
 years of age. Under the present Prostitution Prevention Law, selling the sexual
 services of children is illegal, but purchasing those services is not. According to an
 April study conducted by the AWF, less than 50 percent of high school girls object
 to the idea of dating for money or presents, and 1 in 20 actually dates men for
 money. There is no law that directly prohibits the production and sale of child por-
 nography.
 In June the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Japa-
 nese children be protected from corporal punishment and bullying at school and
 from exposure to violence and pornography in the media and on the Internet. In Au-
 gust the Government revised the law regulating "adult" entertainment to require
 operators of pornographic home pages and suppliers of images to register with local
 safety commissions and to ban offering such pages to persons under age 18. The re-
 visions are to take effect on April 1, 1999.
 Under juvenile law, juvenile suspects are tried in family court and are not allowed
 a retrial. The National Police Agency reported in February that 152,825 minors
 were arrested in 1997 on suspicion of committing criminal offenses, over 13,000
 more than in 1996. A total of 17,981 minors were arrested for violent crimes, includ-
 ing murder, rape, and robbery, an increase of 15.5 percent from 1996 and account-
 ing for 44.5 percent of all violent crimes. In addition, the number of juvenile victims
 of violent crime also increased 23.3 percent overall. In May the director of the Na-
 tional Police Agency instructed local police officials nationwide to strengthen sup-
 
 
 945
 port programs to aid juvenile crime victims. Family court proceedings are not open
 to the public, a policy that has been criticized by family members of juvenile crime
 victims. Teachers also are increasingly becoming the targets of student violence.
 In recent years, the problem of severe bullying, or Wijime," has received greater
 public attention. At elementary and junior high schools, bullying most often involves
 verbal abuse, with physical abuse occurring more often at the high school level.
 However, because many cases go unreported, it is difficult to determine the exact
 number. According to a Management and Coordination Agency study released in
 April, one in three elementary and junior high school students has been bullied but
 more than one-third did not report the bullying to anyone. At least two teenage sui-
 cides that occurred in the spring were linked directly to bullying. Education experts
 suggest that pressures at home and school to excel academically may be contribut-
 ing to the increase in student violence and long-term (30 to 150 days) absenteeism,
 which rose for the sixth consecutive year in fiscal year 1997. In 1994 the Ministry
 of Justice established the Office of Ombudsman for Children's Rights to cope with
 bullying and other children's issues. In addition to compiling statistics on bullying
 and consulting with various groups concerned with children's welfare, the Office of
 Ombudsman provides counseling services for children 18 years of age and younger
 who have been victims of bullying.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings for
 the disabled, however, a 1994 law on construction standards for public facilities al-
 lows operators of hospitals, theaters, hotels, and similar enterprises to receive low-
 interest loans and tax breaks if they build wide entrances and elevators to accom-
 modate those with disabilities. There are an estimated 2.9 million physically dis-
 abled and roughly 2 million mentally disabled persons in Japan. Although not gen-
 erally subject to overt discrimination in employment, education, or in the provision
 of other state services, the disabled face limited access to public transportation,
 "mainstream" public education, and other facilities. Under civil law, persons with
 hearing problems or speech impediments cannot create valid wills because they can-
 not "convey orally" to a notary the contents of a will, or affirm that the text the
 notary reads back to them is correct. In May the Ministry of Health decided not to
 set standards for dogs and for trainers of dogs for the disabled or to subsidize the
 activities of dog training organizations, stating the efficacy of such dogs was clear.
 The Deliberation Panel on the Employment of the Handicapped operates within
 the Ministry of Labor. Since 1976 private companies with 300 or more employees
 have been required to hire a fixed proportion of disabled persons. The penalty for
 noncompliance is a fine. A cabinet directive, effective on July 1, ordered private com-
 panies to raise the proportion of physically disabled persons in their work force from
 1.6 to 1.8 percent, and raised the percentage of disabled persons among civil serv-
 ants from 2 to 2.1 percent. However, there is evidence that only half of the nation's
 eligible companies comply with the law, and, as of September, an estimated 1 in
 12 disabled persons had lost jobs during the previous year.
 An amendment to the Law to Promote the Employment of the Handicapped to in-
 clude the mentally disabled took effect on July 1. The amendment also loosened the
 licensing requirements for community support centers which promote employment
 for the disabled, and it introduced government subsidies for the employment of men-
 tally disabled persons in part-time jobs. In 1997 a former factory owner in Ibaraki
 prefecture who had received generous government subsidies was sentenced to 3
 years' imprisonment for physically abusing mentally disabled workers at his plant
 and for withholding portions of their salaries. Also in 1997, a rehabilitation facility
 for the mentally disabled was closed after its operator and employees were accused
 of using corporal punishment and sexually abusing disabled residents.
 In 1995 the Headquarters for Promoting the Welfare of Disabled Persons, set up
 by the Prime Minister's Office, issued a directive to the nation's municipalities to
 draw up formal plans for care of disabled citizens by the end of March 1997. In 1996
 the Ministry of Health and Welfare also instructed local governments to set numeri-
 cal targets for the number of home help providers and care facilities allocated to
 the disabled. However, according to newspaper reports, less than one-fifth of the na-
 tion's municipalities currently have formal care plans for disabled citizens.
 Indigenous People.-The Ainu are a people descended from the first inhabitants
 of Japan. The Ainu Association of Hokkaido estimates the total number of Ainu at
 50,000, less than 0.05 percent of the country's 124 million population. Almost all live
 on Hokkaido, the northernmost of the country's four main islands. Their primary
 occupations are fishing, small-scale farming, and jobs in the tourism industry.
 Under an 1899 law, the Government pursued a policy of forced assimilation, impos-
 ing mandatory Japanese education and denying the Ainu their right to continue tra-
 ditional practices. The law also left the Ainu with control of only approximately 0.15
 percent of their original land holdings.
 
 
 In 1993 two Ainu filed a suit against the Government, challenging its right to ex-
 propriate their land, which the Ainu consider sacred, to build a dam. In 1997 the
 Sapporo District Court ruled that the Government had illegally expropriated the
 land but did not order the Government to return the land to the plaintiffs because
 the dam had already been completed. However, the Court ruled that the Ainu were
 a minority aboriginal race.
 Ainu Diet member Shigeru Kayano was instrumental in the Diet's passage of the
 Law To Promote Ainu Culture and Disseminate Knowledge of Ainu Traditions in
 1997. The law officially recognized the Ainu as an ethnic minority and required all
 prefectural governments to develop basic programs for promoting Ainu culture and
 traditions. It canceled a series of previous laws that discriminated against the Ainu
 including the 1899 law. With the new law, the Government for the first time ac-
 knowledged the existence of an ethnic minority in the country. However, the law
 stopped short of recognizing the Ainu as the indigenous eople of Hokkaido, and
 also failed to address whether they deserved special rights as a distinct ethnic
 group. The new law did not mandate civil rights protection for the Ainu. A non-
 binding accompanying resolution referred to the Ainu as a legal Japanese minority.
 In July a report submitted by the U.N. Special Rapporteur to the 16th U.N. Work-
 ing Group on Indigenous Populations said that the Ainu had never entered into a
 consensual juridical relation with any state, and stated that the lack of such an
 agreement deprived them of their rights. Many Ainu criticize the Law to Promote
 Ainu Culture for not advancing Ainu political rights and criticize the Government
 for not providing funds for noncultural activities that would improve Ainu living
 conditions or financial status.
 The Ainu continue to face societal discrimination while engaging in an uphill
 struggle against complete assimilation. An Ainu-language newspaper was estab-
 lished in 1997. In April a local Hokkaido radio station began broadcasting a weekly
 15-minute Ainu-language program. In July the Japan Ainu Association, a nation-
 wide organization of Ainu, was established to lobby the Government for economic
 assistance and greater social welfare benefits for Ainu throughout the country.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of iso-
 lation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 fessions such as butchering and undertaking), although not subject to governmental
 discrimination, are frequently victims of entrenched societal discrimination, includ-
 ing restricted access to housingand employment opportunities. They are estimated
 to number approximately 3 million, but most prefer to hide their identity. Beginning
 in 1969, the Government introduced with some success a number of social, eco-
 nomic, and legal programs designed to improve conditions for the Burakumin and
 hasten their assimilation into mainstream society. In recent years, however, some
 within the Burakumin community have questioned whether assimilation is an ap-
 propriate goal. When the basic legislation to provide funding for Burakumin pro-
 grams expired in 1997, the Government enacted legislation effective for 5 years that
 retains 15 of the original 45 programs for Burakumin communities. One of these
 programs is aimed at completing housing plans already in progress.
 In 1997 the Buraku Liberation League rewrote its manifesto for the first time in
 13 years, placing less emphasis on class struggle and more emphasis on civil rights,
 social welfare, and the environment. The new platform also replaced the term
 Burakumin (hamlet people) with Buraku Jumin (hamlet residents), to try to debunk
 the false concept that these people are a different race from other Japanese. The
 platform was adopted at a national convention.
 According to the Ministry of Justice, there were over 1.4 million legal foreign resi-
 dents as of December 31, 1997, accounting for 1.18 percent of the nation's popu-
 lation. Of these approximately 645,400 were ethnic Koreans, followed by 252,200
 Chinese, and 233,300 Brazilians. The number of Korean residents has been decreas-
 ing steadily as Korean nationals naturalize or marry Japanese which allows their
 children to gain Japanese citizenship automatically. Despite improvements in legal
 safeguards against discrimination, Korean permanent residents (most of whom were
 born, raised, and educated in Japan) are still subject to various forms of deeply en-
 trenched societal discrimination. In July the Osaka High Court, overturning a deci-
 sion of the Osaka District Court, ordered a condominium owner to pay monetary
 damages to a Korean family because the owner had instructed the family not to tell
 its neighbors that they were Korean residents and not to go around the condomin-
 ium grounds wearing traditional Korean clothes.
 By law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for naturalization
 and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to vote.
 
 
 947
 In practice, however, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, in part
 due to fears that their cultural identity would thereby be lost. De facto obstacles
 to naturalization include broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and
 great emphasis on Japanese language ability. Naturalization procedures also re-
 quire an extensive background check, including inquiries into the applicant's eco-
 nomic status and assimilation into Japanese society. A Korean may also be required
 to adopt a Japanese surname. According to press reports, many applications are
 routinely turned down. The Government defends its naturalization procedures as
 being necessary to ensure the smooth assimilation of foreigners into Japanese soci-
 ety. Alien permanent residents may live abroad up to 5 years without losing their
 right to permanent residence.
 In 1995 the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not bar permanent
 foreign residents from voting in local elections. However, the Court also ruled that
 existing laws denying voting rights to foreign residents are not unconstitutional. In
 recent years, several local governments have expressed support for foreign residents'
 right to vote, but others have passed resolutions against foreign resident suffrage.
 In June the Gifu District Court dismissed a damages suit fied by nine Korean resi-
 dents who were barred from voting in a local plebiscite because they were not citi-
 zens. Foreign residents also are barred from running in national elections. In March
 the Supreme Court dismissed a suit filed by 11 Korean residents who had not been
 allowed to run in the 1992 House of Councilors election. All 11 had been born and
 raised in Japan, but the Supreme Court ruled that the right to run in a Diet elec-
 tion did not apply to foreigners. In June local election authorities in Koichi prefec-
 ture rejected the application of a third-generation Korean born in Japan to run in
 the July House of Couciors election on the grounds that he lacked a Japanese fam-
 ily register. Similar applications have been rejected previously by Hokkaido, Tokyo,
 Osaka, and Okinawa prefectures.
 According to a survey by a Korean group, 30 of the 57 prefectural and municipal
 universities and 220 of the 431 private universities allow Korean senior high school
 graduates to take their entrance exams, provided that the students first take a col-
 e  trance qualification test. However, under the School Education Law, students
 attending Chinese, Korean, or other non-Japanese schools are not eligible to take
 national university examinations. Although a number of local governments provide
 subsidies to Korean schools, the central Government does not. In February the
 Japan Federation of Bar Associations urged the Government to change its policy.
 Recently some private national universities and graduate schools and at least one
 public national university have defied the Education Ministry by admitting foreign-
 school students.
 In 1993 the Government halted the fingerprinting of permanent foreign residents.
 Instead of fingerprinting, the Government has established a family registry system
 that uses the resident's picture and signature and contains information on parents
 and spouses living in the country, a system similar to that used for Japanese na-
 tionals. The current law leaves intact the requirement that all foreign residents
 carry alien registration certificates at all times. In March the Osaka District Court
 ordered the prefectural governments of Osaka, Hiroshima, and Kanagawa to pay
 compensatory damages to six foreign residents after ruling that they had been ar-
 rested unjustly and detained after refusing to be fingerprinted between 1982 and
 1985. In May the Osaka District Court rejected a request by 10 foreign residents
 that fingerprints they provided under the Alien Registration Act no longer be kept
 on ifie and denied their claim to damages.
 In 1953 the Government decreed that public servants with administrative author-
 ity and the ability to influence public opinion must be Japanese. Noncitizens were
 prohibited from taking examinations for local government positions. Nevertheless,
 some municipal governments began lifting restrictions on noncitizen civil servants.
 In 1996 the Home Affairs Ministry reversed the long-held national policy of opposi-
 tion to localities lifting the nationality clause and instructed local governments to
 decide at their own discretion. However, the Ministry instructed local governments
 to restrict noncitizens' access to jobs that involved the exercise of public authority
 and formation of public intent. The directive also required local governments to
 clearly state which jobs were closed to noncitizens. Some of the jobs considered off
 limits include tax collection, construction permit issuance, sanitation inspection, and
 fire fightin.
 Several local governments have already changed their rules in response to the
 Government's new position. In 1997 the cities of Kawasaki, Yokohama, Osaka,
 Kobe, and Hisai, and Kanagawa and Koichi Prefectures opened many jobs to non-
 citizens, and in June 1997 noncitizens took the employment exams for these cities
 and prefectural governments for the first time. The Osaka municipal government in-
 troduced new guidelines allowing noncitizens with permanent residency to engage
 
 
 in jobs in 276 fields, including public relations, engineering, and social welfare serv-
 ices. Under the new guidelines, noncitizens can be promoted to section chief or high-
 er within the specified fields. In June the Hakodate municipal government an-
 nounced that in fiscal year 1999 it would allow foreign residents to take employ-
 ment tests for all city jobs except firefighters. According to a 1997 joint survey con-
 ducted by the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers Union and the Korean
 Residents Association in Japan, 20 percent of local governments still forbid the hir-
 ing of noncitizens.
 Critics complain that opening some but not all jobs to noncitizens perpetuates in-
 stitutional discrimination and the perception that noncitizen residents cannot be
 trusted to act in the community's best interest. The system also allows each local
 government to develop it own rules without uniformity being imposed by the na-
 tional government. -
 The Immigration Bureau of the -Justice Ministry estimated that, as of January 1,
 there were 276,810 foreign nationals residing illegally in the country, a decrease of
 2.2 percent from the previous year. Illegal immigrants come primarily from: South
 Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, China, Peru, Iran, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
 While many illegally resident foreigners came in-search of better paying manufac-
 turing and construction jobs, these opportunities decreased during the economic
 slowdown. Thus, more of the foreign workers are unemployed or marginally em-
 ployed. Activist groups claim that employers can exploit or discriminate against for-
 eign workers, who often have little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or
 their legal rights. The Government attempts to deal with the problem of illegal
 workers within the bounds of existing law. It has tried to reduce the inflow of illegal
 foreign- workers by prosecuting employers. Recent revisions of the Immigration Law
 provide for penalties against employers of undocumented foreign workers. Suspected
 foreign workers may also be denied entry for passport, visa, and entry application
 irregularities. The Government continues to study the foreign worker issue, and sev-
 eral citizens' groups are working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access
 to information on worker rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to associate freely in unions. Almost 12.3 million workers, 22.6 percent of all em-
 ployees, belong to labor unions. Unions are free of government control and influence.
 Most unions are involved in political activity as well as labor relations, but they are
 not controlled by political parties. RENGO, which represents 7.8 million workers
 and was formed in 1989 through the merger of several confederations, is the largest
 labor organization. There is no requirement for a single trade union structure, and
 there are no restrictions on who may be a union official. Members of the armed
 forces, police, and firefighters are not permitted either to form unions or to strike.
 These restrictions have led to a long-running dispute before the International Labor
 Organization's (ILO) Committee on the Application of Conventions and Rec-
 ommendations over observance of ILO Convention 98 concerning the right to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively. The Committee has observed that these public employ-
 ees have a limited capacity to participate in the process of determining their wages
 and has asked the Government to consider any measures it could take to encourage
 negotiations with public employees.
 The right to strike, implicit in the Constitution, is exercised. During 1997, 110,000
 workdays involving 47,000 employees were lost to strikes. The law prohibits retribu-
 tion against strikers and is effectively enforced. Public employees do not have the
 right to strike, although they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration.
 Unions are free to affiiate internationally and are active in international bodies,
 most notably the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and mantain
 extensive international contacts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides
 unions with the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights are ex-
 ercised freely, and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual "Spring
 Wage Offensive," in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their finms, involves nationwide participation. Management
 usually consults closely with its enterprise union. However, trade unions are inde-
 pendent of management and aggressively pursue the interests of their workers. The
 law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and adequate mechanisms exist for resolving
 such cases as do occur, including the reinstatement with back wages of any workers
 fired for union activities. However, the collective bargaining rights of public employ-
 ees are limited. The Government determines the pay of government employees
 based on a recommendation by the independent National Personnel Authority.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be held in bondage of any kind. Involuntary servitude, except as pun-
 ishment for crime, is prohibited. The le al rohibition against forced or compulsory
 labor apples equally to adults and to children, and there are presently no known
 cases of forced or bonded labor.
 Before and during World War II the Government conscripted both Chinese and
 Korean workers who were forced to work in Japanese factories and mines. This
 practice ended in 1948 when the last of these workers was returned home. Survivors
 and families of these workers continue to press claims for damages and compensa-
 tions for their forced labor, both in Japanese civil courts and in complaints to the
 ILO. In 1997 the Nippon Steel Corporation reached an out-of-court settlement with
 the families of 11 Koreans who had performed forced labor in 1 of the company's
 mines. However, this is the only reported payment by a Japanese firm for using
 forced labor during the war. In more than 20 rulings, the courts have developed a
 pattern of dismissing the suits. In most cases, the judges rule that the 20-year stat-
 ute of limitations for civil claims had expired. In other cases the courts acknowl-
 edged that the plaintiffs suffered injuries from their forced labor but ruled that
 damages need not be paid because of the extraordinary circumstances of war.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution bans the exploitation of children. Both societal values and the rigorous en-
 forcement of the Labor Standards Law protect children from exploitation in the
 workplace. The Government prohibits forced or bonded child labor and enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 Child labor is virtually nonexistent. By law, children under the age of 15 may not
 be employed and those under age 18 may not be employed in dangerous or harmful
 jobs. The Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor, which vigorously en-
 forces the Labor Standards Law, reports no violations. Society places an extremely
 high value on education, which is compulsory through the lower secondary (ninth
 grade) level. Enrollment levels for both boys and girls through the free and univer-
 sally available upper secondary level (age 18) exceed 95 percent.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set on a regional (prefec-
 tural) and industry basis, with the input of tripartite (workers, employers, public
 interest) advisory councils. Employers covered by a minimum wage must post the
 concerned minimum wages, and compliance with minimum wages is considered
 widespread. Minimum wage rates, effective from September 1, ranged from $40
 (5,465 yen) per day in Tokyo and Osaka to $35 (4,712 yen) in Miyazaki prefecture
 and are considered sufficient to provide workers and their families with a decent
 living. The Labor Standards Lawprovides for a 40-hour workweek for most indus-
 tries and mandates premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a week, or 8 in a day.
 However, labor unions frequently criticize the Government for failing to enforce
 maximum working, hnur rt;nilations in smqa11r firms'
 The Ministry of Labor efectively administers various laws and regulations gov-
 erning occupational health and safety, principal among which is the 1972 Industrial
 Safety and Health Law. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued after
 consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Tripartite
 Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to suspend un-
 safe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice concerns
 over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working conditions
 without jeopardizing their continued employment.
