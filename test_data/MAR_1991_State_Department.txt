 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a pluralistic
 political system and a parliamentary form of government with an
 independent judiciary. In practice, however, ultimate
 authority rests with the King who appoints and dismisses the
 Prime Minister and cabinet members and who may dissolve the
 Parliament (which has very limited authority) and rule by
 decree. Past elections to Parliament and municipal councils
 have not been free of government manipulation.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, operating within a
 framework of written legal provisions designed to maintain
 public order. The Direction de La Surveillance du Territoire
 (DST), Surete Nationale, auxiliary forces, *and judicial police
 are under the supervision of the Minister of the Interior,
 while the Gendarmerie Royale, though paramilitary, reports
 directly to the palace. Security forces continued to commit
 human rights abuses, including torture.
 In Morocco's free enterprise economy, about 40 percent of the
 work force is engaged in agriculture, which provides about 16
 percent of the gross domestic product. Since the early 1980's,
 Morocco has actively pursued a program of economic reform and
 liberalization, which has recently helped spur growth and
 investment, particularly in light industry. Total employment
 has been increasing,' but not enough to offset the rapid growth
 of the work force.
 There was a marked improvement in the human rights situation in
 1991, although serious problems remained. In a series of
 releases during the year, the Government freed from prison or
 house arrest an estimated 5,000 prisoners, among them 400 to
 500 political prisoners or other prisoners of conscience, some
 of whom had been in detention for many years, and the military
 detention facility at Tazmamart was reliably reported to have
 been closed and possibly razed. Among those freed were an
 estimated 300 Sahrawis (Western Sahara natives) who were
 granted amnesty by the King. The King also endorsed the
 December 1990 recommendations of his Consultative Council on
 Human Rights (CCDH), aimed, inter alia, at improving prison
 conditibns, increasing cooperation with international
 organizations on human rights matters, and tightening oversight
 of incommunicado detention, and the Parliament enacted the
 recommendations into law. By'the end of 1991, however, the
 King had not promulgated the new laws by decree, as required
 under the Constitution to give the laws effect.
 Nevertheless, there were still widspread abuses and important
 restrictions on basic human rights. Credible reports persisted
 of torture and police brutality, although on a somewhat reduced
 scale. There were also a few reports of government efforts to
 punish perpetrators; in February two officials in Marrakech
 were sentenced to 5 and 15 years' imprisonment respectively for
 the death of a prisoner in detention, and in November six
 officials were arrested in Casablanca for involvement in the
 death of a detainee.  Other principal problems included
 arbitrary arrest and detention, lack of fair trial in political
 and security cases, lack of an independent judiciary, and
 restrictions on the freedoms of speech and press, assembly and
 association, religion, travel, the right of citizens to change
 their government, and women's rights.

 MOROCCO
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were a number of credible reports of death in police
 custody in 1991, the most publicized of which was the death in
 October of'a Casablanca street vendor seized by the police
 during a routine raid. The vendor's death generated so much
 press attention that an initial autopsy showing death from
 natural causes was withdrawn and a new autopsy ordered by the
 prosecutor. On the basis of the second autopsy, six police
 officials were arrested and charged with crimes relating to the
 death. The officials' trial was pending at the end of the
 year. Other reliable reports of deaths in police custody
 included one in which an asthmatic detainee died, allegedly
 after being deprived of medicine by the police, and a number of
 "suicides" labeled as homicides by the detainees' family
 members.
 In riots in Fez and elsewhere in December 1990, security forces,
 used lethal force to restore order after at least one policeman
 had been killed. A number of other persons were killed. A
 government commission of inquiry led by the Secretary General
 of the CCDH and the President of the Supreme Court investigated
 the facts and causes of the violence. At the same time, the
 "nongovernmental, nonpartisan Moroccan Human Rights Organization
 (OMDH) assembled an investigatory committee of its own, as did
 members of Parliament at the Government's request. The OMDH
 committee subsequently abandoned its effort, citing a lack of
 official cooperation. The Government and parliamentary
 commissions presented their reports to the King at the end of
 December, but the reports were not immediately published.
 According to reliable reports, the parliamentary commission's
 report set the number of dead as a result of the violence at
 58, with several hundred injured, although nongovernmental
 observers continued to charge that the number killed was far
 higher. The report also recommended that the King pardon those
 with no previous criminal record among the hundreds convicted
 of participating in the violence.
 b. .Disappearance
 There were no reported permanent disappearances in 1991.
 Temporary "disappearances" continue to result from the practice
 of holding persons in pretrial incommunicado detention, without
 notifying families or attorneys, for longer than the legal
 limit of 48 hours.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution contains no specific guarantee against torture
 or abuse at the hands of government officials. Credible
 reports of torture and degrading treatment persisted, but with
 less frequency than in previous years. Detainees suspected
 both of politically related crimes and of criminal offenses
 were involved. Torture and other forms of cruel treatment
 continued to occur, most often during the initial period of
 incommunicado detention following arrest in order to extract
 confessions which were then used to convict the suspect.
 Methods of torture are said to include beatings, sleep
 
 
 1511
 MOROCCO
 deprivation, keeping prisoners blindfolded and handcuffed for
 weeks on end, and keeping prisoners naked and alone in dark
 punishment cells. Harsh treatment reportedly continues after
 conviction, when prisoners are subjected to random violence by
 guards and deliberately deprived of family visits, sleep,
 baths, blankets, medical care, and wholesome food. For
 criminal offenders, mistreatment often resulted from extreme
 overcrowding in decrepit prison facilities, although criminal
 offenders also suffer many of the hardships experienced by
 political prisoners.
 There was increased press coverage both of reports of torture
 and abuse of authority and of investigation and corrective
 action in such cases. In February two local officials in the
 Marrakech area and the brother of one of the officials were
 sentenced to prison terms ranging from 5 to 15 years for the
 torture death of a prisoner in-detention. Also in February, a
 regional official was suspended by the Ministry of Interior
 after residents of his area petitioned the Government,
 complaining of abuses committed by him and his subordinates.
 Local newspapers also published with increasing frequency
 complaints of prisoners concerning harsh treatment and
 degrading prison conditions. The Ministry of Justice opened
 two new prisons in 1991 in Casablanca and Sale, which replaced
 existing colonial-era prisons noted for their poor conditions
 and overcrowding. 'The Ministry also continued to report that
 it was devoting a substantial portion of its budget to prison
 construction. The recommendations of the CCDH, adopted into
 law in April, also stressed the need for prison reform, more
 frequent inspection of health and food standards in prisons,
 and expansion of prison facilities.
 The detention facility in the military fortress at Tazmamart
 was closed and perhaps destroyed. Since the Moroccan
 aithorities have never acknowledged the existence of a prison
 at Tazmamart, however, official verification of the closure was
 unlikely. All but 5 of the 31 surviving Tazmamart prisoners,
 28 of whom were convicted of participation in the 1971 or 1972
 coup attempts against King Hassan II, were reportedly released
 in September and October. Following his release, one prisoner,
 M'Warek Touil, sought to leave Morocco to join his American
 citizen wife and son in the United States. The Moroccan
 Government finally granted him a passport and permitted him to
 depart in January 1992. Two of the five remaining prisoners
 had their life sentences commuted to 30 years and were
 transferred to Kenitra prison. One was reported to be in
 continuing bad health, and the Government refused to'release
 him despite appeals from human rights organizations. The three
 other prisoners transferred to Kenitra--the Bourequat brothers,
 who were not involved in either coup attempt and who were never
 tried or convicted of any crime--were held until late December,
 when they were released. At the time of their release, they
 were said to be in good health despite earlier reports that one
 was seriously ill and another suffering from a mental
 breakdown. Other released prisoners were reportedly suffering
 serious and sometimes permanent health problems, and many
 complained of ongoing government intimidation and monitoring of
 their activities.
 There were also credible reports that the interrogation
 facility Derb Moulay Cherif in Casablanca, allegedly a site of
 torture, ceased to be used as an interrogation center because
 of the attention it had received from international'human
 rights groups.
 
 
 1512
 MOROCCO
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government often ignores guarantees of procedural due
 process. Moroccan law requires that a detainee be brought
 before a judge within 48 hours of detention (extendable to 96
 hours upon approval of the prosecutor) and informed of the
 charges against him. Incommunicado (garde a vue) detention was
 shortened to 48 hours, plus a one-time 24-hour extension if
 requested by the prosecutor, under the CCDH reforms adopted by
 Parliament in April. The CCDH recommendations provided for
 expanded court and prosecutorial oversight, various efforts to
 speed initial hearings, right of access to an attorney during
 detention, and autopsy in cases of prisoner death. By the end.
 of the year, however, the King had not promulgated the new laws
 by decree, as is required by the Constitution to maKe the laws
 effective. Prosecutors and police, especially in the larger
 cities, began voluntarily to implement the reforms, but the
 implementation was slow and not uniform. The Minister of
 Interior announced in December that, on instructions from the
 King, his Ministry had formed an Office of Public Liberties to
 oversee and advise local and regional governments on human
 rights matters.
 Arrests usually take place in public view, but police sometimes
 refuse to identify themselves, and warrants are not always
 used. Moroccan law requires that a lawyer be present after the
 detainee's first appearance in court. Morocco does not have an
 extensive system of bail, although defendants are sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. The system of bail was
 expanded by Parliament in December beyond its traditional
 narrow limits, but the King did not promulgate the new law
 before year's end. Moroccan law does not provide for habeas
 corpus or its equivalent. Under a separate code-of military
 justice, military personnel have been detained without warrants
 or public trial. No such instances were reported in 1991.
 A number of political prisoners were released from confinement
 during the year. In March King Hassan pardoned and released
 from house arrest the family of General Oufkir, the purported
 leader of a 1972 coup attempt against the King. The family had
 been imprisoned or under house arrest since 1972 (see Section
 2.d.). In August the King pardoned 40 Moroccan prisoners,
 including many of the "group of 26" imprisoned since 1985. In
 September the Government released and expelled Abraham Serfaty,
 frequently characterized by international human rights
 organizations as "Africa's longest serving political
 prisoner." As noted earlier, King Hassan granted a general
 amnesty to an estimated 300 or more Sahrawi prisoners who had
 been detained during military operations or because of their
 alleged cooperation with the Polisario. Those freed included
 Sahrawis who disappeared in the mid-1970's. While the
 Government asserted after the releases that no Sahrawis
 remained in detention, according to one human rights group
 those released were part of a larger group of over 800 Sahrawis
 in detention. The Government did not respond officially to
 requests for information on these other persons presumably
 still in detention. A member of the CCDH indicated to the
 press, however, that the list of 800 included the names of some
 persons no longer in custody.
 There are no known instances of Moroccans being sentenced to
 exile. There are, nonetheless, a number of political activists
 who remain abroad, mostly in France, Belgium, and Switzerland,
 
 
 1513
 MOROCCO
 rather than risk arrest on their return to Morocco.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Morocco has a dual legal system: a secular system based in
 part on French legal tradition and a parallel Islamic system
 which adjudicates family matters and inheritance law for
 Moroccan Muslims. The secular system includes courts of
 original jurisdiction, appellate courts, and a Supreme Court.
 Those accused of political and security offenses are tried in
 the regular secular courts.
 In general, cases are brought before an initial review
 court--the Court of First Instance--which may call for a
 hearing quickly to bring cases to trial. The detainee is
 informed of charges and questioned by the judge to decide if
 they have merit. If the infraction is minor, the judge may
 release the detainee or impose a light sentence. If a lengthy
 investigation is required, the judge may release detainees on
 their own recognizance. In cases of political crimes,
 detainees are often held for long periods before trial. There
 are credible reports of detainees convicted on the basis of
 forced confessions extracted under duress. The court system is
 overly dependent on confessions, so that the authorities are
 motivated to apply sufficient pressure on the detainee to
 extract a statement assuring his conviction.
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered
 susceptible to political intervention and control when a case
 involves challenges to royal authority or state policy, and
 those accused of such crimes often do not enjoy the procedural
 sageguards needed to ensure a fair trial. Human rights groups
 often provide legal counsel for defendants in such cases. In
 criminal cases defendants often receive only cursory hearings,
 and judges depend on police reports to decide cases. Although
 the State provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes (when the alleged offense carries a sentence of over 5
 years), appointed attorneys often provide inadequate
 representation. For lesser crimes, needy defendants usually
 are not represented by counsel.
 Following the riots in December 1990, the Government used group
 arrests and group trials against alleged participants, raising
 charges that this violated legal codes against collective
 responsibility and might not result in fair trials. Some
 members of the CCDH called on the Government to suspend the
 trials pending the completion of an investigation by the
 commission of inquiry, but the trials continued. Standard due
 process protections were not observed during the trials.
 Approximately 850 defendants reportedly were tried, most in
 groups ranging in size from 4 to 85. Defendants were not
 grouped according to the offense charged. Moroccan newspapers
 and human rights organizations charged that defense attorneys
 were not given sufficient time to prepare their cases, that
 some defendants bore physical signs of having been tortured
 prior to trial, and that the trials were conducted with undue
 haste. In addition to the defendants charged with violent acts
 committed in the course of the riots, a number of labor and
 opposition party activists were subsequently detained for
 questioning concerning their involvement, though they were all
 eventually released or acquitted. The majority of the
 defendants arrested for violent acts were found guilty and were
 given sentences ranging from a few months to 15 years. In some
 cases, the maximum sentence was doubled, as permitted by
 
 
 1514
 MOROCCO
 Moroccan law, because of the defendant's status (e.g., a public
 employee). On appeal, most of the guilty verdicts were upheld.
 Human rights organizations believe that there are between 150
 and.300 political prisoners in Morocco (not including
 Sahrawis), but the Government denies holding any. Since the
 Government defines several categories of speech as criminal
 (see Section 2.a.), it regards many who describe themselves as
 political prisoners to be common criminals. This practice has
 resulted in the anomaly of the Government taking credit for
 releasing prisoners of a category it simultaneously denies
 exists. At the end of 1991 the OMDH was preparing to publish a
 list of political prisoners that reportedly contained
 approximately 180 names, which is believed to be the best
 estirate of the number of.political prisoners in Morocco at the
 end of 1991. The figure does not include Sahrawis held in
 Morocco or the Western Sahara. The OMDH is forbidden by the
 Government to have contacts with the Polisario or other Sahrawi
 groups and is consequently unable to estimate the number of
 Sahrawi detainees. All three Moroccan human rights groups have
 called for a general amnesty for political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no
 search or investigation may take place without a search warrant
 issued in compliance with the law. Current law stipulates that
 a search warrant be issued by a prosecutor-on good cause. This
 stipulation is not always observed, however, and there are
 continued reports of illegal searches of the homes and offices
 of suspected political activists. Government security services
 selectively monitor certain persons and organizations, both
 foreign and Moroccan, including their telephones and mail. The
 university campuses are under close surveillance, and an
 extensive informant system exists, especially on the campuses
 and in the cities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, but by
 Moroccan law and tradition there are three forbidden topics:
 the monarchy, Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara, and the
 sanctity of Islam. The King reiterated in an interview with
 French journalists in July that to'state that the Western
 Sahara is not Moroccan is a crime against state security.  In
 addition, many Moroccans censor themselves when criticizing
 government policies, foreign and domestic, for fear of
 government reprisal.
 Press freedom is limited, though the limits are not clearly
 defined. Under a 1958 decree, the Government controls the
 licensing of newspapers and journals through a registration
 procedure. In practice, the requirement of registration is
 used, both by central and regional authorities, to prevent
 publications by organizations or persons considered to be
 "suspect," for example, those who advocate the overthrow of the
 monarchy. Publications that do not conform to the procedure or
 are deemed to be a threat to state security may be seized and
 destroyed. During 1991 the Government forbade the distribution
 of editions of several Moroccan and foreign publications.
 
 
 1515
 MOROCCO
 The Arabic-language monthly Assabil had its third issue blocked
 after the first two carried articles supporting the release
 from house arrest of a prominent Islamist. Further publication
 of an Islamist newspaper, Majmaa al Bahrain, in Tangier was
 banned in May, and publication of the weekly El-Mouaten, whose
 editors reportedly included former political prisoners, was
 blocked after its initial issues appeared in June. The July 9
 issue of Jeune Afrique was delayed, apparently for coverage
 viewed by the Government as sympathetic to Moumen Diouri, a
 Moroccan national expelled from France to Gabon and later
 allowed to return to France. The issue was allowed to appear
 after the July 16 issue contained an article more critical of
 Diouri. The Government does tolerate satirical and often
 stinging editorials in the opposition parties' dailies. In
 addition, there was increased press coverage both of reports of
 prisoner torture and abuse of authority and of investigation
 and corrective action in such cases. Local newspapers also
 published with increasing frequency complaints of prisoners
 concerning harsh treatment and degrading prison conditions. In
 December a number of pro-Islamist newspapers appeared,
 evidently with government permission, and were widely
 available, suggesting a relaxation of earlier controls on such
 publications. Self-censorship by the press is assisted by the
 Interior and Information Ministry's practice of offering
 "guidance" on certain topics.
 .None of the news media is entirely independent of government
 control, which is exercised through government subsidies as
 well as directives from the Ministry of Interior and
 Information. The Government owns the official press agency
 Maghreb Arab Press, the Arabic daily Al Anbaa, the only
 television station available nationwide, and one radio
 station. The Moroccan public has access to a wide variety of
 foreign newspapers and magazines, particularly from Europe and
 the United States, which reflect a broad spectrum of opinion.
 Occasionally, an issue of a foreign publication will be banned
 when it has an article about Morocco that authorities consider
 particularly offensive. For example, after King Hassan's July
 interview with French journalists, the Ministry of Interior and
 Information reportedly blocked the distribution of an issue of
 the French newspaper Liberation because it was considered
 insulting to the King. The Government stopped retransmitting
 TV-5 from France in November 1990 after it broadcast an
 interview with Gilles Perrault, author of a book highly
 critical of King Hassan that is banne in Morocco. Despite
 suggestions from the Government that transmission would begin
 again, it had not done so by year's end.
 Academic freedom is limited. There are strictures against
 scholarly investigation of the monarchy and Islam, although
 there continues to be limited research and publishing on Islam
 and Islamic fundamentalism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of assembly and
 association. These rights, however, are limited by three
 decrees dating from 1935, 1939, and 1958 which permit the
 Government to suppress even peaceful demonstrations and mass
 gatherings. The Government allowed a large, peaceful
 demonstration in Rabat in February in support of Iraq, but
 suppressed other proposed similar demonstrations. In December
 the local authorities in Casablanca broke up a regular meeting
 of the OMDH for the first time since 1988, claiming that the
 
 
 1516
 MOROCCO
 group had not followed established procedure for obtaining
 permission to hold a public meeting.
 The right to form organizations-is also limited. Under a 1958
 decree, persons wishing to create an organization must apply to
 the Ministry of Interior and wait for approval before holding
 meetings. In practice, the Government uses the requirement to
 prevent persons considered "suspect" or who advocate
 replacement of the monarchy from forming approved
 organizations. Islamist and leftist groups had the greatest
 difficulty in obtaining official sanction. The Government also
 interferes with association on an individual level. After the
 June visit to Morocco of Christine Serfaty, a French human
 rights activist and wife of Abraham Serfaty (see Section 2.d.),
 the Ministry of Interior distributed to Moroccan political
 parties a blacklist containing the names of Moroccans who had
 been contacted by foreign human rights activists. The Ministry
 indicated to the parties that the listed persons should not be
 trusted with sensitive information. Morocco has at least 10
 legal political parties, 9 of which have seats in the
 Parliament. Political parties must be approved by the Ministry
 of Interior.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Morocco, 99 percent of
 Moroccans are Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title
 "Commander of the Faithful." The Moroccan Jewish community of
 approximately 7,000 is permitted to practice its faith, as are
 Christians. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of
 worship, only the practice of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism
 is tolerated in keeping with Islamic law and tradition. The
 King has stated that all religions other than these three
 revealed religions (Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) are
 heresies. The Baha'i community (150-200 people) has been
 forbidden to meet or hold communal activities since 1983.
 Attempting to convert a Moroccan to any faith other than Islam
 is punishable by imprisonment. According to Islamic law and
 tradition, conversion of any kind from Islam is strictly
 prohibited. Moroccan Jews may convert to Islam, but they are
 not actively encouraged to do so.
 The Government monitors Friday mosque sermons and the
 curriculum of Koranic schools to insure that approved doctrines
 are taught. Fundamentalist Islamic activities are sometimes
 subjected to official crackdown, but are largely tolerated so
 long as they remain restricted to the propagation of Islam and
 education and charitable activities. Fundamentalist groups
 that question the King's status as Commander of the Faithful
 and those that engage in violence are suppressed. Members of
 the Islamic organization, Justice and Charity, arrested and
 tried in 1990, remained in prison in 1991, hut there were
 confirmed reports that they were released in early January
 1992.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Morocco is unrestricted. In the
 Western Sahara, which is administered by Morocco, movement is
 restricted in areas regarded as militarily sensitive.
 Freedom to travel outside Morocco is controlled by the Ministry
 of Interior through the passport issuance process. Though
 delays are not uncommon, most Moroccans receive passports
 
 
 1517
 MOROCCO
 within 1 month of application. There are frequent allegations
 of corruption in the passport offices; applicants are
 reportedly forced to pay gratuities to obtain application forms
 and to make sure that the application is not lost in the
 bureaucratic labyrinth.
 Some Moroccans, including certain political activists, former
 political prisoners, and Moroccan Bahai's, have been denied
 passports. For example, the Oufkir family, which was released
 from 19 years of house arrest in March, has been denied
 passports but has not received a written explanation of the
 refusal as required by law. According to a communique issued
 by the Moroccan Authors' Union, its vice president and former
 political prisoner, Abdelkader Chaoui, was prevented in June
 from leaving Morocco for Spain to participate in a seminar on
 Morocco. Women must have permission from either their fathers
 or husbands to obtain a passport. A divorced woman must have
 her father's permission to obtain a passport and, if she has
 custody of the children, she must have permission of the
 children's father for passports to be issued to the children.
 The only reported instance of the Government deporting a
 citizen of Moroccan nationality in 1991 was that of Abraham
 Serfaty. Serfaty was expelled from Morocco in September on the
 basis that he was a Brazilian national who had falsely claimed
 Moroccan nationality in an effort to further his intention of
 disrupting internal state security. Serfaty denied that he was
 a Brazilian and said that his Moroccan nationality had never
 before been questioned.
 Moroccan law considers any person who acquires Moroccan
 nationality to be a citizen for life. Moroccans may not
 renounce their Moroccan citizenship, though nhe King may revoke
 it--a little-used practice. Tens of thousands of Moroccans
 hold dual nationality and travel on passports from two
 countries; while in Morocco they are regarded as Moroccan
 citizens. As a result, the Government has sometimes'refused to
 recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of
 dual nationals or even to receive information concerning their
 arrest and imprisonment. Dual natidnals also complain of
 harassment by Moroccan immigration inspectors. The law
 encourages voluntary repatriation for Moroccan Jews who have
 emigrated; Moroccan Jewish emigres, including those with
 Israeli citizenship, freely visit Morocco. The law also
 encourages the return of Saharans who have opposed Morocco in'
 the Western Sahara conflict. Returning former Polisario
 members who are deemed to pose no threat to security are
 integrated into Moroccan life.
 Section 3 Respect For Political Rights:- The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Moroccan citizens cannot freely change their government; the
 King, as Head of State, appoints the Prime Minister, who is
 Head of Government. The Parliament has the theoretical
 authority to effect change in the system of government, but has
 never exercised it. Moreover, the Constitution may not be
 amended without the approval of the King, who indicated in his
 July interview with French journalists that he believes that
 democratization should come slowly to the region. Despite
 persistent rumors that Parliament would soon be given more
 authority and that the Prime Minister would be elected either
 directly or by Parliament, there was no change in the system in
 1991. Two-thirds of the members of Parliament are elected
 directly by universal adult suffrage, while one-third is
 
 
 1518
 MOROCCO
 elected indirectly by various business, labor, and agricultural
 organizations. Six representatives are elected by overseas
 Moroccans. The Ministry of Interior appoints provincial
 governors, though municipal councils are elected.
 The Parliament includes representatives of nine political
 parties, including opposition parties. There are also at least
 two legal leftist parties which are not represented in the
 Parliament. At least two new parties were formed in 1991 or
 were in the process of formation.
 Elections are not generally regarded as fully free of
 government manipulation. Opposition parties contend that the
 GoveKnment rigged the outcome of the last parliamentary
 elections in 1984 by interfering in the selection of candidates
 and the tallying of ballots, although one-third of the deputies
 elected were from opposition parties. In a number of cases,
 challenges were upheld in court. National elections were to
 have been held in December 1990, but were postponed for 2 years
 by a referendum initiated by the palace purportedly to allow
 time to resolve the status of the Western Sahara by a United
 Nations-organized referendum so that "all Moroccans" (i.e.,
 including the Sahrawis) could participate in the next
 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are three officially recognized human rights groups in
 Morocco: two are affiliated with opposition political parties,
 while the third is nonpartisan. The Moroccan League for the
 Defense of Human Rights (MLDHR) (Istiqlal party) and the
 Moroccan Human Rights Association (Party of the Socialist Avant
 Garde) have formed a coordinating committee and generally issue
 joint communiques. The MLDHR chose, however, to participate in
 the CCDH, while the Association did not. The nonpartisan
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH) also chose to
 participate in the CCDH. Investigations by Moroccan human
 rights groups are generally conducted with neither government
 hindrance nor cooperation. An investigation into the 1990 Fez
 riots by the OMDH collapsed because of a lack of cooperation
 from local officials. A parliamentary commission investigating
 the riots reportedly fared somewhat better but complained that
 officials interviewed were concerned mostly with shifting blame
 elsewhere.
 A prominent Moroccan human rights activist was the target of
 attacks in 1991, although it is unclear whether these attacks
 were related to his human rights activities. Two assassination
 attempts, one of which resulted in the death of an innocent
 bystander, were made against Mohamed Kebbab, president of the
 MLDHR. The cases remained unsolved at the end of the year.
 The Government created a blacklist of Moroccans known by it to
 have provided information to foreign human rights investigators
 and gave the list to Moroccan political parties as a suggested
 guideline on who should no longer have access to sensitive
 information. The list included the names of many Moroccan
 human rights activists, who generally regarded it as an effort
 at intimidation.
 International investigation of violations of human rights is
 not well tolerated in Morocco. Christine Serfaty, the French
 human rights activist whose husband was released and expelled

 from Morocco in September, has been forbidden to return to
 Morocco. Inquiries to the government about specific political
 prisoners, transmitted by diplomatic missions, generally go
 unanswered. In 1990, in response to criticism of Morocco's
 human rights performance, the King created the CCDH, among
 whose responsibilities was the representation of Morocco at
 international human rights forums such as the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). However, CCDH representatives
 to the UNHRC in 1991 were provided with little government or
 background information. In September the Government began to
 show more interest in participation in international human
 rights forums when it sought and won the interim presidency of
 the preparatory commission for the 1993 World Conference on
 Human Rights in Geneva.
 In February the CCDH issued a series of recommendations to the
 King concerning, inter alia, government contact with
 international human rights organizations. The Parliament
 enacted the recommendations into law in April. By the end of
 the year, however, the King had not promulgated the new laws by
 decree, as required by the Constitution to make the laws
 legally binding.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution affirms the legal equality of all Moroccans,
 and the Government does not discriminate based on ethnicity.
 Although there is no systematic discrimination, Moroccan blacks
 generally occupy.the lower social strata, though a few hold
 high government or palace positions. Also, some Moroccan
 descendants of sub-Saharan African slaves suffer various forms
 of social discrimination arising out of prejudices on the part
 of some Arabs and Berbers, the two major ethnic groups in
 Morocco.
 Under the criminal code, Moroccan women are accorded the same
 treatment as men. Women are not accorded equal treatment under
 Moroccan family and estate law, which is based on the Malikite
 school of Islamic law. In marriage, for example, a husband may
 repudiate his wife, but the wife may not repudiate her husband.
 The situations under which a woman may sue for divorce are far
 fewer than those permitted to men. Women inherit only half as
 much as their male siblings. Well-educated Moroccan women
 often succeed professionally, particularly in the areas of law,
 medicine, education, and government service. There are,
 however, very few women in the top echelons of their
 professions and there are no women ministers or members of
 Parliament. Women compose approximately 24 percent of the work
 force, with the majority of them in the industrial, service,
 and teaching sectors.   Women enjoy the right to vote and to
 run for office, and some women have been elected to municipal
 councils. There are no women on the CCDH. It is in the rural
 areas where women suffer most from inequality. Women there
 perform most hard physical labor; the rate of literacy,
 particularly in the countryside, is noticeably lower for women
 than for men; and girls are much less likely to be sent to
 school than boys. Women who earn their secondary school
 diploma, however, have equal access to university training.
 The law and social practices governing violence against women
 reflect Morocco's Islamic culture and the importance placed on
 the honor of the family. The criminal code includes severe
 punishment for men who are convicted of raping or violating a
 woman or girl, and the defendant bears the burden of proving
 
 
 1520
 MOROCCO
 his innocence. However, sexual assaults often go unreported
 because of the stigma attached to not being a virgin. Rapists
 are sometimes offered the opportunity to marry their victims
 (even against the girls' will) in order to preserve honor.
 Although a woman who is the victim of wifebeating has the right
 to complain to the police, as a practical matter she would not
 generally do so unless she were prepared to file for divorce
 and leave her husband's home. The law excuses the murder or
 injury of a wife who is caught in the act of committing
 adultery. A woman would not be excused after committing
 violence against her husband under the same circumstances.
 The official language is Arabic, and the languages of
 instr.iction and the news media are Arabic and French. Some
 broadcasting is done in English and Spanish, and there is at
 least one Spanish-language newspaper. There are some Berber
 spokesmen who believe that the Berber identity is not
 adequately maintained because Berber languages are not taught
 in schools and there are no Berber publications, although a few
 state-owned radio stations broadcast several hours daily in
 Berber languages. Berbers are well represented in the
 Government and the officer corps of the military. Berbers
 mostly reside in rural areas, while urban populations are
 largely Arab. While the vast majority of Moroccan Berbers now
 speak Arabic as a second language, Berber identity continues to
 be a political and cultural factor.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize trade
 unions. Workers are free to form and join unions throughout
 the country. The right is exercised widely but not
 universally. The Government keeps abreast of union activity,
 and the selection of union officers and their ability to carry
 out their duties is sometimes subject to government pressure.
 According to the trade union federations, well over a million
 of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized. Five percent of
 the work force is perhaps a more accurate estimate.
 Substantial numbers of workers in the public sector are
 unionized.
 Three of the 16 existing trade union federations dominate the
 labor scene; these three are organizationally independent of
 the Government. They are the Union Marocain de Travail (UMT),
 the Confederation Democratique de Travail (CDT), and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no
 political affiliation, the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union
 of Popular Forces (USFP), and the UGTM to the Istiqlal Party.
 Both the USFP and Istiqlal are currently opposition parties. A
 single factory may contain several local unions, each
 affiliated with a different federation.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so often. Most work
 stoppages are intended to advertise grievances and last 24
 hours or less; however, strikes can be prolonged and arise not
 only from economic demands or those related to working
 conditions but also from union rivalry. Strike activity
 throughout 1991 was limited by the Persian Gulf War and the
 pending referendum in the Western Sahara.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties
 with international trade secretariats.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The multiplicity of trade union federations
 creates competition to organize workers. Any group of eight
 workers may organize, and it is easy for a worker to change
 trade union affiliation. Thus a single factory may contain
 several independent locals or locals affiliated with more than
 one labor federation.
 In both the process of organizing and during collective
 bargaining, labor laws are honored most often in the industrial
 sector of the economy, where ad hoc government mediation and
 arbitration procedures to promote worker-employer negotiations
 are more easily applied. These procedures do not in practice
 infringe on the unions' freedom to bargain and to strike. In
 the-informal and underground economies, especially the growing
 textile sector, and the artisanal field (handicrafts), labor
 laws and regulations are less carefully observed and are often
 ignored. Small employers, especially in the agricultural
 sector, are often ignorant of labor laws and regulations. To
 some degree, the labor surplus hinders protection of the
 organizing and collective bargaining process.
 Because of constitutional guarantees of the right to organize
 and bargain collectively, the principle of collective
 bargaining is implicit rather than explicit in the labor codes
 themselves. The wages of most unionized workers are
 established through practices that include discussions between
 employer and worker representatives. Wages for the vast
 majority of workers are set unilaterally by the employer.
 Collective bargaining agreements are often invoked in legal
 disputes when a worker claims to have been reprimanded or
 dismissed for trade union activity. Employers usually cite
 work-related reasons for the dismissals. An employer intending
 to fire workers without replacing them must apply in advance to
 the provincial governor through the labor inspector's office.
 In the more usual cases where employers plan to replace fired
 workers, the labor inspector provides replacements and mediates
 the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker
 fired for a serious infraction, such as sabotage, is entitled
 by law to a court hearing which, despite the admitted
 government influence on the judiciary, generally provides
 greater satisfaction to worker complainants than might be
 received through administrative channels. An employer found to
 have dismissed a worker unjustly is liable for fines. The
 labor law applies equally to the small Tangier export zone.
 The proportion of unionized workers there is about the same as
 in Morocco as a whole.
 Despite constitutional protection, unions complain regularly
 that employers suspend or dismiss their members for trade union
 activity without penalty. Under the law, Ministry of Labor
 inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators; they are
 often not very effective, however, because they are few in
 number, carry heavy workloads, and do not have the resources to
 investigate all possible cases of labor law violations.
 Workers have thus turned increasingly to the courts for the
 resolution of complaints.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts
 (COE) in its report for 1990 noted that there is no Moroccan
 legal or constitutional prohibition against forced or
 
 
 1522
 MOROCCO
 compulsory labor. As far as is known, forced or compulsory
 labor is not practiced in Morocco.
 d. Minimum Age for Employmdent of Children
 Children may not be legally employed or apprenticed before age
 12. Special regulations govern the employment of children
 between the ages of 12 and 16. Enforcement of these
 requlations outside-the artisanal field is uneven because of
 limited government resources and the need of poorer families to
 earn additional income. In artisanal work, however, children
 are often apprenticed before age 12; the argument is made that
 they need to acquire skills, such as weaving or rug-making, at
 an eqrlier age. Five years of primary education is compulsory,
 starting at age 7, but enforcement in the countryside and
 poorer urban areas is lax.
 Safety and health conditions as well as salaries in enterprises
 employing children are often substandard. The rug-making and
 tanning industries have been cited as areas where the use of
 minors is common. Children are also employed informally as
 domestics and usually receive little or no wages. Abuses of
 the child labor laws often go-undetected because many of them
 occur in the countryside or in private homes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government sets a minimum industrial wage, which is
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor's inspectors. Despite
 subsidies, a family cannot maintain a decent standard of living
 on the minimum wage of a single worker. In many cases several
 members, some of them working in the informal economy, combine
 their income to support the family.
 The law provides a 48-hour maximum workweek, with not more than
 10 hours for any single day, premium pay for overtime, paid
 public and annual holidays, and minimum conditions for health
 and safety, including the prohibition of night work for women
 and minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are
 observed unevenly and have little meaning in the informal
 sector. Labor inspectors endeavor to monitor working
 conditions, accidents, and labor disputes but lack sufficient
 resources and authority to investigate many complaints and
 assure compliance with the law.
