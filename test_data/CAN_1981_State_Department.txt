 CANADA
 
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal system,
 a parliamentary form of government and a strong democratic
 tradition. Its resource wealth and modern industrial
 economy afford Canadians a high standard of living, and
 support a sophisticated and comprehensive system of
 government services. Parliament, the media, and the
 public are quick to react to any real or suspected
 infringement of human rights, not only in Canada but
 elsewhere in the world. Canada is a staunch supporter of
 United Nations resolutions and declarations on human
 rights. It has played a leading role in stimulating
 global concern for human rights abuses and working to
 strengthen international human rights machinery.
 Respect for fundamental human rights in Canada is based
 on (1) the well-established principle of the rule of. law;
 (2) the British North America Act of 1867; (3) the
 criminal code of 1970; (4) the civil code of Quebec; (5)
 federal and provincial statutes, such as the 1960 Canadian
 bill of rights (applicable to areas under federal juris-
 diction), the Saskatchewan bill of rights, the Quebec
 charter of human rights and freedoms, and the Alberta bill
 of rights; (6) human rights commissions, such as that
 established by the Canadian Ruman"Rights Act (1977); and
 (7) other federal and provincial statutes prohibiting
 discriminatory practices in a broad range of social and
 economic activities.
 In 1980 the government introduced measures which would
 entrench a charter of rights and freedoms in a new consti-
 tution and make any further actions in this field by
 either the federal parliament or provincial legislatures
 subject to review by the courts. Some provincial premiers
 and opposition spokesmen in parliament questioned the
 wisdom of transferring responsibility for protection of
 human rights from elected legislators to the judiciary,
 while human rights organizations generally applauded the
 proposed charter. The Canadian parliament has now
 approved the government's constitutional proposals, and
 they have been carried to Westminister for the required
 assent of the British parliament. When the new Consti-
 tution enters into force, provincial as well as federal
 laws will be subject to the guarantees of rights set forth
 in the charter of rights, with certain exceptions. The
 exceptions allow a legislative body to enact laws with a
 temporary (5 year) but renewable validity "notwithstanding"
 certain provisions of the Charter of Rights.
 Although legislative protection of human rights falls
 under the jurisdiction of both federal and provincial
 governments, the specific guarantees discussed below are
 those in existence at the federal level, often reinforced
 by complementary provisions in provincial statutes.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is a practice contrary to the philosophy of
 Canadian criminal law and the principles governing the
 administration of security and penitentiary services. The
 Criminal code prohibits the use of torture.
 
 (788)
 
 
 739
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal code prohibits the use of cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment, and, under the 1960 Bill of Rights,
 any law of Canada which authorized such punishment would
 be held by the courts to be inoperative. The death
 penalty has been abolished for all crimes except certain
 offences against the code of service discipline. The new
 charter of rights will recognize the right not to be
 subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment
 (this guarantee is among the charter provisions to which
 Canadian legislative bodies could enact limited exceptions
 if express declarations are made that the act in question
 shall operate notwithstanding the charter).
 c. Disappearances
 Secret arrest and clandestine detention are contrary to
 law and does not take place in Canada.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 For matters within its jurisdiction, Canada's federal
 parliament has recognized the right of every individual to
 be informed at the time of his arrest of the reasons for
 his arrest. Accused persons are generally released
 pending trial, and there are provisions for judicial
 review at specified intervals when pre-trial detention
 does occur. The Canadian bill of rights renders
 inoperative any law of Canada depriving a person of remedy
 by way of habeas corpus. The new Charter will recognize,
 inter alia, the right not to be arbitrarily detained or
 imprisoned, to be informed promptly of reasons for arrest
 or detention, to retain counsel without delay and be
 informed of that right, to have the validity of detention
 determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if
 detention is not lawful (though these guarantees are
 subject to the same override provision cited above).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Canadian bill of rights gives individuals charged in
 criminal proceedings the right to a public trial before an
 independent and impartial tribunal. More generally, in
 civil as well as criminal matters, the right to a public
 trial is one of the fundamental features of the Anglo-
 Canadian legal system. Defendants have the right to
 counsel of their choice. There is no provision of general
 application in federal law recognizing the right to legal
 assistance, but persons charged with criminal offenses
 under federal law may generally take advantage of provin-
 cial legal aid programs subsidized by the federal govern-
 ment. Under Canada's Official Secrets Act, trials can be
 held in camera in matters involving espionage and similar
 crimes. Though subject to the same override provisions
 cited above, the new Charter will entrench the right to a
 fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial
 tribunal, the right not to be tried twice for the same
 offense, the right of witnesses against self-incrimination,
 and the right to the assistance of an interpreter. The
 Judiciary is an independent branch of government.
 f. Invasion of the Rome
 
 
 740
 The criminal code prohibits forcible entry into real
 property in the peaceable possession of another. If a
 police officer, when Rot authorized to do so by law,
 conducts a search without a warrant, he becomes an
 intruder and subject to legal penalties. In late 1981 an
 official commission concluded that the Royal Canadian
 Mounted Police had engaged in illegal activities,
 including mail openings and surreptitious entries, and
 recommended measures to ensure that no exceptions are made
 to the rule'of law in the future. In general, the RCMP
 and other Canadian law enforcement agencies have
 traditionally enjoyed high regard and broad public
 support. The new charter of rights recognizes that
 everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable
 search or seizure, though this protection is subject to
 override provisions.'
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Canadian bill of rights recognizes freedom of religion,
 freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of
 association and freedom of assembly. (The latter is
 subject to considerations of public order.) However, a
 1981 provincial court concurred in previous opinions that,
 as to the fundamental freedoms of speech, assembly,
 association, the press and religion referred to in the
 preamble of the British North America Act of 1867, none of
 these is so enshrined in the constitution as to be above
 the reach of competent legislation. This will soon change.
 The new constitution, when approved by the British govern-
 ment, will enshrine these fundamental rights, but will
 allow derogations by provincial law under specific
 conditions set forth in the constitution.
 Viewpoints representing the complete political spectrum
 are vigorously argued in newspapers and other publications
 across Canada and on the more than 2,000 publicly- and
 privately-owned broadcasting stations. Some provinces
 maintain censor boards with authority to delete sexually
 explicit or violent material from films approved for
 distribution.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens enjoy well-established rights to enter,
 remain in, or leave Canada. However, federal spokesmen
 have exprssed concern over provincial laws inhibiting
 non-residents of a province from carrying on work or
 owning land, and creating other barriers to the free flow
 of capital, labor and services throughout the Canadian
 economy. The Charter of Rights in the new Constitution
 will strengthen the right of citizens and permanent resi-
 dents of Canada to establish residence in any province and
 take up employment there. It mandates equality of treat-
 ment in employment, subject to exceptions for provincial
 *affirmative action' programs for socially and econom-
 ically disadvantaged individuals.
 Since the end of World War II, Canada has welcomed over
 400,000 refugees. The program initially focused on dis-
 placed persons from Eastern"Europe, but has gradually
 broadened in scope. More than 75,000 refugees have been
 admitted from the Indochina region alone. Canada's annual
 refugee plan for 1981 called for the admission of 8,000
 government-assisted Indochina refugees, 4,000 refugees
 
 
 741
 from Eastern Europe, 1,000 from Latin America, and 500
 from Africa and other world areas, plus a contingency
 reserve of 2,500 spaces.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Legislative power is vested in the house of commons, whose
 members are elected through universal suffrage (by secret
 ballot by adult Canadian citizens), and in an appointed
 senate. Elections must be held at least every five years,
 and participation rates are high. Canadians have complete
 freedom to join the political party of their choice. In
 the 32nd Canadian general election in February 1980, more
 than 11 million Canadians, 69 percent of the registered
 voters, cast ballots.
 Women take an increasingly active part in Canadian polit-
 ical life. They are active in the parties and represented
 in parliament and provincial legislatures. Discrimination
 cases represented the largest single category (29 percent)
 of complaints received by the Canadian human rights com-
 mission in 1980. A cabinet minister is specifically
 charged with'responsibility for the status of women. A
 federal advisory-council on the status'of'women, con-
 sisting of women with distinguished records in business,
 government and social service, advises the minister of
 women's affairs on measures to maintain sexual equality
 within the public service and in federal enactments. On
 December 10, 1981, Canada deposited with the United
 Nations its instrument of ratification of the convention
 on all forms of-discrimination against women. Canada's
 new Charter of Rights specifies that the rights and
 freedoms it refers to are guaranteed equally to male and
 female persons.
 The Canadian human rights commission has recommended steps
 to end sex discrimination ihherent in existing legislation
 which denies Indian status, the right to tribal
 membership, and related benefits to native women who marry
 men who are not Indians. Responding to an individual
 complaint filed under terms of the optional protocol to
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
 the UN Human Rights Committee ruled in July 1981, that
 Canada's denial of the right to reside on a reserve to an
 Indian who had married a non-Indian represented a breach
 of article 27 of the covenant, concerning the right of
 minorities to enjoy their own culture. (Canada is a party
 to the protocol as well as. the covenant itself.) The
 federal government has agreed to waive applicable status
 provisions in the case of Indian bands which request
 exemption.
 Canadian labor unions enjoy notably wide freedom of
 action. Canadian law recognizes the right of labor in
 both the public and private sectors to organize, associate
 freely, bargain collectively and strike. Federal and
 provincial legislation proscribes discrimination in union
 membership recruitment and employee hiring.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 Canada has vigorously supported efforts to increase the
 authority of international bodies to investigate and deal
 with human rights abuses. An exhaustive report, docu-
 menting Canada's observance of the International Covenant
 
 
 742
 on Civil and Political Rights, was presented to the United
 Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva in 1980 and has
 been widely distributed inside Canada. Canadian initi-
 atives have been instrumental in achieving major advances
 at recent sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
 Numerous mechanisms and institutions exist in Canada for
 monitoring human rightspractices. The Canadian human
 rights commission, established in 1977, is charged with
 investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination
 in government and business activities under federal juris-
 diction, and combatting discrimination through informa-
 tion, education and research. The Commission's annual
 report, published in March 1981, indicated that it had
 screened over 13,000 inquiries in 1980 and handled 350
 formal complaints--five percent of which were sent to
 human rights tribunals which it is empowered to establish.
 The commission recommended amendments to the Canadian
 Human Rights Act and other federal statutes which would
 expand proscribed grounds of.discrimination and remove
 specific instances of differential treatment based on sex
 and age. Human rights commissions also have been estab-
 lished at the provincial level.
 Since 1975 a continuing federal-provincial committee of
 officials responsible for human rights has been in exist-
 ence to provide a forum for intergovernmental discussion
 on matters related to human rights in Canada. Canada's
 commissioner of official languages reviews public com-
 plaints over violations in statutory language rights,
 which guarantee Canadians the right to deal with federal
 institutions in either French or English.
 Non-governmental human rights organizations and interest
 groups are also active in maintaining high public concern
 over human rights issues. The prominent role occupied by
 human rights considerations in Canada's external relations
 was kept in the public eye by a March 1981 conference on
 foreign policy and. human rights sponsored by the Canadian
 Human Rights Foundation and attended by senior government
 officials and private participants from across the country
 and abroad.
 Associations of Indian and Inuit people have put forward
 formal land claims involving large areas of Canada, and
 agreements applying to two areas were reached in 1975 and
 1978. After extensive study in late 1981 the federal
 government reaffirmed its commitment to negotiating
 settlements of claims based on aboriginal title relating
 to traditional use and occupancy of land. The government
 is offering to extend new benefits and rights in exchange
 for those based on traditional interests. The pending
 Charter of Rights provides that its guarantees shall not
 be construed so as to derogate from aboriginal rights and
 freedoms previously recognized or acquired in land claims
 settlements. In response to pressure to accord greater
 recognition of aboriginal rights, a constitutional con-
 ference including aboriginal peoples is. to be held, to
 identify and define aboriginal rights which should be
 constitutionally entrenched.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Food, shelter, health care and education are available to
 all inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background or political opinion. The Canadian government
 has demonstrated a strong commitment to improving the lot
 
 
 743
 of the poor. The federal and provincial governments
 administer extensive social welfare programs. An equal-
 ization system provides for transfers of revenue from the
 more prosperous provinces to those which are relatively
 less well-off. Education is free up to grade 13. All
 Canadians are covered by a national medical and health
 insurance program. Canada is one of the few countries in
 the world which provide for full automatic indexing of
 income tax levels to adjust for inflation and maintain an
 equitable tax system. There is a comprehensive and
 generous program of unemployment insurance compensation
 administered by the federal department of employment and
 immigration. Over two million Canadians over 65 receive
 old-age security payments.
 Much emphasis has been placed on the fostering of a bilin-
 gual, multicultural society in which all may enjoy freedom
 from discrimination, while maintaining distinct cultural
 identities with Canada. In particular, the Official
 Languages Act of 1969 declared English and French to be
 equal in status, rights and privileges in all federal
 institutions. During the 1970's federal policies nearly
 doubled the percentage of officer ranks in the public
 service occupied by francophone Canadians. The new
 constitution would ensure that most Canadians belonging to
 either of the official language groups would have the
 right to educate their children in that language, wherever
 numbers warrant. At present, Quebec provincial law limits
 the right of anglophones to be educated in Quebec in
 English. The new constitution will require Quebec to
 provide English language education for the children of
 Canadians who were themselves educated in English in
 Canada, and for all children in Canadian families in which
 at least one child has begun his education in English any-
 where in Canada. The new constitution would not require
 Quebec to provide English language schools for children of
 immigrants or other non-Canadians.
 Canada's per capita gross national product in 1979 was
 $9,640. Canada's population has grown by 1.1% per year
 over the period 1970-79. Infant mortality per 1,000 live
 births was 12 in 1978 and Canada's total fertility rate
 was 1.9% (1979). Life expectancy at birth was 74 years in
 1979. The vast majority of Canadians have access to safe
 water but the percentage of the population with such
 access is not available.
