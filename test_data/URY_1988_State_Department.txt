 URUGUAY
 Uruguay returned to its democratic tradition when 12 years of
 military rule ended on March 1, 1985, with free and fair
 elections in which President Julio Maria Sanguinetti's
 Colorado Party won a plurality in the bicameral legislature.
 The judicial branch regained its independence, but there is a
 continuing public debate over the need to reform the legal and
 judicial systems. ,Political parties, the press, labor unions,
 private interest groups, and other nongovernmental groups
 function freely and political debate is vigorous and
 unrestricted.
 Uruguay's military forces are controlled by the Government.
 The military does not participate in domestic security matters
 unless ordered to do so by the civilian authorities. Domestic
 security and routine police matters are under the jurisdiction
 of the Interior Ministry, which administers all of the
 country's police departments.
 In 1986 and 1987, after several years of stagnation, the
 Uruguayan economy showed significant growth, which continued
 at a slightly slower pace in 1988. This resulted from
 increased prices for beef and wool, and diversification of
 trade into nontraditional exports. Real incomes have
 recovered some of the ground lost in the previous decade.
 During 1988 there were no credible reports of human rights
 violations. After the return to democracy in 1985, all
 political prisoners and even some nonpolitical ones in effect
 received amnesty. Public debate on the 1986 Law on
 Expiration, which effectively exempted military and police
 personnel from prosecution for alleged human rights abuses
 committed under orders during the military regime, continued
 during 1988. Local human rights groups and Amnesty
 International (AI) expressed concern that the law might deter
 investigations of disappearances afid promote a sense of
 impunity among wrongdoers. The Supreme Court has upheld the
 Law of Expiration in several cases challenging its
 constitutionality.
 Under Article 79 of the Constitution which permits the repeal
 of laws by referendum, a commission headed by relatives of
 victims of human rights abuses mounted a campaign to gather
 signatures to submit the Law of Expiration to a popular vote.
 On December 17, 1987, a petition was delivered to the
 Electoral Court, which was charged with authenticating the
 signatures to determine if 25 percent of eligible voters
 signed the petition. Nearly a year later, the Electoral Court
 completed the four-stage signature authentication process,
 validating over 532,000 of the original 634,702 signatures.
 Over 36,000 persons had their signatures placed in suspense
 but will be given an opportunity to validate them in person.
 There must be 555,701 valid signatures to convoke a
 plebiscite, so it appears likely the referendum on the Law of
 Expiration will be held in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No cases of political killings were reported.
 
 
 719
 URUGUAY
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners and
 no cases of torture or deliberately inhuman treatment were
 reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No cases of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile were
 reported.
 The Constitution requires a written warrant for an arrest
 except in cases where the accused is apprehended during the
 commission of a crime. The Constitution provides for the
 right to a judicial determination of the legality of detention
 and requires that the detaining authority in an arrest explain
 and justify to the judiciary the legal grounds for the
 detention. A prisoner also has the right to counsel and the
 right to give a statement and appear before a judge within 24
 hours of detention. The judge must begin the judicial process
 within 48 hours of arrest. Failure to comply with this
 48-hour rule has led to the release of detainees. Bond is
 allowed in criminal trials which could lead to a penitentiary
 sentence. Military justice is applicable to civilians only
 during a state of war or insurrection. These constitutional
 provisions are respected in practice.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary regained its autonomy in 1985, and military
 officers appointed by the military regime to the Supreme Court
 or the higher Appeals Court retired from their positions. The
 law provides for two military justices on the Supreme Court.
 They participate only in cases involving the military. The
 Constitution requires that all trials must open with a public
 statement of the charge by the prosecutor or the complainant.
 However, Uruguayan court procedures require the lawyers'
 arguments to be submitted to the judges in writing, and these
 written statements are normally not made public. There is a
 parallel military court system under the military justice code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the
 home, absolutely inviolable at night, can be entered and
 searched only with a legal warrant during the day. Protection
 for private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a
 warrant is required for confiscation. These rights and
 protections are well respected. Investigations of wiretapping
 during the military regime continue, but there has been no
 evidence of any such activity after March 1985.

 URUGUAY
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 All elements of the political spectrum are involved in both
 the print and broadcast media. Formerly proscribed
 organizations such as the Tupamaro Movement, which conducted
 terrorist campaigns in the late 1960's and early 1970's, and
 the Communist Party freely publish newspapers and operate
 radio stations. There are three nonaffiliated independent
 television stations and one public service government station.
 In 1988 a conservative journalist was sentenced to 6 months in
 prison in the second case in which a conviction was obtained
 under a 1984 criminal libel law. In the first case, a
 journalist for a Communist newspaper was convicted but not
 imprisoned in 1987. In both cases, complaints were filed by
 private citizens.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is
 respected. University elections have been held twice since
 1985, and student groups have resumed campus political
 activities. Most professors dismissed for political or
 ideological reasons by the military regime have returned to
 their positions, although a few cases remain under study.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros, are free to
 organize and express their opinions. Public marches and
 demonstrations are allowed with permits from the Ministry of
 the Interior and occur without official harassment or
 intimidation. Persons denied citizenship rights by the
 military regime because of political affiliation or activity
 have had their rights fully restored.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a
 religion are Roman Catholic. Members of other religions
 exercise their faiths unhindered, and missionaries are free to
 proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted.
 An estimated 300,000 Uruguayans left the country during the
 military regime, some for political and many for economic
 reasons. Programs exist for their repatriation, and
 Uruguayans who wish to return are encouraged to do so. All
 the prominent political figures exiled by the military regime
 have returned.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Uruguay is a multiparty democracy, with mandatory universal
 suffrage for those 18 years of age or older. Voting is not
 
 
 721
 URUGUAY
 restricted by race, sex, religion, or economic status. The
 Colorado party, the Blanco or National party, and a coalition
 called the Broad Front are the three major political entities.
 Each allows ideological divisions within the party, and each
 such division may field its own slate for general elections.
 The Uruguayan electoral system combines a primary and general
 election in a double simultaneous vote. Each party fields
 different lists of candidates; in essence, voters express a
 preference for a list rather than an individual candidate, as
 well as vote for a party. The winning list of the party which
 gets the most votes wins the presidency and a percentage of
 seats in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies corresponding to
 the percentage of votes that the party as a whole received. A
 party therefore may run multiple presidential candidates, each
 with his or her own slate of legislative candidates. National
 and provincial elections are held simultaneously every 5
 years, with the next election scheduled for November 1989.
 There are currently no female members of the Parliament, but
 several serve as alternates. Some women serve in cabinet
 positions, the Supreme Court and lower courts, and in the
 diplomatic service including the ambassadorial level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights performance of the Government since its
 return to democratic rule in 1985 has not been of major
 concern to internationally based human rights organizations.
 Local and international human rights groups have, however,
 expressed concern about, and opposition to, the Law of
 Expiration. The Government is open to inquiries from such
 organizations and does not restrict the activities of human
 rights investigators. President Sanguinetti met with an AI
 delegation in October 1987, to discuss these concerns.
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate
 openly under military rule; now function freely and without
 restriction. A prominent local human rights group, Peace and
 Justice Service (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985 after
 operating underground for 2 years during the military regime.
 SERPAJ now investigates both nonpolitical human rights issues,
 such as prison conditions, and politically controversial cases
 involving killing, torture, and disappearances which occurred
 during the military regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Uruguay has long been one of the most egalitarian countries in
 Latin America. Statistically there are few racial or
 linguistic minorities in Uruguay. Nonwhites are
 disproportionately represented at the lower end of the
 economic scale, but this is not the result of legislated or
 official discrimination. Uruguayan women enjoy complete
 equality under the law. Approximately one-third of the work
 force are women; they pursue professional careers and attend
 the National University in large numbers. Some barriers to
 equality still exist in practice because of traditional social
 patterns and restricted employment opportunities. Pay is not
 always equal for men and women, especially in less skilled
 jobs.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of workers to organize
 freely and encourages the formation of unions. Workers have
 the right to choose their own representatives, publicize their
 views and determine their own programs and policies. Worker-
 chosen representatives have the right to represent their
 members' interests. These interests are respected in practice
 as well as in law. Uruguayan workers have the right to
 strike, and many unions did so during 1988. Unions are not
 controlled or restricted by the Government. The persons and
 property of unionists are protected to the same extent as that
 of any other citizen. There are no restrictions on the
 unions' right to affiliate with international trade union
 bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The worker's right to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by law and respected in practice. About 200,000 of
 Uruguay's 1.5 million workers are unionized, and all unions
 have the right to participate in collective bargaining. A
 Tripartite (government, workers, employers) Council exists for
 negotiating wages. Unlike mediation and arbitration which are
 used to resolve an impasse, the Council is involved in the
 entire process of negotiations. While employers and labor may
 bargain outside the Council, the Government retains some
 persuasive power to obtain cooperation with the Council cince
 no contract is legally binding until recognized by the
 Government. The strike remains as a legal--if not always
 viable--option for workers regardless of whether their
 contract was negotiated within the Council framework. In
 1988, 70 percent of the over 300,000 workers whose salaries
 were negotiated under the Council were covered by signed
 contracts when the Council finished its work in September.
 The remaining workers were given a 15 percent increase
 retroactive to June 1, the day the negotiations began, under
 government-decreed contracts.- The contracts negotiated under
 the auspices of the Council were within government-established
 guidelines for wage increases.
 The central labor body, the Interunion Workers Assembly-
 National Workers Association (PIT-CNT), has filed a protest
 with the International Labor Organization (ILO) over the
 government-decreed wage increases. The ILO reportedly will
 investigate the complaint in early 1989.
 Workers are protected by law and practice against antiunion
 discrimination.
 Workers employed in the special export zone are fully covered
 by all labor legislation.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist in law or in
 practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are protected by a child labor code, violations of
 which are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children under
 the age of 15 generally are not employed, but children as
 
 
 723
 URUGUAY
 young as 12 may be legally employed if they have a special
 government work permit. Children under the age of 18 may not
 perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work, apart from
 domestic employment. Salaries and hours for children are
 controlled more strictly than for adults. Children over the
 age of 16 may sue in court for payment of wages, and children
 have the legal right to dispose of their own income. Children
 working in the informal sector, such as street vendors or
 others with no fixed place of work or in the agrarian sector,
 are generally less strictly regulated and receive lower pay.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Uruguay's minimum wage was raised in July to approximately $74
 per month. According to the most recent figures available for
 April-June 1988, the minimum wage at that time would place a
 one-income household slightly below the "poverty line,"
 placing a family dependent on a single minimum wage in the
 poorest 20 percent of the population. The median family income
 for Uruguayans during the April-June 1988 period, however, was
 close to double the minimum wage. Adults normally work six
 8-hour days per week.
 Workers are-entitled to 10 days' paid vacation after a year of
 employment; this vacation period increases with each year of
 employment. Workers are protected by legislation regulating
 the health and safety of working conditions, though coverage
 of certain workers in rural areas or in the informal economy
 is not as thorough.
