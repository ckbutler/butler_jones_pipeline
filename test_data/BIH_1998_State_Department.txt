 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 The 1995 Dayton Accords (formally known as the General Framework Agreement
 for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina) provided for the continuity of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina (BiH), previously one of the constituent republics of Yugoslavia, as a
 single state, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Agreement also piovid~d for two multi-
 ethnic constituent entities within the state: The Federation of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina (the Federation) and the Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation, which
 has a postwar Bosniak and Croat majority, occupies 51 percent of the territory; the
 RS, populated after the war mostly by Bosnian Serbs, occupies 49 percent. The Day-
 ton Accords established a Constitution for Bosnia and Herzegovina that includes a
 central government with a bicameral legislature, a three-member presidency (con-
 sisting of a Bosniak, a Serb, and a Croat), a council of ministers, a constitutional
 court, and a central bank. The Accords also provided for the Office of the High Rep-
 resentative (OHR) to oversee implementation of its civilian provisions. The entities
 maintain separate armies, although Under the Constitution of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, these are under the ultimate control of the presidency of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina. In September Bosnia and Herzegovina held its most peaceful and plu-
 ralistic elections since the 1995 Dayton Accords put an end to 3 years of war. Multi-
 ethnic parties committed to building on the foundation established at Dayton made
 some progress during the presidential and Assembly ï¿½elections. At the same time,
 the largest political parties, which won a majority of Assembly seats, continued to
 be ethnically based. These were the Bosniak-dominated Party of Democratic Action
 (SDA), the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ), and the
 Serb Democratic Party-Serb Radical Party coalition (SDS/SRS). Although formally
 independent, the judiciary remains subject to influence by political parties and the
 executive branch.
 One of the two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established in March 1994 and transformed the gov-
 ernment structure of the Bosnian territories under Bosniak and Croatian control.
 It is a mixed system with a president and a parliament that must approve thepresi-
 dent's choice of a prime minister. Federation structures have been implemented only
 gradually. Major steps were the creation of provincial structures in the form of can-
 tons, the unification of Sarajevo under Federation control in spring 1996, and 1996
 and 1998 elections to a federation parliament. However, divisions between Bosniaks
 and Croats remain. For example, a continued lack of cooperation between Bosniaks
 and Croats hindered the establishment of unified administration in the bifurcated
 city of Mostar. This reflected mutual suspicion between the two communities as well
 as separatist aims of hard-line Croats.
 The Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) is the other entity. In line
 with decisions by the RS Parliament, which came into office in January, most of the
 political and administrative agencies of the RS moved during the year from Pale
 (near Sarajevo) to Banja Luka in the western RS. (Pale is closely associated with
 the supporters of former Bosnian Serb leader and indicted war criminal Radovan
 Karadzic.) The President and two Vice Presidents were elected in September for 2-
 year terms. The length of their terms is to increase to 4 years after the next elec-
 tions. The RS legislative branch, the National Assembly, is elected on a proportional
 basis. With the November 1997 parliamentary elections, the once unquestioned
 power of the SDS/SRS ultranationalist parties began to erode. This process contin-
 ued during the September elections. Although ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen de-
 feated the more moderate nationalist incumbent Biliana Plavsic, Plavsic coalition
 ally Zivko Radisic defeated the ultranationalist Momcilo Krajsnik for the Serb posi-
 tion in the country's three-member joint presidency. In addition, the moderate
 "Sloga" bloc (a coalition of Radisic's Socialist Party of the RS, Biljana Plavsic's Serb
 Peoples' Alliance, and Milorad Dodik's Party of Independent Social Democrats)
 gained additional seats in the RS National Assembly and can control the Assembly
 with the support of Federation-based parties.

 The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex 4 of the Dayton Accords)
 makes the government of each entity responsible for operating its own law enforce-
 ment agencies in accordance with internationally recognized standards. Under the
 auspices of the International Police Task Force (IPTF) established by the United
 Nations pursuant to Annex 11 of the Dayton Accords, police in both entities are un-
 dergoing restructuring and training on police procedures and human rights. Law en-
 forcement bodies of both entities have on occasion violated international standards,
 demonstrating bias on political, religious, and ethnic grounds. However, confirmed
 cases of this kind were fewer than in the previous 2 years. The IPTF has an ex-
 panded mandate that allows it to investigate allegations of human rights abuses.
 With the assistance of the international community, Federation police formed inter-
 nal affairs units to conduct internal checks on police misconduct. The RS police were
 forming similar units. Multiethnic police worked together in some cantons and
 across the interentity boundary line (IEBL) to investigate crimes. In some instances,
 police demonstrated a willingness to respond to crimes without regard to the eth-
 nicity of perpetrators or victims. Bosnian police continued to suffer from the legacy
 of a Communist system, with "special" or secret police operating in all areas. These
 forces were outside the normal police chain of command, reporting directly to the
 senior political leadership. In addition to locally recruited police forces, each entity
 also maintains an army. Both regular and "special" police committed human rights
 abuses throughout the country.
 The Stabilization Force (SFOR) led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 (NATO) continued its mission to implement the military aspects of the Dayton Ac-
 cords and create a secure environment for implementation of the nonmilitary as-
 pects of the settlement, such as civilian reconstruction, the return of refugees, and
 displaced persons, elections, and freedom of movement of the civilian population.
 There were signs of economic revival, particularly in the Federation, where real
 gross domestic product (GDP) doubled since 1995. The World Bank expected 20 per-
 cent GDP growth during the year in both the Federation and the RS. In 3 years,
 unemployment dropped from 90 percent to an official level of approximately 40 per-
 cent in each entity, and wages more than quadrupled in the Federation, up to $175
 (307 DM) per month. Nevertheless, the country remains heavily dependent upon
 international donor assistance, and the anticipated return of refugees from abroad
 was expected to compound the problem of creating sufficient jobs as well as to re-
 duce remittances. International assistance, which is conditioned upon compliance
 with the Dayton Accords, financed infrastructure reconstruction and provided loans
 to the manufacturing sector.
 The commitment to respect citizens' human rights and civil liberties remains ten-
 uous in the country, and the degree of respect for these rights continues to vary
 among areas with Bosniak, Bosnian Croat, and Bosnian Serb majorities. Serious
 human rights abuses continued in several areas.
 Isolated instances of political killings continued: two elderly Serbs were killed in
 Drvar in April, and one Bosniak was killed in Capljina in October. Killings due to
 bombings and booby traps also continued, mainly as a result of majority attempts
 to prevent minority returns to majority areas. Human rights abuses by the police
 during the year, but serious problems persisted. Police continued to commit abuses
 throughout the country, principally the physical abuse of detainees. Some police in
 the RS used torture. Police in all areas also used excessive force, or did not ensure
 security, to discourage minority resettlement in majority areas. Members of the se-
 curity forces abused and physically mistreated other citizens. Prison conditions con-
 tinued to be poor in both entities.
 In the RS, criminal procedure legislation that was held over from the prewar
 Yugoslav period granted police wide latitude to detain suspects for long periods of
 time before filing charges. However, there were fewer cases of arbitrary arrest and
 detention than in previous years. In July the Federation legislature modified crimi-
 nal procedure legislation held over from the Yugoslav period and decreased the wide
 latitude of police to detain suspects before filing formal charges. Confusion over the
 rules for arrest and detention of suspects for The Hague-based International Crimi-
 nal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has led in some instances to ques-
 tionable detentions in both the Federation and the RS. The arrest of Goran Vasic
 by Federation authorities in February and the conviction of Veselin Cancar in Janu-
 ary raise questions of noncompliance with ICTY rules and procedures agreed upon
 in 1996. The RS continues its de facto refusal to take action, either on its own or
 on behalf of the ICTY, against any Serbs indicted by the ICTY.
 The judiciary in both entities remained subject to coercive influence by dominant
 political parties and by the executive branch. In many areas, close ties exist between
 courts of law and the ruling parties, and those judges who show independence are
 subject to intimidation by the authorities. Even when independent decisions are ren-
 
 
 1168
 
 dered, local authorities often refuse to carry them out. Authorities in all areas in-
 fringed on citizens' right to privacy.
 Authorities and dominant political parties in their respective areas of the country
 exerted influence over the media, and freedom of speech and of the press was lim-
 ited to varying degrees in the different entities. The two television networks, Fed-
 eration State Television in the Federation and Serb Radio-Television in the RS,
 were freed from direct party control and placed under the supervision of inter-
 national administrators. However, party influence was not fully eliminated in either
 network; it was particularly egregious in parts of the RS broadcast media. The Open
 Broadcast Network, an international donor-funded television network, expanded its
 broadcast range and improved its programming in order to promote a broader mix
 of reporting. Academic freedom was restricted. Authorities imposed some limits on
 freedom of assembly and association. Party control of the media and fears about se-
 curity in some areas dampened full participation without intimidation by opposition
 groups and ethnic minorities in the electoral process. Religious discrimination re-
 mained a problem. Both governments and private groups continued to be respon-
 sible for isolated incidents that restricted the open expression of religious practices
 by minorities in majority areas. Although freedom of movement continued to im-
 prove, some limits remained in practice.
 Severe discrimination continues in areas dominated by one ethnic group, particu-
 larly in the treatment of refugees and displaced persons. Local authorities and mobs
 (in most cases believed to be organized or appioved by local authorities) harassed
 minority returnees and violently resisted their return. The destruction of minority-
 owned housesi continued, particularly in Croat-controled areas. RS and Bosnian
 Croat authorities encouraged members of their own ethnic groups to remain or move
 to areas where their group was in the majority, rather than stay in or return to
 their homes. In addition to the lack of security, marginal economic conditions and
 limited educational opportunities continued to act as a brake on the return of inter-
 nally displaced persons and refugees. The enactment by the Federation of new prop-
 erty laws in April provided an improved legal framework for potential return by cre-
 ating legal mechanisms for reoccupation not only of private property, but also of so-
 cially owned apartments. However, implementation of even the preparatory ele-
 ments for reoccupation was uneven in the Federation and by late October, some
 areas still had -not established initial claim mechanisms. In early. December, the RS
 finally passed a long-awaited revision of its property law, but another key piece of
 property rights legislation remained in draft form at year's end. Some restrictions
 on freedom of movement continued, although the introduction of uniform license
 plates greatly expanded interentity movement. Ethnic discrimination remains a se-
 rious problem, and mob violence continued.
 During the year, there were increased efforts on the part of SFOR to apprehend
 perpetrators of wartime atrocities. SFOR's more aggressive approach of apprehend-
 ing individuals indicted by the ICTY, which began in the summer of 1997, resulted
 during the year in the apprehension of 12 indictees out of the 83 publicly indicted
 by the Tribunal. Eight of these were detained forcibly, and four turned themselves
 in. This brought the total number of indictees taken into custody since the Tribu-
 nal's inception to 35. At year's end there -were 23 persons in ICTY custody awaiting
 trial or on trial. Two persons in custody died during the year, one as a result of
 an aneurysm and one as a result of suicide. One indictee, Slobodan Miljkovic, was
 killed in a barroom brawl in Kragujevac, Serbia in August. There were 31 public
 indictees still at large at year's end. ICTY trials during the year resulted in four
 convictions and one acquittal. The arrests of Milorad Krnojelac and General
 Radislav Krstic led to protests by Serbs, during which property was damaged and
 mobs threatened international civilian observers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the-Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other -xtrajudicial Killing.--There were no reports of political
 killings by police.
 However, a pattern of deliberate mob violence against Serbs who sought to return
 to their prewar homes continued throughout the year in the Croat-majority town of
 Drvar and erupted with particular virulence in April. Tensions had grown since late
 1997, with large-scale spontaneous returns from the RS and' Serbia-Montenegro of
 the municipality's prewar Serb residents. In April two elderiy Serbs were-murdered
 in their home, which was burned. The police detained 18, persons for suspected
 arson in November; 7 were juveniles between the ages of 9 and 12 and cannot under
 law be detained or prosecuted. All of the remaining 11 were eventually released,
 while at year's end investigation of the case by Federation police continued. After
 
 
 1169
 the international community responded with the removal of the Croat deputy
 mayor, under authority granted to the Office of the High Representative by the
 Peace Implementation Council in Bonn in December 1997, mob violence occurred,
 orchestrated by Croat hard-liners. The Croats, including some displaced by the re-
 turning Serbs, set fire to and otherwise vandalized Serb housing and the premises
 of international and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) (see Section 4). They
 physically assaulted Serbs, including the mayor, and international organization rep-
 resentatives. International monitors and Serbs claimed to have seen nonuniformed
 Croat personnel from the Bosnian Federation Army in the mobs. The response of
 Bosnian Croat police during the rioting was deemed inadequate by the IPTF. Fed-
 eration authorities acknowledged that some Drvar police officers were involved and
 were under investigation.
 Several Croat returnees were killed in Bosniak-dominated Travnik in 1997. Vio-
 lence continued in only a slightly diminished form in the Travnik area during the
 year. In April an explosive device seriously injured two Bosnian Croats after they
 entered a home during a return-related assessment visit. On July 31 a bomb ex-
 ploded near a mosque, killing a Croat police officer in Travnik. Subsequently Bos-
 nian Croat police officers refused to return to their Travnik station due to fear for
 their safety. The Croat police officers demanded, among other conditions, the depor-
 tation of all "Arabs" from the country before they returned to work. On August 3
 a Bosniak returnee was chased down and beaten to death by attackers in Brcko.
 Police arrested four Bosnian Serb suspects, including two youths, for the killing. A
 grenade attack in the Croat-majority town of Capljina in October killed one Bosniak
 returnee and injured three others. The killing occurred a day after Croats erected
 a roadblock near Capljina to protest the Bosniak returns. The MSU (Multinational
 Specialized Unit)-a specialized public security unit of the NATO-led SFOR-
 cleared the road after local authorities failed to respond to the crisis (see Section
 2.d.). Croats retaliated the next day with the grenade attack, and there were also
 several explosions and shootings. Local residents and international observers wit-
 nessed the mayor of Capljina, Krunoslav Kordic, stirring up crowds of Croat dis-
 placed persons on October 2, just before the grenade attack.
 Many, if not most, of the perpetrators of numerous killings and other brutal acts
 committed in previous years remained unpunished, including those responsible for
 the up to 7,000 persons missing and presumed killed by the Bosnian Serb Army
 after the fall of Srebrenica and those responsible for up to 13,000 others still miss-
 ingand presumed killed as a result of "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia.
 During the year, there were increased efforts on the part of SFOR to apprehend
 perpetrators of wartime atrocities. SFOR's more aggressive approach of apprehend-
 ing individuals indicted by the ICTY, which began in the summer of 1997, resulted
 during the year in the apprehension of 12 indictees out of the 83 publicly indicted
 by the Tribunal. The year began with the arrest of Goran Jelic, Milan Simic,
 Miroslav Tadic, Simo Zaric, Dragoljub Kunarac, Miroslav Kvocka, Mladen Radic,
 Zoran Zigic, Milojica Kos, Milorad Krnojelac, Stevan Todorovic, and finally Radislav
 Krstic in December. Eight of these were detained forcibly, and four turned them-
 selves in to NATO troops. This brought the total number of indictees taken into cus-
 tody since the Tribunal's inception to 35. Krstic, who was under sealed indictment,
 was a current high-ranking general in the' Bosnian Serb army and one of the high-
 est Bosnian Serb officials brought to The Hague. At year's end there were 23 per-
 sons in ICTY custody awaiting trial or on trial. Two persons in custody died during
 the year, one as a result of an aneurysm and one as a result of suicide. One indictee,
 Slobodan Miljkovic, was killed in a barroom brawl in Kragujevac, Serbia in August.
 There were 31 public indictees still at large at year's end. ICTY this year issued
 three convictions (Zdravko Mucic, Hazim Delic, and Esad Landzo) and one acquittal
 (Zejnil Delalic) in the Celibici trial for crimes committed against Bosnian Serbs, and
 Anto Furundzija was also convicted in the second half of the year. This brings the
 total number of convictions to five since ICTY's inception. The arrests of Milorad
 Krnojelac and General Radisav KIstic led to protests by Serbs, during which prop-
 erty was damaged and mobs threatened international civilian observers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of poitically motivated disappearances
 during the year.
 The OHR in late 1997 took the lead in forging an agreement among the Bosniak,
 Bosnian Groat, and Bosnian Serb commissions for missing persons to expedite cross-
 entity IEBL exhumations. By October over 1,300 bodies had been found as a result.
 Gross-entity exhumations and those carried out by authorities in their respective en-
 tities resulted in over 3,000 bodies being recovered during the year.
 In addition to those killed in Srebrenica and Zepa, the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that since 1995 it received requests from family
 members to trace 19,934 persons missing from the war years: 1,882 of these persons
 
 
 1170
 were accounted for (243 of whom were found alive). The ICRC noted that Serb,
 Croat, and Bosniak authorities were in a position to provide more information in
 response to its inquiries, particularly those concerning 432 persons, known to have
 been detained at one time in connection with .the war, who remained missing.
 The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) funds the interentity
 exhumations process, provides support to families of the missing, and puts political
 pressure on Bosnian officials to provide information on missing persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the-right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhu-
 man treatment or punishment; however, in all areas of the country, police and pris-
 on officials abused and physically mistreated persons at the time of arrest and dur-
 ing detention. In the RS, police at times used torture. Police in Sarajevo, Neretva,
 and Tuzla cantons investigated allegations of police abuse or criminal activity and
 dismissed officers found guilty.
 The IPTF made some progress in attempts to investigate allegations of police in-
 volvement-in the abuse of suspects. In October IPTF investigators concluded that
 RS police officers brutally tortured-some of the seven detainees who were arrested
 for the August 7 murder of Pale Public Security Center Deputy Chief Srdjan
 Knezevic. RS police held 7 of 16 suspects incommunicado, tortured them, and forced
 them to sign statements. The police reportedly used pliers and stun guns in addition
 to beatings. IPTF investigators were denied access to the detainees until 8 days
 after the arrests. The IPTF team concluded that there was no physical evidence to
 implicate any of the seven men in the murder and that there were glaring contradic-
 tions, omissions, and rewrites in -the official police reports. At the request of the
 IPTF,.in September the RS Interior Minister removed his chief of uniformed police
 for involvement in this torture. The RS Interior Ministry professional standards unit
 completed an in-depth investigation into this torture. The unit's report rec-
 ommended bringing criminal charges against the former chief of uniformed police
 and two police officers and taking disciplinary action against six others.
 On July 6 the RS Minister of Interior suspended 17 Teslic police officers, includ-
 ing the chief of police and his deputy, ending an investigation by an RS public
 prosecutor for human rights violations. In the previous 12 months the IPTF inves-
 tigated three separate incidents involving citizens who were physically abused while
 in the custody or care of the Teslic police. Of the 17 officers suspended, 10 were
 being considered for criminal prosecution.
 On October 2, Croat police officers from Capljina stopped a police car under IPTF
 escort on its way to Mostar, following an outbreak of violence over Bosniak return-
 ees in Capljina (see Sections L.a. and 2.d.). The local-police officers beat the occu-
 pants of the vehicle, the president of the Capljina board of the SDA and member
 of the Federation Parliament Omer Cerva and two Bosniak police officers, in the
 presence of Police Chief Stanislav Buntic. The three were detained for allegedly hav-
 ing hand grenades in the police vehicle and were later released. IPTF monitors wit-
 nessed the events but were unable to intervene. Police took the three Bosniak men
 behind closed doors inside the police station and denied -the IPTF access. Police
 Chief Buntic attempted to keep IPTF monitors from staying on the premises, but
 they remained. IPTF Commissioner, Richard Monk decertified Buntic, and IPTF
 human rights officers were investigating the case (see Section 4).
 Serb police continued to employ excessive force to prevent Bosniak former resi-
 dents from returning to, or staying in, RS territory. Similar patterns of abuse oc-
 curred in Croat-majority areas. Police in- Stolac proved unwilling or unable to con-
 fain the numerous instances of arson designed to intimidate returnees. Reacting to
 this situation and a refusal by authorities to address similar crimes from 1996 and
 1997, the IPTF replaced the Stolac Chief of Police in February, and the OHR re-
 moved the mayor in March. After the situation failed to improve, the cantonal inte-
 rior minister removed the replacement police chief in July. There also were in-
 stances in which police did not act to halt mob violence. For example, in April Bos-
 nian Croat police reportedly were present when mobs beat and terrorized Bosnian
 Serb returnees to Drvar.
 Moreover, in addition to attacks on members of other ethnic groups committed in
 both entities, Serbs in the RS threatened members of international organizations.
 Upon entering Srebrenica on January 16 to discuss the installation of a new munici-
 pal government, IPTF vehicles containing officers and an vehicle containing staff
 from the Organization for Security-and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were stoned
 by an angry mob of Serbs blocking the road into the city (see Section 4).
 On the night of December 3 in the eastern RS town of Vlasenica Serb demonstra-
 tors destroyed one IPTF vehicle in protest of SFOR's arrest and transport to The
 Hague of General Krstic. On December 4, a mob of approximately 500 Serbs at-
 tacked a European Community Monitoring Mission (EC) vehicle and harassed
 
 
 1171
 two ECMM monitors and their interpreter. The vehicle reportedly was destroyed.
 In this instance, local Serb police intervened to protect the ECMM group and es-
 corted its members to safety in the Zvornik police station. There were no reported
 injuries. The June 15 SFOR arrest of Milorad Krnojelac on charges of war crime
 activities ignited an angry response by a crowd of Serbs in Foca. The crowd threw
 rocks and other items at the Foca IPTF and OSCE offices and burned an IPTF
 truck. OSCE personnel were evacuated temporarily.
 At times some police officers impeded the enforcement of the law. An October 8
 attempted eviction of a Croat family in Gornji Vakuf underscored the ongoing ethnic
 divide between Bosniak and Croat police in central Bosnia. The town is equally di-
 vided between Bosniaks and Croats, as is the police force. While Bosniak police offi-
 cers were ready to evict Croat occupants who were occupying a Bosniak house ille-
 gally, they were prevented from doing so by 15 Croat police officers positioned at
 the apartment. No Croat police officer would participate in the eviction. The Croat
 commander of the police force refused to carry out the eviction order of the Bosniak
 Chief of Police. Federation Deputy Minister of Interior Fabijan Trbara, who is a
 Croat, also refused to take action. As tensions mounted, the chief of police decided
 to call off the eviction process. The IPTF local commander recommended to his head-
 quarters that the recalcitrant officers be decertified.
 The IPTF made significant progress in its efforts to restructure and professional-
 ize the police. All Federation and RS police were being provided with human dignity
 and basic skills training. The IPTF continued its certification of Federation and RS
 police. This process involved written and psychological examinations, as well as
 background. checks. In December the Federation Police Academy, guided by the
 IPTF, graduated its first class, with 66 men and 31 women of representing different
 -ethnic backgrounds. The Federation police includes Croat, as well as Bosniak, offi-
 cers and generally reflects the appropriate ethnic mix within each canton. However,
 the police forces throughout the country generally do not reflect the higher stand-
 ards of ethnic representation required by various agreements. The IPTF has devel-
 oped a minority police return program in cooperation with the Refugee Return Task
 Force as a means of recruiting minority police officers. The current class of the Fed-
 eration Police Academy is made up primarily of officers who will serve in police
 forces where they will be in the minority. Eight of 10 Federation cantons agreed to
 create ethnically mixed police units. The Interior Ministry and most cantons aggres-
 sively sought to increase their numbers of Serb police officers as well. The IPTF also
 achieved full ethnic integration of the police force in the internationally supervised
 city of Brcko.
 Police restructuring moved more slowly in the RS. The IPTF completed profes-
 sional certification, background checks, and training of police in the cities of Banja
 Luka, Trebinja, Doboj, Mrkonjic Grad, and Prijedor. The chief of police in Serb-ma-
 jority Banja Luka interviewed Bosniak candidates to join his force. In December RS
 political leaders signed a framework agreement with the IPTF on police restructur-
 ing, reform, and democratization in the RS. This new agreement is intended to cre-
 ate a more professional and ethnically mixed police force.
 Individual and mob violence continued to be a widespread problem. According to
 human rights NGO's, in May an elderly Serb woman was beaten in Kljuc after a
 crowd of approximately 150 Bosniaks gathered to protest a visit of more than 50
 Bosnian Serbs to the town.
 A large number of bombings caused injuries. In June a newly returned Croat po-
 liceman was injured seriously when his personal vehicle was booby-trapped. His
 Bosniak colleague who was riding with him in the vehicle was also badly hurt. No
 one was arrested for the crime. Some 70 bombings took place in the Croat-majority
 town of Stolac during the year. A November 7 bombing injured two Bosniaks. On
 November 11 a bombing in Poprati, near Stolac, injured another Bosniak recent re-
 turnee. The bombings appeared to be part of an organized campaign to obstruct
 Bosniak returns. Criminal charges were brought in May against 5 persons for their
 role in a bombing in Croat-dominated West Mostar in 1997 in which more than 50
 persons were injured. All five were foreign residents of Middle Eastern origin. One
 of the five was reportedly a fugitive at the time the charges were brought. Although
 three of the five were convicted (one in absentia), Bosnian Croats criticized the sen-
 tences for being too light-only 5 to 7 years-for this massive car bomb.
 Conditions in Federation and RS prisons are well below minimum international
 standards.
 International community representatives were given widespread and for the most
 part unhindered access to detention facilities and prisoners in the RS as well as in
 the Federation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were fewer cases of arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention in both the Federation and the RS compared with 1997. In prior
 
 
 1172
 years, police in both entities enjoyed great latitude based on Communist-era- crimi-
 nal procedure laws that permitted them to detain persons for up to 6 months with-
 out bringing formal charges against them. The Federation revised these laws, re-
 moving this power from police, although not from investigative judges. The deten-
 tion laws remain in force in the RS.d t                                    -
 In October Radio Free Euope p art-time reporter Nikola Gurovic was arrested at
 the Sarajevo airort on charges that he had not presented valid vouchers to justify'
 expenses he had claimed from Federation public television (RTV BiB) in 1992. The
 Independent Union of Prfessional Journalists issued a protest following the action.
 The Union demanded that judicial and police authorities offer a public explanation
 of why Gurovic had been targeted for prosecution, Since many otherindividuals had
 left the country in that period without.having settled personal accounts. The Union
 described his arrest as an attack on the freedom ofjournalists. Gurovic was released
 after a day.              a                                            .
 Human rights NGO's contend that thereare cases in which persons who osten-
 sibly are detained on criminal charges actually are incarcera  or political reasons.
 For example, Ibrahim Diedovic, aparliamentary deputy for the Democratic National
 Union (DNZ), which the ruling Bosniak SDA views as a renegade party due to its
 activities during the war, was arrested and jailed in May 1997 for war crimes, after
 he arrived in Sarajevo to take up his parliamentary seat. The ICTY investigated
 Djedovic and decided not to arrest him for his alleged activities. Most local and
 international observers believe that Djedovic was arrested due to his political afllli
 ation and not because of alleged war crimes. The Sarajevo cantonal court convicted
 and sentenced Djedovic to 10 years in October. He rxmained free at year's end pend-
 ing a ppeal of his conviction "to the Federation Supreme Court and currently serves
 as a DNZ deputy in the Federation House of Representatives.
 There were no report  that forced exile generally was used as a legal punishment.
 However, in some areas of the RS, Serb authorities and civilians attempted to expel
 Bosniaks. ;Fpr example, in Teslic Serb citizens "and members of the civil protection
 unit from nearby vilages intimidated or attempted to evict mostly Bosniak families.
 In July the RS Interior Minister removed 12 officers from the Teslic police for their
 inaction in stopping this incident and possible involvement in the violence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TFrial.-Both the Federation and RS constitutions provide
 for an independent judiciary; however, holdover practices from the Communist and
 wartime eras, during which .the executive and the leading political parties exerted
 influence over the judicial system, persisted in all areas. Party affiliation and politi-
 cal connectioiis weighed heavily in the appointment of prosecutors and judges.
 The existing judicial hierarchy in the Federation consists of municipal courts,
 which have original jurisdiction in most civil and criminal cases, cantonal courts,
 which have appellate jurisdiction over thle canton's- municipalities, and tbree federal
 courts, (Constitutional, Supreme, and Human Rights--although.the third of these
 has not yet been established). The Federation Constitution provides for the appoint-
 ment of judges by the President, with the concurrence of the Vice President and the
 approval of the Assembly, to  an initial teirm of 5 years. Judges may be reappointed
 following this initial term to serve until the age of 70.
 The RS judicial hierarchy includes a Supreme Court to provide for the unified en-
 forcement of the law and a Constitutional Court to assure conformity of laws, regu-
 lations, and general enactments with the Constitution. The RS has both municipal
 and district courts, with the district courts having appellate jurisdiction. Judges are
 appointed and recalled by the National Assembly and have life' tenure. According
 to the OHR, 32 percent of the RS judgeships were vacant as of October.
 In July the Federation Parliament adopted legislation that revised the Federa-
 tion's Criminal Codes and procedures. The international community began an inten-
 sive tr-aining program to familiarize judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys with
 the new codes. Similar legislation had not yet been considered by the RS Par-
 liament. Some NGO's expressed concern over the judicial selection process in eight
 federation cantons, especially in" Sarajevo and Tuzia. Legal  experts argued that the
 law  on judicial selection in those two cantons were inconsistent with the canton
 and Federationl Constitutions.                -..
 Both the Federation and RS Constitution- provide for open and public trials and
 give the accused the right to legal counisel:
 In 1997 an RS municipal court in the town of.Zvornik found seven Bosniaks guilty
 of murdering four Serb civilians "in May 1996 and of possessing illegal weapons.
 Human rights groups found the court's proceedings deeply flawed and called for a
 new trial. They pointed to the lack of evidence against the defendants, apart from
 confessions apparently coerced through torture, as well as the courfs refusal to
 allow effective representation by lawyers chosen by the defendants. Three of the de-
 fendantswere Sentenced to 21 years each for murder; the other four men were given
 
 
 1173
 
 1-year sentences for illegal possession of firearms but freed because they had served
 11 months in jail while awaiting trial. In January following the intervention of the
 Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bijeljina district
 court ordered a new trial, acknowledging that the defendants had been deprived of
 their right to choose their counsel. In late December the Bijeljina court found three
 of the seven defendants guilty of murder and one guilty of attempted murder.
 Human rights monitors judged this trial seriously procedurally flawed, noting that
 there was no evidence presented to link the accused to the crime scene, and that
 the case rested on confessions obtained under torture. The defendants planned to
 appeal the Bijeijina district court's verdict to the RS Supreme Court. The Office of
 the Human Rights Ombudsperson had not issued a report on the new developments
 in the case by year's end; such a report could recommend a new trial.
 Human rights organizations reported that judicial institutions in both entities
 were controlled or influenced by the ruling parties. As a result, they were often re-
 luctant or unwilling to try cases of human rights abuse referred to them. A lack of
 resources and a huge backlog of unresolved cases provided a convenient excuse for
 judicial inaction. Even when the courts rendered a fair judgment, local officials often
 refused to implement their decisions. This was especially the case for those who won
 decisions mandating eviction of illegal occupants from their property. In addition,
 organized crime elements sought to pressure judges, especially in central Bosnia.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides for the right to "private and family
 life, home and correspondence," and the right to protection of property. These rights
 generally were observed better in the Federation than in the RS.
 Despite real progress on property issues, authorities in many places continued to
 use their control over "socially owned" and privately owned housing occupied by dis-
 placed persons or other nonowners to slow down or block minority returns. While
 the main problem continued to be the large number of displaced persons in relation
 to available housing, all three ethnic groups used the control of housing as a major
 instrument for political influence peddling and enrichment. Even with the adoption
 of new property laws in both the Federation and the RS, progress remained slow
 due to sluggish implementation and obstruction by the authorities.
 As in 1997, due to minimal numbers of returnees to the RS-because few minori-
 ties dared to return there-the most frequent cases of intimidation against return-
 ees occurred in Bosnian Croat-controlled areas-particularly in the Herzegovina re-
 ion. Suspected Croat hard-liners mined or destroyed returnees' houses in Drvar,
 apljina, and Stolac. Following Croatia's soccer victory against Germany in July in
 the World Cup tournament, a Croat mob went on a rampage in Stolac, attacking
 and vandalizing the houses of recent Bosniak returnees. Police did not respond.
 With pressure by the OHR and a newly elected pro-Dayton Government in the
 RS early in the year, telephone service and correspondence between the Federation
 and the RS improved although the RS Government continued to hinder some com-
 munication. After 100 badly needed telephone lines were installed with inter-
 national assistance, the RS still had not connected the service by year's end.
 Throughout the country, political party membership was considered the surest
 way to obtain, retain, or regain employment, especially in the management of so-
 cially owned enterprises. Membership was also influential in obtaining or keeping
 housing.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; this right was respected partially in the Federation and in the west-
 ern RS, but less so in the eastern RS. Within the Federation, press freedom was
 more severely restricted in Croat-majority areas. Some progress was made in estab-
 lishing independent media in Federation cantons with a Bosniak majority and in
 the RS, particularly in Banja Luka. The primary restraints on press freedom are
 control of the principal media by governing political parties and, in the case of news-
 papers, the unwillingness of Governments in either entity to provide access to kiosk
 networks under their control. Party-controlled media-particularly Croatian state
 radio and television-are the dominant electronic media and information source in
 Croat-majority areas of the Federation. While coverage of the September elections
 by nationalistic media was improved from 1997, most media continued to be strong-
 ly biased.
 The Dnevni Avaz newspaper, distributed widely in the Federation, was controlled
 largely by the ruling SDA party. Some opposition and independent newspapers oper-
 ate in the Bosniak-majority areas of the Federation and in the RS, principally in
 Banja Luka. Oslobodjenje and Vecernje Novine are the leading independent dailies,
 
 
 1174
 
 and Dani and Slobodna Bosna are the most influential independent magazines in
 the Federation. One of the few independent magazines in the RS was Reporter, a
 weekly published by a former foreign correspondent of the Belgrade-based independ-
 ent Vreme, while Nezavisne Novine is an independent newspaper published in the
 western RS. Also in the RS, the Social-Liberal Party published an opposition maga-
 zine, Novi Prelom, and the Social Democratic Party published a daily newspaper.
 Both of these publications take an independent line and are consistently supportive
 of the Dayton Accords.
 It was difficult for independent and opposition media in the RS to gain access to
 the government-controlled kiosk distribution system. The same was true of some
 areas of the Federation, particularly in Croat-controlled regions. Some independent
 media in the two entities, for example, Dani and Reporter, assist in the distribution
 of each other's publications in their respective entities.
 In order to better regulate all broadcast media, the OHR in June established the
 Independent Media Commission (IMC), whose functions and responsibilities include
 licensing all broadcasters; drawing up codes of practice for broadcasters and other
 media; managing and assigning frequencies for broadcasting purposes; and ensuring
 adherence to license conditions.
 Prior to 1998 the dominant nationalist political parties exercised strong control
 over television and radio. Federation state television (RTV Bill) faithfully served the
 interests of the SDA. The RTV Bill gave preferential coverage to SDA leaders and
 greatly limited reports on the opposition. However, in June jointPresidency mem-
 bers Alija Izetbegovic and Kresmir Zubak signed an OHR-drafted Memorandum of
 Understanding (MOU) for restructuring the RTV BiH which, in effect, is to be the
 basis for a Federation-wide television network independent of political party control.
 The MOU also is designed to be the basis for a nationwide network later on. The
 OHR in July appointed an 11-member interim Board of Governors, which is to guide
 the network until the establishment of a public corporation.
 Croat-controlled areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina are covered by Croatian State Tele-
 vision (HRT). The three HRT channels come into the country by means of an over-
 the-border terrestrial broadcasting satellite, and an extensive rebroadcasting oper-
 ation managed by the Mostar-based, Zagreb-controlled Erotel company. HRT's news
 programs and editorials frequentiy criticize the Dayton Accords. A December deci-
 sion by the IMC is intended to terminate the direct rebroadcast of Croatian State
 Television by requiring that RTV Bill and Croat television broadcasters establish
 a Federation television system that meets the needs of all Bill citizens.
 Until SFOR acted in 1997 on an OHR request to end offensive broadcasts by RS
 government-run Serb Radio-Television (SRT), the SRT followed the line of the then-
 ruling SDS Party, with frequently inaccurate and inflammatory reporting. The SRT
 sought to undercut the Dayton Accords by covering events in the Federation in the
 "international" portion of the news. Following SFOR'S action, the OHR implemented
 a plan to restructure the SRT that included the appointment of an international ad-
 ministrator to oversee management of the station until the completion of restructur-
 ing. In the interim, only the SRT station in Banja Luka was authorized to continue
 broadcasting. Despite the presence of an OHR-appointed international administrator
 at the helm of SRT, its restructuring has stalled.
 The international donor-supported television Open Broadcast Network (OBN)-
 which now has 13 affiliates located in both the Federation and the RS-provides
 independent news and public affairs programming. The OBN was launched by the
 international community to be a cross-entity broadcaster and source of objective
 news. Thanks to an expanded area of coverage and improved programming, OBN
 viewership rose during the year. By November OBN could be seen by 80 percent
 of the population. The OBN still is working to improve its broadcast range.
 Other independent television outlets include TV Hayat, TV X, Studio 99, and sev-
 eral small TV stations scattered around the country. These broadcasters were origi-
 nally municipal stations. They have not yet been fully privatized, and their legal
 ownership status remains unclear.
 Radio broadcasting in the Bosniak-majority areas of the Federation-particularly
 in Sarajevo, Zenica, and Tuzla-is diverse. Opposition viewpoints are reflected in
 the news programs of independent broadcasters. Independent or opposition radio
 stations broadcast in the RS-particularly in Banja Luka and Trebinje. Nezavisni
 Radio, Nezavisna Televizija, and Radio Pegas report a wide variety of political opin-
 ions. Local radio stations broadcast in Croat-majority areas, but they are usually
 highly nationalistic. Local Croat authorities do not tolerate opposition viewpoints.
 While some foreign journalists who represent recognized media were able to travel
 freely to most areas of the country, others encountered difficulties. Local police and
 security officials in the RS and West Mostar harassed journalists associated with
 opposition parties or minority ethnic groups.
 
 
 1175
 
 In September RS police and security officials detained three members of an RTV
 Bili crew covering the elections in Banja Luka for alleged "rudeness and aggressive-
 ness." They were held at a facility where police claimed they "voluntarily" erased
 some of their camera footage. The three were released following intervention by the
 OSCE mission.
 In October Radio Free Europe part-time reporter Nikola Gurovic was arrested at
 the Sarajevo airport on charges that he had not presented valid vouchers to justify
 expenses he had claimed from the RTV-BiH in 1992. The Independent Union of Pro-
 fessional Journalists protested that Gurovic had been singled out for arrest for a
 common offense. Gurovic was released after a day (see Section 1.d.). In October in
 Capljina two journalists were arrested because they had not first registered with the
 police.
 Academic freedom was constrained. In the Federation, Serbs and Croats com-
 plained that SDA party members receive special treatment in appointments and
 promotions at the University of Sarajevo. The University of Banja Luka limits its
 appointments to Serbs. All institutions suffer from a lack of resources and staff, as
 well as the legacy of the Communist period. Officials at the University of (West)
 Mostar endeavor to ensure that very few non-Croats work or study there.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly; however, there were some limits imposed on this
 right in practice. In the period prior to the September national elections, opposition
 political parties enjoyed greater latitude in staging rallies and campaigning than
 they had during the 1996 national elections. However, there were still instances in
 which incumbents attempted to use their positions to hinder the activities of opposi-
 tion parties. In September the OSCE's election appeals subcommission (under the
 authority of Dayton Annex 3) required the resignation of the mayor of Milici, in the
 RS, for seeking to block an opposition rally in the town.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and a wide range of social,
 cultural, and political organizations functioned without interference; however, indi-
 rect pressure constrained the activities of some groups. Although political party
 membership was not forced, many viewed membership in the leading party of any
 given area as the surest way for residents to obtain and keep housing and high-
 level jobs in the state-owned sector of the economy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing private and public worship, and, in general, individuals enjoyed this right in
 their religious majority areas. However, the efforts of individuals to worship in
 areas in which they are an ethnic/religious minority were restricted, sometimes by
 societal violence. Some incidents resulted in damage to religious edifices and ceme-
 teries (see Section 5).
 In July local government authorities and Bosnian Serb protesters in Banja Luka
 prevented the burial of the mufti of Banja Luka in a Muslim cemetery in that city.
 Demonstrators broke into an Islamic community building and harassed mourners.
 The body of the mufti subsequently was interred in Sarajevo. In* November the
 Human Rights Chamber (see Section 4) held a public hearing in Banja Luka to hear
 the Islamic community's case against RS authorities for impairing its ability to re-
 construct mosques and other community-owned buildings destroyed during the war
 in the Banja Luka area.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for "the right to liberty of movement and res-
 idence" and freedom of movement, including across the IEBL, continued to improve,
 with a notable increase in vehicular traffic. The IPTF and SFOR completed the dis-
 mantling of all permanent fixed police checkpoints, greatly enhancing freedom of
 movement. However, for most minorities movement across the IEBL and into areas
 dominated by other ethnic groups remained somewhat limited and cautious in prac-
 tice. While there were improvements in freedom of movement in most areas of the
 Federation and in the western RS, and a growing acceptance of the right to return,
 the eastern RS remained under hard-line control and unwelcoming to a minority
 presence.
 The most important development during the year to increase freedom of move-
 ment was the June 1 introduction of universal license plates. By August 1 an esti-
 mated 75 percent of the drivers throughout the country had the new plates which,
 unlike the previous ones, do not identify the vehicles as being registered in predomi-
 nantly Bosniak, Bosnian Serb, or Bosnian Croat areas. The U.N. Mission in Bosnia-
 Herzegovina (UNMIBH) reported that in the first week after the inauguration of the
 new plates, about 4,000 vehicles crossed the IEBL, and in the first week of July this
 number increased to 8,000. By year's end, freedom of movement had noticeably im-
 proved.
 
 
 1176
 Statistics on refugee returns remained difficult to obtain. By midyear an esti-
 mated 1.4 million Bosnian citizens still were displaced internally or were refugees
 abroad. Most faced either relocation within the country or "minority return," i.e., re-
 turn to areas in which another ethnic group was dominant politically or demo-
 graphically.
 In the first 5 months of the year, there were approximately 11,000 registered mi-
 nority returns and over 60,000 total returns. In view of the number of spontaneous
 unregistered returns, the number of actual minority returns was probably higher.
 However, the goal of 50,000 minority returns in 1998 was not met. At year's end,
 only between approximately 30,000 and 35,000 minority returns had been reg-
 istered, all but about 1,000 to the Federation. By midyear UNHCR field reporting
 also indicated that 30,000 to 40,000 minorities were engaged in the "implementation
 of return," meaning involvement in a concrete activity indicating genuine intention
 to return, such as housing repair, planting of fields, or spending the night at prewar
 homes.
 Refugees from Europe, particularly from Germany, also returned to the country.
 This movement began to grow during the summer, following the end of the school
 year. Although by July there had been only an estimated 30,000 returns from
 abroad, it was estimated that-between 140,000 and 220,000 returned by the year's
 end as a-result of pressure to depart from host countries. Most of those returning
 from Europe were unable to return to-their prewar homes. Some deliberately were
 directed by hard-line political authorities of their own ethnic group to areas where
 -an effort at repopulation was still underway, to consolidate the results of ethnic
 cleansing.
 The UNHCR "open cities" initiative, begun in 1997, linked economic assistance to
 cooperation on minority return (positive conditionality) and helped the UNHCR's ef-
 fort to break down the influence of ethnic separatists. However, in October the
 UNHCR rescinded the open city status of Vogosca, a suburb of Sarajevo, due to its
 noncompliance with agreements on minority returns. Of 228 minority families who
 were scheduled to return there, only 24 were registered by mid-October.
 Several factors prevented a larger number of returns, including canton level con-
 trol over allocation of socially owned property, and, in the Federation, the lack of
 cooperation in hard-line areas in implementing obligations set forth in cantonal re-
 turn plans and new property laws.
 The February 1998 Sarajevo declaration was intended to showcase Sarajevo as a
 model city in terms of tolerance. The declaration was to provide for improvements
 in areas that hindered return: Legislation, housing, security and public order, em-
 ployment, and education, with a goal of 20,000 minority returns for the canton dur-
 ing the year. However, of 2,186 minority families registered to return, only 804 mi-
 nority families returned to socially owned apartments and 414 toprivately owned
 houses in Sarajevo canton. Of roughly 21,000 claims for return of property, only
 7,000 decisions were issued. Due to a allure to meet most of the benchmarks of the
 declaration, the international community temporarily froze reconstruction funds for
 the canton in July.
 During the year the Federation army unlawfully took control of 4,000 former
 Yugoslav military (JNA) apartments that had been abandoned and repaired by a
 Dutch company. Prewar residents continue to wait to return to these, while authori-
 ties encourage occupants to start the purchasing process. After inadequate action by
 local authorities, several of these cases were brought before the Human Rights
 Chamber. No returns have taken place to former JNA apartments. The military has
 attempted to evict legal occupants.
 The continued influence of ethnic separatists in positions of authority also hin-
 dered minority returns. Much of Croat-controlled Herzegovina and all of the eastern
 RS remained resistant to minority returns. Displaced persons living in those areas,
 even those who privately indicated interest in returning to their prewar homes, fre-
 quently were pressured to remain displaced, while those who wished to return were
 discouraged, often through the use of violence (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.). The in-
 creased number of ethnically integrated police forces helped improve the climate for
 return, but security in general remained inadequate in many areas. The lack of an
 ethnically neutral curriculum in public schools also discouraged returns.
 On October 1 in the municipality of Capijina, Croats erected a roadblock on the
 main north-south road in the Federation to protest Bosniak returns. According to
 the OHR, 100 Bosniaks were returning in a preannounced move to villages near
 Capljina. SFOR sent in Italian troops to reestablish freedom of movement when po-
 lice did not take action. According to an OSCE representative, Croats on the road-
 side pelted the MSU, a specialized security unit of the NATO-led SFOR, with stones
 while they broke up the roadblock. According to SFOR, three MSU troops were in-
 jured. The MSU responded by breaking up the crowd of individuals throwing stones.
 
 
 1177
 Police reported another 13 injuries among local citizens, but SFOR contested this
 report. Croats reacted with violence on the night of October 2, leaving one Bosniak
 returnee dead and two injured (see Sections L.a., 1.c., and 4).
 The continued depressed state of the economy throughout the country and the
 consequent lack of employment opportunity for returnees remained a serious obsta-
 cle to a significant number of returns. As a result, most minority returnees in the
 first half of the year were elderly. This presented a new burden for receiving mu-
 nicipalities. Younger minority group members, who depend on adequate wages from
 employment to support families, generally remained displaced, especially in cases
 where they had managed over the past 6 years to find work.
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials held up the system for issuing new passports,
 which restricted travel outside the country. However, new Bosnia and Herzegovina
 passports were finally issued by each entity at midyear, leading to new opportuni-
 ties for freedom of movement and international travel.
 Officially, the Government grants asylum and refugee status in accordance with
 international standards. At times the Government cooperated with the UNHCR and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The arrival of persons who
 fled the fighting in Kosovo raised the issue of the provision of first asylum. The
 Council of Ministers adopted special instructions that allowed the temporary protec-
 tion of Kosovo refugees until adequate legislation could be adopted. However, by the
 fall, the situation in Kosovo had resulted in an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 Kosovar
 refugees in the country, of whom 5,000 had registered with the UNHCR. Federation
 and cantonal authorities obstructed the UNHCR'S efforts to accommodate the refu-
 gees. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a place where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Even though a permanent election law is not jet in place, the Dayton Accords
 commit the parties to "ensure that conditions exist for the organization of free and
 fair elections, in particular a politically neutral environment' and to ensure the
 right to "vote in secret without fear or intimidation." These rights were respected
 in the national and entity elections in September, which were the most fair and plu-
 ralistic elections since the Dayton Accords were signed. Voter turnout was over 70
 percent with over 83 political parties, independent candidates, coalitions, and alli-
 ances competing for office.
 However, at the same time, continued party control of the media and security ap-
 paratus precluded full citizen participation without intimidation, especially in Bos-
 nian Croat areas and parts of the RS. To varying degrees, hll major parties seek
 to inhibit political activity by other parties in the respective areas where they are
 in control. This was especially true in areas controlled by SDS or HDZ hard-liners.
 Implementation of the election went relatively well, with the exception of Presi-
 dent Poplasen's refusal to nominate a candidate for prime minister with sufficient
 support in the RS Assembly to form a government and the delay in the appoint-
 ments to the Council of Ministers. However, implementation at the national and en-
 tity levels is far less difficult than implementation of municipal election results.
 Problems still are being experienced in implementing the 1997 municipal elections;
 Srebrenica remains without the municipal council mandated by the 1997 elections.
 A framework agreement for the establishment of the council has been accepted in
 principle by all parties, but local Serb intransigence prevented its implementation.
 OSCE and OHR officials expected that the framework agreement would be signed
 at the end of February 1999 and that the first assembly session would be held in
 early March 1999.
 Women generally were underrepresented in government and politics, although a
 few women, such as the former President of the RS, have occupied prominent posi-
 tions. In the three legislatures, women are underrepresented seriously. To address
 this concern, the OSCE election rules required parties to include no fewer than 3
 members of each gender among the top 10 names on their candidate lists. Women's
 representation in legislative assemblies significantly increased from 2 percent in the
 1996 RS National Assembly to 23 percent in 1998, from 5 percent in the 1996 Fed-
 eration House of Representatives to 15 percent in 1998, and from 2 percent in the
 Bill House of Representatives to 26 percent in 1998.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The authorities generally permitted outside investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. International and local NGO's involved in human rights appear to oper-
 ate fairly freely, with few reports of intimidation or harassment. The OHR reports
 
 
 1178
 that foreign government' and NGO human rights monitors were able to travel with-
 out restriction in all areas of the country. International community representatives
 were given widespread and for the most part unhindered access to detention facili-
 ties and prisoners in the RS as well as in the Federation.
 While monitors enjoyed relative freedom to investigate human rights abuses, they
 were rarely successful in persuading the authorities in all regions to respond to
 their recommendations. Monitors'interventions' often met with delays or outright re-
 fusal.
 The United Methodist Committee of Relief (UMCOR) reported that during the
 riots in Drvar on April 24, its office was demolished during the violence. Its comput-
 ers, radios, and cellular telephones either were smashed or stolen. An employee of
 the organization was beaten and threatened. Four UMCOR vehicles also were
 burned during the riots, and a fifth vehicle was stolen (see Section L.a.).
 Upon entering Srebrenica on January 16 to discuss the installation of a new mu-
 iicipal government, IPTF vehicles containing officers and staff were stoned by an
 angry mob of Serbs blocking the road into the city. The coordinated movement of
 the crowd and the presence of loudspeakers indicated that the violence was well or-
 ganized. The RS police response was passive.
 The June 15 SFOR arrest of Milorad Krnojelac on charges of war crimes 'activities
 triggered an angry response by Serbs in Foca, during which IPTF and OSCE offices
 were damaged and an IPTF truck was burned. OSCE personnel were temporarily
 evacuated.
 On December 3-4 in Vlasenica, Serb demonstrators destroyed one IPTF vehicle
 to protest SFOR's arrest and transport to-The Hague of General Krstic, attacked
 a European Community Monitoring Mission (ECCM) vehicle, harassed two ECMM
 monitors and their interpreter, and destroyed their vehicle (see Section 1.c.).
 The caseload of the Human Rights Chamber and the Office of Human Rights
 Ombudsperson, two institutions -created under Annex 6 of the Dayton Accords, ex-
 panded during the year. The Chamber has published 19 final and binding decisions
 involving 36 cases  and ordered the respondent parties to take specific actions in
 cases dealing with such issues as the death penalty, housing rights of JNA veterans,
 arrest and detention, and nonenforcement of judicial decisions. The Office of the
 Ombudsperson has published 35 final reports dealing with individual cases and 13
 reports on more general human rights issues. Applicants to the Chamber must first
 have exhausted other effective domestic remedies before appealing their case to this
 level. Decisions of the Chamber are final and cannot be appealed to the Constitu-
 tional Court. The Chamber has about 1,500 registered cases and has issued 19 final
 case decisions. However, the authorities continued their lack of cooperation and im-
 plemented only about 10 percent of the Chamber's recommendations. The OHR was
 involved in monitoring authorities' responses and coordinating intervention in cases
 in which the authorities failed to meet their obligations to cooperate. The OHR's .Co-
 ordination Center for Human Rights asserted in November that RS authorities were
 impeding the activities of the Human Rights Chamber by not allowing HRC judges
 to enter any territory owned by the Banja Luka municipality before November. In
 addition, the RS Government did not send its delegate to a hearing on November
 9 in Banja Luka before the Human 'Rights Chamber. The hearing was postponed
 on two occasions.
 Cooperation with the ICTY in The Hague is a key factor in the implementation
 of the Dayton Accords and the establishment of respect for human rights. In Feb-
 ruary Prime Minister Dodik altered the RS policy of defiance of the Tribunal and
 the Dayton Accords by instructing his officials to cooperate with the ICTY. He also
 offered office space in Banja Luka to the ICTY. His actions helped to reduce the be-
 hind-the-scenes political influence of former wartime RS President Radovan
 Karadzic and his SDS allies.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The parties agreed in the Dayton Accords to reject discrimination on-such grounds
 as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
 origin, or association with a national minority. There-were nevertheless many cases
 of discrimination.
 Women.-Accurate statistics on violence against women, including spousal abuse
 and rape, are not available. Throughout the country, rape and violent abuse are con-
 sidered criminal offenses. However, domestic violence usually was not reported to
 the authorities, and a sense of shame reportedly prevents some victims of rape from
 coming forward to complain to the authorities. There are laws that prohibit rape
 in both the Federation and the RS. Spousal rape and spousal abuse are also illegal
 in the Federation.
 
 
 1179
 
 Trafficking in women from the former Soviet Union for purposes of prostitution
 apparently is a problem.
 There is little legal or social discrimination against women, and women hold a few
 of the most responsible positions in society, serving as judges, doctors, and profes-
 sors. However, a male-dominated society prevails in both entities, with few women
 in positions of real economic power. Anecdotal evidence indicates that women and
 men receive equal pay at socially owned enterprises but not necessarily at private
 businesses. Women are entitled to 12 months' maternity leave and to work no more
 than 4 hours per day until a child is 3 years old. A woman with underage children
 cannot be forced to do shift work. Women were being integrated into the police force
 at a rapid rate: The first graduating class of the Federation Police Academy in De-
 cember consisted of about one-third women.
 Children.-The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is incorporated by ref-
 erence in the Dayton Accords and has the effect of law in both entities. The end
 of the fighting brought a major improvement in the human rights of children. Dur-
 ing the war nearly 17,000 children were killed, 35,000 wounded, and over 1,800 per-
 manently disabled.
 Children suffer from an extreme paucity of social services, especially the lack of
 adequate care for the mentally retarded. In ethnic majority areas, children who are
 members of the minority group must attend schools in which the educational con-
 tent is skewed toward the values, history, and religious traditions of the local major-
 ity. Education is compulsory through the age of 15 in both the Federation and the
 RS.
 There was no societal pattern of abuse against children. Nonetheless, they con-
 tinue to suffer disproportionately from the societal stress of the postwar era.
 People With Disabilities.-By law the Federation Government is required to assist
 disabled persons to find employment and to protect them against discrimination. In
 the RS discrimination against the disabled also is prohibited by law. In the current
 situation there are few jobs available, and thousands of newly disabled victims en-
 tered the job market after the war. The Government has limited resources to ad-
 dress the special needs of the disabled. There are no legal provisions mandating
 that buildings be made accessible to the physically disabled. Several organizations
 representing disabled persons staged a large demonstration in July inSarajevo to
 urge the Government to set aside funds to upgrade accessibility to public places.
 Religious Minorities.-The Interfaith Council, established in 1997 and composed
 of the main leaders of the country's four religious communities-Muslim, Serbian
 Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Jewish--continued its efforts to promote national
 reconciliation. The OSCE and the OHR facilitated many interfaith meetings at the
 local level as well.
 However, throughout the country, religious minorities felt pressure and were in-
 timidated by the ethnic/religious majority.
 There were instances of mob violence in the RS aimed at preventing Catholics
 from worshiping. A bomb explosion-severely damaged a Roman Catholic Church in
 the central Bsnian.twn of Kakanj in July. On April 23 in Derventa (RS), mob vio-
 lence prevented the holding of a Catholic-ceremony that had been approved by RS
 authorities. Bosnian Serb protesters set up roadblocks to-prevent the Bosnian Croat
 visitors, including Cardinal Puljic, from reaching the church. The violence appeared
 to be a reaction to the earlier-murder of two Bosnian Serbs in Croat-controlled
 Drvar. Similarly, another Bosnian Serb mob prevented Bosnian Croats displaced
 from Slavonski Brod from attending mass at the Plehan monastery near Derventa.
 This action followed a day of rioting against Bosnian Serb returnees in Drvar.
 In Croat-dominated areas of Herzegovina, Muslims felt pressure not to practice
 their reigio n  public. Several incidents of vandalism occurred against Muslim reli-
 gious sites, including at a cemetery in Mostar.
 None of the mosques in  the   destroyed dr nhe war have been rebuilt or re-
 paired, despite requests from the Islamic community for reconstruction (see Section
 2.c.).
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic differences-based to a large degree
 on religious differences-were at the heart of the war and remain a powerful social
 force in the country. Although there have been positive moderating developments
 in both parties, some leaders of the SDS and HDZ still support the concepts of a
 "Greater Serbia" and a "Greater Croatia." These parties, and to a lesser extent the
 primarily Bosniak SDA as well, sought to manipulate the movement of persons and
 the access to housing and social services they control to ensure that the ethnic
 groups with which theyr associated consolidate their position in their respective
 geographic regions. Some hard-line local authorities in the eastern RS and in cer-
 tain Croat-controlled areas of the Federation sought to keep information regarding
 the right to return and conditions in return sites from reaching displaced persons
 
 
 1180
 in their areas, so as to dissuade them from attempting to return to their former
 homes.
 In a growing number of areas, including Sarajevo and Tuzla, Imixed communities
 exist peacefully. Nevertheless, harassment and discrimination against 'minorities
 continue throughout the country. These include desecration of graves, damage to
 houses of worship,- throwing explosive devices into residential areas, harassment,
 dismissal from work, threats, assaults, and, in some cases, killings (see Sections L.a.
 and 1.c.).
 According to the 1997 report of the Federation Human Rights Ombudsmen issued
 in April, "Equality before the law is not observed in the everyday practice of state
 authorities that decide on the rights and obligations of the citizens."
 Incidents of ethnic discrimination often center on property disputes. An RS law
 on abandoned property permitted the return of such property to the original owner
 only if any subsequent occupant willingly departed, without taking into account the
 lack of adequate alternative dwellings for the subsequent occupants. In a number
 of areas, local authorities still use the inability of local displaced communities to re-
 turn to their own homes in other parts of the country as a pretext for refusing to
 allow members of other ethnic groups to return. In December the RS Assembly
 passed one piece of revised property legislation that is an improvement, but that
 now requires full and fair implementation, and will require amendment, according
 to the OHR.
 Some Bosnian Serb and Croat political leaders still discourage displaced persons
 of their own ethnicity from returning to areas where they would be in the minority
 and encourage new arrivals from their groups in areas where they would be in the
 majority. The policy among hard-line Bosnian Croats of not only discouraging Croat
 returns to central Bosnia but of actively recruiting those still living there to resettle
 in Herzegovina, sparked an open dispute among Bosnian Croats, with the Catholic
 Church hierarchy denouncing the practice: Until 1998 the SDS Party, which had
 ruled the RS throughout the war and immediately after it, manipulated information
 and used its control over economic resources and the media to discourage displaced
 Serbs from returning to the Federation. Although the new RS Government is on the
 record as supporting the right to return,,at year's end it had yet to implement plans
 for facilitating minority returns. For their part, Bosniak authorities appear tacitly
 to support some resettlement efforts, including resettlement of returnees, in "strate-
 gic" areas of the Federation,,whereBosniaks are in the minority.
 In some cases opponents of refugee returns employed violence, including sporadic
 house burnings, and orchestrated demonstrations in an effort to intimidate return-
 ees. For example, the UNMIBH reported that in the period from March 26 to June
 30 alone, 61 return-related incidents occurred in Stolac and other municipalities of
 the Herzegovina-Neretva canton. In the course of these incidents, 64 Bosniak houses
 were partly damaged by 'arson or explosives, as well as some neighboring houses
 owned by Bosnian Croats and Serbs, while two Bosniak men were beaten severely
 and another one was injured slightly in an explosion (see Sections L.a. and l.c.). In
 August local police in Drvar arrested a 17-year-old Bosnian Croat for setting a
 building on -fire near the Spasovina cemetery in -the town. The youth confessed to
 setting eight previous fires in the last year and stated that he burned Serb-owned
 buildings because he did not want Serbs to return to Drvar. The two largest compa-
 nies in Croat-controlled territory, the SOKO aircraft factory 'and the aluminum fac-
 tory in Mostar, continue to discriminate against former Bosniak employees seeking
 to return to their prewar jobs. Croats in Ahmici blocked the reconstruction of the
 Bosniak primary school and started their own-illegal construction on the site, which
 was halted in November, but the issle was not resolved by year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Federation and RS Constitutions provide for the
 right of workers to form and join labor unions. The largest union was -the Confed-
 eration of Independent Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heir of the old
 Yugoslav Communist trade union confederation. Unions have the right to strike, but
 there were few strikes during the year because of the economic devastation and job-'
 lessness caused by the war throughout much of the Federation.
 Coal miners-from the Zenica region staged a strike in May to demand higher
 wages. Observers reported that police-used excessive force to break up a march by
 some of the strikers on the Sarajevo highway. The Zenica canton interior minister
 resigned as a result of the criticism.
 Unions may affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There was little 'collective
 bargaining in labor-management negotiations during the year. In both the RS and
 
 
 1181
 the Federation workers have the right to collective bargaining, and the law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination.
 There were no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or-Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits ser-
 vitude or forced labor, including that performed by children. Despite rumors that
 work camps exist in isolated areas, investigations have not turned up any corrobo-
 rating evidence. There were no credible reports of child labor in either entity.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children in the Federation and in the RS was 16 years.
 Children sometimes assisted their families with farm work and odd jobs. Children
 are covered under the Constitution's prohibition of servitude or forced labor, and
 such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage in the Federation
 was $73 (130 DM) until October when it was raised to $112 (200 DM), and the mini-
 mum pension was $46 (80 DM). In the RS, the monthly minimum wage was $34
 (60 DM). The minimum wages were insufficient to provide for a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. Many workers still had claims outstanding for sala-
 ries earned during the war but were being paid in full only for current work. Simi-
 larly, many pensioners had outstanding claims. There are no legal limits on the
 number of hours in the workweek. Overtime pay is not required by law.
 Occupational safety and health regulations were generally ignored because of the
 demands and constraints imposed by an economy devastated by war. Bosnia and
 Herzegovina is a signatory to a-number of International Labor Organization conven-
 tions, including those on labor conditions and labor protection and health. However,
 neither entity has completed passage of new laws to enforce the standards in these
 conventions.
