 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a one-party state ruled by the Viet-
 namese Communist Party (VCP). A 13-member Politburo and a Party Central Com-
 mittee are nominally elected by a party congress held about every 5 years. The Po-
 litburo provides guidelines, often in the form of specific directives, that shape gov-
 ernment policies. Despite the adoption of a new Constitution in 1992 that provides
 for the rule of law and respect for human rights, in practice the Government contin-
 ued to restrict individual rights on national security and other grounds. In addition,
 the Constitution contains references to 'democratic centralism" and "the leading role
 of the Communist Party" that have been used to justify limits on civil liberties.
 In addition to the military and police force, Vietnamese security forces monitor
 internal movements and activities of the general population. The Ministry of Inte-
 rior has units that monitor persons suspected of involvement in political or religious
 affairs. Also, government surveillance through informants, household registration,
 and party-appointed block wardens continued in 1993.
 The Government continued the market-oriented economic reforms begun in 1986.
 These reforms have boosted Vietnam's predominantly agricultural economy and im-
 proved the lives of Vietnamese citizens. Goods and services are more widely avail-
 able, and the general population is freer to engage in entrepreneurial activity.
 Although some senior SRV officiais have publicly asserted the profound commit-
 ment of the Vietnamese people and State to the cause of human rights, the Govern-
 ment continued to violate human rights in 1993. The authorities continued to limit
 severely freedom of spech, press, assembly, and association, as well as worker
 rights and the right or citizens to change their government. The Government contin-
 ued its longstanding practice of not tolerating dissent and reacted sharply to efforts
 by Buddhist activists to assert their independence from the government-sponsored
 Buddhist church. However restrictions on travel eased, and contact with foreigners
 is more widely accepted. Tl'here appears to be increasing separation between the
 party and the State.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In 1993 there were no known execu-
 tions of political prisoners or politically motivated extrajudicial killings. There were
 also no known cases of deaths of political prisoners while in detention in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no documented incidents of political abductions by
 government security organizations or by antigvernment forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits physical abuse, and released reeducation camp detainees report
 that camp conditions have improved since 1989. Although there were no credible,
 consistent reports of police brutality during interrogation of suspects, reports of se-
 vere conditions for those confined in prisons continued. There have been reports of
 coercion to elicit confessions. After their release in 1993, American citizens held on
 political grounds reported that they were threatened with violence several times in
 attempts to coerce confessions, elthough they were not actually beaten.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or E&ile.-In 1993 Vietnam continued to arrest and
 imprison people arbitrarily. The 1989 Criminal Procedure Code and subsequent
 amendments provide for various rights for detainees, including time limits on pre-
 
 
 759
 trial detention, the right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him
 or her, a ban on coercion or corporal punishment, and the right to have a lawyer
 present during interrogation. In practice, however, the authorities frequently ignore
 these safeguards. Credible reports indicate that detainees continue to be held incom-
 municado for indefinite periods without formal charges, with authorities using old
 administrative procedures in contravention of the new legislation. The retention and
 continued use of these administrative procedures appear to be a deliberate govern-
 ment policy.
 The Government continued its efforts to implement Party Directive 135, which
 calls for the arrest of those who incite opposition to the Government or advocate po-
 litical pluralism. Some intellectuals, clergy, journalists, and foreigners have been ar-
 rested and detained. For example, Doan Viet Hoat, a scholar who before 1975 had
 been Vice President of the Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon and had been
 incarcerated in Chi Hoa prison from 1976 to 1988, was rearrested in 1990 and in
 March 1993 was sentenced to 20 years for counterrevolutionary activity, apparently
 related to the "Freedom Forum" case. Dr. Hoat is said to be in poor health. In July
 the local press reported that an Appeals Court had reduced his sentence to 15 years.
 According to reputable international nongovernmental organizations (NGO's),
 Doan Thanh Liem is currently serving a 12-year labor camp sentence after beig
 convicted of spreading anti-Socialist propaganda. Truong Hung Thai, arrested with
 Liem, continues to serve an 8-year sentence. Do Ngoc Long also arrested in April
 1990, was never tried and was released from prison in April 1993 after serving an
 3-year administrative sentence. Ngyen Dan Que, sentenced to 20 years' imprison-
 ment in 1991, was recently transferred to a labor camp in Dong Nal Province; he
 is reportedly in poor health.
 Legislation designed ostensibly to prevent inordinate delays in charging suspects
 is often, if not routinely, ignored in political cases. In April and May 1992, two
 American citizens of Vietnamese origin were arrested along with numerous Viet-
 namese for attempting to organize two separate political movements. Both were
 held until 1993 without ever being formally charged with a crime.
 No official statistics are available on the number of detainees held for alleged
 antigovernment activities, and an accurate account is impossible since arrests are
 not publicized and secret detentions trials, and sentencing are common.
 In June 1993, American citizen lRgyen Sy Binh, arrested in April 1992 for train-
 ing members of the "Peoples' Action Party", a group he founded, was released from
 custody and deported. On November 11, four Catholic priests and brothers of the
 Coredemptrix order were released from prison in Vietnam. Reverend John Doan
 Phu Xuan, Reverend Hilary Do Tri Tam, Brother Luke Vu Son Ha, and Brother
 Mark Tran Khac Kinh were all freed before the expiration of their sentences.
 Search and arrest warrants are provided for in law, but they can be issued by
 branches of the security apparatus without judicial review. Law enforcement and se-
 curity personnel appear to be able to arrest and incarcerate people without present-
 ing warrants for their arrest. Each province and city has a 'security committee"
 under direct party control. This committee includes both central and local security
 officials and does not coordinate its activities with the judicial process.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Vietnamese court system consists of local peo-
 ple's courts, military tribunals, and the Supreme Court. The last may review cases
 from either of the lower courts. Both the National AsE-3mbly and State Council have
 the authority to establish special tribunals which may be superior to the Supreme
 Court. In addition, local mass organizations are empowered to deal with minor
 breaches of law or disputes. Judges in all regular courts are appointed after the
 party organization selects all candidates. Article 130 of the Constitution provides for
 the 'inde   dence" of judges and jurors. However, this is negated at all levels by
 a political system that is closely controlled by the VCP and by a selection process
 that puts a premium on political reliability.
 The Pena ICode consists of the Criminal Code and a Criminal Procedures Code,
 which was amended in 1990. Vietnam has a long-established body of family law but
 lacks civil law codes. There is virtually no evidence that legislative improvements
 promulgated in 1990 have been implemented.
 Prison sentences are frequently imposed by administrative procedure, without
 benefit of due process or judicial review. In addition, such sentences are imposed
 on persons for the peaceful expression of their views. The SRV criminalizes certain
 forms of peaceful expression, including, for example, "anti-Socialist propaganda."
 Over the years people have been sentenced to long prison or reeducation camp
 terms for such 'crimes." For example, after a demonstration in May by approxi-
 mately 300 Buddhists, including monks, several Buddhist monks were arrested for
 
 
 760
 inciting antigovernment unrest. The Government tried four of the monks in Novem-
 ber, and the court announced sentences ranging from 6 months to 4 years in prison.
 Accurate statistics on the total prison population, including pretrial detainees, po-
 litical prisoners, and persons held arbitrarily are not available due to the secrecy
 surrounding these procedures.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In 1993
 the Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and con-
 trol through household registration and party-appointed block wardens who use in-
 formants to keep track of individual activities. In general, reports sugest that the
 system is unevenly implemented throughout the country and that local caprice and
 corruption are significant factors in its application. Urban dwellers appear to be in-
 creasingly relaxea about sending mail overseas and meeting foreign visitors. It ap-
 pears that the Government is combining stricter surveillance, designed in part to
 intimidate potential critics, with some relaxation vis-a-vis the general population.
 While the Government continued to censor mail and confiscate packages in 1993,
 it seems to have done so on a more selective basis than in the past.
 The party expects people to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist
 for villages, city districts, school, work (trade union), youth, and women. However
 these organizations-which disseminate party propaganda, support pay-sanctioned
 activities, and play a watchdog role-have become increasingly ineffectual.
 While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the state sector,
 recruitment of new party members has become more difficult, and many older party
 members have ended their participation in party activities. Membership in the
 youth union-the normal path to VP membership-has dropped sharply over the
 past few years.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, but in practice such freedoms are severely limited.
 A pervasive network of informants chills free speech considerably, although the
 p arty continued to tolerate (and at times invite) criticism concerning its own per-
 formance and that of persons deemed to be corrupt or incompetent. Questioning the
 legitimacy of the VCP or its exclusive vanguard role is not tolerated.
 The Communist Party line and policies are disseminated regularly from the Party
 Central Committee to provinces, cities, and districts through men-randums for in-
 ternal distribution only. Only party members are privy to this information, which
 covers the issues of freedom of speech and press for the citizenry and economic pol-
 icy, as well as party interpretations of changes to the status quo (i.e., dynamic inter-
 pretations to fit current conditions).
 Short of clearly proscribed writing, such as advocacy of a multiparty system, the
 limits of criticism are not clear. Some ideas may be expressed in internal party
 meetings and in internally circulated documents but not publicly. The movements
 and activities of foreign journalists are monitored but seldom interfered with.
 Criticism is occasionally expressed publicly within established forums, such as
 National Assembly proceedings broadcast over the national radio service. The Gov-
 ernment does not use systematic prior censorship to control the media, but guidance
 from party watchdogs is pervasive, and national security legislation is sufficiently
 broad to ensure effective self-censorship.
 The Government controls all broadcast media and does not normally permit the
 broadcast of opposing views, though it has broadcast reports of debates during Na-
 tional Assembly meetings. In addition to government controlled radio (both domestic
 and international), television stations, and the Vietnam news agency wire service,
 Vietnam has five mass daily newspapers and many smaller newspapers. Party orga-
 nizations and the Ministries of Culture, Information, Sports, and Tourism control
 the newspapers as well as other publications and cultural exhibits. Western and
 other publications are widely available in stores frequented by Vietnamese, without
 obvious restriction on their sale or distribution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is re-
 stricted in law and practice. People wishing to gather in a group are required to
 apply for a permit which local authorities can issue or deny arbitrarily. In practice,
 large informal gatherings in public, like market areas or parts, are commonplace es-
 pecially in urban areas. There is little evidence to suggest that informal public gath-
 erings are restricted. However, demonstrations or meetings that could be seen as
 having a political purpose are not permitted and are sometimes forcibly suppressed.
 For example, the Government refused to permit a conference on democracy that was
 to be held in Ho Chi Minh City in November. The existence of NGO's is permitted,
 but they may meet only for approved and narrowly defined objectives. Opposition
 political organizations and activities are not permitted.
 
 
 761
 c. Freedom of Religin.-Vietnam has no state religion, and adherence to a reli-
 gion is not permitted for party members. According to some estimates, nearly three-
 fourths of the population of 70 million people are Buddhists, but the Government
 has claimed that only 6 million of these actually" practice their religion. The Vatican
 believes that some 6 million Vietnamese are Cathoic; a much smaller number are
 Protestant. Virtually all foreign clergy remaining in the south in 1975 were expelled
 at the end of that year. While the SRV has permitted visits by foreign clergy, it has
 not been willing to permit them to reside permanently for religious purposes in Viet-
 na1.
 Reports indicate that religious goups are alowed freedom in their activities to
 the degree that they cooperate with the Government. Buddhism was afforded in-
 creasing tolerance until the Unified Buddhists (An Quang sect) began to protest gov-
 ernment control through 1992. The tension increased in early 1993 when the arrest
 and confinement of numbers of middle- and low-level leaders sent a clear signal to
 the Buddhist hierarchy that they cannot challenge the Government.
 While restrictions on religious organizations ame usually severe, they vary widely
 by locality. This is also true of church attendance. Many people report they have
 generally been free to attend worship services since 1975, an, during the past few
 years, visitors to Vietnam have reported that attendance at religious services is
 growing. Churches in and around Ho Chi Minh City and elsewhere have been ob-
 served overflowing during Sunday services. Buddhist temples and edifices of the
 Hoa Hao and Car Dai sects in several towns of the south appear active and pros-
 perous enough to be well maintained.
 Freedom of worship is provided for in the Constitution, along with the proviso
 that no one may use religious adherence or belief to violate state laws and policies.
 The Government, concerned that religious groups might become competing centers
 of influence within the society, has consistently attempted to divide and control reli-
 gious groups, in p art by establishing government-controlled policymaking bodies
 such as the Catholic Patriotic Association to which clergy are obliged to belong.
 The Government has also attempted to prevent the growth of religious groups by
 inhibiting the publication of religious materials and the training of new clergy. The
 Government exercises approval authority on the content of speeches and sermons
 by clergy, but reports continue to indicate that approval is generally granted as long
 as the content cannot be construed as a challenge to the legitimacy of Vietnamna
 one-party system. Also, Buddhist monks have reported that permission is usually
 given to young people wishing to study to become monks, if they register with the
 authorities. Several hundred an reported to be enrolled in Buddhist instruction in
 Ho Chi Minh City.
 The Government has regularly detained, arrested, and restricted the activities of
 religious figures of all faiths on political grounds. Authorities leveled charges of
 "possessing and disseminating counterrevoutionary propaganda," "fomenting un-
 rest," or "anti-Socialist propaganda" against Buddhist monks and nuns and Catho-
 lic, Protestant, and other religious leaders. A number of Catholic and Buddhist cler-
 gy remained in prison or confined to home villages. In September an American citi-
 zen reported that an informal prayer meeting involving approximately 30 Vietnam-
 ese and 3 foreignerss a         ebroken up by the plice, who detained the Vietnamese and
 seized the foreigners' passports. There have been some releases this year (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.), and, with the exception of members of the An Quang sect, few new ar-
 The Buddhist Patriarch, Thich Huyen Quang of the Unified Buddhist Church, has
 been under house arrest in Quang Ngai province since 1982, reportedy because he
 refuses to submit to the government-dominated Vietnam Buddht Church. In May,
 ater a self-immolation at the Linh Mu Pagoda (supporters of Quang) in Hue and
 the police interrogation of the abbot, ThichTri Tuu, there were large protest dem-
 onstrations by Buddhists (see Section .e.).
 Thich Duc Nhuan, a former Secretary General of the Unified Buddhist Church,
 was released in January, after receiving a 1-year reduction in his sentence. Vietnam
 has in recent years expanded its dialog with the Vatican. In 1993, however, the Gov-
 ernment continued to prevent the return from Rome to his archdiocese in Ho Chi
 Min City of Archbishop Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan (a nephew of Ngo Dinh
 Diem) to succeed the ageing Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh. In September the Gov-
 ernment rejected the aican's a pointment of Bishop Huynh Van Nghi to admin-
 ister the Roman Catholic church in Ho Chi Minh City.
 While the Government now permits Catholic seminarians to be admitted to
 seminaries every 3 years instead of 6, it still places sharp limits on the recruitment,
 training, ordination, and assignment of new seminarians, priests, monks, and nuns.
 The selection of both students and teachers is subject to government veto, and there
 
 
 762
 are continuing difficulties in obtaining teaching materials and in expanding reli-
 gious training facilities.
 Father Dominic Tran Dinh Thu, founder of the Mother Coredemptrix, was re-
 leased in May. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987 for "propa-
 gandizing against the Socialist system." In November four more clergy affiliated
 with the Mother Coredemptrix order were freed (see Section 1.d.). In 1993 the first
 foreign religious community received government approval to work in Vietnam;
 Mother Theresa's Sisters of Charity began work in Hanoi at the end of the summer.
 After a Vatican-based cardinal admonished Vietnamese Catholics not to join the
 government-sponsored union of Vietnamese Catholics, observers noted that fewer
 priests attended the annual meeting of this organization. At last report the only
 rtestant seminary had not been permitted to take in new students since 12 were
 admitted 6 years ago.
 Some religious leaders believe that the Government's goal is to weaken the
 churches as a social force by limiting personnel and restricting their ability to move
 their clergy around the country. For example, only 15 priests in Haiphong serve
 over 150,000 Catholics there, and no religious women have been allowed to establish
 convents or novitiates there.
 Most property of religious institutions remains under government control, includ-
 ing temples, churches, convents, seminaries, former religious schools, libraries, and
 orphanages. Sharp restrictions are exercised on the use, repair, or extension of those
 facilities that are returned to religious control.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-During 1993 the Government continued the trend of recent years of al-
 lowing freer movement within the country for most citizens. Vietnamese are re-
 quired technically to obtain permission to change their residence, but it appears
 that obtaining permission has not been difficult during the past few years. Large
 numbers have changed residence without official permission, apparently without ad-
 verse consequences. Areas that have previously been off-limits to foreigners were re-
 portedly opened. Since April 1, foreigners have been permitted to travel without per-
 mits to all areas except islands, border, or highland areas.
 Private travel abroad is usually restricted to 3 months, except travel for education
 or medical treatment. Violators of this limitation may be barred from further travel
 for 3 to 5 years.
 The Government continued its program of relocating people into sparsely popu-
 lated New Economic Zones (NEZ's), but we have no reports that these relocations
 are forcible. There are reports of some people voluntarily moving to the NEZ's to
 gain access to land or remaining in the NEZ's to which they were sent earlier. The
 state-run radio has said that, of more than 2 million people who were moved from
 their homes in cities or crowded areas, only a quarter had substantially improved
 their living standards. The report admitted that many of the NEZ's were unfinished
 or short of basic facilities. The Government's rationale for relocating people to the
 NEZ's is to reduce urban crowding, exploit little-used land, and thereby heip develop
 the economy. There have been no reports in recent years of banishment to the NEZs
 as a form of punishment.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for family reunification and for
 Amerasian Vietnamese and their close family members. The U.S. Orderly Departure
 Program, including Amerasians, former reeducation detainees, and family unifica-
 tion cases, continued to resettle beneficiaries at the rate of about 4,700 persons per
 month; a total of 57,000 immigrants and refugees in 1993. Other nations operate
 smaller resettlement programs for Vietnamese nationals. There are some concerns
 that members of minority ethnic groups, particularly highland peoples, might not
 have ready access to these programs. Vietnamese who emigrate are generally free
 to return. The Government regards overseas Vietnamese both as a valuable pten-
 tial source of foreign exchange and expertise and as a potential security threat.
 Thus, the Government generally grants visas to overseas Vietnamese and encour-
 ages them to visit Vietnam, whether they emigrated legally or had been granted
 permanent resettlement after illegal departures from Vietnam. At the same time
 the public security police monitor them, especially those who come under suspicion
 as a result of their actions or associations. During 1993 some overseas Vietnamese
 were arrested, detained, and deported for activities deemed to be subversive, as de-
 scribed in Section 1.d.
 In 1988 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to increase acceptance of voluntary
 repatriates, provided there was financial assistance. This agreement included a com-
 mitment by Vietnam to waive prosecution and punitive measures for illegal depar-
 ture from Vietnam of persons who return under the UNHCR voluntary repatriation
 program. Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees
 
 
 763
 through direct visits. This agreement has resulted in a substantial flow of repatri-
 ates from several countries back to the SRV. Although there were suspicions that
 Vietnamese who decided to repatriate to Vietnam voluntarily would face discrimina-
 tion, the evidence indicates they do not. More than 55,000 Vietnamese have re-
 turned voluntarily. The UNHCR, which monitors them extensively after they re-
 turn, says they do not face retribution or discrimination.
 Although the source of refugees itself Vietnam has also been the country of first
 asylum for between 15,000 and 20,000 dambodian refugees (mainly ethnic Chinese)
 who have fled to Vietnam since 1975. Repatriation of these refugees, who have been
 cared for by the UNHCR in well-organized camps, began in 1992. Atrocities commit-
 ted against ethnic Vietnamese residents of Cambodia resulted in substantial refugee
 flows into Vietnam in 1993. The SRV has moved to absorb ethnic Vietnamese refu-
 gees from Cambodia, and there have been no reports of political problems. Some
 30,000 are receiving international assistance.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All authority and political power
 is vested in the VCP; political opposition and other political parties are not toler-
 ated.
 The Central Committee of the VCP is the supeme decisionmaking body in the
 nation; its 13-member Politburo is the locus of policymaking. The Secretariat of the
 Central Committee oversees day-to-day implementation of leadership directives. De-
 bate and criticism is limited to certain aspects of individual, state, orparty perform-
 ance determined by the party itself. No challene to the legitimacy of the one-party
 state, or even debate on this subject, is permitted.
 Citizens elect members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the chief legislative
 body, but it is still constrained by party guidance. The 395 delegates were elected
 in the summer of 1992. Candidates for the National Assembly election were care-
 fully screened, and credible reports indicate that many people who wished to become
 candidates were not permitted to run because their views were not considered reli-
 able. Although candidates are screened by party front groups, they are not required
 to be party members themselves, and multiple candidates contest each seat.
 The law provides for equal participation in politics by women and minority
 groups, but in practice minority groups and women are underrepresented. The Gov-
 ernment has claimed that women hold 46 percent of the senior posts in government
 and that 18 percent of the members of the Ninth National Assembly are women.
 A woman was elected Vice President of the country in 1992. The most senior leader-
 ship, however, is predominately male as can be seen, for example, in the all-male
 Politburo and Council of Ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Vietnam does not permit private human rights organizations to form or operate.
 Moreover, it generally prohibits private citizens from contacting international
 human rights organizations. Since 1989, however, the VietnamesegRed Cross has
 been permitted expanded cooperation with the American Red Cross in assisting per-
 sons seeking missing relatives, including those in reeducation centers. The SRV has
 permitted international visitors to monitor implementation of its repatriation com-
 mitment3 under the Comprehencive Plan of Action and carried on a limited dialog
 with human rights organizations. The SRV has allowed some human rights organi.
 zations to visit. For example, it received a delegation from the U.S.-based human
 rights group Asia Watch. In addition, the SRV has shown some willingness to dis-
 cuss human rights issues bilaterally with other governments if such discussions
 take place under the rubric of "exchanges of ideas" rather than "investigations." The
 SRV refused, however, to grant a U.S. Senator access to Nguyen Dan Que (see Sec-
 tion l.d.).
 The Government has on occasion granted consular access to third-country nation-
 als imprisoned in Vietnam. In November SRV authorities for the first time allowed
 a U.S. consular official to visit an American citizen in a Vietnamese prison.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Varying levels of discrir.-ination have been reported by people released from re-
 education camps in the areas of housing or education. Those released from reeduca-
 tion camps generally are not eligible to regain their citizenship rights until 1 year
 after their release date. They and their families are not allowed employment with
 the Government, which restricts their access to housing and other benefits given to
 state employees.
 
 
 Priority in social services is given to families of party members and families of
 soldiers who fought for the Government. Testing standards of university entrance
 examinations are reportedly lower for children of party officials. Arbitrarily high
 standards are set to keep the children of suspect background out of a university.
 Study abroad is also restricted to politically acceptable persons.
 Women.-In general women do not appear to face discrimination in employment
 and are treated equally under the law. However, they face problems competing with
 men for higher status positions owing to attitudes deeply ingrained in traditional
 Vietnamese society. Such problems persist in spite of government efforts to mold
 popular attitudes to conform with the Constitution, legislation, and regulations
 mandating equal treatment before the law in virtually all respects. Article 63 of the
 new Constitution provides that women and men receive equal pay for equal work,
 and a large body of legislation and regulations is devoted to the protection of wom-
 en's rights in marriage as well as in the workplace. Government statistics indicate
 that approximately 50 percent of the primary school students are girls and that
 women represent about 39 percent of university students.
 Although Vietnamese law does address the issue of domestic violence, there is no
 information readily available on how comprehensive the law is in this area. Limited
 anecdotal evidence indicates that violence occurs (although its extent is unclear) and
 that law enforcement is somewhat limited. There are no official or unofficial statis-
 tics on domestic abuse.
 Children.-Reputable international NGO's reported that the Government's inter-
 est in children's issues and promoting child wel are was commendable. For example,
 the Government began a nationwide immunization campaign for children.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Gradual assimilation appears to be the Gov-
 ernment's long-term strategy for ethnic minorities. A member of a northern high-
 land minority is currently serving as President of the National Assembly. The Gov-
 ernment has created special schools in the Hanoi area for the education and indoc-
 trination of members of minorities to be the "eyes and ears of the party" among
 their own people. Highland minorities in central Vietnam are subject to repression
 if suspected of ties with resistance groups. Officially programmed resettlement of
 ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands is designed in part to increase government
 control over minority groups. At the same time, the Government appears to be try-
 ing to narrow the gap in the standard of living between highlanders and lowland
 ethnic Vietnamese.
 People with Disabilities.-There is little official protection or government support
 for the disabled, and, apparently, no laws mandating access for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Vietnamese workers are not free to form or join
 unions of their own choosing. If working for the state sector, all workers automati-
 cally become members of the union in their workplace, and dues are deducted from
 their pay. These unions are organized by the Party and belong to the Party-con-
 trolled Confederation of Vietnamese Workers (CV'.V). Strikes are considered unpatri-
 otic and are officially forbidden. Nonetheless, authorities have tolerated a few peace-
 ful strikes at foreign-owned factories.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Vietnamese workers do not
 have the right to organize unions of their own choosing or to bargain collectively.
 However, the Chairman of the CVW is empowered by legislation to attend con-
 ferences of the Council of Ministers and raise issues on behalf of labor that cannot
 be resolved at lower levels. SRV officials have stated that wages are set by a bu-
 reaucratic system and that the wage scales provided for existing state corporations
 are also imposed on newly formed enterprises. With a growing private sector, local
 market forces played a greater role in wage determination. The question of
 antiunion discrimination on the part of employers against employees seeking to or-
 ganize does not arise.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is permitted by
 the Constitution, which states in Article 80 that "citizens must pay taxes and labor
 in the common interest as provided by law." Refugees report that every Vietnamese
 citizen is required by law to contribute 15 days of work per year to the State or
 pay a fee. A number of government projects have used forced labor provided by re-
 education camp prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to regulations inherited
 from the former Trench colonial administration, the minimum age for employment
 of workers is 17. There is no reliable information concerning the enforcement of
 these regulations, but refugees report that they are not enforced. There are no sta-
 tistics available on the number of child workers in Vietnam. Refugees report that
 children under 15 are exempt from compulsory labor requirements. Compulsory cie-
 
 
 765
 mentary education laws exist but appear to be honored mostly in the breach for the
 children of the poor. Vietnamese culture holds education in high regard, however,
 and families send their children to school if they can afford to do so.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government adopted the former French
 colonial administration's system of regulations pertaining to working conditions, in-
 cluding a minimum wage; a maximum workday of 8 hours; a workweek of 6 days;
 and safety standards. E   in  standards do not appear to be widely enforced.
 Wages are generally low in Vietnam, inadequate to provide the cast majority of
 work era and their families a decent living. The minimum wage for employees at
 joint venture (Vietnamese and foreign) companies is $35 per month (VN Dong
 367,500),. which is higher than the average wage paid by Vietnamese frms. In Au-
 gust workers at a foreign-owned factory staged a peaceful strike for improved labor
 conditions, which was tolerated by the authorities.
