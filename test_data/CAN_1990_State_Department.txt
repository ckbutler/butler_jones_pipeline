 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal
 parliamentary form of government. Representatives in the
 multiparty political system are elected by universal suffrage
 at local, provincial, and federal levels. The national
 Constitution defines government responsibilities and is
 subject to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial,
 and municipal police forces, which are responsible for
 national and local law enforcement, and the armed forces,
 which have no role in domestic law enforcement except in
 strictly defined national emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 Canadians enjoy, in law and in practice, a wide range of
 freedoms and individual rights as enumerated in the Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms, which was added to Canada's revised
 Constitution in 1982. Principal complaints of human rights
 abuses arise in the area of discrimination against.ethnic
 minorities (including actions by the police) and
 discrimination and violence (much of it familial} against
 women. The Constitution and laws provide avenues for legal
 redress of such abuses, and the Government and private
 organizations try to ensure that human rights are respected in
 practice at all levels of society. Canada actively promotes
 respect for human rights around the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings. However,
 Canadian authorities and the general public are concerned
 about the potential for terrorist activity committed by Sikhs
 and members of other resident ethnic groups with active ties
 to troubled homelands., A Sikh fundamentalist, resident in
 British Columbia, is on trial in Vancouver accused of having
 placed a bomb on a Canadian airplane in 1985 that killed two
 baggage handlers in Tokyo's Narita-Airport. A Lebanese-
 Canadian was convicted on weapons charges in March 1990 for
 hijacking a Greyhound bus and detaining its passengers in
 April 1989 to protest the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically
 motivated-Aisappea.ances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 These abuses are prohibited by law, and none was reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected in practice..

 CANADA
 A 1988 law authorizes the Federal Government to take special
 measures to ensure safety and security during national
 emergencies, including the suspension of basic civil
 liberties. The 1939 Official Secrets Act prohibits the
 private possession, distribution, and publication of
 information deemed prejudicial to the interests of the State
 and provides that persons under suspicion may be arrested
 without a warrant.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is based on English common law on the
 federal level and in most provinces. In the Province of
 Quebec, the judicial system is based on the Napoleonic code.
 Judges in Canada are appointed. In criminal trials, Canadian
 law provides for a presumption of innocence of the defendant
 until proven guilty, as well as the right to a public trial
 and to counsel. Free counsel is provided to indigents. The
 Official Secrets Act provides that trials involving classified
 government information be held in secret with certain
 presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecutions under this
 statute are extremely rare, and convictions hard to sustain on
 appeal. There are no political prisoners in Canada.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 Federal and Provincial governments do not interfere with a
 person's basic rights. Intrusive searches may only be carried
 out when there is a reasonable basis for presuming that the
 person is involved in criminal activity. Police officials may
 face judicial penalties if they abuse a person's privacy
 without first obtaining a search warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the
 Constitution and respected in practice. Laws prohibiting
 certain forms of hate literature and pornography, restrictive
 decisions by provincial film censorship boards, and
 legislation which specifically protects language and cultural
 rights are the sole exceptions to these freedoms. The
 Canadian Human Rights Act makes it illegal to make repeated
 communications by telephone that expose a person or people to
 hatred or contempt. In February the Ontario Court of Appeal
 upheld the 1988 conviction of a neo-Nazi for spreading false
 news by publishing a pamphlet claiming the holocaust was a lie.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed. Permits
 are not required for meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside
 Canada, including the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 Canada continues to be a haven for many refugees and displaced

 CANADA
 persons. Widespread concern that many economic refugees have
 taken advantage of Canada's generous refugee law and made
 spurious requests for asylum led to the passage of a new
 refugee law, which went into effect on January 1, 1989, and
 has resulted in a 50-percent reduction in asylum applications.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by Federal and Provincial Governments that
 are freely elected by the Canadian people through universal
 suffrage. Legislative elections at both the federal and
 provincial levels must be held at least every 5 years and
 often result in a transfer of power to opposition parties.
 Voter participation rates'are high. The Governor General is
 the Queen's representative as Head of State., In practice,
 power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the members of
 the Cabinet, who usually are elected members of the 295-seat
 House of Commons. Three main parties are represented in the
 Commons, and several others function at the provincial level.
 All provinces and territories have similar freely elected
 legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission and its provincial
 counterparts investigate and resolve complaints of
 discrimination in public and private cases.- A wide variety of
 private human rights organizations operate freely.
 Canadian natives have brought allegations of human rights
 abuses related to a recent standoff by Mohawk Indians near
 Montreal, as'well as other longstanding grievances, including
 land claims, to the attention of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) and various international human
 rights organizations. The Canadian Government submitted
 information to the UNHRC on the- cases and permitted a
 European-based human rights organization to monitor th-
 situation involving the Mohawks.
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums,
 and the Federal Government encourages nongovernmental
 organizations to pursue investigations of human rights abuses
 throughout the world.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and educati-on are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. Article 15 of the Charter
 of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal benefits and
 protection of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic
 origin, color, religion, sex, age, -or.mental or physical
 disability. These rights are respected in practice.
 However, Canada's multicultural society does have racial
 problems. There has been increased friction between the black
 communities and police in Toronto and Montreal over the
 shooting deaths of blacks (several of whom were unarmed) in
 those cities. The Province of Ontario appointed a task force
 to study relations between police and minorities. The Quebec
 Province police union has called for training that would
 
 
 1114
 
 CANADA
 sensitize its members to minority cultures. Judicial
 inquiries in Manitoba and Nova Scotia investigated the
 treatment of aboriginal people by the judicial system in those
 two provinces. The one in Nova Scotia concluded that racism
 was a factor in the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of
 Donald Marshall, a Micmac Indian, for murder. Members of the
 black community in Halifax, Nova Scotia, staged a hunger
 strike in July to protest the conviction of three black men on
 a charge of causing a disturbance in a racial brawl at an area
 high school in late 1988. All eight white men who were
 charged in the same incident were acquitted or had the charges
 against them dropped.
 Native (Indian) protests during the summer of 1990 led to
 increased friction between Indians and their nonnative
 neighbors. Nonnatives, angered by the Mohawk barricades south
 of Montreal, held nightly rallies in late summer at which
 natives were burned in effigy. Protestors often scuffled with
 police. In another incident, a caravan of Mohawk women,
 children, and elderly persons were stoned as they attempted to
 leave the reservation.
 Natives, religious groups and human rights activists alleged
 human rights abuses during the 78-day armed Mohawk standoff at
 Oka, Quebec. They claimed that Quebec Province police
 prevented the passage of food and medicine to the Mohawks
 living on lands behind the barricade. There were reports of
 ambulances being delayed due to police searches. The Indians
 also said that the police prevented religious and spiritual
 advisers from crossing police lines.
 The Peel, Ontario, school board (the largest public board in
 the Province) tried to prevent Sikh students and teachers from
 wearing kirpans, ceremonial daggers with religious
 significance, to school. The Ontario Human Rights Board ruled
 that the Peel board could not infringe on the rights of Sikhs
 to wear the daggers in public schools.
 Women's groups have been effective in bringing the issue of
 family violence to the fore. In a June 1987 report, a
 Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women estimated
 that 1 in every 10 women is physically, psychologically, or
 emotionally abused by her spouse or partner. In Quebec,
 nearly 30 percent of calls to police are from battered women,
 and 18 percent of women in emergency rooms are there because
 of conjugal violence. A study conducted by the Ontario Native
 Women's Association reported that 8 of 10 native women have
 suffered some kind of abuse, mostly at the hands of their
 partners. Federal and Provincial Governments have attempted
 to address the issue of family violence.
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including in
 business and the professions, at wages comparable to those of
 men, according to an official from the Canadian Advisory
 Council on the Status of Women. Ontario Province enacted a
 far-reaching law that took effect on January 1, 1990, which
 requires that all employers (public and privateY with more
 than 10 workers provide equal pay to men and women for work of
 comparable skill and provides a formula for evaluating and
 comparing jobs traditionally held by women with those
 traditionally held by men. Women enjoy marriage and property
 rights equal to men.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to assodiate freely and to strike. The Canada Labor Code,
 which covers'all employees under federal jurisdiction,
 protects these-rights at the federal level, while provincial
 labor legislation protects all other-organized workers. Trade
 unions are independent of the Government and may freely
 affiliate with international organizations. About 36 percent
 of Canada's nonagricultural.work force is organized into trade
 unions. All workers' rights protected in law are respected in
 practice. The Canadian Labour Congress is a member of.the
 International Confederation Qf Free Trade Unions, and some of
 its member unions are branches of American Federation of Labor
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations unions.
 In practihe, certain groups of~essential public sector
 employees are not allowed to strike.' Restrictions'vary from
 province-to'province. The Province of Alberta was
 particularly-hard hit by illegal strikes by public employees:
 approximately 1,600 social workers and 1,800 prison guards
 struck illegally inMay.
 Notable among private sector labor disputes was A ruling by
 the Ontario LaborRelations Board ruled that a 2-day work
 stoppage by Ontario workers in April was illegal, and the'auto
 manufacturer filed a damage claim against the Canadian Auto
 Workers for compensation for lost production- Over l5,00a
 steelworkers in Ontario and Quebec went on strike in August at
 the expirAtion of their collective agreement. New contracts
 were successfully negotiated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to.organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 is protected by law and freely practiced, though some
 essential public sector employees have limited collective
 bargaining rights which vary from province to province.
 Antiunion discrimination is banned by law, and there are
 effective mechanisms for resolving complaints. However, in
 August 1990, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the Charter
 of Rights and Freedoms' guarantee of freedom of association
 does not guarantee unions the right to negotiate on behalf of
 their members. Since the right to strike is codified in
 federal and provincial legislation, the ruling has had no
 effect in practice.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration,
 and the judicial system. Canada has no export processing
 zones.
 a. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is illegal and not practiced. The Committee of
 Experts of the International Labor Organization (ILO) took
 note at its 1990 meeting that the Canadian Government planned
 to amend the Canada Shipping Act during the course of the year
 to revoke those sections of the Act which do not conform with
 ILO Convention 105 on the abolition of forced labor, which
 Canada has ratified.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Generally, workers must be 17 years of age to work in an
 industry under federal jurisdiction. Provincial standards
 (covering over 90 percent of the national work force) vary,
 but generally require parental consent for workers under 15 or
 16 and prohibit young workers in dangerous or nighttime work.
 In all jurisdictions, a person under 16 may not be employed in
 a designated trade or become an apprentice before that age.
 Federal and provincial authorities enforce these standards
 through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all limit
 the standard workweek to 40 to 48 hours. Minimum wages are
 established in both federal and provincial Jurisdictions. The
 federal minimum wage, covering about 10 percent of the
 Canadian work force, is about $4 per hour. Fiveprovinces
 (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, and
 British Columbia) have lower minimum rates for youths and
 students. Collectively, only I percent of workers governed by
 the federal minimum wage are paid at the minimum rate. Eight
 percent of all workers are paid at the respective minimum wage
 covering their class of employment. A family with only one
 member employed and working at minimurrwages would be below
 the poverty level. All provinces-have established minimum
 wages higher than the federal minimum.
 The Federal Government establishes health and safety standards
 for the approximately 10 percent of workers covered by federal
 labor legislation. Provincial legislation provides for health
 and safety standards for other workers. Federal and regional
 authorities enforce these standards through inspections.
