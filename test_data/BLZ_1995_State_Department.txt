 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy with a Constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 independence from the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, a Cabinet of Min-
 isters, and a Legislative Assembly govern the country. The Governor General rep-
 resents Queen Eliz   th II in the largely eremonial role of Head of State. Both
 local and national elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis.
 The Police Department has primary responsibility for law enforcement and main-
 tenance of order. The Belize Defence Force (BDF) is responsible for external secu-
 rity, but when deemed apprpriat by civilian authorities may be tasked to assist
 the Police Department. Both the police and the BDF report to the Minister of Na-
 tional Security and are responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities. There
 were occasional reports of abuse by the lice.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, although tourism is now the number one
 foreign exchange earner. The agricultural sector is heavily dependent on pref-
 erential access to export markets for sugar and for bananas. The Government favors
 free enterprise and generally encourages investment, although domestic investors
 are given preferential treatment over foreign investors in a number of key economic
 sectors. Preliminary estimates put 1995 gross domestic product growth at 2 percent
 in real terms. Belize has an annual per capita income of $2,200.
 The Constitution provides for, and citizens enjoy in practice, a wide range of fun-
 damental rights and freedoms. Principal human rights abuses include occasional use
 of excessive force by the police when making arrests, discrimination and domestic
 violence against women, and employer mistreatment of immigrant workers in the
 banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture or other inhuman punishment. Although there were
 several credible reports of mistreatment and abuse by police, no police or prison offi-
 cer was charged with or convicted of such an offense in 1995. The Police Depart-
 ment, the Police Complaints Board, and on occasion special independent commis-
 sions apointed by the Prime Minister investigate any allegations of official abuse.
 The Hattieville prison opened 2 years ago and replaced the notoriously decrepit
 Bslize City prison. Although designed to hold 500 inmates, it now houses well over
 900 or about 5 prisoners per 10- by 12-foot cell. There are no reports of human
 rights abuses at the prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions. The
 law requires the police to inform a detainee of the cause of detention within 48
 hours of arrest and to bring the person before a court within 72 hours. In practice,
 the authorities normally inform detainees immediately of the charges against them.
 Bail is granted in all but the most serious cases. However, many detainees cannot
 afford bail, and backlogs in the judicial system often cause considerable delays and
 postponements of hearings, resulting in an overcrowded prison and prolonged incar-
 ceration before trial.
 The Constitution forbids exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. Persons ac-
 cused of civil or criminal offenses have constitutional rights to presumption of inno-
 cence, protection against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, a public trial, and
 appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in capital cases. Those convicted by either a mag-
 istrate's court or the Supreme Court may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some
 
 
 329
 cases, including those resulting in a capital sentence, the convicted party may make
 a final appeal to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. The Privy Council has
 agreed to hear several such appeals in 1995, thereby delaying execution of the cap-
 ital sentences.
 The authorities respect the constitutional guarantees in practice, although the
 fact that prominent government leaders continue to practice law while in office
 brought the judiciary's independence into question on several occasions. For exam-
 ple, when the Speaker of the House was photographed in the company of a client
 reputed to have direct links to the Cali cocaine cartel by a journalist from an opposi-
 tion newspaper, a dispute ensued and the Speaker was accused by the journalist
 of misdemeanor assault. Although a police official corroborated the journalist's ver-
 sion of events, the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence and the charges
 against the Speaker were dismissed.
 The appearance of judicial independence from the executive branch is com-
 promised because judges and the Chief Prosecutor must negotiate renewal of their
 employment contracts with the Government and thus may be vulnerable to political
 interference. The Supreme Court and magistrate courts suffer backlogs aggravated
 by the inability to maintain a full complement of judges.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. A
 wide range of viewpoints is publicly presented without government interference in
 six privately owned weekly newspapers (there is no daily press), half of which are
 directly subsidized by major political parties. All newspapers are subject to the con-
 straints of libel laws.
 Since Belize's first privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasting
 in 1990, other stations have since been established, broadening the audience's
 choices. Popular radio call-in programs are lively and feature open criticism of and
 comment on government and political matters. Through financial subsidies, the Gov-
 ernment continues to exert substantial editorial influence over the nominally auton-
 omous Broadcasting Corporation of Belize (BCB) and its two radio stations; BCB
 once held a monopoly on radio in the country. The Government utilizes BCB studios
 and facilities to produce partisan advertisements and party propaganda.
 There are eight privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several
 cable networks in Belize City and the major towns. The Government's Belize Infor-
 mation Service and the independent television stations-Channels 5 and 7-produce
 local news and feature programs. The Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA) regu-
 lates broadcasting and asserts its right to preview certain broadcasts, such as those
 with political content, and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material
 from political broadcasts. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this author-
 ity during 1995 although there appeared to be ample opportunity to do so in the
 face of the aggressive and negative media campaigns each party waged against the
 other's plitical leadership.
 The Belize Press Association was formed in 1995 and is seeking to find common,
 professional ground among the disparate, usually partisan members of the press.
 One of the new association s main goals is to obtain increased access to government
 information. The association hopes to utilize the country's Freedom of Information
 Act in this effort. However, this act as well as the Constitution permit the Govern-
 ment to withhold information for a wide variety of reasons, including public safety,
 health, and national security.
 When the Government decided to repatriate several Cuban families by airplane
 to Havana (see Section 2.d.), the BDF barred the press from covering the story at
 the airport. The BDF arrested a reporter and seized her video tape after she gained
 access to the airport and ventured onto the tarmac where the Cubans were being
 loaded onto a Cubana aircraft by BDF troops. Formal charges against the reporter
 were not filed and the video tape was eventually returned.
 The owner of a Cayo district radio station identified with the opposition party
 filed criminal charges against two Cabinet Ministers. He alleged that the Ministers
 broke into the station, beat him, and destroyed equipment. At years end, the case
 was pending in court.
 The law provides for academic freedom and the Government respects it in prac-
 tice.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and the authorities honor it in practice. Political parties and
 other groups with political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The or-
 ganizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the meet-
 ings; such permits are not denied for political reasons. In July the opposition Peo-
 ple's United Party (PUP) held a mass street demonstration and political rally in
 downtown Belize City drawing thousands of participants (many brought in from out-
 lying districts). The Constitution permits citizens to form and join associations of
 their choice, both political and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-he Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 In the wake of the civil conflicts in Central America during the 1980's, over
 40,000 mostly Hispanic immigrants came to Belize, many of them entering illegally
 and living in the country without documentation. The Government generally cooper-
 ates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The UNHCR provides the major-
 ity of funding for refugee programs in the country, including the salaries of most
 of the employees in the Government's Department of Refugees. The-UNHCR is con-
 cerned about the ambiguity of the immigrants' status; less than one-fifth are docu-
 mented.
 During the banana harvest season, the Government deported many undocu-
 mented agricultural workers, mostly Guatemalans and Hondurans. In the process,
 a number of persons with legal resident status were also deported. The Government
 is investigating the matter.
 Several boatloads of Cuban immigrants arrived in Belize early in the year. After
 the first group arrived in Belize City harbor aboard an unseaworthy vessel and ap-
 plied for refugee status, there followed almost a month of intense policy debate with-
 in the Cabinet (during which time the immigrants were detained in a military
 camp). The Government decided to deny their application and to repatriate them by
 air to Havana. Subsequent Cuban immigrants' boats were intercepted offshore, re-
 paired, reprovisioned, and asked to leave Belizean waters.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a democracy governed by a Legislative Assembly, with executive direc-
 tion from a Cabinet of Ministers headed by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel. The
 law requires national elections at least every 5 years.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 and older. National political parties include the People's United Party, the United
 Democratico Party (UDP), and the National Alliance for Belizean Rights (NABR).
 The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected in each party's membership. The Govern-
 ment changed hands (for the third time since independence in 1981)in 1993 when
 a coalition of the UDP and the NABR won 16 of 29 seats in the House of Represent-
 atives.
 Women hold a number of appointive offices, including three of nine Senate seats.
 One member of the House of Representatives is a woman, but women in elective
 office are the exception rather than the rule. None hold senior positions higher than
 membership on the executive committees of the political parties. No laws impede
 participation of women in politics; their scarcity in electoral politics can be attrib-
 uted to tradition and socioeconomic factors.
 SectionA. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigtion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their activities. The Human Rights Com-
 mission of Belize (HRCB), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with re-
 gional human rights organizations and partly funded by the UNHCR, operates free
 of government restriction on a rangeof issues, including refugee and agricultural
 workers' rights, cases of alleged poie abuse, and cases of alleged illegal deporta-
 tions of Central American nationals. The HRCB publicizes, and urges police and
 other government bodies to act upon, complaints it receives. Local and international
 human rights groups operate freely, and the Government cooperates with independ-
 ent investigations of human rights conditions.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of recently arrived Central American and Asian immigrants, continued to
 be a problem.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. Women Against
 Violence, an NGO with branches throughout the country, runs a shelter for battered
 women and a hotline for rape victims.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women face social and economic
 udices. For example, women ind it mre difficult than men to obtain business
 and agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed women are con-
 centrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally low status and wages.
 A Women's Bureau in the Ministry of Labor and Social Services is charged with de-
 veloping_ programs to improve the status of women. A number ofofficially registered
 women s groups work closely with various government ministries in promoting so-
 cial awareness programs. Women have access to education and are active in all
 spheres of national life, but relatively few are found in top managerial positions.
 While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, women wage
 earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. Tere are no legal impediments
 to women owning or managing land or other real property.
 Children.-There is a Famly Services Division in the Ministry of Human Re-
 sources devoted primarily to children's issues. The division coordinates programs for
 children who are victims of domestic violence advocates remedies in specific cases
 before the Family Court, conducts public education campaigns, and works with
 NGO's and the United Nations Childre's Fund to promote children's welfare. There
 is also a National Committee for Families and Children, chaired by the Minister of
 Human Resources. There is no pattern of societal abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate specifically the provision of
 accessibility for disabled persons nor prohibit job discrimination against them. The
 Government's Disability Services Unit, as we  as a number of NGO's such as the
 Belize Association of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center for the
 Visually Impaired, provide assistance to physically disabled persons. Disabled chil-
 dren have access to government special education facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 L The Right of Association.-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Eleven independent unions, with an estimated 9 percent
 of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and profes-
 sional workers, including most civil service employees. Several of the unions, how-
 ever, are moriund and inactive. The Ministry of Labor recognizes unions after they
 file with the Office of Registry. The law empowers members to draft the by-laws and
 constitutions of their unions, and they are free to elect officers from among the
 membership at large. Unions which choose not to hold elections may act as rep-
 resentatives for their membership, but the National Trade Union Congress permits
 only unions which hold free and annual elections of officers to join its ranks. Both
 law and precedent effectively protect unions against dissolution or suspension by ad-
 ministrative authority.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties (the UDP and the PUP). Unions
 freely exercise the right to form federations and confederations and affiliate with
 international organizations. The law permits unions to strike, but unions represent-
 ing essential services may strike only after giving 21 days' notice to the ministry
 concerned. The Public Service Union, which is the bargaining unit for some 1,400
 civil servants, is at loggerheads with the Government over the latter's decision ear-
 lier this year to withhold a promised pay raise.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining and unions freely practice it throughout the country. Employers and
 unions set wages in free negotiations, or, more commonly, employers simply estab-
 lish them. The Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked collective
 bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding coun-
 sel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily ac-
 cepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept the Com-
 missioner's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided that
 it is linked to some provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and after a union
 is registered. Unions may freely organize, but the law does not require employers
 
 
 to recognize a union as a bargaining agent. Some employers have been known to
 block union organization by terminating the employment of key union sympathizers,
 usuall on grounds purportedly unrelated to union activities. Effective redress is ex-
 trmey difficult in such situations. Technically, a worker may file a complaint with
 the Labor Department, but it has been virtually impossible to prove that a termi-
 nation was due to union activity.
 The Labor Code applies in the country's two export processing zones (EPZ's).
 There are no unions in the EPZ's, however, reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids forced
 labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years, or 17 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation, although in recent
 years school truancy officers, who have historically borne the brunt of the enforce-
 ment burden, have been less active. The law requires children between the ages of
 5 and 14 to attend school, but there are many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of WorkI-The minimum wage is $1.12 (BZ$2.25) per
 hour, except in export industries where it is $1.00 (BZ$2.00) per hour. For domestic
 workers and shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed, the rate is
 $0.87 (BZ$1.75) per hour. The minimum wage law does not cover workers paid on
 a piecework basis. The Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing the legal mini-
 mum wage, which is generally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole
 source of income is inadequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. Most salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 The law sets the normal workweek at no more than 6 days or 45 hours. It re-
 quires paymeat for overtime work and an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patch-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and the Min-
 istries of Labor and Public Health enforce these regulations in varying degrees. En-
 forcement is not universal countrywide, and the ministries commit their limited in-
 spection and investigative resources principally to urban and more accessible rural
 areas where labor health, and safety complaints have been registered. Workers
 have the legal right to remove themselves from a dangerous workplace situation
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
 The exploitation of undocumented Hispanic workers, particularly young service
 workers and workers in the banana industry, continues to be a major issue for the
 Government the HRCB and other concerned citizens. Undocumented immigrants
 working in tle Stann Creek area banana industry for years have cited poor working
 and living conditions and routine nonpayment of wages. However, little progress has
 been made in resolving or precluding these systemic problems.
