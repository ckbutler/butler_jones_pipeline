 HONDURAS
 Honduras' return in 1982 to democratic, constitutional rule
 was consolidated in November 1985 by national elections marked
 by over 80 percent voter participation. A new president,
 three vice presidents, 134 members of the unicameral National
 Congress, and several hundred municipal officials were elected
 for four-year terms.
 National police functions are performed by the Public Security
 Force (FUSEP). FUSEP is fundamentally a civilian police force
 with limited military capabilities (although commanded by an
 Army officer) and traditionally has enjoyed a non-adversarial
 relationship with the Honduran people. Major FUSEP elements
 include the COBRA incident response unit, the Directorate of
 National Investigations (responsible for criminal
 investigations andsome intelligence activities), the Traffic
 Police, and training academies for police officers and
 enlisted personnel. The Armed Forces are the traditional
 guarantor of Honduran internal and external security. Closely
 linked to rural Honduras and to the economic middle-class, the
 Armed Forces are strongly supportive of the democratic process
 and of broadly-based social and economic development.
 Honduras is among the economically least-developed nations in
 Latin America. Although 1984 and 1985 saw inflation largely
 under control and positive economic growth, economic problems
 remain severe. Combined unemployment and underemployment
 exceed 50 percent of the workforce. Honduras has a mixed
 economic system in which private sector economic production
 receives significant government and international support. A
 number of government-owned autonomous agencies provide both
 goods and services; the public sector is the largest employer.
 During 1985, President Suazo and the current military
 leadership have demonstrated increasing sensitivity to the
 importance of strengthened human rights. This attitude is
 expected to continue under the newly-elected government.
 Honduras enjoys a vocal political opposition, a free press,
 and a generally good human rights record. A national program
 is being developed to improve the administration of justice
 and otherwise to strengthen the judiciary system. However,
 the mistreatment of detainees and the incommunicado detention
 of accused persons for longer than the 24 hours allowed by law
 continue to occur. Although the Constitution guarantees
 judicial due process, the administration of justice is uneven,
 slow, and often subject to improper influences. Honduras
 continues to feel the effects of civil strife in neighboring
 countries, including external efforts to foster subversion in
 Honduras. In August, several casualties resulted from efforts
 by government forces to detain Salvadoran guerrillas operating
 in refugee camps near Colomoncagua. The country hosts over
 85,000 refugees, including at least 65,000 from Nicaragua and
 more than 20,000 from El Salvador and Guatemala.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Unlike previous years, there were no public accusations of
 politically motivated deaths in Honduras in 1985. The
 Honduran Armed Forces published a preliminary study on
 
 
 586
 HONDURAS
 reported disappearances through early 1984 which indicated
 that some of those missing may have died at the hands of
 expatriate Nicaraguans in Honduras. The allegation was not
 repeated in the inconclusive final report published on October
 17, 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were documented in 1985, although human
 rights organizations continue to assert that 118
 disappearances between 1974 and 1984 remain unexplained. An
 Armed Forces' investigation of alleged disappearances
 reportedly included interviews with human rights activists and
 with those members of the Armed Forces mentioned by name as
 having been involved in disappearance cases. The final report
 concludes that no evidence exists to determine that any
 military officials were involved in any disappearances, that
 no reportedly "disappeared" persons are held in military or
 public security facilities, and that the information provided
 to the investigation by human rights activists was vague and
 at times contradictory. The inconclusive preliminary and
 final reports were heavily criticized by human rights
 spokesmen. The report recommends that any further accusations
 of involvement by members of the Armed Forces be taken to the
 proper judicial court. On December 12, a criminal court case
 against six officers accused of involvement in disappearances
 was dismissed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited under the law; however, physical and
 mental mistreatment of prisoners exists. Beatings,
 humiliation, and at times more severe treatment are known
 abuses. These are identified by the Honduran Human Rights
 Committee (CODEH) as the most severe current human rights
 problem. Prisons are crowded and medical attention for
 prisoners is poor. Prisoners are allowed visitors during
 regular hours, and many depend on these visits for food and
 supplies. Due to the inefficiency of the court system, as
 many as one-third of those in prison at any given time have
 not been tried and convicted of any crime.
 Confession is the most common basis for holding a prisoner.
 When a judge finds that an accused person has been beaten or
 that a confession otherwise has been obtained illegally, the
 case is dismissed. This procedure is said by public security
 authorities to stimulate false accusations of torture.
 However, several allegations of mistreatment by the police
 were officially investigated in 1985, and at least three
 police officers, including one DNI detective, were imprisoned
 for their actions.
 In August, an American priest, Father John Donald, S.J., was
 detained for 48 hours by Honduran authorities for
 investigation of charges of involvement in subversive
 activities. Father Donald complained of having been bound and
 blindfolded when transported and deprived of food and sleep
 while held by Honduran military authorities. (The charges
 against Father Donald were determined by the investigation to
 be without substance, and he was allowed to continue to work
 in Honduras.)

 HONDURAS
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The judicial system continues to be cumbersome and often
 inequitable. Honduran law requires that a person be presented
 to a judge within 24 hours of arrest and that the judge must
 decide within 6 days whether there is sufficient evidence to
 hold the accused for trial. In practice, these rules are not
 always followed. Persons accused of subversive or terrorist
 activities frequently have been held incommunicado for several
 days or, at times, even weeks.
 Government security forces continue to maintain that suspected
 subversives at times must be held incommunicado for longer
 than the 24 hour period allowed by the law in order to protect
 national security. Suspected subversives captured in
 Siguatepeque in February initially were unaccounted for but
 later were interviewed by the press at the central
 penitentiary following an "appeal for personal exhibition"
 filed by CODEH. Former labor leader Anselmo Ronero Ulloa was
 released on August 23 from incommunicado detention pursuant to
 a request of habeus corpus and the intervention of a
 presidential advisor.
 An "appeal for personal exhibition" can be filed with the
 Supreme Court to locate an individual believed to be
 detained. Such appeals have received faster attention
 following a restructuring of the Supreme Court in June. The
 courts and police officials are increasingly responsive to
 habeas corpus and personal exhibition demands. On at least
 three occasions in 1985 the authorities allowed general
 searches of prisons by court-appointed authorities for persons
 alleged to have been improperly detained. No evidence was
 found to substantiate the allegations of improper detention.
 Much of the improvement in this regard has resulted from
 efforts by the Armed Forces Commander to resolve the issue of
 disappearances and to improve the adherence to the law by the
 security services.
 Forced or compulsary labor is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Honduran law provides for fair trial, although social and
 economic status are factors in the dispensation of justice.
 There are no secret tribunals nor political prisoners.
 Detainees are allowed to contact lawyers, and bail practice is
 liberal. Public defenders are, in theory, available but the
 system is not effective in practice. A new penal code went
 into effect in March 1985, and attempts were made by the
 Honduran Bar Association to educate lawyers and Judges
 throughout the country regarding changes. Nevertheless,
 judicial guidance in implementing the new code has been
 minimal and few substantive changes have resulted thus far. A
 revised code of procedures, which also took legal effect in
 March 1985, has yet to be published.
 The Supreme Court is'appointed by the Congress for four-year
 terms; it administers the court system and appoints all other
 judges, including justices of the peace. The Constitution
 provides for judicial independence; however, the courts are
 subject to political influence. A June 1985 restructuring of
 the Supreme Court following an attempt by the Congress to
 impeach several justices resulted in a less politicized court
 which has proven more responsive to demands for habeas corpus
 
 
 588
 HONDURAS
 and has shown a willingness to consider charges of judicial
 misconduct. A positive development is the increased role of
 the Honduran Bar Association in the administration of
 justice. The Bar Association sponsored forums to explain new
 laws and also acted against at least one judge accused of
 improper conduct.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government normally does not interfere with the private
 lives of its citizens. Citizens are free to affiliate, move,
 and live as they choose. A "spoils system" is characteristic
 of public employment, and, as the national election
 approached, some public employees were dismissed due to their
 political affiliations. Some officials and private
 individuals claim that their telephones have been monitored or
 their movements observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and all
 viewpoints are tolerated and printed in the Honduran press.
 Local radio stations (there are over 100) broadcast numerous
 programs which allow the public freely to express opinions.
 The television stations are privately owned. Freedom of the
 press is widely respected; both the newspapers and radio
 stations openly criticize the Government, the courts, and the
 Armed Forces without fear of reprisal. Academic freedom is
 respected and student groups play a major role in the
 formation of university policy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to organize and demonstrate is recognized and
 exercised by labor unions, political parties, professional
 organizations, students, and human rights groups. Trade
 unions enjoy a thirty-five year history and are independent,
 strong, and varied in political orientation. Most industries
 have unionized labor forces. Workers have the right to
 organize, to bargain collectively, and to strike.
 Honduras' trade unions maintain close ties with international
 trade union organizations. Its largest confederation, the
 Confederation of Honduran Workers (CTH), is an affiliate of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
 and the ICFTU's regional arm, the Inter-American Regional
 Workers Organization (ORIT). The second largest
 confederation, the General Workers Central (CGT), is an
 affiliate of the World Confederation of Labor and its regional
 arm, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT). The
 Unitarian Federation of Honduran Workers (FUTH) is an
 affiliate of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The
 three principal labor organizations claim to represent
 approximately twenty percent of Honduran workers, including a
 substantial number of peasants and rural laborers.
 Honduran labor and peasant leaders played a major role in the
 resolution of a March-May constitutional confrontation between
 the executive and legislative branches, Labor and peasant
 organizations actively participated in the electoral process,
 meeting on several occasions to affirm their support for the
 
 
 589
 HONDURAS
 constitutional process. Labor leaders ousted by competing
 internal factions have claimed that government or political
 party interference led to their defeat. The International
 Labor Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association noted
 in mid-1985 that the Government of Honduras had not replied to
 charges made in 1984 which alleged the wounding and
 disappearance of trade union members, unwarranted dismissals,
 and interference of the Government in trade union affairs.
 Union leaders regularly travel to international meetings and
 some were elected to the national Congress.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although predominantly Roman Catholic, Honduras has no state
 religion. All religions are tolerated. Missionaries operate
 in many parts of the country. Members of the clergy
 occasionally have been detained but only on the basis of
 alleged secular offenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Hondurans freely travel within and outside of Honduras. There
 are no permanent travel restrictions for Hondurans or
 foreigners in the country, although national security concerns
 have led to increased police checks for proper personal
 documentation. Those who do not have proper identification
 are held until documentation is produced but are not charged
 with an infraction. Exit visas are required for Hondurans
 wishing to leave the country and constitute a form of control
 over international travel. Exit visas almost always are
 granted without dispute, although the wife of former Armed
 Forces Commander Gustavo Alvarez was refused permission to
 leave for several days.
 Attempts are made to identify and register the thousands of
 undocumented foreigners--principally Salvadorans and
 Nicaraguans--residing in Honduras. In addition, Honduras
 hosts some 85,000 refugees (approximately 40,000 under UN
 sponsorship) who are allowed to remain in Honduras without
 threat of involuntary repatriation. Refugee experts generally
 consider the protection of the refugees to be good. On August
 29, government forces entered the refugee camps near
 Colomoncagua in an effort to detain Salvadoran guerrillas
 known to be operating there; the ensuing confrontation with
 the camps' residents resulted in two deaths and over a dozen
 casualties. The UNHCR recognizes the right of Honduran
 authorities to exercise their police function in the camp but
 complained about the way in which the action was taken.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On November 24, 1985, following an active and sometimes stormy
 political campaign, nearly 1.6 million Hondurans went to the
 polls to choose their next Government in elections marked by
 popular enthusiasm for the exercise of democracy. Nine
 candidates representing four political parties were on the
 ballot, each with his own slate of vice presidents,
 congressional deputies, and municipal officials. Voting is
 mandatory and by secret ballot. The Constitution guarantees
 to all Honduran-born citizens of legal age the right to hold
 office and, despite controversy about some, the National
 Electoral Tribunal officially accepted all candidates.
 
 
 590
 HONDURAS
 Through the Armed Forces Commander, General Walter Lopez, the
 Armed Forces have endorsed the election process and declared
 their intention to support the Constitution. A two-month-long
 political crisis arising from disputes over the selection by
 the political parties of presidential candidates was resolved
 in May by a compromise agreement worked out among the
 democratic labor unions and peasant organizations, the Armed
 Forces, and political leaders, with Catholic Church
 mediation. An attempt in late October by some members of the
 National Congress to convert the Congress into a Constituent
 Assembly and to postpone the elections was halted by a popular
 outpouring of support for the constitutional process and by
 the public refusal of the Armed Forces to support the action.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The Government continues to cooperate with local and
 international human rights organizations. Foreign Minister
 Paz Barnica has spoken frequently with human rights groups and
 declared publicly his interest in investigating allegations of
 human rights abuses. The Armed Forces investigation of
 alleged disappearances was completed in March and published in
 October, although adding little to already existing
 knowledge. Local human rights leaders and visiting members of
 human rights organizations are widely quoted in the press.
 In addition to the two major private human rights
 organizations (CODEH and the Families of Disappeared Persons),
 the Honduran Bar Association has an increasingly active
 committee on human rights. A congressional committee on
 constitutional guarantees exists and exhibited some interest
 in examining extrajudicial procedures.
 Amnesty International Report 1985, which covers events in
 1984, expressed concern about the arrest without warrant of
 political detainees, their detention without trial in both
 unofficial and recognized detention centers, and allegations
 of torture, "disappearances" and extrajudicial executions.
 Freedom House rates Honduras "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Honduras is 4,499,000 and is growing at an
 estimated annual rate of 3.3 percent. Despite the presence of
 a sizeable middle-class, the 1985 per capita gross national
 product was only $815. Honduras is among the economically
 least-developed nations in Latin America. Well over half of
 the population lives in rural areas. Almost 55.0 percent of
 the rural population and 14.0 percent of the urban population
 were considered in 1978 (most recent data) to live below the
 absolute poverty level. The Honduran Ministry of Education
 claims that the literacy rate has risen in recent years from
 less than 60 percent to near 70 percent. The Ministry's claim
 of 86 percent primary school enrollment is considered by many
 to be inflated; a more accurate figure is about 74 percent
 with many children of varying ages and abilities often
 attending classes given by one teacher in one room. The
 national university is available to those who satisfy basic
 academic qualifications and the cost is minimal. Technical
 training is severely lacking at all levels.
 Health care is poor for the majority of Hondurans. Although
 there are sufficient doctors, many areas have no health care
 
 
 591
 HONDURAS
 facilities and, in many cases, medical centers built in the
 last several years are unoccupied. The life expectancy rate
 at birth is 60.73 years; the infant mortality rate is 73.3 per
 1,000 live births. Forty-four percent of the people have
 access to safe water; the 1977 caloric supply relative to
 nutritional requirements was approximately 95 percent.
 Discrimination against women is banned by law. Cultural
 practices reduce the number of women occupying key positions
 in the Government and business, However, education is equally
 available and women who manage to obtain positions are
 accepted. Legal discrimination against women in domestic
 cases exists; attempts to correct this are underway. Ethnic
 minorities, concentrated on the north coast, enjoy legal
 and--in most cases--social equality.
 The Constitution and the labor code require that all labor be
 fairly paid and limit the hiring of children under 16.
 Minimum wages, working hours, and occupational health and
 safety are regulated by law. The daily minimum wage varies
 among productive sectors, ranging from 4.60 to 7.10 lempiras
 (2 lempira equal $1.00). The standard work period is 8 hours
 per day and 44 hours per week. The labor code provides for a
 paid vacation of ten workdays after one year and twenty
 workdays after four years. Despite violations of the above
 laws and regulations by individual employers, workers' rights
 are generally respected. There is no evidence that either the
 government or employer associations systematically seek to
 deny workers' rights.
