 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy. The
 coalition government (Socialist Party and People's Party),
 formed after the November 1986 national election, continued in
 office in 1989. The loosely united Green Party and the
 liberal/nationalist Freedom Party constituted the opposition.
 The police and security organs are effectively subordinated to
 the executive and judicial authorities.
 Austria has a developed economy, and Austrians enjoy a high
 standard of living.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asyltu for approximately 2 million refugees from Eastern
 Europe. Austria continued in this role during 1989.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria, and individual
 rights and political freedoms are constitutionally guaranteed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings either
 bylgovernment authorities'or opposition groups. On July 13,
 three Iraniaff Kurdish activists were murdered in Vienna,
 almost certainly by non-Austrians.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no political abductions.
 c, Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman,'or Degrading
 ,Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution, and is not
 practiced.
 In 1989 a leading Green parliamentarian called for reform of
 the procedures used in handling citizen complaints against the
 police. He cited government records showing that during the
 years 1986-88 there had been 844 citizen complaints alleging
 unnecessary use of force by police. Judgments against the
 police were forthcoming in only six cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. In
 criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial
 detenti6n for up to 48 hours, by which time an investigative
 judge must decide on the legality of extending the period of
 detention. Provided the investigative judge agrees, the
 accused may be held pending completion of an investigation for
 a maximum of 2 years. Grounds for investigative detention are
 enumerated in the~law, as are conditions for release on bail.
 Domestic critics of the use made of pretrial detention
 continue to point to a study which showed that of those so
 detained in Vienna, for example, only 57 percent were
 eventually found guilty of crimes justifying prison
 
 
 1034
 sentences. In recent years, the number of those in
 investigative detention and in jail serving prison sentences
 declined. On September 1, the total number of those in
 custody was 5,771, of whom 1,646 were in investigative
 detention. During 1989 work continued on a comprehensive
 reform of the law on detention for infractions of
 administrative law.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. Trials are public. Judges are
 appointed for life and may not, in principle, be removed from
 office. Jury trials are prescribed for major offenses, and
 those convicted have the right of appeal. Written charges
 must be presented to the accused, who has the right to be
 represented by a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and telephone.
 The privacy of family life is respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and
 multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if tney violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected. Austria's
 well-established democratic political system, its active and
 independent press, and its effective judiciary combine to
 assure continued freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Public demonstrations require a permit from the
 police authorities, who may consider only the public safety
 aspect of the proposed demonstration and not its political
 purpose. Permits are routinely issued.
 The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 makes an exception to
 freedom of association in the case of Nazi organizations and
 activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945, as amended in
 1947, also prohibits Nazi organizations and activities. The
 law on the formation of associations stipulates that
 permission to form an association may be denied if it is
 apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal
 activities of a prohibited organization.

 AUSTRIA
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is provided for in the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St..Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, a religious group must register with the
 Government. Although 88 percent of the population is Roman
 Catholic, most of the world's major religions are represented,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel abroad and
 to emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the
 right to return.
 Austria serves as a country of first asylum for refugees from
 Eastern Europe and as a transit point for Soviet Jewish
 emigrants on their way to Israel or other countries. A mass
 exodus of East Germans from Hungary through Austria on their
 way to the Federal Republic of Germany began on September 1
 with the permission of Hungarian authorities. In 1989 more
 than 50,000 East Germans transited Austria.
 During 1989 the Interior Ministry reported that approximately
 21,800 persons applied for asylum in Austria. At year's end,
 18,252 asylum applicants were being cared for by Austrian
 authorities.
 Austrian authorities have been using an accelerated procedure
 for distinguishing between genuine political asylum seekers
 and "economically motivated" immigrants. Those arriving from
 Poland and Hungary are informed that they have very little
 chance of receiving asylum. In August 1988, 25 percent of
 applicants were granted asylum. This decreased to 15 percent
 in July 1989 and to 5 percent in August. Those denied Austrian
 asylum under this procedure generally have been allowed to
 remain in Austria but without any official financial support.
 Austria's legal guest worker population stood at 174,266 in
 November, not including resident dependents.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary
 system. Under the Constitution, national elections must be
 held at least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly
 draw high levels of participation. There is universal
 suffrage for those over 19 years of age. The most recent
 national elections (1986) resulted in a change of government.
 No party won an absolute majority. The Socialist Party, which
 won 80 seats in Parliament, went into a coalition with the
 People's Party, which won 77 seats. As for the two other
 parties represented in Parliament, the liberal/nationalist
 Freedom Party won 18 seats, and the Greens won 8. Several
 small parties participated in the elections, including the
 Communist Party, which did not receive sufficient support to
 elect candidates to the Parliament.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the
 authorities are discussed and investigated by the press,
 public groups, and private persons without government
 hindrance. Both international and local human rights groups
 operate freely.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Commission
 of Human Rights in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Human Rights Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively
 with international human rights matters, especially the human
 rights situation in Eastern Europe.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. In employment and in other areas, there is extensive
 legal protection against discrimination because of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. In practice, there is
 no pattern of such discrimination.
 The commemorative events and media analyses associated with
 the 50th anniversaries of the annexation of Austria by Germany
 in March 1938, the Kristallnacht pogrom in November 1938, and
 the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 included many
 examinations of anti-Semitism in Austrian history and
 contemporary Austria. The public discourse on the issue
 during this period was unprecedented in the postwar era.
 Opinion surveys indicate the continued existence of,
 anti-Semitic sentiments among some Austrians. The Government
 has condemned this phenomenon in very strong terms and has
 recommitted the country to combating all its manifestations.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been
 abolished. Women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward economic
 equality in the postwar era. Nevertheless, in practice
 inequality still exists in political, economic, and social
 fields, despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979 to reform
 family law.
 The issue of violence against women was addressed by the
 Government in 1989 as the coalition parties reached general
 agreement on several legal reforms. These would make spousal
 rape criminal and provide an expedited procedure for barring
 husbands from their homes when they had threatened their wives
 with violence. The latter procedure would be available even
 in the absence of a divorce action, a significant change in
 existing law.
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are fully respected.
 However, in 1989 the Slovenian-speaking minority in the
 province of Carinthia remained concerned about the future of
 instruction in the Slovenian language in local elementary
 schools. The Slovenes feared that changes in the province's
 bilingual education system, advocated by some German-speaking
 groups, might curtail the use of Slovenian in many provincial
 elementary schools. A 1988 comptomise plan to retain
 Slovenian/German bilingual education in a majority of
 
 
 1037
 ZMSTRIA
 instances has yet to take concrete form. In 1989 Slovene
 access to the government-owned televisidn broadcasts
 increased. The Government also pledged to construct a new
 secondary school for the Slovene cokr mity. Slevene leaders
 ended their 10-year boycott of partieipation in a federal
 advisory committee on Slovene issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 Their right to join trade unions and to engage in activities
 in ptvrsu~t of trade union aims is protected under general
 constitutional guarantees o-fteedom of association. in
 practice, Austrian trade unions have an important and
 independent voice in the political, social, and economic life
 of the country.
 More than 60 percent of the work force is organized in 15
 national unions, each of which is a member of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (ATUF)., This organization has a
 strong; dcentralized leadership structure. Individual unions
 and'the federation are independent of government or political
 party control, although there are formal factions within these
 organizations that are closely allied with political parties.
 Strikes in the postwar period have been comparatively few and
 usually (5f short 'duration. High on the list of reasons for
 Austria's record of labor peace is the system of "social
 partnership"--Austria's nearly unique unofficial forum for
 cooperation among labor, management, and government. At the
 center of the system is a parity commission for wages ind
 prices, chaired normally by the Federal Chancellor, which has
 an important voice on major economic questions.
 The ATUF is a member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions andthe European Trade Union Confederation.
 However, the'ATUF's Christian faction is also affiliated to
 the World Confederation of-Labor, while the left-wing faction
 is affiliated to the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 The labor movement enjoys widespread acceptance and almost all
 large companies, private and state owned, are strong and well
 organized. Workers councils representing all of the workers
 in a unit operate at the enterprise level, and workers are
 entitled by law to elect one-third of the members of the
 boards of major companies. Collective agreements are
 negotiated by the ATUF on behalf of its member unions with the
 National Chamber of Economics and its associations
 representing the employers within a framework of wage-price
 policy guidelines set by the Joint Parity Commission. A 1973
 law imposes on employers the obligation to prove that job
 dismissals are not motivated by antiunion discrimination. In
 1989 the International Labor Organization's Committee of
 Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations
 asked the Government to apply these protections also to
 enterprises with fewer than five employees.
 Workers are further protected by membership in the Austrian
 Chambers of Labor--compulsory for all employees except civil
 
 
 1038
 AUTRA
 servants. These chambers fulfill several functions that are
 handled by trade unions in other countries, such as carrying
 out studies and preparing legislative proposals, but the ATUF
 is exclusively responsible for collective bargaining. The
 leaderships of both the chambers and the ATUF are elected
 democratically.
 Austria has no export processing zones. Labor law and
 practice are uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced labor in Austria. It is prohibited by law.
 d. Minimum -Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 15. The law is effectively
 enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage in Austria, but a worker
 whose annual income falls below a poverty line (approximately
 $381 per family member per-month at the current exchange rate)
 is eligible to receive social welfare benefits. In addition,
 nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimum wage
 rates by job classification for each industry. The average
 Austrian has a high standard of living by any international
 comparison, and most of the least well-paid workers still
 enjoy a decent minimum standard.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours
 since 1975, more than 50 percent of the labor force enjoys
 collective bargaining agreements setting a maximum workweek at
 38 or 38.5 hours.
 Legislation under which a labor inspectorate attached to the
 Ministry of Social Affairs conducts inspections of
 occupational health and safety conditions ensures the
 effective protection of workers in these areas.
