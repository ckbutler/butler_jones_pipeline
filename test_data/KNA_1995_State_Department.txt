 ST. KTTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a small two-
 island state with a democratic, parliamentary form of government. The Constitution
 provides the smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the Federation in accordance with certain enumerated proce-
 dures. A Prime Minister, a Cabinet, and a Legislative Assembly govern the country.
 The Governor General, with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State
 and must call general elections at least every 5 years. After national elections in
 June, Prime Minister Denzil Douglas and his St. Kitts and Nevis Labor Party
 formed a Government with 7 out of 11 seats in the legislature. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent.
 Security forces consist of a smll plice force, which includes a 50-person Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 The mixed economy is based on sugar cane, tourism, and light industry. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry (the country's
 largest economic enterprise) and 85 percent of arable land are owned by a state cor-
 poration. Hurricanes in the latter half of the year caused substantial damage to the
 economy, particularly to the sugar crop and the rail system used to transport it, and
 resulted in a decline in tourism.
 Human rights were generally respected during 1995, although the Government
 continued to restrict access by the opposition to government-controlled media. Vio-
 lence against women is a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The authorities have closed the disappearance case of the former Kittitian ambas-
 sador to the United Nations as presumed lost at sea.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 St. Kitt's prison was built in the 1830's. Prisoners suffer from severe overcrowd-
 ing, poor food, and lax security. These conditions have contributed to riots in the
 past, although none occurred in 1995.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exle-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought before a court within 48 hours. There were no reported
 cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that every person ac-
 cused of a crime must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these require-
 ments are generally observed.
 The judiciary is highly regarded and independent. The court system is comprised
 of one high court and four magistrate's courts at the local level, with the right of
 appeal to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Court of Appeal. Final ap-
 
 
 517
 peal may be made to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no mili-
 tar or political courts. Legal assistance is available for indigent defendants.
 There were no reports of  litical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives
 of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, for the most part, the authorities respected these provisions in
 practice. However, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St.
 Kitta, and these media generally did not adequately publicize rallies and conven-
 tions held by the opposition political party. There is a religious television station
 and a privately owned radio station on News.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daly newspaper, each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspapr. The papers are free to criticize
 the Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International news publications
 are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Political parties organized demonstrations, rallies,
 and public meetings during the 1995 election campaign without significant govern-
 ment interference. The main opposition party was denied a parade permit several
 weeks befor  e election because the date conflicted with a arade organized by the
 ruling party. The main opposition party held its parade at a later date.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--The Government does not restrict travel within or departure from the
 country.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status;
 however, government practice remained undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens ar e    to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multipartyp~olitical system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of ago and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot.
 The Legislative Assembly has 11 elected seats: 8 for St. Kitts and 3 for Nevis.
 In the June elections, Prime Minister Dr. Denzil Douglas' St. Kitts and Nevis Labor
 Party won seven of eight seats at stake in St. Kitts with 60 percent of the popular
 vote. The People's Action Movement, the former ruling part y, took only one seat, but
 received 40 percent of the vote. The Concerned Citizens Movement won two of the
 three Nevis seats; the Nevis Reformation Party won the remaining one. The island
 of Nevis has considerable self-government and its own legislature.
 The re     no impediments in law or in practice to the participation of women in
 leadership roles in government or political parties. St. Kitts andNevis' sole female
 member of Parliament chose not to run for reelection in the June elections, and
 there were no other female candidates. However, women do hold such high govern-
 ment offices as permanent secretary and are active within the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, birth
 out of wedlock, political opinion or affiliation, color, sex, or creed, and the Govern-
 ment respects these provisions in practice.
 Women.-The roe of women in society is not restricted by law but is cir-
 cumscribed by culture and tradition. According to a government official, violence
 against women is a problem, but many women are reluctant to file complaints or
 pursue them in the courts. Despite this reluctance, there were publicly reported
 cases of both domestic violence and rape, and a few convictions. A special police unit
 
 
 works closely with the Ministry of Women's Affairs to investigate domestic violence
 and rape cases.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare and has
 incorporated most of the provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child into domestic legislation. There is no evidence of societal abuse or violence
 against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Although there is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constittion prohibit
 discrimination in employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The law permits the police, civil service, and
 other organizations to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union, the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St.
 Kitts Labour Party and is active in all sectors of the economy. There is also an inde-
 pendent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city, and
 a taxi drivers' association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes. Unions are free to form federations or con-
 federations and to affiliate with international organizations. The islands' unions
 maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. The law pro-
 hibits antiunion discrimination but does not require employers found guilty to rehire
 employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must pay
 lost wages and severance pay. There is no legislation governing the organization
 and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to recognize a
 union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled wish to orga-
 nize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace by workplace basis, not in-
 dustrywide. The Labour Commission mediates all types of disputes between labor
 and management on an ad hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes actually go
 to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the Minister of
 Labour can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be brought before
 a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not occur in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14 years. The Labour Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the
 community affairs division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. Local
 law mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A 1984 law, updated in 1994, establishes mini-
 mum wage rates for various categories of workers, such as domestic servants, retail
 employees, casino workers, and skilled workers. The minimum wage varies from
 $56.18 (EC$150) per week for full-time domestic workers to $74.91 (EC$200) per
 week for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a
 wage earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals
 such as goats and chickens. The Labour Commission undertakes regular wage in-
 spections and special investigations when it receives complaints; it requires employ-
 ers found in violation to pay back wages.
 The law provides for a 42- to 44-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. The law provides that workers receive a minimum annual va-
 cation of 2 weeks. While there are no specific health and safety regulations, the Fac-
 tories Law provides general health and safety guidance to Labour Ministry inspec-
 tors. The Labour Commissioner settles disputes over safety conditions. Workers
 have the right to report unsafe work environments without jeopardy to continued
 employment; inspectors then investigate such claims.
