 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) is a developing country with
 no proven oil reserves and few other natural resources.
 Until 1962, Yemen was a theocracy ruled by an Imam and
 isolated from the outside world. In 1962, a group of
 military officers led a republican revolution which over-
 threw the Imam. This was followed by a long civil war
 which continued until 1970.
 The Yemen Arab Republic is beset by problems of poorly
 developed public institutions, widespread poverty and
 political instability. Yemen does not have a cohesive
 society. It is divided along religious, tribal and
 geographical lines with rugged mountains, harsh deserts
 and poor roads virtually isolating large parts of the
 country. Central government authority in outlying areas
 is limited.
 During the past four years two Yemeni presidents have
 been assassinated. There were two attempted coups and
 a border war with the People's Democratic Republic of
 Yemen (PDRY - South Yemen). The PDRY-backed National
 Democratic Front (NDF) was active during 1980, primarily
 in the south-central part of the republic. NDF activi-
 ties included attacks on villages, assassinations and
 kidnapping of village leaders and other prominent citizens.
 Executive power in Yemen is exercised by the president,
 who is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
 Recent Yemeni presidents have been military officers.
 The president appoints an advisory council whose members
 represent a wide spectrum of political views. This
 advisory council, along with the Council of Ministers,
 advises the president on matters of state.
 The primary legislative body is the Constituent Assembly,
 which, after a hiatus of three years, was reconstituted
 by presidential appointment in 1978 and has now been
 expanded to its full membership. The Constituent
 Assembly is responsible for the ratification of laws
 and treaties, budget review, codification of Islamic
 law, and provisions for new elections. It has ratified
 the selection of the last two presidents.
 1. Respect for the Integriry of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Koranic law, on which the Yemen's legal system is based,
 prohibits torture. Article 42 of the constitution pro-
 hibits torture, as do several other statutes. There are
 credible reports that police and security officials have
 beaten prisoners during the interrogation process to
 obtain confessions. There are also reports that the
 government has not been overly zealous in its efforts
 to prevent torture or to punish the perpetrators. In
 many parts of the country, the government exercises
 insufficient control over local law enforcement and
 prison officials.
 
 
 1124
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The traditional Islamic law observed in Yemen sanctions a
 number of penalties such as stoning for adultery and
 severing of the right hand for theft. These penalties
 are not known to have been imposed since the establish-
 ment of the Republic in 1962. Prisoners incarcerated in
 remote areas, where the authority of the state is limited,
 are sometimes subjected to cruel or degrading treatment.
 Prison conditions there are often harsh.
 While the state furnishes only minimal food, medicine,
 clothing and amenities to prisoners, family, friends, and
 legal representatives of prisoners are allowed to visit
 and to bring these items to them. Treatment of prisoners
 normally is uniform and does not vary with the prisoner's
 offense, class, race, sex or religion. Prisoners without
 sufficient funds for legal representatives or without
 family and friends will not receive the visits and items
 mentioned above, thereby making incarceration more difficult.
 c. Disappearances
 There are cases of secret arrest and clandestine detention
 by the Central Organization for National Security, a
 security force reporting directly to the President and not
 governed by a particular law. These most often occur in
 cases of suspected espionage or other anti-government
 activity. Friends and family soon learn of the arrest,
 locate the detainee and initiate efforts for his release.
 If the national security forbes conclude that the
 individual was not involved in such activities, he
 normally is released from detention within the week.
 Other detainees have been held for months, however,
 before being released or referred to a special security
 court.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution and central government directives
 provide that an accused must be brought before a court
 within one week of arrest and tried within three to six
 months. Police may detain a suspect for up to 24 hours
 on their own authority. After this initial period of
 detention, the police must present the case to the public
 prosecutor's office, which may approve further periods of
 detention for investigative purposes. These periods are
 definite in length and normally six to eight weeks.
 Detainees are permitted access to family and lawyers.
 During the investigative process, lawyers are not permit-
 ted to represent their clients. Their activities are
 restricted to counseling the accused and attempting to
 insure fair treatment.
 These safeguards may not be available to persons detained
 by security forces. There are credible reports that
 arbitrary arrest and detention, for periods from one day
 to more than six months, have taken place. Political
 prisoners often fall into this category. They include,
 for example, persons suspected of espionage or of supporting
 armed dissident activity. In the sensitive and turbulent
 
 
 1125
 border areas, military and police authorities tend to act
 swiftly against those suspected or accused of anti-govern-
 ment activities. The number of political prisoners is
 believed to number in the hundreds, although the exact
 number is unknown.
 Occasionally, one or both parties in a commercial dispute
 are imprisoned and then seemingly forgotten, due to
 apparent official indifference or inadequate record-
 keeping. In such cases, a prisoner may remain in prison
 until family or friends are able to bring his case to the
 attention of higher authorities. There have been instances
 in which local authorities, on their own initiative, have
 arrested and detained individuals for lengthy periods of
 time on the basis of hearsay or circumstantial evidence.
 The government often uses religious and national holidays
 as opportunities to pardon and release detainees, both
 criminal and political.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are several types of courts in the Yemen Arab
 Republic including traditional Sha'ria (Islamic) courts,
 commercial courts, and special security courts.
 Yemenis obtain fair public trials in Sha'ria courts.
 These courts have a tradition of fairness and impartial-
 ity. The judge plays an active role in questioning the
 witnesses, seeking to establish the guilt or innocence
 of the accused. Attorneys may counsel their clients but
 do not actually represent the defendant. The defendant
 normally is informed of the charges against him at the
 conclusion of the police investigation. In the commercial
 court, litigants can also expect a fair and open trial.
 The attorney actively represents his client during the
 proceedings. The government is working toward -- but has
 not yet completed -- a national codification of all
 criminal laws to ensure standard court procedures, rules
 of evidence, and the protection of the accused's rights.
 The Sha'ria and commercial courts in Yemen remain largely
 independent of the executive, although all decisions are
 subject to review and confirmation by the president.
 Those charged with espionage or other anti-government
 activities are tried in special security courts. These
 courts are convened at the direction of the president to
 handle specific cases. The rights normally afforded the
 accused may be suspended in security cases. All decisions
 made by the security court are subject to review and
 confirmation by the president.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Residential search warrants, issued by the public
 prosecutor's office, are required. Traditional respect
 for the integrity of the home minimizes governmental
 invasions, which occur infrequently. National security
 forces, which are not regulated by a particular legal
 code, may enter homes without search warrants. During
 periods of national emergency, such as that following the
 October 1978 coup attempt, searches are conducted without
 warrants.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Yemen Arab Republic continues to be a poor country
 despite gains made since the overthrow of the Imam in
 1962. Per capita income in FY-78/79 was S268 according
 to U.N. estimates. Despite the rapid expansion of non-
 acricultural sectors, which grew an average of 15 percent
 annually, aariculture remains the most important
 activity. Agriculture produces approximately 40 percent
 of the country's total economic output and employs two-
 thirds of the domestic work force. Remittances from
 Yemenis who work abroad are the country's major source
 of foreign exchange. An estimated 800,000 Yemenis are
 expected to send home about S1.5 billion during FY-79180.
 Yemen's Five-Year Plan, covering 1976-81, targets an
 imoroved standard of living, and an overall annual growth
 rate of 8 percent. It calls for better health care and
 increased literacy, together with such infrastructure
 development as road construction, electrification, and
 industrial development.
 Although there have been advances made in health and
 education, much remains to be done. Average life
 expectancv for a Yemeni is 37 years; the infant mortality
 rate is 150 deaths per 1,000 births; the ratio of doctors
 to rersons ranges from 1 '26,000 in the most developed
 province to 1'57,000 in the least developed. Only twenty-
 six percent of Yemeni males and two percent of females are
 literate.
 The Yemeni government is constrained by lack of funds,
 organiration, and expertise and must rely heavily on
 :oreicn assistance in order to realize its development
 coals. Foreign assistance programs are under way to
 improve nutrition, to train nurses and midwives, to set
 ur clinics and hospitals, and to improve the quality of
 education. Local efforts also contribute toward meeting
 basic human needs. Local development associations have
 tarzeted S59.5 million for schools and S12.8 million for
 health durini the course of the Five-Year Plan.
 During FY--S -9, remittances provided an average S245
 rer capita in addition to the rer carita income of S268
 mentioned above. Accordinz to U.N. studies, these funds
 were well dispersed throuchout the population, with the
 larzer portion coing to rural areas. Despite Yemen's
 severe labor shortace, the government continues to allow
 Yemenis to work abroad and to transfer funds freely. The
 exocue cf en has made Yemeni women increasingly resrcn-
 sible for farr rrocuction and urkeer.
 All Yoenis, includino both men and women, have the richt
 to own rivate property. Many farmers own their land,
 th.uh.narecroppinc is more rrevalent in the southern
 mountain and coastal recions. Many urban dwellers are
 renters, but most own houses in their home villaces.
 The covernment encouraces private investment and industry
 while at the same time it develops the rublic sector.
 
 
 1127
 Except for the seizure of the former royal family's real
 estate holdings by the government and by some private
 individuals during the revolution, there have been no
 expropriations of private wealth. Most of the seized
 royal family properties remain with those who took them.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Riahts, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 While as individuals Yemenis are free to express their
 political views, the government does not tolerate mass
 political rallies which, in its view, are potential
 threats to the state's internal security. The government
 sometimes organizes rallies to support its own policies.
 The labor law of Yemen is a detailed and well-implemented
 document. Its stated intention is to protect workers
 from illegal or arbitrary actions by management. Under
 the law, labor unions and strikes are illegal. Few if
 any professional groups exist in Yemen. Yemeni lawyers
 within the past few months have initiated efforts to
 form a professional association but little progress is
 evident.
 The small Jewish community, estimated at between 400
 and 600 people, resides in remote sections of the country
 and coexists without friction with its tribal neighbors.
 Its m'mbers are under no restrictions as to movement or
 emigration. Foreign Christians art allowed to conduct
 private services and Christian missionaries are permitted
 to operate hospitals and clinics. Religious proselytizinz
 is forbidden by law.
 The Yemen press is iovernment-controlled. The Ministry
 of Information directs the television, radio and the news
 aqt'ncy from which the media obtain international news
 items. Whilt the daily newspapor in Sanaa occasionally
 has criticized certain government policies and ministries,
 no criticism of the ,iovernmtnt is found on radio and
 television. The Ministry of Information routinelv censors
 forei,in newspapers and maazinos. Btotks and artistic works
 art' monitored but not as elosolv controlled.
 b. Frtedom of Movemtnt within the Country, Forei-n
 Ttravtel, i-mie ration and Repatriation
 Yemenis .ire frt' to travel within the countrv. There
 traditionally has been larot'-scale emi,.ration, either
 Itemporary or prmant'nt. iRemi t tainces from Yemonis workin
 abroad are now ai impot'rtant sourco of national revenue.

 Yemen is located near several countries from which
 refugees seek asylum. Over the years, political refugees
 from the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen have been
 qranted refuge in Yemen and have integrated themselves
 into Yemeni society. The same cannot be said of other
 refugees, such as Ethiopians, Eritreans, and Somalis.
 The government has attempted to stem this flow; it regular-
 ly denies residence visas and asylum. There are 400
 to 500 Yemeni-Vietnamese refugees living in a refugee
 camp near Taiz. A number of Yemeni traders had migrated
 to Vietnam in the past and most of the refugees were
 ranted asylum in Yemen because they had some claim to
 Yemeni nationality. There are no available statistics
 for the numbers of South Yemenis, Ethiopians and other
 nationalities in Yemen who might be classified as
 re fujecs.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no political parties in Yemen. In the absence
 of elections, the Yemeni relics on the efforts of
 traditional leaders, such as tribal shaikhs and military
 officials to influence government decisions. Political
 decisions in Yemen often reflect the influence of
 Lraditional leaders whose support is essential for the
 conLinued eflectiveness of the qoverment. In early 1980,
 the president, Col. Al i Abdullah Salah, appointed a 40
 memls'r "Committee for NaLi onal Dialogue" to draw up plans
 for a national pc. The national pact apparently would
