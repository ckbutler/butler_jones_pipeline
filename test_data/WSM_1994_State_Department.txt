 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island countr with a population of approximatly
 160,000, is a parliamentary democracy but with certain concessions to Samoan cul-
 tural practices. The Constitution provides for a Samoan Head of State, a unicameral
 
 
 717
 legislature of mati (family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an independent ju-
 diciary, protection of Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of fun-
 damental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested in the Head of State,
 with the Government administered by the Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister
 and 12 ministers chosen by him. All laws passed by the Legislative Assembly need
 the approval of the Head of State, Malieta Tanumafili ]I, who holds the position
 for life. His successors will be elected by the Legisative Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but uniquely Samoan.
 Traditional authority is vested in the matai who are appointed by a consensus of
 the alga (extended family) or by decision of the fono (council of matai). Ownership
 of land is legally vested in the matai who have the responsibility to direct the eco-
 nomic, social, and political affairs of the alga. Western Samoa has 330 villages with
 over 25,000 matai. Each village is governed by a fono, which can fine or otherwise
 punish offenses against village rules.
 Western Samoa does not have a defense force. The small national police force is
 firmly under the control of the Government but has little impact beyond Apia, the
 ca itl city.
 e economy is primarily agricultural and is susceptible to shifts in world prices
 for its export commodities. In recent years, tourism and light industry have become
 increasingly important foreign exchange earners. Western Samoa is heavily depend-
 ent on foreign aid and on remittances sent to family members by more than 100,000
 Samoans living in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 Western Samoan society is based on a collective value system in which obligations
 and responsibilities to the alga are often given precedence over individual rights.
 Most disagreements are settled by decision of the fono. Judgments usually involve
 fines or, more rarely, banishment from the village.
 The principal human rights abuses arise out of political discrimination against
 women and non-matal, and violence against women. Societal pressures may inter-
 fere with the ability to conduct fair trials, and there are some restrictions on free-
 dom of speech and press and religion. A public defender's office and an ombuds-
 man's office help Samoans in their dealings with the courts and the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. However, there was one instance of vigilante killing
 arising out of a decision by a village council dispensing traditional justice (see Sec-
 tion i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or pun-
 ishment, and there have been no reports of such practices by police or other govern-
 ment authorities. However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the fonos
 may mete out banishment as punishment when deemed necessary. This is one of
 the harshest forms of punishment in this collective society.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law contains safeguards against ar-
 bitrary arrest and preventive detention, and these are widely observed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair
 public trial, which is honored by the official court system. However, many civil and
 criminal matters are not handled by Western-style courts but by village fonos, which
 differ considerably both in their decisionmaking style and in the number of matai
 involved in the decisions. The Village Fono Act of 1990 gives legal recognition to
 the decisions of the fono and provides for limited recourse of appeal to the Lands
 and Titles Courts and to the Supreme Court. In a 1993 court case, a village fono
 ordered the property of a villager to be burned after he had disobeyed and flouted
 village rules. An angry mob killed the villager and burned all his belongings. The
 villager who actually shot the victim was tried in 1994 and sentenced to death by
 the Supreme Court. The six matai members, though originally charged by the Su-
 preme Court with inciting murder, were subsequently only charged with willful
 damage and received a minimal fine and no jail sentence. Western Samoa's Attorney
 General has lodged an appeal on the grounds that the sentence was "inadequate
 and inappropriate."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Western
 Samoan law provides for protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property
 without substantive and procedural safeguards, including search warrants, which
 are issued by the judicial branch. Practically, however, there is little or no privacy
 
 
 718
 
 in the village. Village officials by law must have permission to enter homes, but
 there can be substantial social pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press. The Government prints a weekly newspaper containing news and
 features dealing largely with government activities. The Newspapers and Printers
 Act and the Defamation Act in 1993 require journalists to reveal their sources in
 the event of a defamation suit against them. To date, no court case has required
 that these acts be invoked. In 1994 the Prime Minister charged the local press with
 irresponsible journalism after one of his parliamentary speeches was reported inac-
 curately. He raised the possibility of legislation against what he called biased and
 malicious reporting, but no action has been taken.
 Two English-language newspapers and numerous Samoan-language newspapers
 are printed regularly m the country. The Government operates a radio station and
 the country's sole television station, and there are two private radio stations. Tele-
 vision from neighboring American Samoa is readily available to viewers in Western
 Samoa.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations. There are no sig-
 nificant restrictions. In 1994 Tumua and Pule, traditional leadership groups rep-
 resenting the two major islands of Upolu and Savaii, staged a major incident-free
 demonstration against a newly imposed value-added tax.
 c. Freedom ofReligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Nearly 100 percent of the population is
 Christian. However, wile the Constitution grants each person the right to change
 religion or belief and to worship or teach religion alone or with others, in practice
 the matai often choose the religious denomination of the aiga. There is strong soci-
 etal pressure to support church leaders and projects financilfly. Such contributions
 often total more than 30 percent of personal income.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, but in
 practice some citizens have been banished either from village activities or coi-
 letely from the village. The Government actively supports emigration as a safety
 valve for. pressures of a growing population, for potentially rebellious youths, and
 because it increases foreign ncme through remittances. The Government does not
 restrict foreign travel arbitrarily or the right of citizens to return from abroad.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through direct, multiparty
 elections but women's political rights are restricted by their lack of matai titles.
 While all citizens above the age of 21 may vote, the right to run for 47 of the 49
 seats in the Legislative Assembly remains the prerogative of the approximately
 25,000 matai, 95 percent of whom are men. The remaining two seats are reserved
 for citizens not of Samoan heritage. While all adult Samoans may vote for the Legis-
 lative Assembly, matai continue to control local government through the village
 fono, which are open to them alone. The 12-member Cabinet has 1 female member
 and women hold 2 of the 47 seats in Parliament. The first female judge was named
 Sin 1994.
 The political process in Western Samoa is more a function of personality than of
 p arty. The Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) led by its leader, Prime Minister
 Toffla Eti Alesana, holds the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. The
 Samoan National Development Party is the opposition party. Unless the Govern-
 ment falls, the next general elections will not be held until 1996.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions against their formation, no official or pri-
 vate human rights organizations exist. There are no reports of any international or
 nongovernmental requests for investigations of alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Western Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic minorities.
 Samoan politics and culture are the product of a heritage of chiefly privilege and
 power, and members of certain families have some advantages. While there is dis-
 crimination against non-matai and women, women (and particularly female matai)
 play an important role in society and may occasionally reach high office.
 
 
 Women.-The traditional subordinate role of women is changing, albeit slowly, es-
 pecially in the more conservative parts of society. While abuse or women is prohib-
 ited by law, social custom tolerates physical abuse of women within the home. The
 role and rights of the village fonos and tradition would prevent police from interfer-
 Ig n instances of domestic violence, barring a complaint from the victim-which
 village custom strongly discourages. While police do receive some complaints from
 abused women, domestic violence offenders are most often punished by village coun-
 cils, but only if the abuse is considered extreme. ("Extreme abuse" would be visibly
 evident signs of physical abuse.) The village religious leader may also intervene in
 domestic disputes.
 Many cases of rape ma still D unreported because tradition and custom discour-
 age it. In spite of this, the authorities note a greater number of reported cases of
 rape, as women are slowly becoming more forthcoming with the polce. Rape cases
 that do reach the courts are treated seriously. Convicted offenders are often given
 relatively stiff sentences of several years' imprisonment.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to the welfare of children is reflected
 in legislation and in its continued efforts to strengthen the educational system. The
 law prohibits abuse of children, but tradition tolerates physical abuse of children
 within the home.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has passed no legislation pertaining to
 the status of handicapped or disabled persons or regarding accessibility for the is-
 abled. Samoan tradition dictates that handicapped persons be cared for by their
 family, and this custom is widely observed in practice.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Western Samoan workers have legally unrestricted
 rights to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. To date, two trade
 unions have been organized. The Western Samoa National Union, organized in
 1994, is a six-member association which includes workers from the three major
 banks. A second union represents members at the sole large factory in the country.
 Both unions are independent of the Government and political parties. There are no
 laws specific to union activity in Western Samoa. The Commissioner of Labour
 would adjudicate any cases of retribution against strikers or union leaders on a
 case-by-case basis.
 The Public Service Association, representing government workers, an increasingly
 important sector of the work force, also functions as a union. The Supreme Court
 has upheld the right of government workers to strike, subject to certain restrictions
 imposed principally for reasons of public safety. Workers in the private sector have
 the right to strike, but in 1994 there were none. The Public Service Association free-
 ly maintains relations with international bodies and participates in bilateral ex-
 changes.
 b. he Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While workers have the legal
 right to engage in collective bargaining, they have seldom practiced it due to the
 newness of union activity and the inexperience of union leaders. However, the Pub-
 lic Service Association engages in collective bargaining on behalf of government
 workers, including bargaining on wages. Minimum wages are set by an advisory
 commission to the Minister of Labour. Wages in the private sector are determined
 by competitive demand for the required skills. Any antiunion discrimination case
 would be reported to and adjudicated by the Commissioner of Labour. Arbitration
 and mediation procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although these
 rarely arise.
 Labor law and practice in the one export processing zone are the same as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While the Government does not
 demand compulsory labor and it is prohibited by law, in this collective society people
 are frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most people do so willingly,
 but, if not, the mata can compel them to do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the terms of the Labor and
 Employment Act of 1972 as amended, it is illegal to employ children under 15 years
 of age except in "safe and light work." The Commissioner of Labor refers complaints
 about illegal child labor to the Attorney General for enforcement. The Attorney Gen-
 eral has received no complaints about violation of the child labor laws, which prob-
 ably seldom occurs. The law does not apply to service rendered to the matai, some
 of whom require children to work, primarily on village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of WorX.-The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 as
 amended established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a small mini-
 mum wage. The hourly minimum wage is $0.42 (Tala 1.05). This minimum wage
 suffices for a basic standard of living when supplemented by the subsistence farm-
 
 
 720
 and fishing in which most families engage. The Labour and Employment Act
 of 1972 provides that no worker should be required to work for more than 40 hours
 in any 1 week.
 The Act also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health standards, which
 the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing. Independent observers report,
 however, that the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when accidents high-
 light noncompliance. Many agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately
 protected from pesticides and other dangers to health. Government education pro-
 grams are addressing these concerns. The Act does not apply to service rendered
 to the matai. While the Act does not specifically address the right of workers to re-
 move themselves from a dangerous work situation, a report of such a case to the
 Commissioner of Labour would prompt an investigation, without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment. Government employees are covered under different and more
 stringent regulations, which are adequately enforced by the Public Service Commis-
 sion.
