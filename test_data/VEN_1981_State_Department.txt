 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela has now experienced 23 years of democratic
 government, and it continues to be a free and pluralis-
 tic society. This situation exists despite the economic
 difficulties of the last several years and despite the
 problems of enormous social change, a massive rural-urban
 population shift, inflows of illegal immigration, and
 a rising curve of expectations among its citizens.
 The voluntary handing over of executive power to an elected
 opposition has been firmly established in Venezuela.
 Democratic processes have been institutionalized and
 accepted-by all elements of the society. Venezuela has
 a free andlopen press. Venezuela maintains both in theory
 and in practice a clear commitment to human rights.
 The government of Venezuela is active in supporting demo-
 cratic governments throughout Central and South America,
 and it continues to offer asylum for political exiles.
 The reform bill under consideration in late 1981 by the
 Venezuelan congress will, if passed, significantly extend
 women's legal.rights. Through its oil facility agreements,
 Venezuela provides substantial assistance to Caribbean
 Basin nations. By returning part of the purchase price
 of petroleum in the form of long-term loans at nominal
 interest rates, Venezuela is providing a means for many
 of the oil-poor states of the region to undertake long-
 term, energy-related projects aimed at improving domestic
 and economic conditions. Venezuela also contributes
 aid through a number of multilateral organizations and
 has given considerable direct economic assistance to
 -El Salvador and Jamaica.
 The Venezuelan enjoys a high degree of individual liberty.
 His rights are protected by a judiciary which enforces
 habeas corpus, a free press sensitive to human rights
 issues, and a political system which features constant
 competition for public attention on social issues. Suc-
 %cessive democratic governments have pursued effective
 policies to attract radical political groups into the
 established political process. The-president of Venezue-
 la's.thLrd largest party is a.former guerrilla who accepted
 the proffered opportunity to renounce violence for legi-
 timate.politics. President Herrera's amnesty program
 was-the culmination of this process, and prominent former
 guerrilla leaders who had been imprisoned or living under-
 ground.accepted the amnesty offer.
 Venezuela.is South America's largest petroleum producer,
 with the result that it has the highest per capita gross
 domestic-product of .any country on the continent, approxi-
 mately $3636 in 1980. Nationalized oil and other indus-
 tries, although administered as private enterprises,
 place a substantial proportion of their income under
 direct or indirect government control. Despite relatively
 high employment, income distribution patterns are uneven.
 Approximately 70 percent of the work force has only primary
 education or less. Government social programs are directed
 (545)
 
 
 546
 at education and housing, but such programs have been
 severely hampered by the massive immigration of rural
 populations to urban areas during the past decade.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Article 60 section 3 of the 1961 constitution states
 that "no one may be held incommunicado nor subjected
 to torture or to other proceedings which cause physi-
 cal or moral suffering. Any physical or moral attack
 inflicted on a person subjected to restriction of his
 liberty is punishable." Constitutional guarantees of
 the integrity of the person are enforced. There is no
 practice of torture.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Pun-
 ishment
 The Venezuelan Constitution provides that "no law may
 establish the death penalty nor any authority to carry
 it out." It also limits prison sentences to a maximum
 of 30 years, regardless of the offense. Although the
 police have been known to be heavy-handed in dealing
 with suspected criminals, clearly illegal police activity
 is not tolerated by the authorities, the press, or the
 general public. Laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment are generally respected. However,
 prison conditions are poor and riots and hunger strikes
 have occurred, triggered by overcrowding and allegations
 of mistreatment of prisoners by guards. A federal inves-
 tigation of prison conditions is currently underway and
 a new prison is scheduled to open in 1982. Women offend-
 ers, with children, are rarely imprisoned because of
 a consideration of "family responsibilities."
 Venezuela's respect for rights of asylum was reaffirmed
 in August 1981, when a former political prisoner -- and
 police informant -- was given asylum in the Mexican Embassy
 and safe conduct was granted for him to leave the country.
 c.   Disappearances
 Occasionally "disappearances" are claimed to occur, and
 several cases have been the subject of Amnesty Interna-
 tional "urgent action" reports since late 1978. The
 Council on Hemispheric Affairs reported three unconfirmed
 cases of disappearance in 1980, one allegedly attributed
 to the security police, one to municipal police and one
 to military intelligence. Its 1981 report, however,
 placed Venezuela "in the forefront of hemispheric nations"
 in supporting human rights. Enforcement of official
 accountability is effective in the civilian courts, but
 limited in the case of those offenses subject to military
 jurisdiction (i.e., crimes against the security of the
 state) because of Venezuela's dual civilian-military
 structure which does not grant the attorney general juris-
 diction over the military justice system.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since the implementation of the Herrera government's
 amnesty program in 1979, there have been no substantiated
 claims that any prisoners or detainees are being held
 
 
 547
 in disregard of generally accepted principles. The govern-
 ment maintains that those detained or imprisoned have
 been either convicted or formally charged with specified
 criminal acts. Despite claims to the contrary by families
 and supporters of some incarcerated persons, no pattern
 of arbitrary arrest or imprisonment appears to exist.
 However, in one specific case the government has apparently
 decided to delay indefinitely, through legal tactics,
 the highest military court's review of the 1979 acquittal
 of four imprisoned expatriate Cubans accused of complicity
 in a 1976 terrorist bombing, whose release would seriously
 complicate Venezuelan-Cuban relations.
 Habeas corpus is an established practice, and arrested
 persons cannot legally be held more than eight days without
 formal charges being lodged against them. Occasional
 delays beyond that legal limit are due to bureaucratic
 lethargy and red tape.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Venezuelan law and practice provide for fair trials,
 including the assumption of innocence until proven guilty
 beyond reasonable doubt. Rules of evidence are strict,
 and convictions are not easy to obtain. A law passed
 in April 1980 provides for supervised parole, rather
 than imprisonment, of persons either convicted of crimes
 or detained pending trial for crimes whose prescribed
 penalties are five years imprisonment or less. The intent
 -- still to be fully realized -- is to reduce the prison
 population and eventually to offer probation as an alterna-
 tive to those facing detention for less.serious crimes.
 Except in the case of.civilians. tried by military courts
 for subversive~or terrorist acts, the civilian judiciary
 exercises complete jurisdiction independent of any other
 -authority.. Charges in both civilian and military courts
 must be for specific criminal offenses. Military justice
 provides for full access to the court by the accused
 and his lawyers,.but third party access to the proceedings
 is left  to the judge's discretion. Appeals of convictions
 can be made to the ,supreme court. The amnesty granted
 by the.Herrera government greatly reduced the numbers
 of civilians being held under military justice.
 f.   :Invasion of the Home
 Article 62 of the Venezuelan constitution provides that
 *the home is inviolable." Court warrants are generally
 required for an official to enter a private residence.
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home
 are respected in practice. However, police may enter
 a home if in active pursuit of a criminal.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Venezuelan constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
 press, religion and assembly. Freedom of association
 and assembly for lawful purposes are not subject to harass-
 ment or limitation. Radio, television, and the press
 are free and often highly critical of the government.
 Although the government tolerates such criticism, govern-
 nent-media tensionsi and occasional confrontations,
 
 
 548
 do occur. During 1981, for example, "El Diario" reporter
 Maria Eugenia Diaz and her editor were interrogated by
 a military investigator and had their homes searched
 because of a story written by the reporter which allegedly
 revealed sensitive information. A military judge later
 ordered the reporter's arrest. This order was not carried
 out because the reporter was -- and remains -- out of
 the country. Nevertheless, the government's action caused
 an outcry in the local and the foreign press. There
 has been continuing criticism, as well, of the proposed
 ban on liquor advertisements on radio and television,
 following a similar ban on cigarette advertising. Industry
 critics claim that the government's proposals are aimed
 less at curbing cigarette and alcohol consumption than
 they are at making the privately-owned media financially
 vulnerable. There is also opposition to the government's
 authority to punish violations of various programming
 codes without providing for recourse to the courts.
 Such shutdowns, usually for a day or two, are'ordered
 occasionally.
 Apart from the instances cited above, censorship and
 interference in the cultural and social fields are not
 practiced. Major parties and political figures are often
 the butt of successful theatrical productions and satirical
 publications, which are not subject to interference.
 Labor is the "object of special protection' under article
 85 of the constitution, and Venezuelan labor unions are
 free, independent, and a powerful force in the country.
 Strikes are frequent, unexceptional, and tolerated.
 They are also usually peaceful.
 There is no state religion. While the population is
 overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, other groups are allowed
 to proselytize actively. Adherence to such minority
 religious groups carries no social or political disadvan-
 tage.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, either
 within Venezuela or abroad. Venezuelans may emigrate
 without restriction, but few do so. There is also freedom
 to repatriate without prejudice. Recovery of nationality
 requires a residence period of two years for Venezuelan-
 born repatriates. A native-born citizen can expatriate
 himself only by voluntary renunciation of citizenship
 or by taking the citizenship of another country.
 Venezuela's immigration policies have been liberal.
 No reliable statistics are available regarding the number
 of aliens living in Venezuela, although there have been
 newspaper estimates of up to 300,000 -- the majority
 said to be Colombians. In an effort to solve the undocumented
 alien problem, the governmdnt has offered residence docu-
 ments, without prejudice, to employed illegal aliens
 registering with the authorities. As of April 1981,
 approximately 240,000 aliens registered with the govern-
 ment. Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for poli-
 tical and other refugees from the hemisphere. It has
 accepted for resettlement as many as 75,000 Cuban refugees
 and thousands of other Latin American refugees. Refugees
 from Europe have also found shelter in Venezuela, but
 statistics are lacking.
 
 
 549
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy with full citizen
 participation. Elections for president, a bicameral
 congress, and municipal councils are held every five
 years, with voter turnout approximating 90 percent.
 Two parties, Social Christian (COPEI) and Social Democratic
 (Accion Democratica), have elected presidents and held
 a majority or plurality of the seats in the congress
 during Venezuela's 23 years of uninterrupted democracy.
 A proliferation of minor parties, some of which were
 formerly guerrilla organizations accorded legitimate
 status in connection with amnesty policies, operate freely.
 Presently, such smaller parties -- most of them to the
 left -- represent approximately 15 percent of the national
 legislature.
 The Venezuelan constitution prohibits discrimination
 on the basis of sex, and women are awarded the same poli-
 tical rights under the law as men, as well as *special
 protection" in the workplace. While traditional practice
 has been that the woman's role is in the home, the rapid
 pace of modernization and social change has brought about
 attempts at greater equality and a continuing re-examina-
 tion of the role and rights of women. The Venezuelan
 cabinet includes a minister of state for women's affairs,
 and educated women are increasingly becoming prominent
 professionally. They are prominent in the judiciary
 and the government ministries, perhaps in part because
 male lawyers are not attracted by relatively low-paying
 government jobs. Nevertheless, government is setting
 a standard in employing increasing numbers of women at
 professional levels. A bill to reform the civil code
 to expand women's rights is being considered by the Vene-
 zuelan congress. Women are still underrepresented in
 political and economic life, although middle-level posi-
 tions are slowly opening up. The female blue collar
 labor force is also growing, but cultural bias and dis-
 crimination in employment remains. In general, women's
 wages are lower than those of men for the same work.
 While these differences persist, the trend is toward
 greater equality of opportunity in the workplace. Women
 are active in all political parties, although the most
 senior positions are still occupied by males.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 Venezuela has been a strong and consistent supporter
 of human rights in international fora. In 1981 Venezuela
 ratified the Pact of San Jose accepting the jurisdiction
 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Domestically,
 the fiscal general (attorney general) is charged with
 monitoring human rights in cases under civil court jurisdiction.
 An Amnesty International office operates freely in Caracas,
 as does the Latin American Foundation for Human Rights
 and Social Development. The local press is a major monitor
 of alleged human rights violations in Venezuela, and
 it does not hesitate to accord such allegations headline
 treatment. Venezuelan authorities are sensitive and
 responsive to approaches by recognized human rights organi-
 
 
 550
 zations. Venezuela strongly supports the United Nations
 and Inter-American Human Rights Commission and other
 groups, and takes pride in its good human rights record.
 Venezuela is a frequent and vocal critic of governments
 in Latin America and elsewhere that support or tolerate
 widespread human rights violations.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Despite Venezuela's tremendous resources and potential,
 and despite the government's clearly outlined plans,
 there has been no growth in the economy and a decrease
 in real per capita income over the last three years.
 Capital outflow due to interest rate differentials contri-
 buted to a shortage of liquidity for internal economic
 activity. In August 1981, the central bank was forced
 to let interest rates float, leading to a slight increase
 in borrowing. Floating rates should make more capital
 available, but could be detrimental to companies with
 current low profit margins. Tight credit during 1980
 has been instrumental in reducing inflation from that
 year's historically high annual rate of 23 percent.
 Figures for the first six months of this year indicate
 annual inflation will probably range from 14-18 percent.
 while tight money has reduced inflation, it has also
 depressed business activity.
 The government is making an effort to assist those on
 the lower end of the economic scale. In July 1981 the
 government established a system of interest-free loans
 to assist in the purchase of lower-priced houses. The
 government is dedicated to continuing assistance so that
 basic human rights are shared by everyone. The recently
 announced sixth national plan (1981-1985) seeks to improve
 the overall quality of life in Venezuela. Education
 at all levels will remain a top priority. Housing construc-
 tion, under the national housing program, is projected
 to provide an additional 669,000 housing units. The
 government expects an additional 76,000 hospital beds.
 It is planned that, by 1985, potable water will be avail-
 able to 90 percent of the urban population and at least
 70 percent of the rural population. The Venezuelan govern-
 ment's currently defined poverty level is $465 per house-
 hold per month. Using this income level, it has been
 estimated that some 81 percent of rural households and
 38 percent of urban households in Venezuela fell below
 poverty level.
