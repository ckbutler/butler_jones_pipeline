 GUATEMALA
 Following open and free elections of the President, federal
 deputies, and local mayors in 1985, Guatemalan democracy
 continued to take root during 1987. Fewer human rights
 violations were reported, and the Government improved its
 capacity to investigate allegations of abuses. In particular,
 politically motivated killings and kidnapings in 1987 occurred
 with much less frequency than in the early 1980's. The United
 Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) adopted a resolution
 in March 1987 recognizing the progress made by the Government
 in protecting human rights. The U.N.'s newly-appointed expert
 for advisory services visited Guatemala in September. Efforts
 continued by private Guatemalan citizens to have those
 responsible for past disappearances punished.
 The Marxist guerrilla insurgency, which has lasted for two
 decades, continued to decline. In October direct talks were
 held in Madrid between government officials and representatives
 of the guerrillas. A large public employees' strike during
 the spring and a major business shutdown to protest tax
 legislation in October were both resolved through dialog and
 without violent confrontation.
 The National Police are no longer under military control
 following their transfer to the Ministry of Interior in 1986.
 In 1987 the National Police improved their effectiveness and
 initiated proceedings against members accused of having
 committed criminal acts. Three hundred and sixty policemen
 were fired for criminal actions. Standards for recruitment to
 the force have been raised.
 Although suffering from a recession since the early 1980's,
 Guatemala stabilized its economy and achieved modest growth in
 1987. Distribution of wealth in Guatemala is badly skewed.
 The Government passed a tax reform measure, over the objections
 of private sector elements and opposition parties, to raise
 revenue needed to address social problems.
 The Guatemalan Congress selected a Human Rights Ombudsman in
 August. Thus far, the new Ombudsman has been active in
 attempting to resolve strikes and a case dealing with freedom
 of expression. In addition, that office is working with the
 Ministry of Education to formulate a human rights curriculum
 for the schools.
 Government actions to reform the judicial system and to
 increase the professionalization of its police forces
 continued with assistance from a number of other democratic
 governments, including United States' funding for
 "Administration of Justice" programs. A commission was formed
 in late 1987 to coordinate the efforts of the judicial,
 executive, and legislative branches, together with the
 universities and the bar association, in a coherent program
 supporting these objectives.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The number of cases in which a political motive could not be
 ruled out declined significantly fox the fifth year in a row.
 Estimates of the number of such cases, based on available
 
 
 495
 GUATEMALA
 official statistics, declined to 83 for the months January to
 November 1987; as compared to 126 for the same period in
 1986. It is' unknown how many of these deaths were, in fact,
 actually' polltfbally motivated or,* if so, which group or
 faction was responsible.
 The Governmet ha's;made an effort to eliminate any official
 involvement-in politica'l killings through reorganization and
 prosecutons of'the-military and police on criminal charges.
 Involverient of-mllftary personnel and pblicemen in some
 incidents of criminal activity is'a continuing problem.
 Homicides attributed to common crime continued at a high rate
 in 1987, 'inbluding cases of suspected vigilante justice by
 private'citiiens. According to National Police statistics, in
 .the first eight months of 1987, 1,183 murders occurred, an
 average'of 1418 a month, slightly below the 1986 average of 153
 a month. Reported cases of assault Vith intbnt to kill rose
 dramatically from an a~etage of 424 h month in 1986 to 600 a
 month in 1987.- This rise in crime has been' attributed in part
 to the activities of many unemployed ex-soldiers and bodyguards
 trained in the use of arms._ Solhe observers continue to cite
 the high rate of criminal violence in Guatemala as'a basis for
 charges that political killings continue unabated.
 Allegationis'of death squad-type activities cbntinued.  In
 November the-press'quted" a' membbf of 'the Congrssional Human
 Rights Committea';as 'caiming that death squads committed 186
 extrajudicial killings of individuals with criminal records in
 1986 and 1987. Representatives of the Government deny that
 the military and police are involved in death squad killings.
 A government representative stated that most killings of this
 type resultbd from'private land disputes, paid assassinatins -
 for personal reasonS., or criminal .'ang activity.     -   -
 Among th sdispected political murders i'n 1987 was the kidnaping ,
 and murder  of Edgar 'Arara Castillo: - Formerly active with
 subversive'brganizations, Arana Went-a6f1ad in:g1982'after
 receivfng-ddath'threlts. " After his e'tuin'to Guatemala, he
 was abducted in March 1987 and his body was later found
 floating in a river. Many assert that he was killed by the
 army as 'a political statemeit and as a warnin1 to ofher former
 guerrilla's not to return 'to Guatemala. Military official!S
 claim that Arana was'killed by the guerrillas for abandoning
 their cause.
 The murder of San Cdrlos University psychology Profess r
 Ronald Obdf'lio Villagran Marin is also suspected as being
 politicallymot-ivate."' A fbrmerpresident of the university's
 student associatibn in'1971-72, Villagran had received death
 threats sooradfcally since 1980. -A previous :attempt on his
 life in 1981"failed, and in 1986 he escaped two kidnaping
 attempts. 'He was shot to death in April 1987. Those close to
 Villagran assert that the army killed him to warn members of
 the university community who still'r'e residing abroad that
 they are n6f weltome in Guateniala. There is no evidence to
 substantiate this allegation, however.
 Christian Democratic Congressman Victor Vicente Moscoso
 Machorro was killed in-August, ift what appears to be an
 internal party struggle. A former bodyguard of the mayor of
 Jocotan, also a member of the Christian Democratic Party, was
 arrested and charged with murder. In the past year, in the
 city of Jocotai, the mufders of a union leader and two city
 councilmen were also attributed to party infighting.
 
 
 496
 GUATEMALA
 Several other widely-publicized cases also occurred in 1987 in
 which a political motive was suspected. Among those is the
 unsolved kidnaping and murder in January of Maria Odilia
 Raxjal Sisimit and her mother Maria Esteban Sisimit de Raxjal.
 In late October, the kidnaping and murders of university
 student leaders Danilo Sergio Alvarado Mejia and Rene Haroldo
 Leiva Cayax prompted a public outcry. Government authorities
 conducted a professional investigation which resulted in the
 arrest of the police chief of Quezaltenango for masterminding
 the crime and five other police officers for actually
 committing the killings. The case is now before the courts.
 The Marxist guerrilla insurgency continued in 1987. According
 to official statistics, guerrillas killed 53 soldiers through
 the month of August. In addition, 31 guerrillas, 8 civil
 defense patrolmen, and 54 civilians were reported to have died
 as a result of the fighting. Among those killed by the
 insurgents were three military commissioners (civilian
 representatives of the military) in the departments of Solola,
 Izabal and Quezaltenango. Others killed by the guerrillas
 include farm owners and managers in the departments of
 Escuintla and Chimaltenango.
 In November, 10 guerrillas stopped a bus near Santiago Atitlan
 and killed a local political figure who ran for Congress in
 1985. That same month, the military reported capturing two
 guerrilla notebooks which listed hundreds of assasination
 targets.
 b. Disappearance
 The situation in Guatemala today bears little resemblance to
 that of the early 1980's. Although disappearances are
 undoubtedly still taking place, and persons with links to the
 police or military are occasionally involved, neither civilian
 political leaders nor the military leadership sanction or
 condone politically motivated kidnapings. In 1987 both the
 military and police who committed such crimes were brought to
 trial.
 From January through August 1987, the National Police reported
 87 kidnapings,. compared to 72 during that 8-month period in
 1986, and some were presumed to be politically motivated.
 The most publicized case was that of Debora Carolina Vasquez
 Velasquez who was abducted in April in Guatemala City.
 Vasquez had been living abroad for 6 years and returned to
 Guatemala a few days before her abduction. After public
 denunciations by her father and the local human rights
 organization, the unidentified kidnapers released Vasquez
 after 9 days. The family claimed that the military was
 responsible for the abduction. They asserted the kidnaping
 was an effort by the military to warn former guerrilla
 sympathizers not to return to Guatemala. The Government
 categorically denied involvement in the kidnaping, which
 remains unsolved.
 In July Ernesto Tema Perez, the local Secretary General of the
 Social Democratic Party in San Marcos, and his brother, Juan
 Tema Perez, were abducted and are presumed dead. Leaders of
 the Social Democratic Party denounced the abductions in
 Congress, and in conjunction with leaders of other political
 parties, met with President Cerezo, and Defense Minister
 
 
 497
 GUATEMALA
 dramajo to discuss the case. The military agreed to
 investigate to ascertain if its personnel were involved. The
 case remains unsolved.
 A Catholic activilst priest, Father Andres Giron, met with
 President Cerezo in November to protest the alleged kidnaping
 and subsequent disappearance of several farmworkers.
 According to Giron, the-President agreed to investigate his
 allegations that some of the victims were taken to a farm
 owned by the military. The military has denied any involvement
 in the disappearances.
 Efforts to locate or account for missing persons from previous
 years continued in 1987. The most vocal Guatemalan group to
 demand'investigation into these disappearances is the Mutual
 Support Group (GAM). Since President Cerezo took office in
 January 1986, GAM leaders have called for an investigation
 into the whereabouts of missing persons and demanded that the
 kidnapers be brought to trial. In response to these demands,
 Cerez& announced in April the creation of a commission,
 composed of government officials, to investigate the status of
 missing persons. GAM members prbtested the lack of promised
 progress by:bccupying'the Guatemalan Congress building in
 July. The'governmental commission has not yet issued its
 report or -publicly defined- is role'-
 The GAM has at times made apparently unfbunded or
 unsubstantiated allegations; it has been urged by Cerezo to
 present its charges before the Guatemalan judicial system for
 investigation. In October GAM leaders'reversed their previous
 position of refusing to work with the courts and presented a
 legal complaint tb Judge Olegafio Labbe in which they accused
 17 soldiers and policemen of responsibility for disappearances
 which occurredlin 1983 and 1984-.
 Since mfd!'l9862 Judge -Lhbbe has in'Vestigated habeas corpus
 writs by humano rights oifganizations. -In a July 1987 interim
 report, he indicated'thab of l,367 writs received-, at least
 108 persons were still alive after they were reported to be
 missing. Many of these cases involved people who had departed
 for-the United States or'werb missing for only a few days. 'In
 a number of other cases, mostly among- those reported in 1986
 or 1987, some were erroneously alleged to be missing when they
 were actually serving in the-military or completing jail
 sentences.
 Gonzalo Menendez de la Riva was appointed as Guatemala's first
 Human Rights Ombudsmah in August. According to reports, the
 Ombudsman's Office iWill leave the investigation of cases of
 persons missifig from previous years to Judge Labbe. To date,
 the Ombudsman's Office has dealt primarily with other human
 rights issues, but may involve itself during 1988 with
 investigating current disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Reports of police brutality continued during 1987. Instances
 of torture attributable to the military or police forces are
 infrequent. The Nation'al Police., under the coordination of
 the Interior Ministry, are attempting to'end all such abuses.
 Through training and foreign assistance programs from several
 countries,-including the United States, Spain, Venezuela, and
 
 
 498
 GUATEMALA
 the Federal Republic of Germany, the National Police have
 begun to reorganize and to improve investigative and forensic
 laboratory techniques.
 d. Arbitiary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Allegations of arbitrary arrest are not frequent in Guatemala.
 Under the Constitution, a person cannot be held for more than
 6 hours without being brought before a judge and formally
 charged with a crime. Consequently, at times cases are
 brought before a judge with insufficient evidence. This
 requirement in the Constitution, designed to prevent arbitrary
 arrest and detention, has frequently resulted in allowing
 criminals to go free because of lack of time to investigate
 their cases.
 In spite of police comolaints that the judicial system favors
 the criminal, legislation supported by the Ministry of the
 Interior to permit holding repeat offenders in custody pending
 trial was struck down by the Constitutional Court during 1987.
 Involuntary exile is not used as a punishment by the
 Government, and there have been no known instances in which
 government critics were arrested for political reasons. The
 practice of compulsory labor is prohibited by law. Charges
 continue to surface that members of volunteer civil defense
 patrols are forced to do unrelated tasks without compensation.
 Documentation on such cases is scarce.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Government has attempted to strengthen the legal system
 which traditionally has been characterized as inefficient and
 corrupt, particularly by dismissing judges shown to be
 dishonest. The Guatemalan judiciary is working closely with
 the United Nations Institute for the Prevention of Crime and
 the Treatment of Criminals (ILANUD) in order to improve the
 effectiveness of the legal system and to acquire needed
 equipment.
 The right to legal counsel is provided for by law and made
 available by the state to indigents. State funded legal
 services are usually provided by law students. Since the
 majority of the nation's lawyers live in or near Guatemala
 City, it is sometimes difficult to obtain legal counsel in the
 countryside.
 Defendants may be released at the discretion of the magistrate
 after posting bail. The cumbersome judicial machinery results
 in many defendants spending several months in prison before
 their cases are brought to trial.
 There are no known cases of persons being imprisoned for
 political reasons or for nonviolent exercise of basic human
 rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home,
 personal correspondence, and private papers. Instances of
 authorities violating the privacy of the home and engaging in
 criminal acts against individuals and property are isolated.
 
 
 499
 GUATEMALA
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 An estimated 1,200 t� 1,500 Communist guerrillas continue to
 fight in remote areas. There are-few documented cases of-
 violations of humanitarian law.
 The use of landmines by the guerrillas, pkmarily'by the
 Revolutiohary Organization of the Pebple in Arms (ORPA), led
 to some civilian injuries. The Guatemalan Army does not place
 landmines. Among the cases reported in 1987 was one in which
 a vehicle detonated a landmine and three passengers were
 injured. In another highly publicized case, a young boy was
 seriously injured when he stepped on a landmine.
 Other violationS include murders by guerrillas of civilians
 such as farm administrators and military commissioners. On
 approximately 50 occasions so far this year, guerrillas have
 stopped buses to confiscate food, money and belongings from
 passengers. Residents continue to flee areas with heavy
 insurgent activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although there is no formal press censorship in Guatemala, the
 media continues to exercise a degree of self-censorship on
 certain'topjics. Charges of censorship were leveled at the
 Government for initially prohibitihg the airing of some
 television commercials critical of its tax policy. These
 announcements were rejected by the government entity
 responsible for approving all media advertisements because
 they allegedly contained untrue information. The advertisers
 were able to obtain a court injunction countermanding the
 GovernmdKt's decision, and the ads were broadcast. Generally
 the overwhelming majority of antigovernment advertisements,
 including insurgent manifestos, are run without government
 interferehce. The requirement that Guatemalan radio and
 television carry government-sponsored-broadcasting became a
 contentious issue. Under a 1978 law, radio and television
 stations cap be required to carry, government-provided
 broadcasting for. urgent mafters. Previously, the stations
 were only occasionally required to carry major national
 events. 'In mid-summer 1987, however, the Government began
 requiring stations to carry government broadcasts daily.
 Journalists charge that this requirement is an abuse of
 governmental authority.
 The arrest and 1-week detention of an investigative reporter
 in midsummer for afleged misappropriation of government
 property also caused concern within the press community. The
 arrest was not reported by Guatemala's press due to concern
 for the journalist's reputation and safety. Some observers
 viewed thp arrest as a veiled warning against investigative
 reporting. The lack of aggressive investigative reporting
 dealing with the military and human rights violations
 apparently is due to self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and political association are
 provided for in the Constitution, and are freely exercised.
 Labor groups, human rights organizations, and political
 parties have the right to meet peaceably and did so in 1987
 
 
 500
 GUATEMALA
 without government interference. The GAM continued to hold
 numerous marches and rallies to protest lack of action in
 resolving the cases of the disappeared during 1987. For 24
 hours in July they occupied the Guatemalan Congress building
 without incident.
 There are three major trade union confederations composed of
 hundreds of smaller, active labor unions, and many other types
 of smaller labor groupings. The largest union confederation
 is the Guatemalan Confederation for Syndical Unity (CUSG),
 composed of 150,000 members from 19 federations. The CUSG is
 a democratic group which receives some support from the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO), and is formally affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The
 second largest and most active confederation is the
 Coordinating Committee of Guatemalan Workers (CGTG), with six
 federations and a membership estimated at 23,500. This group
 has a Christian Democratic orientation and tends to support
 the Government. The leftist-oriented Union of Guatemalan
 Workers' Unions (UNSITRAGUA) is a loose coalition of 33 unions
 with approximately 12,000 members.
 These union confederations are free to organize, bargain and
 strike. In April and May, a massive public employees' strike
 which encompassed approximately 25,000 workers was settled
 peacefully.
 A major business shutdown took place in October to protest the
 Government's new tax package and most Guatemala City
 businesses were closed for several days. No actions were
 taken against the private sector organizers of this protest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 More than 70 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, but
 all religious denominations have the right to practice freely
 in Guatemala. Many Indian groups, which comprise roughly 50
 percent of the nation's total population, mix native beliefs
 with Catholic practices. Over 25 percent of Guatemalans now
 adhere to Protestant denominations, most of which are
 Evangelical in nature. There are also small communities of
 Jews, Mormons, Baha'i, and Buddhists. Tension between the
 nation's Catholic hierarchy and the growing Evangelical
 movement continues, but few instances of violent clashes were
 reported in 1987.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country and with regard to travel abroad. The only
 impediments to free movement are occasional government and
 guerrilla roadblocks. The police check vehicle registrations
 and look for suspicious vehicles which might be stolen or
 carrying stolen goods or contraband. Guatemalan guerrilla
 groups use roadblocks to rob the occupants of passing vehicles
 and to disseminate propaganda.
 Guatemala has ceased to be a refugee-generating country and is
 now a refugee-receiving country. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates the total number
 of Guatemalan refugees in Mexico has risen to approximately
 42,500 due solely to natural increase within the existing
 refugee community. Approximately 1,000 returned to Guatemala
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 GUATEMALA-
 during 1987. About 400 Guatemalan refugees remain in Honduras.
 Most of the refugees are Indians from aTeas afflicted by
 insurgent activities.
 The Catholic Church, in cooperation with the Government; is
 giving some limited assistance to several thousand displaced
 persons who had been living in areas of guerrilla activity in
 the highlands. Many of these displaced persons had been living
 in the mountains for'several years before seeking help.
 Bishops in the departments of Alta Verapaz and El Quiche are
 assisting these displaced persons, providing medical attention,
 food and temporary liousing.' The Government has provided land
 for settlement to some groups.
 Nicaraguans and Salvadorans continued to flock to Guatemala.
 Estimates of Nicaraguans living in Guatemala vary between
 7,000 and 20,000, most of whom are in the country illegally.
 In addition, several thousand Salvadorans have come to
 Guatemala to seek jobs or to escape guerrilla warfare. The
 Government does not deport these refugees, many of whom obtain
 assistance from various church groups and other charities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 .   to Change Their Government
 Presiden Vinicio Cerezo'took office in January 1986 after
 free and fair d~mocratic elections ihn1985-following 20 years
 of military rule. The President and a near majority of
 Congressional Deputies are members of the Christian Democratic
 Party. In the 100-member unicameral Congress there are ten
 political partieswhich range across the political spectrum
 from right to left. The:Presideit and Congressional deputies
 were elected to 5-year terms in 1985 and new national-
 electiois ate scheduled for 1990. Municipal elections are
 scheduled tobe held in smaller'municipalities nationwide in-
 April 1988. Several'government officials stated publicly in
 1987 thaE there wbuld be no impbdiment to the establishment of
 a legal.Commdnist party in Gudtemala.- -
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmentar Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In March the improved human rights situation in Guatemala was
 noted inr a resolution pdssed by the UNHRC. *Hector Gros
 Espiel,,the United Nations human rights expert for Guatemala,
 visited in September and consulted with the Government on
 human rights issues. Members of the UNHRC Working Group on
 Enforced.or Involuntary Disappearances visited in October.
 Amnesty International tnd Americas Watch continued to issue
 reports in 1987 that were critical of the human rights'
 situation in Guatemala, although some improvements were noted.
 Both groups have-visited to Guatemala since the democratically
 elected Government came to power in January 1986.
 Members of a now defunct organizing committee for a locally
 proposed Amnesty International chapter alleged instances of
 harassment and threats in late 1986 and early 1987, and
 attributed these acts to a reaction against their efforts to
 form a chapter.
 As noted earlier, the GAM's campaign to have disappearances
 from previous years investigated resulted in President
 
 
 502
 GUATEMALA
 Cerezo's creation in April of a governmental commission to
 investigate the status of missing persons.
 A locally managed Red Cross has operated freely in Guatemala
 for many years with no connection to the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In response to indications
 of interest in a renewed relationship, a delegation from the
 ICRC visited Guatemala in November. In December the Government
 granted approval for an ICRC office in Guatemala, and it
 opened in January 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Stark cultural differences between the ladino middle and upper
 classes and the large number of indigenous Mayan groups, who
 number approximately 50 percent of Guatemala's population,
 have historically created an environment of misunderstanding
 and separation between the two groups. In an attempt to bring
 the indigenous people into national life, the Government is
 providing them with medical attention as well as bilingual
 education in Spanish and their native language. Indians
 living near towns have had these benefits, and several have
 been elected as members of the National Congress and as mayors.
 A number of women are making significant contributions in the
 Government and the private sector. Two members of the
 Cabinet, seven members of the National Congress, and four of
 Guatemala's ambassadors posted abroad are women, as is the
 person appointed to the "notable" person position on the the
 National Reconciliation Commission, formed pursuant to the
 Esquipulas II agreement. Despite this progress, centuries-old
 stereotypes still exist. To address the needs of women in the
 workforce, the Government has established a National Office of
 Women (ONAM). Staff and resource limitations restrict its
 ability to coordinate activities with 56 Guatemalanwomen's
 organizations. Among the issues ONAM is attempting to address
 are employer discrimination against married and pregnant
 women, the inability of professional women to find employment,
 and the lack of day care centers for the children of working
 women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 A variety of laws protect the rights of Guatemalan workers by
 establishing minimum wages, minimum working age, safe working
 conditions, and maximum working hours. Minimum safety
 standards at the workplace are frequently ignored by the
 employers, and the government has been unable fully to enforce
 these laws. A labor court system exists to handle labor
 disputes, but it is heavily backlogged. Consequently,
 disputes are frequently negotiated outside the court system,
 usually to the detriment of the employee. The Ministry of
 Labor regularly becomes engaged in the settling of disputes
 between labor organizations and employers.
