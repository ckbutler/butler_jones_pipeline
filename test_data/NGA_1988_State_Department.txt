 NIGERIA
 Nigeria is ruled by a military regime under President Ibrahim
 Babangida, who came to power in an August 1985 coup. He led
 the overthrow of a previous military regime, which had seized
 power from a civilian government in December 1983. A
 30-member Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) is the country's
 main decisionmaking organ, while a mixed military/civilian
 cabinet presides over the Federal Government's executive
 functions. Military governors head each of the 21 states.
 The 1979 Constitution remains partially in effect, but
 significant provisions, namely those guaranteeing free
 elections, political parties, due process, and habeas corpus,
 are suspended. Federal and state legislation, promulgated by
 decree, is exempt from challenge in the courts. The Federal
 Military Government presented plans in 1987 to return the
 country to democratic, civilian rule characterized by a
 two-party system by 1990--later postponed to 1992. Following
 nationwide elections for local governing councils in 1987 and
 1988, a constitutional assembly began deliberations on a draft
 constitution in June 1988.
 The Government enforces its authority through the federal
 security apparatus--the military, the State Security Service
 (SSS), and the national police--and through the courts. No
 separate law enforcement agencies exist at the state and local
 levels. The Government generally exercises effective control
 over the security apparatus, but deficiencies in organization,
 management, and implementation of control have led to human
 rights violations.
 Nigeria, with an estimated population of 110 million, is
 Africa's most populous country. It has a mixed economy in
 which the Government plays a major but declining role. In
 1986 President Babangida announced a structural adjustment
 program calling for increased reliance on market forces and
 the private sector. Though the program formally was to end in
 June 1988, its essential elements remain in place, including a
 sweeping privatization effort affecting 92 state-owned
 companies and ambitious diversification projects, e.g., the
 liquefied natural gas plan.
 Under the AFRC, human rights in Nigeria continued to be
 circumscribed in 1988. The Government enforced limits on
 press freedom; it proscribed organizations and detained
 persons it considered threatening, including journalists and
 trade unionists; and constrained political expression and
 association, at least until 1989, when some partisan political
 activity will be allowed to resume. Nevertheless, the
 Government repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to human
 rights, which it defines in essentially Western terms, and
 initiated steps toward the reestablishment of a democratic
 system, e.g., the constitutional assembly. There is tension
 between the Government's commitment to fundamental liberties
 and its concern to maintain security and order in a country
 that suffered a devastating civil war in the mid-1960's and
 still experiences strong ethnic, regional, and religious
 divisions. However, in the lively press and public operation
 of local human rights organizations and among lawyers,
 academics, and political leaders, including President
 Babangida, human rights is an ongoing subject of debate. A
 major human rights concern is the slow pace of the court
 system: more than half the prison population has never been
 convicted of-any crime, although many prisoners have been
 awaiting trial for years.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was no evidence of politically motivated killing at
 government or private instigation in 1988. The October 1986
 letter-bomb killing of th  editor-in-chief of an influential
 newsmagazine, Dele Giwa, remains unsolved despite a continuing
 government investigation.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A portion of the 1979 Constitution still in effect outlaws
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Nigerian law provides
 that such excesses be dealt with in criminal or civil
 proceedings. There were no reports or allegations of torture
 in 1988. However, public allegations and evidence of police
 brutality frequently surfaced, primarily in connection with
 the treatment of suspected armed robbers.
 In 1988 there was considerable attention given to prison
 conditions, which remain poor because of the lack of basic
 necessities. Food and medical facilities are particularly
 inadequate. As a result, malnutrition and disease are
 prevalent among those unable to receive support from private
 outside sources. The Government has announced plans for a
 program to build several new prisons. In May 1987, inmates at
 Benin prison rioted over food supplies, resulting in the
 deaths of 24 prisoners.
 In addition to the poor conditions in the general prison
 system, recent confirmed reports indicate that the Government
 ran for 10 years an unofficial island prison, Ita-Oko, which
 the press reported was set in "some of the most inhospitable
 conditions known to man." The prison was closed on September
 29, the day its existence was reported in the Lagos press.
 Accessible only by boat or helicopter, it was reported to be
 escape-proof for its approximately 20 prisoners. The Obasanjo
 Government founded the prison in 1978 and originally intended
 the island camp to be a "rehabilitation center" for homeless
 and idle Nigerians and illegal aliens who, it was alleged,
 were prone to crime. Under the Buhari regime it was used to
 incarcerate civilian and military detainees. The prison's
 population peaked under Buhari, when 50 prisoners were
 detained there. According to the Nigerian civil liberties
 organization, which discovered the prison, inmates were at the
 mercy of the Nigerian security-forces who determined their
 length of stay.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Babangida Government has retained the authority to detain
 without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country,
 as well as those suspected of being a threat to the Government
 under Decree 2 of 1984, the State Security (Detention of
 Persons) Decree. This Decree suspends sections of the 1979
 
 
 260
 NIGERIA
 Constitution guaranteeing citizens the right to fair trial,
 due process, and judicial determination of the legality of
 detention (habeas corpus). While it imposes no time limit and
 disallows challenges of the detention in a court of law, the
 Decree provides for administrative review of such cases every
 3 months. Several persons, including former politicians
 returning from self-exile, were detained under this Decree
 during 1987. In 1988 journalists and labor leaders were
 detained under this Decree for questioning, usually for
 periods of several days. In addition, the Federal Military
 Government announced in August 1988 that the authority to
 arrest and detain without trial had been extended to the
 Minister of Internal Affairs, who will now share this power
 with the Chief of General Staff and the Inspector-General of
 Police.
 Some Nigerians were detained in 1988 without being held under
 the provisions of Decree 2 of 1984. Cumbersome administrative
 procedures and bureaucratic inefficiency can result in persons
 suspected of criminal offenses being held for extended periods
 without charge or trial. This is so even though provisions of
 the 1979 Constitution still in force stipulate that persons
 charged with crimes should receive a fair public trial in
 civilian courts within 3 months from the date of arrest. The
 Minister of Internal Affairs stated in September that, of a
 prison population of 58,000, 27,860 prisoners are awaiting
 trial. Human rights activists and press reports state that
 unless someone outside has kept track of the prisoner and his
 case, legal assistance may be delayed for years while the
 prisoner remains incarcerated. High Court chief judges
 continued in 1988 to exercise their right to release detainees
 who have already spent more time in prison than they would
 have if they had been convicted for their alleged crimes.
 Following religious riots in northern Nigeria in March 1987,
 about 700 persons were detained for investigation. The Civil
 Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree, Decree 2 of 1987,
 promulgated after the riots, provided for investigation and
 the arrest and trial by a special tribunal of those suspected
 of committing specified offenses. Although this Decree made
 northern Nigeria's criminal procedure code the applicable law
 for the trials, administrative confusion resulted in long
 detentions into 1988 without charge or bail for many.
 However, by year's end, all of those involved had appeared
 before the tribunal, and either had been convicted or
 released. The cases of those who were found guilty were being
 reviewed by the Kaduna state military governor.
 In 1988 the Government continued a process, begun in 1986, of
 reviewing the cases of persons detained or convicted under
 various decrees during the previous military administration
 (1984-1985), many of whom have already been released. At the
 end of 1988, the number of political detainees and prisoners
 was unknown but believed to be few. Most of those arrested as
 a result of the 1985 coup that brought Babangida into power
 have been released. Two exceptions had been former Head of
 State Muhamadu Buhari and his second-in-command, Tunde
 Idiagbon; however, both were released in December but remained
 subject to restrictions on their travel abroad. Shehu Shagari
 and Alexander Ekwueme, the former civilian President and Vice
 President overthrown in 1983, remained under similar
 restrictions in 1988.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 NIGERIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1984 decree modifying the 1979 Constitution left the
 judiciary relatively unscathed, but it shifted judicial
 responsibility for certain specified offenses to special
 military tribunals that were established outside the regular
 judicial system. The regular judiciary is composed of both
 federal and state courts and includes procedures for appeals
 from courts of first instance to appeal courts at state
 levels, then to the Federal Court of Appeals, and finally to
 the Federal Supreme Court. Courts of first instance under the
 1979 Constitution include magistrate or district courts,
 customary or area courts, religious or Shari'a courts, and for
 some specified cases, the state High Courts. In some
 instances, the nature of the case determines which court
 enjoys jurisdiction. In others, when jurisdiction is
 overlapping, as in the case of customary and Shari'a courts,
 the plaintiff can designate the court. Shari'a, or Islamic
 Courts, are limited by the Constitution to the 11 northern
 states of Nigeria.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and adhere to
 certain constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. These
 include a presumption of innocence, the right to be present at
 a public trial, to confront witnesses and present evidence,
 and to be represented by legal counsel if desired. In capital
 cases, the Government provides counsel for indigent
 defendants. In other cases, indigents must rely for counsel
 on the Nigerian Legal Aid Council, which has limited
 resources. There is a functioning bail system. Bail,
 however, is denied to those charged with murder and armed
 robbery.
 Through decrees promulgated by the previous military
 government that are still in effect, the AFRC transferred
 jurisdiction over cases involving corruption, currency
 violations, armed robbery, and a variety of miscellaneous
 offenses, such as drug trafficking and illegal oil bunkering,
 from the civilian judicial system to special military
 tribunals. In these cases, those charged have access to legal
 assistance, bail (except in the case of armed robbery), and
 the right to appeal (except in the case of armed robbery and
 conviction under the Civil Disturbances Decree). In contrast
 to the previous regime, however, civilian judges head all
 Special Tribunals even though a representative of the military
 and the police are also included. Convictions for armed
 robbery by the Special Robbery and Firearms Tribunals carry
 the death sentence and no right of appeal, although the
 sentence must be confirmed by state military governors before
 it is carried out. Conviction under the Treason and Other
 Offenses Tribunal (formed in 1986) also carries the death
 sentence and provides for appeal only to the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff. The Special Appeal Tribunal began its first hearing in
 September 1987. Recommendations of the Appeal Tribunal are
 subject to AFRC confirmation.
 There is criticism of the mandatory death penalty without
 right of appeal, especially for convictions for armed robbery
 where the sums involved are minor and there appear to be
 irregularities in procedure. Armed robbers have been
 sentenced to death for stealing sums as small as about $65.
 In another case, 12 males aged 16 to 18 were sentenced to
 death in a trial that the press and legal observers charged
 was riddled with irregularities. At year's end, the case was
 under review by the state governor.
 
 
 NIGERIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions
 of the 1979 Constitution still in force provide for rights of
 privacy in the home, correspondence, and oral electronic
 communications. While there have been isolated instances of
 unauthorized forced entry by security elements, the State does
 not carry out general surveillance of the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The modified 1979 Constitution continues to provide for
 freedom of expression and the press. In addition, the 1979
 Constitution reserves for the federal and state governments
 the exclusive right to own and operate radio and television
 stations. There are no restrictions on ownership of print
 media, and Nigeria has a lively press. Among the many
 Nigerian daily newspapers are seven privately owned national
 dailies with large circulations, one daily owned by the
 Federal Government, and another in which the Federal
 Government owns a majority share. Many states operate their
 own daily or weekly newspapers. In some states, privately
 owned dailies compete with state papers. Six weekly
 newsmagazines (including two new ones in 1988) vie for
 national readership.
 In practice criticism of the Government is tolerated, and
 there is generally open discussion of political, social, and
 economic issues. The AFRC, however, uses various techniques
 to limit public political expression and press freedom, e.g.,
 it frequently cautions journalists, both publicly and
 privately, on their responsibility and the limits of the
 Government's tolerance of press freedom. As a result,
 journalists maintain that self-censorship is common.
 In 1988 federal and state governments continued to interrogate
 and detain editors and reporters of newspapers when those
 organs published stories with which the Government took strong
 exception. There have also been allegations of harassment of
 editors and publishers by the security forces. Government
 officials have denied access to certain government buildings
 (such as State House) to journalists who published stories
 which the Government found embarrassing. The magazine This
 Week was suspended for several weeks for publishing a story on
 the President's advisors.
 The Government also influences publications through
 administrative means. The military governor of Lagos State
 was considering a law which would compel publishers to send
 advance copies of publications to state officials when
 requested and to inform them of appointments of new editors.
 Penalties for violations would include heavy fines or closure
 of press offices. Because Lagos is the governmental,
 commercial, and information center of Nigeria, this edict
 would have repercussions throughout Nigeria if enacted.
 Several other states were also reported to have enacted such
 laws or to be considering them.
 Academic freedom has generally been respected, although events
 in 1988 clouded the picture. In March the Government deported
 a university professor, Patrick Wilmot, a Jamaican national
 
 
 263
 NIGERIA
 who had lived in Nigeria since 1970 and is married to a
 Nigerian citizen. Although the Government accused Wilmot of
 spying for the South African Government, it never attempted to
 bring him to trial, nor did it produce any evidence to
 substantiate the charges. The Government, however, accused
 Wilmot of being a "radical" and of inciting students to
 "radical activities." His deportation came at a time when the
 Government had begun to warn Nigerians against so-called
 radical activity, and one state governor commented that "the
 deportation of Dr. Wilmot is a note of warning to other
 university dons who might toe his line." The Government has
 also cited the activity of "radicals" within the National
 Association of Nigerian students (NANS) and the Nigerian
 Labour Congress (NLC) as one of the reasons for banning the
 former and suspending the latter. The Academic Staff Union of
 Universities (ASUU) was also proscribed by decree in July.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution assures all citizens the right to
 assemble freely and to associate with other persons in
 political parties, trade unions, or other special interest
 association. In practice, however, there are important
 limitations. The provision regarding the right to form and
 join political parties was suspended by Decree 9 of 1984.
 This Decree also authorizes the Government to dissolve or ban
 any other group considered to have objectives similar to those
 of a political party. Police monitor gatherings suspected of
 violating the ban. The Government frequently reminded
 Nigerians during 1988 of the continuing ban on political
 activity, and it also disbanded at least one group it
 suspected of violating the ban. The Government intends to
 allow the formation of political parties, limited to two, in
 1989, but has insisted that both political parties must be
 national--that is, command significant support in all 21
 states--and that neither be based on religion.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special
 interest organizations, including religious groups, trade
 groups, women's organization, and professional associations.
 Organizations are not required to register with the
 Government. Following the March 1987 religious disturbances,
 however, the Government required that religious groups be
 sanctioned by either the Christian Association of Nigeria or
 the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. Permits are not
 normally required for public meetings unless'the venue is
 outdoors in a government facility and police security would be
 appropriate. In most states, open-air religious services,
 outside a church or a mosque, continue to be prohibited. The
 ban on'NANS remains in effect, although some universities have
 allowed campus student governments to return.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution prohibits the federal and state
 governments from adopting any religion as a state religion.
 This is adhered to in practice. Constitutional provisions
 providing for freedom of religious belief, religious practice,
 and religious education are generally respected. Allegations
 persist of harassment of Christians by officials in the
 predominantly Muslim areas of northern Nigeria in the form of
 bureaucratic obstacles to church construction that delay
 
 
 264
 NIGERIA
 projects, sometimes indefinitely. In 1988 Muslims in Plateau
 State, where Christians are in the majority in local
 governments, made similar charges. There are no restrictions
 on the numbers of clergy trained nor on contacts with
 coreligionists in other countries. Religious travel,
 including the hajj, is permitted and is even subsidized by the
 Federal Government. Missionaries and foreign clergy, though
 limited by quotas, are permitted to work in Nigeria. The
 Government places no obstacles in the way of Nigerian
 missionaries working in other countries.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities remain
 high in some parts of Nigeria, though there has been no
 repetition of the violent religious rioting which took place
 in the northern state of Kaduna in 1987. In the aftermath of
 those disturbances, the Government instituted a ban, still in
 effect, on all religious organizations on postprimary
 campuses, while reaffirming the right of individual students
 to practice their religion in recognized places of worship.
 Several state governments temporarily banned religious
 preaching and the playing of religious cassettes outside
 places of worship, without the written permission of police.
 Publication of advertisements paid for by religious
 organizations remains banned, and religious programming on
 radio and television remains limited in some areas. In July
 1987, the Government launched the Advisory Council on
 Religious Affairs, comprised of equal numbers of Christian and
 Muslim leaders. Some Christian leaders initially boycotted
 the Council's proceedings. By mid-1988, the Council had won
 acceptance from leaders of both religious communities,
 although it had not held a formal meeting by the end of 1988.
 The 1982 ban on the Maitatsine religious sect, the source of
 bloody disturbances in 1982 and 1983, remains in effect. The
 group still exists but is closely monitored by the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles citizens to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside where they wish. The same
 provision prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the denial of
 entry to or exit from Nigeria to any citizen. In general,
 these provisions have been observed. Following the local
 elections in December 1987 and March 1988, the authorities
 ordered in June the chairmen of local government areas to
 inform their respective state governors of their travel
 outside of their areas. An attempt has also been made to
 order traditional rulers to inform local government chairmen
 of their travel. Police blockades, ostensibly to combat the
 high crime rate, are set up throughout the country, and
 security authorities are often accused of demanding bribes or
 staging false arrests. There have also been cases of military
 personnel harassing citizens or taking the law into their own
 hands over personal disputes without being disciplined or
 punished. The Government has spoken out against these
 practices, but there have been few prosecutions for them.
 Nigerians travel abroad in large numbers, and many thousands
 are studying abroad. Exit visas are not required. However,
 passports of editors and reporters have been seized to prevent
 them from traveling after their publications have printed
 stories offensive to the Government. Citizens who leave
 Nigeria have the right to return. Citizenship cannot be taken
 away for any reason, including political reasons, from persons
 who are citizens by birth or naturalization. No known
 
 
 265
 NIGERIA
 penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have emigrated,
 settled abroad, or acquired another nationality. However,
 Nigeria does not recognize dual nationality, and
 naturalization in another country does not release Nigerians
 from Nigerian laws.
 Nigerians are free to change their place of work within
 Nigeria, but local laws and custom sometime disadvantage
 citizens not indigenous to the area. For example, access to
 limited places in elementary and secondary schools is more
 difficult for children of residents of other areas who must
 also pay higher school fees than the children of local
 residents.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria supports and cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Repatriation of refugees is normally conducted in accordance
 with UNHCR standards. In 1987 and 1988, several hundred
 Chadian refugees were repatriated at their request. No
 refugees were expelled in 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1988 citizens did not have the right to change their
 national or state governments through the electoral process.
 The 30-member AFRC headed by President Babangida is the
 highest political authority in Nigeria; there is no elected
 legislative body, and political parties are prohibited.
 President Babangida has repeatedly stated that 1992 is the
 date for returning Nigeria to complete civilian rule. The
 Government based its program for transition to civilian rule
 on the recommendations of the civilian Political Bureau, which
 conducted a nationwide year-long public debate on Nigeria's
 political future during 1986 and presented its findings to the
 AFRC in April 1987. While many of the Bureau's
 recommendations were accepted,, the Government rejected or
 amended many other significant provisions, especially on
 socioeconomic policy. An appointed civilian Constitutional
 Review Commission completed its work in early 1988 and in
 April presented a draft constitution to the AFRC.
 In June the Constituent Assembly, made up of representatives
 elected by local government areas and including
 representatives of special groups (labor, women, religious
 leaders) -appointed by the Government, began the process of
 ratifying the Constitution. The new Constitution is expected
 to resemble closely Nigeria's 1979 Constitution. The
 Government, however, recommended a major change calling for a
 two-party rather than the multiparty system which permitted
 six political parties to participate in the last elections in
 1983. While the Government has generally permitted
 deliberations to proceed without interference, it ended the
 Assembly's debate on extending the jurisdiction of Sharila
 Islamic courts when Christian and Muslim delegates became
 deadlocked.
 The Government also appointed a National Population Commission
 to undertake a nationwide census in 1991. The Government has
 indicated, however, that the results of the census will not be
 used for redrawing political districts for the national
 elections in 1992.
 
 
 266
 NIGERIA
 In December 1987, the Government organized elections for local
 government area councils. In those jurisdictions where the
 results of these elections were invalidated because of fraud
 or mismanagement (about 6 percent of the total), new elections
 were held in March. In September the Federal Military
 Government suspended from office an elected chairman of a
 local government area for alleged financial irregularities
 connected to his involvement with a state-owned company. This
 act established that during the period of transition to
 civilian rule, the Federal Military Government may suspend
 elected officials without reference to the judiciary.
 In local government elections, all citizens 18 years and older
 were eligible to vote. Dates have been set for additional
 elections at local and state level in the run-up to 1992.
 Thousands of former Nigerian government officials, both
 civilian and military, are prohibited from participating fully
 in the transition process, although they remain eligible to
 vote. In September 1987, the Government significantly
 extended a ban announced in 1986 on partisan political
 activity for a large number of former politicians from the
 last civilian regime (1979-83) to include many political
 figures from'the first civilian republic (1960-66) and past
 and present high-ranking military leaders. These persons,
 including President Babangida himself, will be barred from
 contesting any election until after the transition is
 completed in 1992. Also, former politicians who were officers
 of the previous parties will be forbidden to hold office in
 any political party or to run for elected office until that
 time. Furthermore, any person convicted or removed from
 office for various misdeeds at any time since 1960 will be
 banned for life from contesting elections or holding any
 political party office.
 Along with the July 1987 announcement of the political
 transition program, the Government promulgated Decree 19 of
 1987, which makes persons who might in any way forestall or
 prejudice the transition program liable to a prison term of up
 to 5 years. The Special Tribunal authorized to try offenses
 under Decree 19 was formed in October 1987. Its decisions may
 be appealed to the Special Appeal Tribunal. In addition,
 anyone who takes part in forming a political body prior to the
 lifting of Decree 9 (1984) or encourages others to join him in
 misrepresenting or distorting the provisions of the transition
 program is subject to the same penalty. No one has yet been
 charged under Decree 9, but the Government has frequently
 warned that such violations are being monitored and are
 subject to prosecution.
 The composition of the AFRC and Cabinet reflects greater
 ethnic and religious diversity than any Government in the
 recent past. There are currently no women, however, on the
 AFRC or the National Council of Ministers (Federal Cabinet).
 Five women serve as directors general in cabinet departments;
 some serve on state executive councils or as commissioners in
 state governments. A few women also won posts in the local
 government area elections in December and March. One woman
 sits on the Federal High Court, and several sit on State High
 Courts.
 
 
 267
 NIGERIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, the Government did not respond to Amnesty
 International's (AI's) several 1988 appeals concerning
 commutation of individual death sentences and an end to
 executions. There were no investigations of alleged human
 rights violations in Nigeria during 1988 by any international
 or nongovernmental agency. The Babangida Government has
 repeatedly renewed its pledge to uphold basic human rights and
 to tolerate criticism from local human rights advocates. It
 does not interfere with local human rights organizations. The
 Human Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association  .
 monitors the domestic human rights situation and consistently
 speaks out against human rights abuses. At least three other
 groups also monitor human rights practices in Nigeria: the
 Council of Human Rights, an independent organization founded
 in late 1985; Citizens for Human Rights; and the Civil
 Liberties Organization, which was founded in 1987, discovered
 Ita-Oko prison and published what it considered human rights
 violations in 1988. The former Bar Association president and
 chairman of its human rights committee continues to hold the
 post of Attorney General and Minister of Justice. AI
 maintains an office in Ibadan and has active chapters
 throughout the country, both on university campuses and among
 civil servants. Its annual human rights report is publicized
 in the Nigerian Press.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of discrimination among Nigeria's
 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not specifically favor one
 group over another. The Government generally makes a
 conscious effort to strike a balance among different groups in
 its decisionmaking and in appointment to key governmental
 positions. However, Nigeria has a long history of tension
 among the diverse ethnic groups, and tradition continues to
 impose considerable pressure on individual government
 officials to favor their own ethnic or religious group.
 Allegations of religious and ethnic favoritism or harassment
 persist. Ethnic and regional hiring quotas based on
 considerations of federal character are observed in most
 public sector employment. Persons whose family is not
 indigenous to their state of residende frequently experience
 difficulty in jobseeking, school enrollment, and other areas.
 Women have always had economic power and exerted influence in
 Nigerian society through women's councils or family
 connections. As primary school enrollment increases, women
 are gaining greater access to education. There has been a
 dramatic increase in the number of women who have university
 degrees and who have become professionals, including teachers,
 lawyers, doctors, judges, senior government officials, media
 figures, and business executives. Despite a degree of
 economic independence, women suffer discrimination in
 employment and other areas, experience social prejudice, and
 have only a few representatives in the political arena.
 The pattern of discrimination against women varies according
 to the ethnic and religious diversity of Nigeria's vast
 population. In some states, husbands can prevent their wives
 from obtaining employment or passports. In many states, a
 widow cannot inherit her husband's property, which in the
 
 
 268
 NIGERIA
 absence of children usually reverts to the husband's family.
 Women do not receive equal pay for equal work, and male
 professionals receive fringe benefits not extended to their
 female counterparts. Female circumcision is still practiced
 in some areas, as is the selling of young girls for marriage
 by poor rural families.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In 1981 organized labor claimed 3 million members out of a
 total work force of 30 million. All Nigerian workers 16 years
 or older may join trade unions, with the exception of members
 of the armed forces and designated employees of essential
 government services as defined by the Federal Military
 Government, which it may vary by decree. Employers are
 obliged to recognize trade unions and must pay a dues checkoff
 for employees who are members of a registered trade union.
 Nigeria has an active trade union movement, and one which has
 been, within limits, relatively free. However, this movement
 has been subject to government oversight which reached
 extraordinary proportions during 1988.
 Despite provisions in the 1979 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 28 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees and policy continue to
 restrict labor freedoms. A 1978 decree created a single
 central labor body, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),
 forcibly merged a number of unions into 42 industrial unions,
 and deregistered all other unions. The Government has not
 acted upon the ILO Committee of Experts' finding, first
 enunciated in 1979 and subsequently repeated, that this decree
 violates ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association and
 protection of the right to organize, to which Nigeria is a
 party. Nor has the Government accepted the Committee of
 Experts' recommendation that the decree be amended.
 Since 1978 the NLC has been subject to close government
 oversight. In February 1988, the Government dissolved the
 national and state executive councils of the NLC, appointed a
 temporary administrator, and in September announced that it
 would merge the present 42 unions into 19 prior to holding new
 NLC elections in December; the plan was abandoned prior to the
 elections.
 The 1978 decree also created senior staff associations for
 white collar workers, which a 1986 decree explicitly excluded
 from NLC membership, forcing two such associations to withdraw.
 Since 1975 government policy has permitted international labor
 affiliation only with the ILO and the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and associated pan-African labor
 federations. Government policy does permit, however, informal
 "fraternal relations" with foreign unions and international
 trade secretariats as long as there is no formal affiliation.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, again except in the
 case of essential services. The definition of essential
 services varies; in 1988 nurses struck and were allowed to
 negotiate their grievances. On the other hand, during the
 April-May labor unrest, the Federal Military Government made
 it clear that strikes by utility workers would not be
 tolerated.

 Work stoppages, strikes, and protests during 1988 focused
 primarily upon worker and trade union opposition to the
 Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) and pay issues. The NLC
 organized a campaign in November 1987 to protest against the
 Government's announced intent to remove or reduce oil
 subsidies as d part of the SAP. A series of nationwide
 strikes, focused in the north, took place in April when the
 Government raised petroleum product prices by amounts varying
 from 6 percent to 300 percent. The Government detained an
 estimated 140 workers and trade union leaders in the wake of
 these strikes. They were eventually released as part of an
 agreement between the unions and the Government to end the
 strikes and to undertake extended discussion between
 government and labor representatives over the issues
 involved. Those discussions continued at year's end.
 University lecturers went on strike in June to demand payment
 of salary increases promised them since January, and bank
 workers were also on strike in July demanding payment of new
 salary increases. In October some senior employees of the
 National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) disrupted power in
 the north and elsewhere, demanding NEPA's commercialization,
 removal of employees from the civil service structure, and
 increased salaries. In November railway workers struck for 1
 day to press their demand for 3-months' back salaries.
 Dockworkers went on strike in December, protesting the delayed
 payment of salary step increases to which they were entitled.
 In response to the June strike by professors and staff, the
 Government proscribed the Academic Staff Union of Universities
 (ASUU), which has not been replaced by another organization.
 Government officials claimed the strike continued illegally
 after the dispute had been referred to the industrial
 arbitration panel. The 1978 Trade Disputes Decree forbids
 strikes and lockouts while disputes are under mediation by
 this body. In December, 11 senior NEPA employees were
 sentenced to life imprisonment, subject to confirmation by the
 AFRC, for conspiracy and inducing certain employees to disrupt
 electrical power service. Also in December, the Government
 released three bank union officials, who had been detained
 since July. The release of the bank officials was believed to
 be a good will gesture toward the'newly elected President of
 the NLC, Paschal Bafyau.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 the labor laws of Nigeria permit collective bargaining between
 management and trade unions. However, a series of restrictive
 measures imposed by the Government during the last 2 years
 significantly reduced the range of issues left for
 bargaining. In February 1987, the National Economic Emergency
 Decree of 1985, which granted the Federal Military Government
 broad authority over labor matters, was extended for 2 more
 years. The Federal Military Government transferred to state
 governments the power involuntarily to deduct special levies
 from the salaries of workers for financing state development
 projects. A national wage freeze, imposed in 1984, was lifted
 in January, allowing a return to collective bargaining on
 basic salary levels. Collective bargaining is common in the
 industrial sector of the economy which, however, is relatively
 small. Nigerian law protects workers against retaliation by
 employers for labor activity. Labor legislation is applied
 uniformly throughout Nigeria.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution provides that "no person shall be
 required to perform forced or compulsory labor." while this
 provision is generally observed, two exceptions have been
 made. The first is the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC)
 begun under the Gowon regime (1966-1975). All Nigerian youths
 or young adults who have completed college or university
 training and are under the age of 30 must complete 1 year of
 work in the NYSC. Jobs range from agriculture to office work
 and teaching, and some effort is made to match jobs with
 previous training or post-NYSC occupational goals. The
 Government also attempts to use the NYSC to build "federal
 character" by sending individuals to work in parts of the
 country away from their area of upbringing or ethnic
 affiliation. The other exception is the environmental
 clean-up campaign, begun under the Shagari regime and
 continued by the present Government. All citizens are
 required to spend the morning of the final Saturday of each
 month tidying their house, yard, and neighborhood. All
 movement during this period is suspended, and persons may be
 arrested for violating this rule. This does not include
 emergencies or official travel. At the end of the morning,
 full freedom of movement is restored.
 The ILO Committee of Experts has noted that various provisions
 of the Labor Decree of 1974, the Merchant Shipping Act, and
 the Trade Disputes Decree of 1976 impose sanctions that
 obligate work for breaches of labor discipline or for taking
 part in a strike. The Committee has urged the Government to
 adopt the necessary measures to bring these laws into
 compliance with ILO Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children
 under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and restricts
 other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic
 work. The Labor Decree does allow the apprenticeship of
 youths aged 13 to 15, but only under specific conditions.
 Apprenticeship exists in a wide range of crafts, trades and
 state enterprises; with respect to apprentices over the age of
 15, their activity is not specifically regulated by the
 Government. As most of Nigeria's large population lives in
 rural areas, the Government's ability to enforce these laws is
 limited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree also established a 40-hour
 workweek, prescribes 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and sets a
 minimum hourly wage for commerce and industry which amounts to
 about $25 a month. This wage is sufficient only for the most
 minimal standard of living in the cities. The 1974 Decree
 contains general health and safety provisions, some aimed
 specifically at young and female workers, enforceable by the
 Ministry of Employment, Labour, and Productivity. Employers
 must compensate injured workers and dependent survivors of
 those killed in industrial accidents. The ineffectiveness of
 the Ministry in enforcing these laws in the workplace is
 regularly criticized by labor unions.
