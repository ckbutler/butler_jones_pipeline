 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are guaranteed by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court interpretations.
 Successive Irish Governments have had to deal with the
 spillover into the Republic of recurring outbreaks of violence
 in Northern Ireland. In recent years, this has resulted in
 the deaths of police officers, soldiers, and civilians due to
 the actions of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)
 and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). This violence
 has led Irish Governments to adopt special legislation to deal
 with acts of terrorism. During 1986 the Government, in the
 opinion of leading rights groups in Ireland, sought to apply
 such special legislation with restraint, although some
 observers are concerned at the use of these powers in cases
 where no political connections are apparent.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance
 to the observance and maintenance of human rights both in
 theory and practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings occasionally occur in Ireland
 as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. There
 were no political slayings in the Republic in 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected in practice by the Government. From
 time to time, allegations have been made that individual
 policemen have used physical abuse during interrogations or
 have mistreated prisonors. As an adjunct to the Omnibus
 Criminal Justice Act of 1984, Parliament passed the Garda
 Siochana (complaints) Act of 1986. Not yet implemented, the
 Act provides for the investigation and adjudication of
 complaints about the conduct of members of the police. It
 establishes a Complaints Board and a Complaints Appeal Board,
 and calls for the appointment of a Board of Tribunals to
 consider breaches of discipline and related matters.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution contains provisions implementing its
 guarantee that "no citizen shall be deprived of his personal
 liberty save in accordance with law." The same section of the
 Constitution provides for a judicial determination of the
 legality of a person's detention and requires that the
 arresting authorities make written explanation to the court
 about the person concerned. Neither in law nor in practice is
 
 
 954
 IRELAND
 anyone subject to arrest for the expression of political or
 religious views. Arrest is carried out openly and the right
 to a fair and speedy trial with full right of legal counsel
 exists in law and practice. Detention without charge is
 restricted. It is permitted for a maximum of 48 hours,
 however, in cases covered by the Offenses Against the State
 Act of 1939, legislation designed to "prevent actions and
 conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority
 of the State." This legislation was reactivated in 1972 and
 broadened to include other "scheduled offenses" against peace
 and order. The police can now arrest and detain for
 questioning anyone suspected of any offense involving damage
 to property. After the 48-hour period, the individual must be
 brought before a magistrate, presented with written charges,
 and be given legal representation.
 The Omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives somewhat
 increased powers to the police in the area of detention for
 interrogation. By the terms of the Act, however, these
 provisions cannot be invoked until a police complaints
 mechanism is-established.
 Critics of the Omnibus Criminal Justice Act argue that the
 increased powers it will give to the police, in particular,
 detention without charge and the curtailment of the right to
 silence, are out of proportion to the threat addressed and are
 unhealthy for democracy. Defenders of this legislation point
 out that two issues of human rights are at stake: the right of
 citizens to be protected against crime and the safeguarding of
 individual rights from abuse by police.
 There is no forced labor in Ireland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The courts are independent, and jury
 trial is the norm. The Constitution provides, however, for
 the crEation of "special courts" to deal with cases where the
 "ordinary courts are inadequate ti secure the effective
 administration of justice, and the preservation of public
 peace and order." The Offenses against the State Act of 1939
 formally set up such courts and provides that they may try
 persons for offenses against national security, especially
 cases of political violence. Rather than having juries, these
 courts have panels of judges, each consisting of an uneven
 number of judges, but in any event not less than three. Their
 verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally
 are similar to those of regular courts, except that the sworn
 statement of a police Chief Superintendent that the accused is
 a member of an illegal organization is considered prima facie
 evidence of such membership. Court sessions are usually
 public but may exclude certain persons, other than genuine
 press representatives. There is provision for free legal aid
 and appeal against conviction or sentence.
 There is no provision under Irish law for use of political
 offense arguments to evade prosecution or otherwise receive
 special consideration in law enforcement and judicial
 processes, except in extradition, and even there, the Supreme
 Court in recent years has severely circumscribed use of that
 argument. Such arguments are often made by members of the
 PIRA and other illegal organizations convicted of terrorist
 offenses.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 basic human right of noninterference with personal privacy,
 family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and
 generally observed. The Constitution, however, provides that
 the State shall enact no law "providing for the grant of the
 dissolution of marriage." In a national referendum in June on
 amending the Constitution to permit divorce in limited
 circumstances, the amendment was overwhelmingly defeated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally respected in practice. The State endeavors to
 insure that organs of public opinion, while preserving liberty
 of expression (including criticism. of government policy), are
 not used to undermine public order, morality, or the authority
 of the State. Furthermore, "publication or utterance of
 blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, such censorship as exists in Ireland is directed
 largely toward materials considered pornographic in nature.
 Nonetheless, the state-owned radio and television network, on
 the basis of the constitutional provisions dealing with public
 order and the authority of the State, denies air time to
 members of a list of organizations including Sinn Fein, the
 outlawed PIRA's legal political wing. In late 1982, this
 prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme Court and
 upheld on constitutional grounds. All political parties not
 on the list are given full and regular access to both
 public-owned radio and television facilities and major
 independent daily newspapers. Criticism of the Government in
 such media is not only allowed but flourishes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such
 as the PIRA, however, are illegal, and membership in them is
 an offense against national security. The INLA was added to
 this list in early 1983. Political parties or groups
 associated with such organizations, such as Provisional Sinn
 Fein, are not proscribed.
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage in
 free collective bargaining. The Irish Congress of Trade
 Unions, which represents unions in both the Republic and
 Northern Ireland, has 89 member unions with over 650,000
 members. The Irish Labor Party severed its formal
 relationship with the trade union movement in the 1930's,
 although some unions, including several of the largest, pay
 subscriptions to-the Labor Party and assist candidates. Union
 officials and members play an active role in politics through
 the parties of their choice. Labor unions are permitted to
 conduct protests, including secondary and wildcat strikes.
 There are no compulsory settlement procedures.
 Although there is no basic law governing trade union
 activities, most terms and conditions of employment are
 
 
 956
 IRELAND
 determined through collective bargaining. The right to join a
 union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to refrain from
 joining. Most businesses (covering over 56 percent of the
 labor force) are unionized.
 c. Freedom c! Religion
 Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom to all religious groups. There are no
 Lestrictions upon freedom of worship or association.
 Discrimination in employment, education, and other fields
 based on religious grounds has not been alleged. Some Irish
 laws, such as the prohibition against divorce, reflect the
 point of view of the majority community. The area of family
 law is the subject of much current debate in which minority
 religious communities have felt fully at liberty to take a
 vocal and active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, and
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary
 repatriation. Ireland has accepted displaced persons on a
 limited basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ireland. has had a consistent history of orderly transfer of
 power by elections since the end of the Irish Civil War in
 1923. The country has two major parties, three smaller
 parties, and provision for independents to stand for election
 to either house of Parliament. The constitutional requirement
 that elections be held at least every 5 years has always been
 met. Ireland uses a proportional voting system, and the
 secrecy of the ballot is fully safeguarded. The Government
 elected in November 1982 is a two-party coalition in which the
 party leader of the larger party serves as Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government generally cooperates with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although it has
 not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 Amnesty International is active, as is the Irish Council for
 Civil Liberties. Both operate freely and without hindrance in
 Ireland as the principal independent organizations interested
 in domestic human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide adequate shelter,
 nutrition, health care, and education without regard to race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 People whose means are inadequate and who are not entitled to
 other benefits may receive pensions or other payments from
 public funds.
 In recent years women have been playing a more significant
 role in the Irish work force. Although the Constitution
 
 
 957
 IRELAND
 recognizes the woman's role in terms of "her life within the
 home," women have been entering the office and marketplace
 relatively smoothly but slowly. Studies have highlighted the
 difference in pay scales between men and women and the fact
 that in recent pay increases female workers have lagged
 considerably behind the male sector, thus further widening the
 gap. Equal pay for equal work, the elimination from the
 social welfare system of discrimination against women, and
 reform of the law on rape are priorities on the growing agenda
 of Ireland's small but increasingly active women's movement.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for employment is 15 years. Irish laws limit
 the hours of employment for 15-year-olds to 8 hours per day
 and 40 hours per week. Those 16 and 17 years of age may work
 up to 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. Those 18 years
 and older are, in the case of shop employees and industrial
 workers, limited to 48 hours per week plus 12 hours overtime.
 There is no general minimum wage legislation in Ireland.
 However, some 56,000 workers are covered by minimum wage laws
 applicable to specific industrial sectors, mainly those which
 tend to pay lower than average wages. Four basic laws dealing
 with occupational safety provide adequate coverage. An
 extensive system of public health insurance offers health
 protection.
