 KUWAIT
 The August 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq marks a dividing line
 in this year's report on human rights practices in Kuwait. In
 preinvasion Kuwait, while there were significant restrictions
 on political rights, there was substantial government respect
 for the integrity of the person. Iraqi atrocities under the
 occupation were egregious and massive, as described
 extensively in this report.
 Prior to the invasion, Kuwait's amirs, drawn from the al-Sabah
 family, governed the country, in consultation with prominent
 commercial families and other community leaders, for over 200
 years. The 1962 Constitution provides for an elected National
 Assembly and details the powers and relationships of the
 branches of the government and the rights of the citizens.
 However, the Amir can suspend any or all provisions of the
 Constitution by decree. The National Assembly was dissolved
 from 1976 to 1981 and again in 1986; since then, the Amir had
 ruled by decree. In addition to suspending the National
 Assembly, the 1986 decrees imposed prior censorship on the
 press and added to existing restrictions on the political and
 civil rights of all Kuwaiti residents.
 In April the Amir, responding to popular pressures to restore
 Parliament, called for the creation of an interim body, a
 National Council, to advise the Government on the question of
 restoring a parliamentary system. The Amir appointed one
 quarter of the Council's members, and elections were held in
 June for the remaining seats. The Council was termed advisory
 in nature and given a 4-year mandate.
 Kuwait's Ministry of Interior supervised the country's
 security apparatus, including the Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), which was responsible for ordinary criminal
 cases, and the Kuwait State Security (KSS), which investigated
 internal security-related offenses. Both were active in
 investigations of terrorism and both worked in collaboration
 with .the uniformed police.
 Prior to the invasion, which has wreaked econom-c- havoc'on- the
 country, the people of Kuwait enjoyed a high standard of
 living, with an estimated per capita gross income of $10,17a
 in 1989. Most of the country's preinvasion income derived
 from oil production and commercial investment.- Despite the
 emphasis the Kuwaiti Government placed on an open market
 economy, expatriates were not allowec to own property or
 majority- shares in significant local businesses and were
 subject to restrictive labor laws, whi-h were further
 tightened in 19a9. The Kuwaiti government in exile retains
 full control over its sizable overseas investment portfolio
 and has drawn bn it to support Kuwaiti refugees abroad.
 Kuwait's human rights situation in 1990 was dominated by two
 events: the proparliament movement which began at the end'of
 1989 and led to the creation. of the advisory National Council,
 and Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. In 1990 the
 principal human rights concerns about the Government of Kuwait
 included restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech, the
 right of citizens to change their government, women's and
 worker rights, and instances of arbitrary arrest, mistreatment
 of prisoners, and lack of due process in trials of security
 cases.

 KUWAIT
 Following the Iraqi invasion, international human rights
 organizations and exiting refugees reported that Iraqi
 occupation authorities violated Kuwaiti human rights massively
 and systematically, including but not limited to engaging in
 oxtrajudicial killings, torture and other cruel and inhuman
 treatment, kidnaping, arbitrary arrest and detention, denial
 of trial, arbitrary interference with privacy and family, and
 denial of freedom of speech, press, assembly, movement, and
 worker rights. The United Nations Security Council, in a
 series of binding resolutions, condemned Iraq for many of
 these practices and demanded that it fulfill its international
 legal responsibilities. There is no evidence that Iraqi
 occupation authorities have established a legal framework such
 as existed in preinvasion Kuwait for the protection of basic
 civil liberties and advancement of social welfare.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There-were no reports of killings instigated or condoned by
 the Government of Kuwait.
 There were reports from a wide range of credible sources of
 mass extrajudicial killings and summary executions of Kuwaiti
 citizens by Iraqi military authorities, often carried out so
 as to maximize-psychological terror. For example, these
 killings were not limited to suspected members of the Kuwaiti
 resistance, but included their families, other civilians, and
 children as young as 12 years of age. Iraqi forces reportedly
 engaged in reprisal killings for attacks on their soldiers,
 going into neighborhoods where attacks had taken place and
 summarily and randomly executing innocent civilians. Kuwaiti
 refugees reported seeing executions of teenage boys accused of
 resistance activities, whose families were forced by Iraqi
 troops to witness the executions. Additionally, the
 possession of opposition literature, the Kuwaiti flag, or
 photographs of the Amir were said to have been treated
 effectively as capital offenses. Offering refuge to
 foreigners was designated in an official Iraqi decree an act
 of treason punishable by hanging.
 Kuwaiti medical personnel reported that scores of bodies of
 young men, shot at close range, were brought by Iraqi forces
 to hospitals, and doctors were forced to certifythat their
 deaths were from natural causes. Large-scale executions by
 hanging were reported to have been carried out by the Iraqis
 on the grounds of Kuwait University.
 Scores of handicapped and infirm people, including infants,
 died as a direct result of the systematic looting of Kuwaiti
 medical facilities. Eyewitnesses reported that Iraqi forces
 disconnected patients from life-support systems, turned
 patients out of their beds, expelled mentally ill persons from
 institutions, abandoned handicapped persons by the roadside,
 denied medical care or access to hospitals to all but Iraqi
 forces, and took premature infants out of their incubators.
 In one particularly harrowing incident in late September, a
 Kuwaiti physician responded to a distress call from the
 nursing staff of the Kuwait Maternity Hospital and found upon
 his arrival at the hospital the bodies of 72 premature babies
 dumped onto the ground from their incubators by Iraqi troops,
 
 
 1509
 
 KUWAIT
 who had then carted off the incubators. The Iraqi forces
 stripped Kuwait's medical centers of all supplies and
 machinery and transported it to Iraq, leaving the civilian
 population of Kuwait with only those private stores of basic
 medications that they had been able to keep hidden from the
 Iraqi army.
 In October the severely injured son of a British national,
 brought to a hospital in Kuwait City, was turned away because
 the staff had no medicines, equipment, anesthesia, or even a
 stretcher to offer the dying youth. Transported on a board to
 an Iraqi military base for a flight to Baghdad, he was bumped
 from the flight by Iraqi military officers, who took his seat
 and his father's, over the father's desperate protestations.
 The young man subsequently died, after lying at the airfield
 without medical care for 6 hours, Iraqi authorities in
 Baghdad initially refused permission for the father, who had
 been in hiding in Kuwait, to leave Iraq with his son's body,
 and only relented when the case threatened to become public.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances until the invasion.
 There were credible reports from many sources of
 disappearances of Kuwaiti citizens at the hands of Iraqi
 occupation forces. It has not been possible to determine the
 number involved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although it is specifically prohibited by the Kuwaiti
 Constitution, there were plausible reports of torture.
 Amnesty International (AI) stated in a February alert that it
 had reports that 4 Shi'ites detained on security grounds were
 tortured during interrogation.
 Kuwaiti police and security officials occasionaly- used
 physical violence in apprehending and interrogating persons
 suspected of committing criminal acts. Evidence of
 mistreatment during interrogation is a defense in Kuwaiti
 courts, and confessions or other evidence obtained through
 torture are not admissible.
 There were many credible reports of the use of torture-by
 Iraqi occupation authorities. Among the techniques attributed
 to the Iraqi forces were electrical shocks, prolonged
 beatings, breaking of limbs, plucking out of hair and nails,
 rape-, prolonged hanging by the limbs and exposure to cold,,and
 detention in isolation. Psychological torture methods
 employed included forcing relatives and friends to witness
 killings and~torture, threats of sexual assault or execution,
 mock executions, and general humiliation and insults.
 The Bibi Saleh Center in downtown Kuwait City was reportedly
 converted by the Iraqi secret police, the Mukhabarat, into an
 interrogation and torture center. Witnesses at the Amiri
 Hospital testified in early October that their facility alone
 had received approximately 230 mutilated bodies from the Bibi
 center. These bodies were said to have borne signs of
 torture, such as missing fingers-and toes, lacerated ears, and
 scorched eyeballs.

 KUWAIT
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and-imprisonment are formally prohibited by
 the Kuwaiti Constitution. A number of prominent Kuwaiti
 opposition figures were arrested for political reasons in 1990
 during the proparliament ferment. On several occasions in
 December and January and again in April and May, police
 forcibly broke up diwaniyas (traditional Kuwaiti evening
 social gatherings for men) called-by ex-parliamentarians to.
 discuss the return of Parliament and other issues of political
 reform. The arrested were charged with participating in
 unlicensed gatherings. In mid-July, an opposition spokesman
 was arrested on the charge of having "harmed the image of
 Kuwait abroad" for his contacts with a foreign news
 organization.
 The Kuwaiti penal code affirms a person's right to-due process
 and stipulates that a detainee may not be held for more than
 4 days without charge. A prosecutor's approval is required
 for detention periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter, the
 suspect must either be released or charged by a prosecutor,
 who may authorize detention for up to an additional 21 days.
 Further detention pending trial may be
 authorized by a judge. Warrants are required unless a person
 is apprehended in the act of committing-an offense. These
 legal safeguards were generally observed prior to the ,
 invasion. Bail is commonly set in all cases, with the amount
 depending on the nature of the crime. Arrests were generally
 made openly and for specific violations of the law. Reports
 of incommunicado detention were rare. Persons without proper
 identification may be detained by police.
 Under Kuwaiti law, no Kuwaiti may be exiled or denied return
 to Kuwait. A noncitizen, however, even if a long-term
 resident, may be summarily expelled without charge or judicial
 recourse if the authorities deem him a "troublemaker" or
 "security risk." Expatriates were also subject to deportation
 for attempting to change employers before the end of their
 3-year period of work for their initial sponsor. Expatriates
 were obliged to leave the country if they were unable to find
 work after being released from their initial employment. Some
 expatriates had been held in deportation centers for extended
 periods of time, reportedly up to as-long as 5 years, if they
 were unable to provide for their bwn transportation out of the
 country.
 There are no figures available on the number of deportations
 in 1990 prior to the invasion. The majority of routine
 deportations involved immigration and residency violations.
 Official figures in 1989 showed a continued decline in the
 number of expatriates employed in the public sector, tighter
 restrictions-on expatriates employed in the private sector,
 and a concerted effort to regularize the residency status of
 those whose claims to residency as "stateless" persons were,
 in the Government's view, unsubstantiated.
 International human rights organizations such as AI and Middle
 East Watch reported that hundreds of Kuwaiti nationals were
 arrested by Iraqi forces for their suspected opposition to
 Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. There were reports that,
 including Western nationals held hostage, up to 3,O0O
 detainees were held in Kuwait or were transferred to detention
 centers in Iraq.
 
 
 1511
 KUWAIT
 Many foreign nationals, in particular Westerners, were rounded
 up and transported against their will to Iraqi military and
 industrial -sites to serve as "human shields" against a
 military strike by allied-forces in the area of the Persian
 Gulf. Kuwait'res~dents were'arrested for-giving refuge to
 these forei4ners.,-.Harboring a foreign nafional, especially a
 Westerner, was, made a ,capital .offense.

 e. .Deniar-of Fair Public'Tr.al .
 Kuwait's preinvasl6i  judicial. system was independent and,
 except for the'State Security'Court, provided for fair public
 trials aid the-right df -appeal. Judges'were appointed by the
 Amir on the recommendation of the Justice.Ministry. Kuwaiti
 nationals who serve' as judges usually received lifetime
 appointments, while the many non-Kuwaiti judges served under
 I- to 3-year contracts, which were renewable. The Justice
 Ministry may remove judges, but such removal was rare.
 By law, all defendants in felony cases have to be represented
 by attorneys, court-appointed if necessary. In misdemeanor
 cases, which include crimes' punishable by less than 3 years'
 imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, and the- court is not
 required to appoint a defense attorney. The courts gave
 consideration to defendants' allegations of police -
 mistreatment in reaching verdicts and sentencing. Defendants
 tried in absentia have the right to an additional appeal.
 Legal representation was of adequate quality, including in
 cases ift which the defendant was assigned counsel. There were
 no reports of government interference in the issuance of
 verdicts or of discrimination against defense7 counsel.
 However, translation of court proceedings-, to ensure that they
 were understood by non-Arabic-speaking defendants', was
 sometimes inadequate.
 Trials before the State Security Court, which convened on an
 ad hoc basis to handle cases deemed of an internal security
 nature, did not meet international standards for fair -trial.
 Composed of judges normally serving in other courts, this
 tribunal, with few exceptions, conducted its proceedings in
 closed sessions. In an action unprecedented in Kuwait, the
 Kuwaiti Government allowed Al representatives to attend the
 first two sessions of the trial in May  of four Shi'a suspects
 charged with attempting to overthrow the Government. The Ar
 representatives were also able to meet with Ministry of
 Justice officials to inquire about the case and treatment of
 the defendants. Al raised concerns regarding the defendants'
 pretrial treatment because their arrest did not conform to
 Kuwaiti Criminal Code procedures and they were reportedly
 mistreated. All four of the Shi'a were eventually acquitted
 in June. As of August 2, only the group's leader was still in
 prison awaiting trial on two minor charges.
 State Security Court decisions may not be appealed.
 Defendants are permitted to have an attorney, who is allowed
 to conduct an active defense on behalf of the accused. No
 death penalties were handed down between January and July
 1990. As of the time of the invasion, the Amir had not acted
 
 
 1512
 
 KUWAIT
 upon previous death sentences mandated by the court for
 terrorist attacks, including sentences for an attack on the
 U.S. Embassy in 1983 and on the Amir himself in 1985.
 According to the Constitution, military courts have
 jurisdiction'only over offenses committed by members of the
 armed or security forces, except during periods of martial
 law, which the Kuwaiti Government has never declared. The
 Amir has the power to pardon or commute sentences passed by
 either-civilian or military courts and did so through the
 publication of an annual list of commutations following
 Kuwait's independence day, February 25. In 1990 the Amir's
 commutations covered the release of 292 prisoners held for
 common crimes and reduced sentences for 519 others. The
 commutations have not applied to terrorists or others
 convicted by the State Security Court.
 There has been no evidence that Iraqi occupation authorities
 have conducted trials or other legal proceedings in the case
 of detainees, but there is much evidence of summary
 punishment, including executions. Despite Iraqi claims to
 govern Kuwait as part of Iraq, authorities there have not
 extended-to detainees even the slight protection afforded by
 the 'raqi'juditial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and was generally respected
 by the Government of Kuwait in practice. Search warrants are
 required, unless the police are in hot pursuit of a suspect
 fleeing the scene of a crime, or there is an indication of the
 presence of alcohol or narcotics. Search warrants to enter
 premises are issuedby a public prosecutor. Expatriates, and
 particularly laborers and servants who lived in accomodations
 provided by their employers, may have their premises searched
 by the police only with the authorization of their employer.
 Items arriving by mail for personal or institutional use were
 not usually opened before delivery unless the contents were
 suspected of being pornographic.
 In 1986 the Government restricted the right of Kuwaiti males
 to marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval in
 advance would henceforth be required. Government officials
 indicated the action was motivated by concern over how to meet
 the State's responsibilities toward the children of
 non-Kuwaiti spouses residing outside the country. The
 Government, and the public at large, were also concerned about
 the growing number of Kuwaiti males marrying foreigners rather
 than Kuwaiti women.
 There were numerous credible reports that Iraqi military
 personnel engaged in forced entry into private and diplomatic
 residences, seized private possessions and personal documents,
 looted commercial and public establishments, and harassed
 Kuwaiti residents at military checkpoints.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions respecting these freedoms are
 subject to such conditional phrases as "ii accordance with
 conditions and manner specified by law." Before the invasion,
 
 
 1513
 KUWAIT
 the Kuwaiti or foreign resident felt free to offer his opinion
 in private without fear of official retaliation, but no one
 could publicly criticize the Amir and the ruling family,
 Islam, or attack leaders of other Arab states. Kuwait had an
 active censorship department, which reviewed all books, films,
 videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering Kuwait in
 bulk or for commercial purposes. Radio and television are
 government owned and controlled.
 The Amir's July 1986 decrees that amended the press law to
 impose prior censorship on the Kuwaiti press and otherwise
 tighten press curbs remained in effect at the time of the
 invasion. These decrees also authorize the Government to
 suspend for up to 2 years any publication found to be serving
 foreign states or organizations, receiving assistance from
 foreign sources without the approval of the Information
 Ministry, or publishing material conflicting with Kuwait's
 national interests. The revised censorship regulations also
 toughened existing penalties for violators, prescribing prison
 sentences of up to 3 years and fines up to $17,000 for
 offenses by publishers, editors, and journalists.
 The press was forbidden to publish material that contained
 direct criticism of the Amir and the ruling family, involved
 official confidential communications or treaties and
 agreements with other states, might disturb relations with
 Arab and friendly states, or "might incite people to commit
 crimes, create hatred, or spread dissension among the
 people." Prior to the Amir's decrees, there was selective
 enforcement of the list of proscribed topics; violators were
 usually only issued warnings. After July 1986, however,
 government censors reviewed press items before their
 publication and ensured compliance by excising offending
 material or having it rewritten. On those political topics
 not proscribed and on a wide range of social and economic
 issues, the press was free to engage in vigorous debate.
 Since the July 1986 decrees, senior government officials held
 periodic meetings with Kuwait's chief editors, at which: the
 editors were warned to avoid sensationalism and .publishing-
 items which might be offensive or harmful to state security.
 By law, publishers lose their license, issued by the
 Information Ministry, if their publications do not appear for-
 6 months.
 Academic freedom was subject to the same general restraints
 that applied to the press.
 Iraqi occupation authorities did not recognize the right of
 free speech; their troops used the most brutal measures to
 quell any criticism of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, including
 summarily executing Kuwaitis for mere possession of
 photographs of the Amir or literature supporting the Kuwaiti
 Government. Iraq denied access to Kuwait to foreign
 journalists and announced that any persons entering without
 official permission would be considered spies. As the Iraqi
 Government had executed a British journalist for a similar
 alleged violation in Iraq in the spring of 1990, this policy
 effectively guaranteed that there would be no uncensored
 reporting from Kuwait.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembiy and Association
 Political parties were banned in preinvasion Kuwait.
 Political activity found its outlet in informal, family-based
 
 
 1514
 
 KUWAIT
 social gatherings known as "diwaniyas." The Constitution
 affirms the right to private assembly, public meetings,
 processions, and gatherings which are peaceful and not
 contrary to public morals. However, any group of more than
 five-people desiring to meet for public discussion, or to meet
 privately but issue a statement, must receive prior permission
 from the Ministry of Interior. The authorities could prevent
 such an assembly merely by ignoring the request.
 As the proparliament movement gathered momentum in early 1990
 and the number and size of diwaniyas swelled, the Government
 sent in police to break them up and arrest vocal opposition
 members, regarding such gatherings as public, unlicensed
 meetings and therefore illegal. The gatherings came to
 include large segments of the-Shi'a and Sunni merchant
 classes, Islamic fundamentalists, intellectuals, and
 ex-deputies, and demonstrated.broad support for return to
 parliamentary government. (See also Section 3.)
 Professional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies
 were permitted to establish international contacts without
 government interference. University student groups were
 active and relatively free to express their views on
 international politics as long as there was no open discussion
 of domestic politics.
 Iraqi occupation forces recognized no right of free assembly
 in Kuwait and did not distinguish between dizssent and
 resistance; activities in support of the latter were grounds
 for summary execution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Kuwaiti Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute" but must not "conflict with public policy or
 morals." Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) is, according to the Constitution, "a main
 source of legislation." The ruling family and most of the
 prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims. There were no
 restraints on worship by Shi'a Muslims, who constitute about
 30 percent of Kuwait's population. Kuwait had a tiny Arab
 Christian minority; there were a number of expatriate
 Christian congregations and churches. Expatriate
 practitioners of Eastern religions (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and
 Buddhists) not recognized by Islam were not allowed to
 establish places of worship but could worship privately in
 their homes. Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims was
 prohibited.
 There have been no specific reports of efforts by Iraqi
 occupation forces to suppress religious practice.
 d. -Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally were free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. Those serving in the
 military have to receive permission from the Defense Ministy
 before traveling abroad. Although there were no different
 legal standards regarding the internal or foreign travel or
 emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands could
 prevent their wives and minor children from leaving.the
 country.
 
 
 1515
 
 KUWAIT
 Representatives of societies, associations, and trade unions
 wishing to travel to and participate in international meetings
 must receive prior permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto," the
 Government's policy of revoking the citizenship of some
 Kuwaitis was in contradiction to this rule. In some cases,
 such action was based on the voluntary acquisition by the
 individual of foreign citizenship.. An anomalous situation
 developed, however, in the case of so-called stateless persons
 who resided in Kuwait and who claimed not to have any other
 nationality but who were unable to document their claim to
 Kuwaiti citizenship. In 1989 the Government promulgated a
 series of measures which, inter alia, dropped stateless
 persons from the census rolls and stripped them of civil
 identification cards entitling the bearer to a variety of
 social serviues.
 By the time of the Iraqi invasion, the Government's actions
 reportedly had cut the stateless population by half from an
 estimated 270,000. Faced with denial of civil identification
 cards, some of the stateless exited Kuwait and reentered as
 expatriates after obtaining other nationality documentation,
 while others left the country permanently. Those who could
 neither claim other citizenship nor produce documentation of
 Kuwaiti citizenship were left in limbo, without the legal
 right to work, attend school, and obtain official documents,
 or the practical ability to travel in and out of Kuwait. As-
 of the time of the invasion, the Government had not indicated
 any plans for a general amnesty to resolve their status.
 Iraqi troops have flagrantly violated the fundamental right of
 freedom of movement following the invasion. Many Kuwaitis
 were prevented from leaving Kuwait, and hundreds of foreign
 residents were taken hostage by Iraqi forces. There was
 little movement within the country as Kuwaitis feared
 harassment or arrest by Iraqi troops and foreigners faced
 detentio. Iraqi authorities opened the Kuwait-Saudi border
 periodically to allow one-way exit for som Kuwaitis. Males
 over the age of 16 were detained at the border and prevented
 from leaving. The United Nations Security Council condemned
 actions such as these, including efforts by Iraqi forces to
 destroy Kuwait's civil records, as an Iraqi attempt to change
 the demographic composition of the population of Kuwait.
 Those who tried to flee the country without authorization
 risked heing arrested or even attacked by Iraqi forces-. In a
 number of cases, Iraqi troops fired without warning on private
 vehicles, clearly identifiable as civilian, trying to cross
 from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia; a British citizen was killed in
 one such incident in. August.
 In violation of the norms of diplomatic conduct, Iraq imposed
 the same strictures on freedom of movement by diplomatic
 personnel in Kuwait   The Government of Iraq imposed an August
 24 deadline for foreign missions in Kuwait to close down and
 relocate to Baghdad. Diplomatic personnel, including U.S.,
 who attempted to leave Kuwait on August 24 were subsequently
 prevented from departing, despite official Iraqi assurances to
 the contrary. With the release of American hostages and the
 departure of most Americans from Kuwait in December, the
 remaining members of the U.S. Embassy staff also departed.
 
 
 1516
 
 KUWAIT
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Preinvasion Kuwait had no formal' democratic institutions and
 its citizens did not have the right to change the government
 by democratic means. Under the Constitution, executive power
 is vested in the Amir and, under him, in an appointed Council
 of Ministers, which numbered 24 before the invasion, headed by
 the Crown Prince, who traditionally served also as Prime
 Minister. Following the pan-Kuwaiti conference in Jeddah, the
 Government set up a 35-member advisory consultative committee,
 chaired by the Crown Prince, which included 4 cabinet
 ministers and 30 Kuwaiti private citizens.
 At independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies elected by secret ballot, plus Cabinet
 members sitting ex officio. The electoral law provides that
 candidates for the National Assembly be self-nominated, with
 multiple candidates permitted to compete for the 50 seats. A
 "grandfather clause" effectively limits suffrage to adult
 males who resided in Kuwait before 1920, and maintained a
 residence there until 1959, and their adult male descendants.
 In 1986 the National Assembly approved an amendment to the
 1966 Nationality Law that delayed for 10 years, until 1996,
 the granting of voting rights to Kuwait's so-called second
 category citizens. The latter are certain long-term Arab and
 non-Arab residents who do not meet the "pre-1920"
 qualification. The Nationality Law was further amended in
 1987 to extend from 20 to 30 years the period that naturalized
 Kuwaitis must wait before acquiring the right to vote.
 Distinctions made on the basis of parentage, length of
 residence, and gender established a limited class of
 citizenship with the privilege to participate in the political
 system.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir
 in July 1986, was still in effect at the time of the
 invasion. The 1986 decrees also suspended various
 constitutional provisions, including Article 107, which
 specified that, within 2 months of the Assembly's dissolution,
 either special elections were to be held for a new Assembly or
 the dissolved one was to be reinstated. The Assembly had
 previously been dissolved in 1976 and reinstated in 1981. In
 the Assembly's absence, the Amir rules by decrees having the
 force of law. Far from being a rubber stamp, the Assembly
 over the years served as an important forum for the expression
 of diverse political views, some sharply at odds with those of
 the Government, and its dissolution represented a setback for
 citizens' political rights.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system, as is the tradition
 that the .Amir should govern in consultation with other
 community leaders. Traditionally, adult male Kuwaitis have
 had relatively easy access to their leaders, including the
 heads of the prominent merchant clans and the ruling family
 itself, through the system of "diwaniyas," informal
 family-based discussion groups to which anyone could come and
 freely speak his mind. Following the Assembly's dissolution
 in 1986, Cabinet Ministers instituted the practice of setting
 aside several hours a week to receive the public in their
 offices.
 
 
 1517
 
 KUWAIT
 As the proparliament movement grew in January, the Amir
 consulted with ex-parliamentarians who were involved in the
 movement and then formally designated the Crown Prince to open
 a dialog with those calling for political reform. The Crown
 Prince met with key political and social leaders for over 2
 months. In reporting his findings to the Amir, he said a
 return to a parliamentary system was a "certainty," but that a
 future assembly would need controls to avoid a third breakdown
 of legislative-executive relations and to limit the ability of
 parliamentarians to harm Kuwait's relations with neighboring
 states. The Amir then convened a National Council with a
 4-year mandate to advise the Government on the restoration of
 Parliament.
 A number of opposition leaders termed the National Council
 insufficient and organized a boycott of the June elections,
 but over 60 percent of the electorate eventually
 participated. The Council, which met in July, was given
 limited legislative powers and a mandate to appraise the
 "parliamentary experiment" and advise the Government on its
 restoration. The Council was also tasked to monitor the work
 of government departments and review public finances. It was
 authorized to comment on bills submitted by the Cabinet, as
 well as propose bills to the Council of Ministers. However,
 no law can take effect unless ratified by the Amir.
 In October the Government held a "pan-Kuwaiti conference" in
 Jeddah to which it invited over 1,000 participants, including
 all the members of the preinvasion opposition and hundreds of
 prominent citizens. The conference endorsed the notion of a
 political future-in which the National Assembly would be
 restored and political reforms, unspecified, would be
 undertaken. The Crown Prince, in his opening address to the
 conference, invoked the 1962 Constitution (which provides for
 a parliament) as the basis for postcrisis rule, and said the
 Government "would allow for more extensive political
 participation on the part of the masses."
 Iraq initially claimed that it had invaded Kuwait at the
 request of a group of Kuwaiti revolutionaries; it soon dropped
 this pretense and announced formal annexation of the country.
 Iraq respects no right of self-determination in occupied
 Kuwait. Those suspected of resistance, however passive, to
 the Iraqi regime are subject to arrest, torture', and summary
 execution. Iraqi government officials have repeatedly
 asserted their annexation of a sovereign state is
 "irreversible," without regard to the desires of the Kuwaiti
 people.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no nongovernmental human rights groups in Kuwait
 before the invasion that dealt with domestic human rights.
 The Government has an in-house council on human rights,
 composed of senior officials and workinq-level experts, but
 its effectiveness, if any, is unknown as no information about
 its activities was published.
 In the spring of 1990 the Government allowed observers of AI
 to attend the trials of suspected Shi'a terrorists and to meet
 with an official of the Ministry of Justice on overall
 treatment of the prisoners.

 Iraq has not allowed any international human rights groups or
 humanitarian agencies access to Kuwait.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kuwaiti women were allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice-. Denied the vote, women were also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in society.
 Nevertheless, there were some Kuwaiti women who were outspoken
 in their demand for a broader role in society. A Kuwaiti
 woman is permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in
 public, and has access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Women have the right to litigate against men,
 for example, in child custody cases. ILi recent years, more
 Kuwaiti women joined the work force and competed for
 government and corporate employment. Some women reached
 senior government positions, up to the level of assistant
 under secretary and director general.
 The Government publicly encouraged respectful treatment of
 women, and Article 60 of the Kuwaiti Criminal Law of 1960
 states that a person who "beats or injures, or causes bodily
 harm or exposes another person's body to disrespect" may be
 sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 2 years and subject
 to a fine.
 Violence against women was known to occur in Kuwait, but
 little is known about its extent. The Government produced no.
 official statistics on domestic abuse. There was a large
 number of expatriate South and Southeast Asian female domestic
 servants in Kuwait prior to the invasion. Although physical
 and sexual abuse of maids is punishable by law, and the press
 regularly reported some of the worst cases, mistreatment of
 female domestic servants was persistent and pervasive. There
 were a number of reports in 1990 in Kuwaiti newspapers of
 domestic abuse; in one case, a maid was beaten to death by her
 employer. In those cases that were publicized, the reports
 noted that the person committing the crime was sentenced to
 prison and fined for damages. Although domestic servants were
 able to take legal recourse against their employers if they
 chose, many cases went unreported due to fear of reprisal from
 employers.
 Before the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1986,
 Islamic groups within that body were able to secure a bar on
 the granting of citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibiton of
 alcoholic beverages, and partial classroom segregation at
 Kuwait University. The Government accommodated the National
 Assembly's demands for the application of some fundamentalist
 principles but blocked attempts to apply Islamic law across
 the board. Commercial law is based on Western practice.
 There was no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the
 administration of Kuwait's extensive welfare programs,
 although members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority were less likely
 to be appointed to sensitive government positions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to establish and join unions.
 Kuwait's labor movement had about 27,000 members, organized
 
 
 1519
 KUWAIT
 into 13 unions. All but one of the 13, that of the bank
 workers, are affiliatedwith the Kuwait Federation of Trade
 Unions (KFTUI,. Expatriate workers, who comprised about 80
 .p ercent of .tle roughly 700,000-str6ng labor force, were
 permitted to :joln unions ifter , years'.-residence but only as

 i se    Kuwui9i. law,prdvents the establishment of more .than. -
 n     ern unctionalY area.
 Thetapt majority of union membexs .were Kuwaitis. The KFTU,
 gro ping together hil'ne civil service unions and three oil
 sector unions, is a miember of the International Confederation
 of Arab.-Trade Unions as well as the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 The right to strike is recognized but is limited by Kuwait's
 labor law, which provides for compulsory negotiation followed
 by arbitration if a settlement cannot be reached between labor
 and management (See Section 6.b.Y. In 1990 oil workers went
 on strike for a brief period in June, demanding a pay raise,
 which oil officials promised to address at a later date.
 Labor/management relations were calm, in large part due to a
 generous social welfare system and the Government's
 willingness to provide employment for Kuwaitis in the public
 sector, which featured one of the most liberal retirement
 systems in the world.
 Kuwaiti labor law has a provision allowing for compulsory
 dissolution of any union that commits "acts considered to be
 violating the provisions of this law and of the laws connected
 with the preservation of public order and morals." Under the
 law, a union may only be dissolved by a court decisionp such a
 court decision may be appealed. No union has been dissolved
 in this manner.
 Union activity was concentrated in the government, banking,
 and oil sectors. Union members have the right to elect
 representatives of their own choosing provided the candidates
 can demonstrate no criminal record. While non-Kuwaiti workers
 did not enjoy the same union rights as Kuwaitis, there was
 little evidence of discontent among expatriate workers. Most
 expatriates were drawn to Kuwait by high wages; the Government
 would deport any non-Kuwaiti deemed a troublemaker; and a
 non-Kuwaiti could not remain in Kuwait without employment
 sponsorship.
 There is no indication that Iraqi military authorities
 recognize any worker rights in occupied Kuwait.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to organize and'bargain
 collectively. Union rights are incorporated in the labor law
 and were generally respected in practice. Article 78 of the
 Kuwaiti labor law states that any employer who "terminates or
 inflicts any penalty on a laborer for the purpose of forcing
 him to join, refrain from joining, or to withdraw from any
 
 
 1520
 KUWAIT
 trade union" must either rectify the contravention or be
 subject to fines. Discrimination against union or nonunion
 employees was rare.
 Kuwaiti labor law provides for direct negotiations between
 employers and "laborers or their representatives." If an
 amicable agreement is not reached, the parties can petition
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for settlement. If
 no agreed solution is reached by this means, the dispute is
 referred to a labor arbitration board composed of officials
 representing the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
 There were no export zones in Kuwait, and labor laws were
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Kuwaiti Constitution'prohibits forced labor "except in
 cases specified by law for national emergency and with just
 remuneration." This prohibition appears to have been
 generally respected.
 There were credible reports that Iraqi occupation authorities
 have compelled, by threat of arrest and imprisonment, key
 workers in banks and government agencies to report to work.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age under Kuwaiti law is 18 years for full-time
 work and 14 years for part-time work. This law appears to
 have been generally observed and enforced in preinvasion
 Kuwait, particularly in urban areas, by both labor inspectors
 from the Ministry of.Labor and Social Affairs and truant
 officers of the Ministry of Education.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 General conditions of work were established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sectors, with the oil
 industry treated separately. The law limits the workweek to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days' leave per year,
 and establishes a compensation schedule for industrial
 accidents. Reflecting the importance of the petroleum
 industry in Kuwait, the law governing employment in this
 sector is more generous than the general laws. It provides
 for a 40-hour workweek, overtime pay for shift work, 30 days
 annual leave, and a generous sick leave policy. Women are
 permitted to work, except in "dangerous industries and trades
 harmful to the health," and are promised "equal remuneration
 to that of a man provided she does the same work." There is
 no legal minimum wage, but this had little impact since
 preinvasiDn Kuwait was not a low-wage country.
 By and large, employers in preinvasion Kuwait appear to have
 respected provisions of the labor law and provided suitable
 working conditions, although abuses did occur in the treatment
 of unskilled foreign workers, particularly household maids and
 servants. There were credible reports that sizable groups of
 South Asian expatriate workers doing manual labor were not
 paid promised salaries in the first half of 1990. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs issued a new regulation
 in 1988 requiring employers to set aside specified monetary
 
 
 1521
 KUWAIT
 amounts to serve as wage insurance for foreign workers. This
 was an attempt to address the chronic problem of late payment
 or nonpayment of foreign laborers.
 A 1979 ministerial decree created a permanent commission to
 coordinate activities in the field of public health and
 occupational safety. It had some success in raising the
 safety awareness and improving government coordination. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for
 enforcing the labor laws but, despite penalties for such
 violations as nonpayment or underpayment of wages, the abuses
 continued.
 Iraq's invasion compelled hundreds of thousands of expatriate
 workers to flee, with-a resultant loss of livelihood, and
 severe physical and financial hardship.
