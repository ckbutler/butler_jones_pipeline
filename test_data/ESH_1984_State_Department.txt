THE WESTERN SAHARA
 Moroccan administration includes portions of the Western
 Sahara now divided into four provinces. Morocco assumed
 administration of the northern three provinces after the
 withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975, and it asserted control
 over the southernmost portion in 1979 when Mauritania
 renounced claim to the area and ceased administering the
 region over which its authority had been vested by the Madrid
 accords of 1975.
 Since 1977, the northern provinces of Layoune, Smara, and
 Boujdour have participated in elections held throughout
 Morocco. Communal elections were held in the southernmost
 province of Qued ed Dahhab in May 1981. The four Saharan
 provinces participated in 1983 elections and all votes in
 1984, including the August 31 referendum on the
 Moroccan-Libyan Treaty of Union, the September 14 direct
 parliamentary elections, and the October 2 indirect
 elections. Participation in the first two votes of 1984
 tended to run higher than in most of the rest of Morocco, with
 some areas in the Western Sahara registering as high as 100
 percent participation, according to official figures, in the
 August 31 referendum.
 Moroccan Saharan incumbents fill all 10 parliamentary seats
 from the Western Sahara provinces, and politicians of Western
 Sahara origin also fill seats from other provinces.
 Governors of the Saharan provinces, appointed by the King, are
 all native Saharans. In consultation with elected municipal
 and provincial councils, the four governors administer their
 provinces in the same manner as provinces and prefectures of
 Morocco proper. Most village and civil servants are also
 locally recruited Saharans. The governors are concerned
 primarily with accelerating development and delivery of social
 services. Large-scale public works projects, expansion of
 public services, and upgrading of long-impoverished areas
 continue.
 A consultative council on the Sahara was elected in 1981. The
 council, some of whose 80 members are women, first met in late
 1981 and continued to function in 1984.
 Ultimate sovereignty over the Western Saharan region remains a
 subject of international dispute with sporadic fighting
 between Moroccan forces and the Polisario, an organization
 wnich seeks independence for the territory. At the June 1981
 summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
 Nairobi, Morocco proposed that a referendum be held to decide
 the question. Two months later, at a subsequent OAU meeting,
 specific measures seen as leading to a peaceful settlement of
 the Saharan problem were outlined by the member states. The
 OAU summit in June 1983 resolved that the referendum be held
 by December 1983 but also called for direct negotiations
 between Morocco and the Polisario, a request with which
 Morocco did not agree. The resulting stalemate has prevented
 progress to resolve the Western Sahara dispute in the OAU.
 Morocco walked out of the November 1984 OAU Summit after the
 Saharan Democratic Arab Republic delegation was seated.

 MOROCCO
 The civilian population in the portion of the Western Sahara
 under effective Moroccan control apparently enjoys the same
 civil liberties as other Moroccans in areas of undisputed
 Moroccan sovereignty. There have been few opportunities to
 evaluate the human rights practices of the Polisario in areas
 outside the "Berm.' There have, however, been frequent
 Moroccan allegations of Polisario human rights abuses,
 including illegal detention, impressment into military
 service, and general infringement of the civil liberties of
 the inhabitants of the Western Sahara.
