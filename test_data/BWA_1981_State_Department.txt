 BOTSWANA
 Botswana has maintained the fundamental principles
 of the rule of law, political democracy, and respect
 for human rights throughout its 15 years of independence.
 The constitution of Botswana, which came into effect
 in 1965 when Botswana was still the British-administered
 Bechuanaland Protectorate, contains what is in effect
 a bill of rights providing for the "protection of
 fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual.*
 These constitutional rights are upheld in the courts.
 Botswana permits political dissent; competition among
 the four political parties results in lively discussion
 of political issues. Civil and military officers in
 Botswana are accountable to an independent judiciary
 for misconduct in office. Legislation protecting
 the rights of minorities is enforced. Botswana continues
 to accept refugees and currently provides for the
 social welfare needs and security of more than 1350
 refugees from various countries. Starting from a remark-
 ably poor base, Botswana has made significant progress
 in addressing the economic and social needs of its people.
 In sum, the Botswana Government has demonstrated a commit-
 ment to protecting the political liberties and civil
 rights of its people and to bettering their economic and
 social circumstances.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution, and there have
 been no allegations of torture in Botswana.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is prohibited by law, is contrary to public
 policy and is rare in practice. The attorney general's
 office investigates reported cases of police brutality.
 All such claims investigated to date have proved unfounded.
 There have been no summary executions in Botswana. Prison
 conditions allow for adequate diet and health care and
 visits from family members. Jails can, however, be crowded
 and inmates who have no relatives to see to their needs
 may encounter difficulty in arranging for maintenance.
 Flogging is permitted for infractions of prison rules.
 It is also used by traditional tribal courts, whose
 jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses. Women, how-
 ever, are not subject to flogging. Corporal punish-
 ment is also administered occasionally in the schools
 for serious cases of disobedience.
 c. Disappearances
 The Botswana constitution provides for the protection of
 personal liberty and there have been no allegations of
 secret arrests or clandestine detentions in Botswana.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Botswana constitution contains provisions protecting
 Botswana citizens from arbitrary arrest. There are no
 political prisoners in Botswana and preventive detention
 is illegal. Habeas corpus exists in practice, with a
 requirement that the police bring a suspect before a
 (26)
 
 
 27
 magistrate for charging within 48 hours of his arrest.
 All suspects must be released at that time unless the
 magistrate issues a warrant of detention.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Ttie right to a fair public trial is provided by law and
 is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel, and consultation between defendants and counsel
 may be held in private. Defendants must be charged
 within 48 hours of arrest, and the charges must be formally
 and clearly stated. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive and military, and this separation has been
 upheld even in controversial and politically sensitive
 cases. The high court has ruled that the constitution
 contains an implied *fifth amendment," i.e. that no one
 may be compelled to testify against himself; moreover,
 silence cannot be construed as guilt and the burden of
 proof remains with the prosecution. All trials are held
 in public. Accounts by foreign as well as domestic news
 sources indicate a scrupulous adherence to established
 procedures and meticulous observance of the rights of
 defendants.
 There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. Although the Botswana Defense Force
 Act provides for military courts, none as yet has been es-
 .tablished, and cases over which the military has juris-
 diction are referred to the attorney general and the
 civilian court system. There are problems in the ad-
 ministration of justice, but they center mainly on the
 difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified
 judicial personnel and court reporters.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law and re-
 spected in practice. A search warrant issued by a magis-
 trate is required for an official to enter a private
 residence, except in cases of suspected diamond theft
 or illegal drug transactions when a senior police
 officer may search without a warrant.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, of religion, and of the press are
 guaranteed by the Botswana constitution. The people of
 Botswana are free to express independent political ideas
 in speech, peaceful assembly and through the election
 process. Three opposition political parties exercise
 these rights through persistent public criticism of the
 government and the ruling Botswana Democratic Party.
 Botswana's information media (with the exception of an
 An radio station operated by VOA) are operated by the
 government. Their editorial staffs enjoy considerable
 independence, however. They frequently carry articles
 critical of government officials and policies. They also
 cover the activities of the political opposition. Foreign
 newspapers, magazines, and books circulate freely within
 Botswana. There is no censorship of books or films and
 no interference with academic inquiry.
 Labor unions have the right to organize, strike (none
 have-been reported this year), bargain collectively, and
 lobby. Selection of union officers must be ratified by
 the ministry of home affairs, but the only ground for
 
 
 28
 withholding such approval is that union procedures have
 not been properly complied with. No professional groups
 have experienced persecution or harassment. There is
 no official or state-favored religion, and those affil-
 iated with minority religions are not discriminated
 against in their civil, economic, or political status.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restric-
 tions on emigration or repatriation. There are just
 over 1350 refugees now in Botswana. Some 545 of these
 are from Angola, approximately 360 are South African,
 over 180 are from Zimbabwe, almost 140 come from
 Namibia, 125 are from Lesotho, and the remainder are
 from other African countries. The Botswana Government
 requires refugees to live in a camp located at Dukwe,
 in the central portion of the country, unless they are
 authorized to live elsewhere for reasons such as employ-
 ment or schooling. In cooperation with international
 agencies, the government provides educational programs,
 sports and recreational programs and business opportun-
 ities for the refugees at Dukwe. Like other foreigners
 in Botswana, refugees are not permitted to accept employ-
 ment without showing that there is no qualified Botswana
 citizen who can fill the position. During the past year
 the Botswana Government forcibly repatriated four African
 youths whom the immigration and security authorities
 determined were not bona fide refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy based
 on constitutionally-guaranteed universal suffrage. Its
 citizens enjoy complete freedom to participate in
 politics by voting, engaging in party activities, and in
 publicly advocating proposed policies. In the October
 1979 parliamentary elections, three opposition parties
 challenged the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BOP)
 in free and open elections which were decided by secret
 ballot. While the ruling BDP contested all 32 constit-
 uencies, the Botswana National Front contested 16 (one
 short of the number constitutionally required to elect
 a presidential candidate), the Botswana Peoples Party
 contested 14, and the small Botswana Independence Party
 contested only five. Since the opposition parties tend
 to have different regional bases, no BDP candidate ran
 unopposed. The government made a strong effort to
 persuade eligible voters to participate in the electoral
 process. Women have full political rights in Botswana.
 In practice, women are increasingly participating in
 political life. There are two women members of
 parliament, both of whom are ministers. The executive
 secretary of the ruling BDP is a woman. There is one
 white member of parliament, who is also a cabinet
 minister. The speaker of the national assembly is
 also white.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged violations of Human Rights
 Botswana welcomes the attention and interest of the
 outside world in its human rights record, including
 its treatment of refugees. Its record of cooperation
 with international agencies involved in assisting
 
 
 refugees has been excellent. At present, there are
 no Botswana-based organizations set up to observe,
 report, or contest human rights violations. The
 Botswana Government has a positive attitude toward
 international human rights bodies and consistently
 responds promptly and forthrightly to the inquiries
 it receives about the human rights situation in
 Botswana.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Botswana became independent in 1966 lacking the
 economic development benefits many former colonies
 derived from their colonial experience. It had no
 hard-surfaced roads and very few schools, partic-
 ularly above the primary level. Per capita GNP is
 estimated to have been no more than $69 and 57 percent
 of the government's operating.budget was financed
 by foreign aid. Despite these initial handicaps, the
 Botswana Government has striven, with remarkable
 success, to bring about economic development and has
 demonstrated sensitivity to the basic economic and
 social needs of the population.
 The Botswana Government has devoted consistent efforts
 to meeting the health and nutrition needs of the people.
 Accomplishments in this area have been significant,
 despite the country's poor initial situation. The
 percentage of the population with access to safe water
 increased from 29 percent in 1968 to 45 percent in 1970.
 The increase in access to safe water was greater in urban
 areas (71 percent to 95 percent) than in rural areas
 (26 percent to 39 percent), due in part to the fact that
 Botswana's rural population is widely scattered. It is
 estimated that in 1977 94 percent of the calorie supply
 required for Botswana's population was available in the
 country. The Botswana Government's efforts in the health
 field were reflected in an increase in life expectancy
 from 41.0 years in 1968 to 48.3 in 1978. The infant
 mortality rate is 97 per 1000 live births.
 Starting from a very weak base, the Government of
 Botswana has attempted to provide educational opportun-
 ities for its people as rapidly as possible. Due to
 these efforts, the adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio increased from 66 percent in 1968 to 89 percent
 in 1978. The difference in the 1978 ratios for boys
 (80 percent) and girls (98 percent) is due primarily
 to the persistence, of the custom of using young boys
 to herd cattle.
 Botswana is now attempting to implement a policy of
 universal primary education and-the ratio should,
 therefore, have improved since 1978. The adult
 literacy rate (which had risen to 35 percent in 1975 from
 33 percent in 1964), as well as relevant manpower training
 and the number of women in the job market, should
 also improve over time in response to the government's
 efforts.
 By 1978 per capita GDP had risen to $620. It has most
 recently been estimated at $720. Despite this advance,
 much remains to be done to overcome poverty in Botswana.
 The most recent estimates, which take into account the
 annual population growth rate of 2.8 percent, are that
 55 percent of the rural population and 40 percent of the
 residents of Botswana's urban areas have incomes below
 the absolute poverty level. With the fifth national
 development plan for 1979-85, the government focused
 attention on the themes of employment creation and rural
 development in an effort to redress this imbalance.
 Previously, the government had emphasized the provision
 of infrastructure throughout the country. Progress,
 however, will be difficult because a substantial number
 of the country's citizens are even now only marginally
 involved in the money economy.
