 BOLIVIA
 The inauguration of President Hernan Siles Zuazo On October 10,
 1982 marked Bolivia's return to civilian democratic government
 following 18 years of nearly continuous rule by the armed
 forces. Two military presidents, Gen. Celso Torrelio Villa and
 Gen. Guido Vildoso Calderon, also held office during 1982, ruling
 in the name of the Bolivian military.
 Prior to the change, a loose coalition of political parties and
 the main labor confederation, the Bolivian Workers' Central,
 created a political stalemate and blocked effective economic
 action by the military Governments. The armed forces then
 decided to return to civilian rule by convoking the
 never-installed congress elected in 1980. That congress
 subsequently chose Siles as president in accordance with the
 Bolivian Constitution and the unwritten rule that the winner of a
 plurality in the elections should be selected.
 Bolivia's economic system is basically state capitalist, with
 about 80 percent of the GDP produced by state enterprises. The
 country, already the poorest in South America, has been
 debilitated by several years of economic mismanagement.
 During 1982 successive Bolivian Governments took several positive
 steps in the human rights field. The security police were
 brought under tighter control. On May 26 the Government declared
 a political amnesty which allowed political exiles to return to
 the country and lifted the "recess" on political and labor union
 activities imposed after the 1980 coup by Gen. Luis Garcia Meza
 Tejada. On May 20 the Government restored full autonomy to state
 universities. On May 8 it lifted the national curfew decreed by
 Garcia Meza. The Government allowed many radio stations, notably
 the Catholic Church's radio "Fides," closed in 1980, to begin
 broadcasting again. It also rehabilitated many stations operated
 by the miners before returning them to the airwaves. On October
 10 the military government of Gen. Vildoso turned power over to
 Hernan Siles Zuazo. The new Government has stated that it will'
 respect human rights and has abolished the security police.
 During the Torrelio and Vildoso presidencies, far fewer arbitrary
 arrests took place than under the Garcia Meza regime. The
 incidence of torture declined. With the restoration of
 democratic government in October, Bolivians recovered full
 political rights. However, groups of "paramilitaries" operated
 in Bolivia during 1982, and some probably had links with the
 former military governments. The most important of these groups
 are essentially private armies financed by proceeds of the
 cocaine trade and under the control of private individuals. The
 "paramilitaries" include some foreigners and many of the same
 people who, as agents of the security police, committed human
 rights violations in 1981. On the day of Siles' inauguration the
 new Government signalled that they could no longer act with
 impunity by capturing and returning to Italy a leading
 "paramilitary"/terrorist, Pierluigi Pagliai. Pagliai was wounded
 at the time and subsequently died in Italy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Bolivian Government did not use assassination as a tool of
 policy during 1982. Nevertheless, some deaths occurred during
 confrontations between civilians and government authorities. In
 Cochabamba six people died on March 26 when the government tried
 to break up a workers' demonstration against the floating of the
 Bolivian peso. On September 17 four people, including one
 
 
 413
 policeman, died in Sucre during another demonstration by workers
 and university students in support of a department-wide strike.
 Terrorists of unknown sponsorship were allegedly responsible for
 the death on May 28 of a student, Cesar Frade. The Interfaculty
 Committee of the Greater University of San Andres in La Paz
 alleged that Frade had received "constant threats from
 paramilitary elements."
 Bombing was used as a form of intimidation by "paramilitary"
 groups. Numerous bombings in La Paz did not result in personal
 injury or death.
 There have been unconfirmed reports of human rights violations,
 including killings of farmers, during operations by the police
 against cocaine laboratories and in search of illicit coca
 production, and in some cases farmers retaliated by killing
 policemen.
 b. Disappearance
 Although the military Governments did not publicly announce
 detentions for political reasons, detainees (perhaps totaling
 over one hundred) usually were released after a short time. On
 Dedember 9, 1982 the Siles Government created a commission to
 investigate the fates of those people who had disappeared during
 the eighteen years of military rule. The commission received
 reports that two people had disappeared during 1982, but it was
 not immediately clear that the military Government then in power
 had actually detained them and made them disappear. According to
 the Washington Office on Latin America, individuals who
 disappeared under the Garcia Meza regime are still unaccounted
 for.
 c. Torture
 The incidence of torture declined under the military Governments
 during 1982 and virtually ended after the May amnesty. The most
 notable among the several cases of torture included those of Luis
 Lopez Altamirano, the Secretary General of the General
 Confederation of Factory Workers of Bolivia, who was arrested on
 February 5; Filemon Escobar, then an officer of the Bolivian
 Workers' Central and the Union Federation of Mineworkers of
 Bolivia, arrested on February 4; Jose Maria Palacios, an officer
 of the Bolivian Workers' Central and leader of the Socialist
 Party One, arrested on April 10; and possibly Lucio Lopez Lopez,
 the leader of the factory workers' union of Cochabamba, arrested
 on March 26. Allegedly, the most common means of torture
 involved electricity, including passing electrical current
 through electrodes attached to various parts of the body or
 through a wet metal floor on which the victim stood, and
 suspension in a tub of water through which electricity was
 passed. Some prisoners were severely beaten, and there were
 reports of the insertion of a rod or pipe into the victim's
 rectum.
 The torturers employed by the security police included Bolivians
 and foreigners. Some of these reportedly moved from the security
 police into the "paramilitary" groups. Most of the torture with
 electricity took place in La Paz at the Department of Political
 Order and the security police headquarters. The army's
 intelligence section also reportedly had equipment for.torture at
 its headquarters in the Miraflores barracks in La Paz.
 Most instances of torture were reported to occur soon after
 arrest - in the case of the security police often immediately
 after the prisoner's arrival there. Beatings of prisoners
 ,occurred in jails outside La Paz, but torture with electricity
 was not reported. Former President Torrelio and his Interior
 
 
 414
 Minister, Colonel Romulo Mercado Romero, publicly denied any
 knowledge of torture, but they took action against accused
 torturers. The commander of the security police, Lt. Col. Freddy
 Quiroga Reque, was reassigned in March. The Interior Ministry
 also reportedly dismissed three non-commissioned officers who had
 allegedly tortured Lopez Altamirano. Thereafter, allegations of
 torture declined during the year. The Vildoso Government appears
 not to have permitted the extreme forms of torture, although in
 the departments of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, and Santa Cruz some
 severe beatings occurred.
 On July 8, 1982 "paramilitaries" of unknown sponsorship kidnapped
 a leader of the unofficial Single Union Confederation of
 Campesino Workers of Bolivia, Zenon Barrientos Mamani, and beat
 him so severely that he required hospitalization. The alleged
 leader of the "paramilitary band," Roger Mareno Roca, was
 identified by the national police, but never apprehended.
 On August 25, 1982, following an intensification of the struggle
 between two rival farmers' unions, the Single Union Confederation
 and the official National Confederation of Campesino Workers of
 Bolivia, for recognition as the sole spokesman of the nation's
 farmers, the leaders of the former's La Paz departmental
 affiliate, Estanislao Poma and Luciano Chiara, were allegedly
 kidnapped by a group of "paramilitaries." The two stated that
 they were beaten during the abduction, held for several hours and
 then released.
 The Siles Government has stated that it will not employ torture,
 has abolished the security police, and has physically dismantled
 the apparatus used for torture. No cases of torture are known to
 have occured following the amnesty of May 26, 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 With the exception of Luis Lopez Altamirano, whose case was
 passed to the civil judicial system for trial, political
 prisoners were generally kept apart from common criminals. The
 Department of Political Order, where political detainees were
 kept, contains two cold, damp cells. Mattresses and blankets are
 in short supply. The Catholic church delivered food and personal
 messages to prisoners when permitted to do so.
 Most prisons for common criminals are old and overcrowded.
 Corruption is rampant, with prisoners paying guards for outings,
 better cells, food, contraband liquor, and drugs. Rehabilitation
 programs are non-existent. Very few upper class Bolivians of
 European extraction are arrested or jailed before or after
 trial. Men and women are kept in separate jails. Common
 criminals are not segregated by type of offense. The main reason
 for poor physical conditions in common jails is the country's
 lack of adequate resources.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the military Governments in 1982, the number of people
 detained at any time for political or arbitrary reasons averaged
 at least ten until May and then decreased. Other persons were
 detained during the period May-September, but these detentions
 were of very short duration. Human rights sources reported no
 one under political detention in early October. During periods
 of political unrest in the country, arrests rose considerably.
 For instance, a number of students and workers were detained in
 an effort to minimize public discontent following the economic
 austerity measures implemented on February 4, 1982. Many of
 these people were exiled abroad and the rest were released during
 February. Following the enactment of the Government's second set
 of economic measures at the end of March, another group was
 arrested, but public pressure brought about their release in the
 
 
 415
 first days of April. Many university students were detained in
 Cochabamba and La Paz during the general strike and
 demonstrations which led to the Government's granting of full
 university autonomy on May 20. Finally, some arrests occurred
 during the public demonstrations against the adoption by the
 Vildoso Government of a proposed third round of economic
 measures.
 The right to habeas corpus, although guaranteed by the Bolivian
 Constitution, was not respected in cases of political
 detentions. During 1982 habeas corpus petitions were seldom
 filed against the Interior Ministry on behalf of political
 detainees. Under the Constitution individuals may not be held
 without charge for more than twenty-four hours, but this
 provision was not respected in political cases.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no political trials in Bolivia in recent years.
 In criminal cases the defendant is presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, is permitted to have counsel, and may consult with
 counsel in private. Those arrested have a right to be charged
 within twenty-four hours. The Constitution requires that an
 accused be tried before a regularly constituted, competent civil
 tribunal. No special civilian or military courts were created
 for political offenses. Verdicts may be appealed from the
 ordinary courts to district courts and the Supreme Court.
 The criminal justice system - based on civil or Roman law - moves
 slowly. Some cases take years to complete because of antiquated
 procedures and shortage of qualified court personnel. In January
 a group of lawyers from La Paz issued a complaint about the legal
 delays inherent in the Bolivian criminal justice system.
 The Bolivian judiciary has often been influenced by political
 pressures and corruption. The Supreme Court judges were all
 replaced by the new civilian Government.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The privacy of the home is constitutionally protected. However,
 forcible entry of residences took place under the military
 Governments in 1982, although less frequently than in 1981. For
 instance, on January 1, 1982, agents of the security police,
 claiming that a political meeting was underway, raided an alleged
 New Year's Eve party in La Paz and arrested 34.people including
 two dual American/Bolivian citizens. All were later released.
 Security organs of the Bolivian government were believed to have
 a limited capacity for electronic eavesdropping.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Formal press censorship does not exist in Bolivia. However,
 editors and reporters often have avoided antagonizing recent
 military regimes because they feared reprisals. During 1982
 press criticism of the Government increased. Some publications,
 such as the satirical "Cascabel," which stopped publishing after
 the Garcia Meza coup, have now returned to the newsstands with
 regular issues. Before lifting of the "recess" on labor and
 political activities, the Bolivian Workers' Central and the
 political parties often published advertisements in the press to
 present their points of view. Since May 26 political and labor
 activities have been fully reported without regard to the
 Government's views.
 
 
 416
 Attempts to intimidate editors and reporters by means of death
 threats, break-ins, and bombings occurred in 1982. Although the
 incidence of death threats decreased in comparison with the
 previous year, break-ins and bombings increased during the
 Torrelio and Vildoso Governments.
 On September 17, 1982, the military declared the city of Sucre a
 "military zone," ordered press censorship, and occupied the
 city's radio stations. The measures were lifted the next day.
 During 1982 the Government helped rebuild and reopen some of the
 tin miners' radio stations which had been shut down by the Garcia
 Meza Government. Factory workers and railroad workers also
 initiated talks with the Government for the reopening of their
 stations. The Catholic church's radio "Fides," which was badly
 damaged after the 1980 coup, returned to the air on February 25,
 1982 after negotiations with the Government.
 The military Governments are believed to have intercepted some
 international mail during 1982.
 Informal restrictions on freedom of speech eased during the early
 part of 1982 and disappeared following the amnesty of May 26,
 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Most restrictions on peaceful assembly and association were ended
 during the year by the military Governments. The Bolivian
 national curfew, which prohibited private gatherings, was lifted
 in May.
 In Cochabamba on March 26, 1982 and in Sucre on September 17,
 clashes between demonstrators and authorities led to deaths. The
 Government of Bolivia had refused to grant permission for the
 meetings beforehand. The security police's forcible dispersal of
 a group of hunger strikers from the offices of the Bolivian
 Episcopal Conference on February 16 brought a strong protest from
 the Catholic church and resulted in disciplinary action against
 four security police agents whom the Government said had exceeded
 their authority.
 Bolivia's labor confederation, the Bolivian Workers' Central,
 began 1982 as a proscribed underground organization and ended it
 as a powerful civilian force. It was an important factor in
 bringing an end to the military Government in October. Virtually
 all Bolivian workers in the significant industrial and service
 sectors are organized.
 An agreement signed on December 19, 1981 between the Government
 and Bolivia's miners provided for the gradual abolition of the
 national "recess" on labor union activities imposed in 1980. On
 May 26, 1982 the Government accelerated the process, lifting all
 the controls and restoring full labor union rights. The Bolivian
 Worker's Central is a powerful and autonomous labor body which
 often opposes government policies, and unions now freely exercise
 the rights to negotiate and strike.
 Some union leaders, most notably those of the Single Union
 Confederation of Campesino Workers of Bolivia, alleged in 1982
 that they were harassed by the military Governments. The Single
 Confederation's rival, the National Confederation of Campesino
 Workers of Bolivia, enjoyed government recognition as the farm
 laborers' agent with the armed forces governments under the terms
 of the military-peasant pact of the late 1960's. The National
 Confederation's headquarters were in the Ministry of Peasant,
 Agricultural, and Livestock Affairs, and its leadership was
 
 
 417
 allied with military governments.
 Bolivia has many professional organizations, and neighborhoods
 are organized into neighborhood councils. Most, if not all, of
 Bolivia's regional departments have powerful civic committees.
 Since May 26, 1982, when controls imposed in 1980 were formally
 lifted, no known legal restrictions on the right to organize by
 such groups have existed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Bolivia. Neither the
 military regimes nor the civilian Government persecuted
 individuals for their religious beliefs during 1982, nor were any
 religious figures detained.
 The Catholic church in Bolivia, acting through the Archbishop of
 Sucre and the Papal Nuncio, has protected religion in general and
 has encouraged the Government to end human rights violations.
 Protestant churches operate openly and freely. In 1982 a
 Protestant college opened its doors in Santa Cruz. The small
 Bolivian Jewish community was not harassed by the Government
 during the year, although the military regimes tolerated neo-Nazi
 "paramilitary" groups which published anti-semitic tracts. For
 instance, an anti-semitic newsletter put out by a group calling
 itself the "Sovereignty Paramilitary Command" threatened members
 of the U.S. Embassy and the Bolivian media.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement by Bolivians within the country is not controlled.
 Foreign travel requires an easily obtainable exit visa stating
 that the traveller is not wanted by the police and has paid all
 taxes. The Bolivian Government neither encourages nor
 discourages emigration.
 Before the amnesty of May 26, 1982, the Torrelio Government sent
 some political opponents into exile. About one hundred people
 were exiled in 1982, most in the wake of arrests following
 protests of the adoption of economic measures in February and
 March.
 Since May 26 all political exiles have been allowed to return,
 and most have done so. The Government did not obstruct their
 repatriation, and most did not experience harassment under the
 military governments. However, the leader of the unofficial
 campesino confederation, Genaro Flores Santos, who returned
 quietly but openly to Bolivia a few weeks before the amnesty,
 reportedly received numerous death threats.
 The system of internal exile instituted by Garcia Meza was
 abolished by the May 26 amnesty. This system obligated detainees
 to travel at their own expense to an isolated place of residence
 and to report to the local police station sometimes as often as
 three times daily.
 A related measure that forced individuals living at home to
 register frequently at a police station was suspended in late
 February and abolished on May 26, 1982.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The inauguration of the Government of President Hernan Siles
 Zuazo on October 10, 1982 restored the Bolivians' right to
 participate in the political process. The military Government
 convoked the Congress chosen in the country's 1980 elections. In
 accordance with the Constitution of 1967, the Congress elected
 
 
 418
 Siles, who received a plurality in the 1980 presidential
 election. Eighteen political fronts and parties covering the
 entire ideological spectrum had been certified to participate in
 the 1980 election.
 By and large persons of heavily European extraction make up the
 governing structure of Bolivia. Individuals primarily of Indian
 ancestry have little opportunity to rise to the top positions in
 the military or the Government because of their lack of education
 and isolation from the elites' culture, and because of the
 elites' traditional discrimination against them. President
 Siles, however, appointed an Aymara Indian as Minister of
 Peasant, Agricultural, and Livestock Affairs.
 Few women are named to high-ranking jobs. None of the four
 cabinets of the three Governments which ruled Bolivia in 1982
 included women. The Congress which was convoked in October
 contained three women deputies and no women senators.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 In March 1982 Bolivia participated in the 38th meeting of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). The commission
 published the report of an investigation of human rights
 practices in Bolivia conducted in October 1981 by the
 commission's special envoy, Hector Gros Espiell, shortly after
 the Torrelio Government assumed power. The report detailed fully
 the violations of human rights during the Garcia Meza regime, but
 commented on the improvements during the first weeks of the
 Torrelio Government. The UNHRC, in approving Gros Espiell's
 report, noted the improvement in human rights during the Torrelio
 Administration. The Bolivian Government has also cooperated with
 the UNHRC's Working Group on Disappearances to try to resolve
 questions about the fate of people missing since the Garcia Meza
 coup.
 The Catholic church, the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights, and
 the press are the most important monitors of human rights in the
 country. Most of the Church's direct dealings with the
 Government on this issue are through the Papal Nuncio. The
 Bolivian Episcopal Conference plays a role in providing relief to
 detainees' families. During the military Governments, a priest
 often but not always was permitted to visit political detainees.
 This priest was harassed intermittently, but no other instances
 of governmental retaliation against the church are known.
 The Permanent Assembly of Human Rights takes less direct action
 but is more active in publicizing detentions, violations of human
 rights, and conditions leading to violations of human rights.
 This broader definition of its function has led it to make
 statements which have caused public controversy. The press was
 most effective in publicizing detentions and exilings by the
 military Governments.
 The Church, the Permanent Assembly, and the press received
 information from the families, political parties, and labor
 unions of detainees. Early in the year the security organs
 reportedly warned detainees upon their release of the adverse
 consequences of revealing to human rights organizations the
 treatment they received while in detention.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The World Bank's 1982 development report estimated Bolivia's
 population at 5.6 million (mid-1980) with a growth rate of 2.6
 percent (1980). Life expectancy at birth in 1980 was estimated
 to be 50.2 years. The infant mortality rate is very high, 131.3
 per 1,000 live births (1980 est.). Data from some other sources
 suggest that 252 per 1,000 children do not reach the age of five,
 
 
 419
 and the 1976 census reported that 291 out of 1.000 rural children
 (compared to 186 per 1,000 urban children) die before their fifth
 year. These figures correspond closely to the small proportion
 of the:population which has access to safe water - 14.4 percent
 (1976) - and the calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements - 83 percent (1977).
 Bolivia's economy is burdened with a large foreign debt, a
 stagnant public sector (which generates 80 percent of GDP), and a
 potentially productive private sector which lacks sufficient
 government incentives or capital. GDP reached an estimated $7.5
 billion in 1981, but will probably drop in real terms by about 5
 percent in 1982. The Bolivian per capita product was $573.50 in
 1980 but has since declined. Between January and September 1982
 inflation reached 126.3 percent: between February and September
 the value of the dollar rose by 900 percent against the peso; and
 from the beginning of the year until September there was a 28.4
 percent drop in the purchasing power of the average Bolivian
 worker. These declines do not affect all segments of society
 equally. The upper class often has investments and savings
 abroad or income denominated in dollars. The lower class, which
 forms the bulk of the population, remains on the margin of the
 money economy, and many continue to live by subsistence farming.
 The urbanized middle classes suffer the most because their
 salaries do not keep up with inflation. They usually do not
 receive dollar incomes, but often have loans denominated in
 dollars.
 The adult literacy rate was estimated to be 62.7 percent in 1976,
 but recent Bolivian estimates place it at about 75 percent.
 Public education is free and, in urban areas, generally available
 though subject to disruption during periods of governmental
 change or unrest. Except in the most isolated areas, Bolivian
 rural youth can expect at least three years of schooling. The
 primary school enrollment ratio was estimated at 87 percent. in
 1979. Instruction at government schools is conducted only in
 Spanish. All Bolivian universities except Catholic University in
 La Paz and the Protestant college in Santa Cruz belong to the
 state system.
 Since the 1952 revolution, racial discrimination has been banned
 in Bolivia. However, informal social discrimination against
 persons of Indian ancestry persists. Positive correlations exist
 between high socio-economic position and European origins and
 between low soclo-economic position and Indian origins.
 Equality between the sexes is greater in traditional Indian
 society than in Hispanic European society. Many peasant
 merchants and craftspersons are women. They contribute
 significantly to their families' incomes and have important
 voices in their families' and communities' affairs. Women in the
 Hispanic European society are much more likely to stay at home
 and be socially but not economically or politically active.
