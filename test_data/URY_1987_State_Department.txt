 URUGUAY
 Uruguay returned to its democratic tradition of a freely
 elected executive branch, independent bicameral legislature,
 and autonomous judiciary when 12 years of military rule ended
 on March 1, 1985. Since the resumption of democracy, Uruguay
 has experienced a high level of political participation from
 all sectors of the society, marked by vigorous and unrestricted
 debate over national issues. President Julio Matia
 Sanguinetti's Colorado Party holds a plurality in the
 Parliament which resumed its independent role in the political
 life of the nation. The judicial branch also regained its
 independent status, and there is a continuing public debate
 over the need to reform the legal and judicial systems.
 Political parties, the press, labor unions, private interest
 groups, and other nongovernmental groups function freely.
 In 1986 and 1987, the Uruguayan economy showed significant
 growth after many years of stagnation. This was largely the
 result of increased prices for beef and wool, diversification
 of trade into nontraditional exports, and strengthened
 commercial ties with its immediate neighbors, Brazil and
 Argentina, as well as with the United States and Europe. Real
 incomes have recovered some of the ground lost in the previous
 decade. The Government is considering reform of the
 comprehensive, but expensive, social welfare system and is
 planning to trim the extensive network of state enterprises
 which dominate many sectors of the economy.
 During 1987 there were no credible reports of human rights
 violations. All political prisoners and even some nonpolitical
 ones in effect received amnesty, including release from prison,
 after the return to democracy in 1985. However, despite the
 passage of the 1986 Law on Expiration, which effectively
 exempted military and police personnel from prosecution for
 alleged human rights abuses committed under orders during the
 military regime, public debate on this subject continues. The
 Law of Expiration was adopted with the idea of putting the
 country's past behind it and consolidating democracy. The
 executive branch determines if cases already pending against
 military and police officials for human rights abuses are
 covered by the law's provisions; if so, the cases are
 considered closed. Cases thus far forwarded by the Supreme
 Court to the executive branch have been found to be covered by
 the law.
 Under Article 79 of the Constitution which permits the
 overturning of laws by referendum, a commission headed by
 relatives of victims of human rights abuses mounted a campaign
 to gather signatures to submit the Law of Expiration to a
 popular vote. On December 17, the national proreferendum
 commission delivered the petition to the Electoral Court,
 which at the end of 1987 was charged with authenticating the
 signatures to determine if 25 percent of eligible voters
 signed the petition.

 The Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the
 home, absolutely inviolable at night, can be entered and
 searched only with a legal warrant during the day. Protection
 for private papers and correspondence is equally strong, "and a
 warrant is. required for confiscation. These rights and
 protections are well respected. Investigations of wiretapping
 during the military regime continue, but there has been no
 evidence of any such activity after March 1985.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 Newspapers and magazines are published by all sectors of the
 political spectrum, including formerly proscribed organizations
 such as the Communist Party and the Tupamaro movement which
 conducted terrorist campaigns in the late 1960's and early
 1970's. Criticism of the Government is allowed and widely
 practiced. Some journalists fear that a 1984 press law, under
 which journalists can be fined or imprisoned for defamation or
 slander, could be used to restrict press freedom. One
 journalist was convicted in 1987 of making false statements
 concerning the business connections of a senator and the
 director of the state insurance bank, but he was not
 imprisoned.
 The national university is autonomous, and academic freedom is
 highly respected. University elections have been held twice
 since 1985, and student groups have.reestablished themselves
 in the political life of the campus. Most professors fired
 for political orideological reasons by the military regime
 have returned to their posi-tions, although some isolated cases
 remain tinder study.-
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of, assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups,, such.as the Tupamaros, are free to
 organize and express their opinions. Public marches and
 demonstrations are allowed with permits from the Ministry of
 the Interior and occur without official harassment or
 intimidation. Persons denied citizenship rights by the
 military regime because of political affiliation or activity
 have had their rights fully restored..
 The Constitution provides for the right of workers to organize
 freely and encourages the formation of unions. The Interunion
 Workers Assembly-National Workers Association (PIT-CNT), which
 represents the majority of Uruguay's unions, has resumed
 activities since the return to democracy. Workers have the
 right, to strike and bargain collectively, and both are widely
 practiced. The Government supports these rights and promotes
 collective bargaining by the Government, management, and labor
 through salary councils for various sectors of the work force.
 Trade and professional organizations are free to join the
 general labor movement. The labor confederation (PIT-CNT) is
 free to affiliate with international bodies, but has not done
 so although some Uruguayan unions hold membership in trade
 organizations associated with international confederations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans are Roman Catholic.
 Members of other religions exercise their faiths unhindered,
 and missionaries are free to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted.
 An estimated 300,000 Uruguayans left the country during the

 military regifne, some for political and others-for economic
 reasons. Programs to help in the'repatriation process are now
 active, and Uruguayans wbo wish to return are encouraged to do
 so. All'bhe'rominent political figures exiled by the
 military reglme-have retuifed.

 Sectioi 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding Inte'national and
 Nobgoerhmintal-Investigation of A-leged Violations
 of Human Rights         -' -:"
 The human'rights performnance of the Government since its
 return'to democi:atic rule in 1985-has not been of major
 concern to iriternatioi'ally based human rights organizations.
 The Government is open to such organizations and does not
 restrict the activities of human rights investigators. The
 American Association for the Advancement'of Science conducted
 an invest-igation of phyEicians' participation in torture
 during the military Tegime and'was allowed to interview
 military medical Personnel. The results of this investigation.
 were later published. Amnesty International (AI) in a letter
 to the President of Uruguay expressed concerns regarding the
 1986 amnesty'law. The President provided a point-by-point
 respone'to AIIs inquiry which became a matter of public
 record.'
 Local human rights groups, some of which could not operate
 openly under military rule, now function freely and without
 restriction. A prominent local human rights group, SERPAJ
 (Peace and Justice'Service), was legalized in early 1985 after
 being forced to operate underground for 2 years during the
 military regime. SERPAJ now investigates both nonpolitical
 human rights issues, such as prison conditions, and
 politically controversial cases, involving death, torture, and
 disappearances which occurred during the military regime. A
 Uruguayan congressional commission investigated the murder of
 an Uruguayan senator and a representative in Buenos Aires
 during the time of the military regime but uncovered no
 evidence of direct complicity by Uruguayan military or police
 officials.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Uruguay has long been one of the most egalitarian countries in
 Latin America and has a well-developed welfare system.
 Statistically there are few racial or linguistic minorities in
 Uruguay. Nonwhites are disproportionately represented at the
 lower end of the economic scale, but this is not the result of
 legislated discrimination.
 Uruguayan women enjoy complete equality under the law. They
 pursue professional careers and attend the National University
 in large numbers. There are women serving in cabinet
 positions, the Supreme Court and lower courts, and in the
 diplomatic service up to the ambassadorial level. There are
 currently no female members of the Parliament, but several
 serve as alternates. Some barriers to equality still exist
 because of traditional social patterns and restricted
 employment opportunities. Pay is not always equal for men and
 women, especially in less skilled jobs.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 For many decades, Uruguay has had some of the most advanced
 workers' rights legislation in Latin America. Children are
 not legally permitted to work until they have obtained a
 primary education. Children under the age of 15 are not
 generally employed, but they can work from the age of 12 with
 special permits from the Government. Children under the age
 of 18 cannot perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work,
 apart from domestic service. Salary and hours for children
 are also more strictly controlled than for adults. Children
 over 16 years of age can sue in court for payment of wages,
 and child laborers have the right to dispose of their own
 wages by law. Children working in the informal sector, such
 as street vendors, itinerant laborers, and others with no
 fixed place of work, or in the agrarian sector are generally
 less strictly regulated and receive lower pay. Adults
 normally work six 8-hour days, 48 hours per week.
 Workers are entitled to 10 days of paid vacation after 1 year
 of service, and this vacation period increases with each year
 of additional service. Wages must include a Christmas bonus
 in addition to the paid vacation. Workers are at least
 theoretically protected by minimum wage laws and legislation
 regulating the health and safety of working conditions. The
 minimum wage, which does not apply to rural or domestic
 workers, was adjusted three times in 1987, as were private and
 public workers' salaries. In dollar terms, the minimum wage
 decreased slightly during the year, dropping from the
 equivalent of about $90 per month after the February
 adjustment to about $85 per month after the November
 adjustment decreed by the Government. Health and safety
 conditions are extensively and effectively regulated. Special
 regulations which limit working hours or mandate safety
 equipment are applied nationwide to industries deemed
 "unhealthy," and they are enforced by inspectors from the
 Ministry of Labor.
