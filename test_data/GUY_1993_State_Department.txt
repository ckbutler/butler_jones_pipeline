 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana a member of the Commonwealth of Nations
 and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), is a small, multiracial developing na-
 tion with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election in a multiparty pohtical
 
 
 system. Dr. Cheddi Jagan leader of the party obtaining a plurality of seats in Par-
 liament, was sworn in as Executive President on October 9, 1992. The President ap-
 points a Prime Minister and other ministers. There was general agreement among
 international observers that the 1992 elections were free and fair.
 Security forces are comprised of the Guyana Defense Force (GDF) and the Guyana
 Police Force (GPF). The latter has primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order throughout Guyana. The police and security forces are subordinate to the ci-
 vilian government. Guyanese social and political life is strongly influenced by the
 presence of two main ethnic groups, the Afro-Guyanese and the Indo-Guyanese.
 urban Afro-Guyanese dominate the opposition People's National Congress (PNC),
 the civil service, and the security forces- Indo-Guyanese predominate in the agricul-
 tural and business sectors and in the ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP).
 Guyana's economy depends on agriculture and mining, with sugar, rice, bauxite,
 and gold being the major export earners. Despite an estimated growth rate of 8.2
 percent in 1993, Guyana's per capita gross domestic product was only about $465
 in 1992. The economy suffers from high external debt, shortages of skilled labor,
 and a deteriorating infrastructure.
 Human rights problems in Guyana in 1993 continued to include extrajudicial
 killings by police, and police rape and other abuse of detainees and prisoners. Police
 generally were able to commit these abuses with impunity. Societal violence against
 women and children, and discrimination against the indigenous Amerindians contin-
 ued. There were still limitations on workers' rights, but political control of union ac-
 tivity diminished somewhat.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political killings are known to
 have occurred in recent years.
 There were credible allegations that police are responsible for deliberate, illegal
 executions. In most instances, there was a failure to investigate and prosecute the
 responsible police officers. On September 5, two police officers shot and killed Ricky
 Samaroo and Joseph "Dingo" Persaud in Georgetown. Persaud had earlier been a
 witness in a civil case against police officers accused of murdering a suspect, Mi-
 chael Teekah, in 1988. Another witness against police in the same case reported
 that six police officers threatened to kill him and Persaud. Two days after the
 killings, the police department bestowed cash awards on the two policemen respon-
 sible or the deaths of Persaud and Samaroo. The police claimed an investigation
 was being conducted but have ignored the Guyana Human Rights Association's
 (GHRA) inquiries into its progress.
 On June 4, Frank Wilson was shot and killed at the police station where he had
 worked as a laborer for 12 years. Police claim Wilson committed suicide, but his
 family believed he was murdered. Authorities ignored the family's calls for an inves-
 tigation into the death.
 Seven inmates escaped from the Mazaruni prison in July. Police shot three of the
 escaped .risoners, killing two, during operations to recapture them.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, the GHRA and the press reported a ris-
 ing number of incidents of police brutality.
 On occasion, confessions have been thrown out of court on the grounds that they
 were coerced. There were also credible reports of police officers involved in criminal
 activity, including extortion, intimidation, and assault, although the number of such
 charges declined since 1991. The independent newspaper Stabroek News, in an Oc-
 tober 19 editorial entitled "Business as Usual," stated, "short on skills and re-
 sources, the cops have maintained their now traditional routine of beating and har.
 assment to persuade suspects to talk. In the process, the guilty and the not guilty
 confess, and these 'confessions' become the focal point of the vast majority of cases
 at the criminal assizes."
 In July a police detective was demoted and transferred from the Criminal Inves-
 tigation Department (CID) after being accused of brutality. Also in July, the head
 of CID, who was also accused of brutality, resigned from the police force after being
 transferred to the administrative section. In August legal counsel for five men ac-
 cused of smuggling cocaine into Guyana claimed in court that police beat his clients
 to gain confessions, but he offered no independent evidence to support this claim.
 Citizens complained that members of the Special Police Impact Group beat them
 with rifle butts for no other reason than being out on the streets late at night.
 
 
 Eleven Angolans who entered Guyana illegally from Brazil were detained in police
 custody for several months while their applications for political asylum were consid-
 ered. The African Cultural and Development Association (ACDA) claimed police beat
 four of the Angolans after they went on a hunger strike. The Commissioner of Police
 claimed that the four had damaged police property by throwing chairs around and
 "got physical" with police while being moved from one location to another.
 The Amerindian Peoples Association (APA) charged that there is a systematic pat-
 tern of abuse of Amerindians, particularly abuse of Amerindian women by police
 and soldiers stationed in interior communities. In September the Minister of Home
 Affairs received a report that police in the Orealla Amerindian reservation were ar-
 resting Amerindian women on false charges and sexually assaulting them in the
 jail. The APA said that all the policemen were transferred out of the reservation
 but complained that no investigation was carried out and no criminal charges were
 filed against any of the policemen.
 There is no independent body charged with looking into complaints of police bru-
 tality or abuse. The Ombudsman lacks the authority to look into allegations of po-
 lice misconduct. Such cases are heard by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA).
 The PCA has no power to interview police officers or witnesses, must rely on mate-
 rial submitted by the police, and must refer cases of alleged abuse to the Commis-
 sioner of Police. Investigations of such charges are perfunctory and rarely result in
 serious disciplinary action. Officers charged as a result of complaints to the PCA are
 routinely suspended for a few days and sometimes fined but are rarely jailed. In
 essence, the police force is responsible for investigating itself and failed to do so ef-
 fectively.
 Prisons continued to be severely overcrowded. According to the Ombudsman, Guy-
 ana had 267 prison inmates per 100,000 population in 1992. The GHRA cited poor
 diet, inadequate medical attention, underpaid andporly trained staff, and lengthy
 trial delays as problems facing the prison system. The Ombudsman reported receiv-
 ing 33 complaints from prisoners in 1992. Prisoners complained of prison conditions,
 unreasonable charges, mail delays, and censorship. Suraj Persau  a teenage boy,
 was beaten to death in Brickdam jail in Georgetown. The GfRA complainedto Po-
 lice Commissioner Laurie Lewis that fellow youthful prisoners beat Persaud over a
 period of several days with no attempt by pol ice to intervene. Lewis did not respond
 to the GHRA complaint. All letters sent by prisoners to the Ombudsman are opened
 by prison officials. The GHRA applied to have one of its members named to the pris-
 on visiting committee but received no response from the Government. The Govern-
 ment also failed to appoint a GHRA member to the new prison advisory committee
 charged with recommending ways to reform the prison system. According to the
 GHRA, all women prisoners in Guyana are held in one prison. The facility's isolated
 location and lack of adequate staff make it difficult or amily members to visit.
 There were credible allegations that female detainees were sexually abused by the
 police.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that was generally re-
 spected in practice in 1993.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official, only an assessment
 of guilt by the police officer. The law requires that a pe rson arrested and held for
 more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Chief Maistrat K.
 Juman Yassin publicly complained that suspects are ofen detained for more than
 24 hours but never charged. Bail is generally available except in capital cases. In
 narcotics cases, magistrates have some discretion in granting bail before trial but
 must send all persons convicted on narcotics charges to custody, even if an appeal
 is p ending.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trail
 The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal offense has the
 right to a hearing by a court of law, and this right is respted in practice. Guyana
 has a functioning bail system. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal may
 be made to higher courts.
 There are no political prisoners or special courts for political security cases. Sev-
 eral persons charged in an alleged coup plot, held since 1990, were released from
 custody without trial in 1993.
 In the past, some members of the opposition to the previous PNC governments
 expressed concern over court rulings in libel suits brought by ,overnment officials
 as well as other governmental use of the courts to harass political opponents. The
 judiciary now exerts greater independence due to the freer political atmosphere
 
 
 462
 which has developed in the country since 1985. The present Government made no
 attempt to use the courts to intimidate the opposition.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are often caused by shortages of trained court ad-
 ministrative personnel and magistrates, inadequate resources, low salary levels, and
 the slowness of police in getting cases ready for trial. The inefficiency of the judicial
 system is so great as to undermine due process. Prisoners are often detained 3 or
 4 years awaiting trial. Appeals of some murder cases have been delayed for several
 y ears. Postponements are routinely granted to both the defense and the prosecution.
 In a recent session of the Court of Appeals, eight criminal appeals were dismissed
 for lack of prosecution. The defendants had served their full sentences (3 years on
 the average) and had been released from prison before the appeal could be heard.
 The Chief Magistrate reported that it is not uncommon for defendants to be incar-
 cerated for 2 to 3 years pending trial.
 Although the laws of Guyana recognize the right to legal counsel, in practice, with
 the exception of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford to pay.
 A small groups of lawyers is working to begin a Legal Aid clinic. The Government
 has provided a small cash grant for the clinic as well as the services of a lawyer
 from the Attorney General's office. The clinic is expected to open early in 1994 after
 the Government provides office space. Due to resource constraints, the clinic ini-
 tially will limit its activities to certain types of civil cases in Georgetown. Apart
 from these efforts, virtually no lawyers work pro bono in criminal cases. Defendants
 in murder cases are assigned an attorney by the court. The Guyana Association of
 Women Lawyers provides free legal services for civil cases only.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the right to privacy, although some politicians
 claimed instances of surveillance by the previous PNC government of political meet-
 ings and rallies. (Uniformed police officers routinely monitor such rallies.) The laws
 requiring judicially issued warrants for searches were generally respected in 1993.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitutional provision for freedom of
 speech is generally respected, and Guyanese freely criticize their government and
 its policies. The Government generally ignored often savage ad hominem attacks on
 President Jagan and his Government by the opposition PNC newspaper New Na-
 tion. However, a businessman was pressured by a government official to withdraw
 advertising from the papr, and there were credible charges that foreign investors
 were pressured to cancel contracts with consultants who were former PNC govern-
 ment officials. President Jagan and members of his Government criticized the inde-
 pendent daily newspaper Stabroek News for what they considered unfair and inac-
 curate reporting but took no action against the paper.
 The government-owned Guyana Television and the two radio stations controlled
 by the government-owned Guyana Broadcasting Corporation offer relatively even-
 handed reporting of local events. Guyana has no private radio stations but does
 have six private television stations in Georgetown, and several more in outlying
 towns. Two of the private television stations offer frequent public affairs program-
 ming which is often critical of the Government, and they began to produce Guyana's
 first independent newscasts in 1993.
 In past years, the Government exercised varying degrees of control over the media
 through ownership of what had been the countrys only daily newspaper (the Guy-
 ana Chronicle), the communications agency, the two radio stations, and the issuance
 of import licenses for newsprint and printing presses. The Minister of Information
 stated that the Government will not privatize the state-owned media, but the Gov-
 ernment's role in the media nonetheless declined greatly due to the increased avail-
 ability of other newspapers and the rapid growth of television. In 1993 the inde-
 pendent Stabroek News expanded publication to seven times a week and added a
 weekly regional edition. Independent and opposition newspapers frequently criticize
 the Government in editorials and satirize it in cartoons.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act requires
 police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commissioner has the author-
 y to refuse permission for a public meeting at his discretion and without expla-
 nation. There was no evidence that he used this authority for political purposes in
 1993. Political parties and other groups held public meetings and rallies throughout
 the country without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Guyanes practice a wide variety of religions, the major
 faiths being Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. The Constitution provides for free-
 dom of religion, and members of all faiths are allowed to worship freely. There are
 no restrictions on foreign religious groups proselytizing in Guyana.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission, the result of a law dat-
 ing from colonial times designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation.
 Prior to the 1992 elections, the GHRA, opposition politicians, and some c ergy con-
 tended that permits were sometimes denied to missionaries and non-PNC politi-
 cians, and that the regulations were used to maintain PNC influence among the
 Amerindians. In practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas with-
 out regard to the formality of a permit. Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to emi-
 grate, and to return.
 Guyana did not generate political refugees in 1993. Eleven Angolans and one or
 two other Africans who entered Guyana from Brazil applied for political asylum. On
 the advice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, most of the ap-
 plications were ultimately approved.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Guyana has a unicameral Parliament which is chosen by direct election in a
 multiparty political system based on proportional representation. The leader of the
 party which obtains a plurality of seats in Parliament durin national elections is
 sworn in as Executive President. The President appoints a  abinet, headed by a
 Prime Minister, which tsether with the President exercises executive power.
 Guyanese are free to join or support olitical parties of their choice. The 1992 gen-
 eral election, considered free an  air if not entirely unflawed by foreign observers,
 brought the major opposition party to power while turning the then governing party
 into the main opposition. Despite constitutional provisions, elections were still not
 held on schedule or in a consistent manner. The general election was delayed from
 1990 to October 1992; municipal elections, scheduled for December 1992, had not
 been held by the end of 1993.
 No progress was made on reforming or replacing the Constitution, which rants
 an inordinate amount of power to the President. Constittional reform requres a
 two-thirds majority in Parliament, which could only be achieved through the co-
 operation of the ruling party and the opposition. Only one constitutional amendment
 was proposed during the 1993 parliamentary session, to change the composition of
 te.ational Elections Commission, and this was eventually agreed to after ex-
 tended negotiations among the four parties represented in Parliament.
 There are no legal impediments to women or minoritiesparticipating in the politi-
 cal process, but historically neither women nor Amerindians were encouraged to
 participate, other than by voting. Any Guyanese citizen 18 years or older can reg-
 ister to vote, and about 80 percent of those registered cast votes in the 1992 elec-
 tion. President .Jagan's Cabinet includes two women, two persons of Portuguese de-
 scent, one of Chinese origin, eight of East Indian extraction, four Afro-Guyanese,
 and one Amerindian. The new 65-member Parliament includes 13 women and 8
 Amerindians, representing both major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference in 1993. The GHRA is a nongovern-
 mental organization formed in 1979 with the participation of trade unions, profes-
 sional organizations, various ethnic groups, and churches. It issues periodic press
 releases and publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. The Govern-
 ment made no public statements in response to either GHRA or foreign human
 rights reports. The GHRA received no threats in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-In principle, the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex and commits the Government to ensure equal pay for equal work. However, a
 1988 government-sponsored constitutional amendment rendered the equal pay ro.
 vision unenforceable except in cases in which equal pay for equal work is provided
 for by specific statute. No such statutes have been enacted.
 The 1990 Equal Rights Act was meant to end sex discrimination, but the failure
 to include a specific definition of discrimination rendered the Act unenforceable.
 There is no legal protection against widespread sexual harassment in the workplace,
 and dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy is common and not illegal.
 Other legislation passed by the Parliament in 1990 protects women's property
 rights under common law marriage, entitling a woman who separates or divorces
 to one-half of the couple's property if she had been working and one-third of the
 
 
 464
 property if she had been a housewife. However divorce by consent remains illegal,
 and there are unequal provisions regarding adultery as grounds for divorce. The leg-
 islation also gave authority to the courts to overturn a man's will in the event it
 did not provide for the wife.
 Violence against women and children, including domestic violence, is a significant
 problem. Wife beating, rape, and incest are common, but lawyers say their clients
 very rarely report such crimes to the authorities. Victims of such abuse who do seek
 redress from the police and the courts often suffer social retribution and additional
 harassment from the authorities charged with pursuing their claims. Because of
 their economic circumstances and the lack of any family shelters or other place of
 solace, victims of domestic violence are often trapped in their homes with their
 abusers. The National Women's Rights Campaign (NWRC) presented a draft bill on
 domestic violence to the Government in September which the Ministry of Labour,
 Human Services, and Social Security promised to table in Parliament in 1994.
 There are few organizations, other than those sponsored by political parties, that
 focus primarily on women's rights. Two exceptions are the Guyana chapter of the
 Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA) and the NWRC
 which opened a counseling center for victims of violent relationships in early 1993.
 Children.-A 1992 U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) report on children and women
 in Guyana stated that "the rights of children and women to survival and develop-
 ment, to protection, and to participationhave not been adequately met." An esti-
 mated 65 to 86 percent of the population of Guyana lives in poverty, and children
 are more severely affected than any other group. The severe deterioration of the
 public education and health care systems has stunted children's futures and often
 cut short their lives. For many children, health care has become unaffordable. Chil-
 dren are often denied access to education because their families cannot afford school
 fees, or because their families need the children to contribute to running the house-
 hold by working or providing child care for other children.
 The worst effects on children's lives come from migration. Over 3 percent of Guy-
 ana's population emigrates every year in search of a brighter economic future. As
 parents migrate they often leave behind their children to be raised by other family
 members, friends, or by other children. Nearly 1 percent of Guyana's households are
 headed by children under the age of 14.
 The administration of justice for children is characterized by a punitive legal sys-
 tem which does not take into account the needs of children fleeing sexual, physical,
 or emotional abuse. The 1992 UNICEF report stated that the "human rights of chil-
 dren in institutions are essentially violated . . . . Children are being detained in
 inhospitable prison conditions for as much as 6 months without trial and without
 being allowed to go to school. Children have been picked up from the streets and
 detained in an institution without being taken to court and without the consent of
 their families. Within both public and private institutions children report being
 beaten and sexually and emotionally molested."
 First Lady Janet Jagan and several ministers of government are strongly commit-
 ted to children's human rights and welfare. In July the National Committee for the
 Survival, Protection, and Development of Children held its first meeting, chaired by
 Mrs. Jagan. The Committee is drafting a national program for action on children,
 but the Government's ability to improve the situation of children will be severely
 constrained by the lack of resources available to the State.
 Indigenous People-Guyana has a small indigenous Amerindian population, com-
 posed of nine tribal groups, most living in reservations and villages in remote parts
 of the interior. Their standard of living is much lower than that of most Guyanese,
 and their ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions,
 and the allocation of natural resources is virtually nil.
 Amerindian life is regulated by the Amerindian Act, legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect the indigenous peoples from exploitation. The Act
 gives the Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and what is
 an Amerindian community. Additionally, the Act gives the Government the power
 to appoint Amerindian leaders and to cancel or annul any decisions made by Amer-
 indian councils. Both individuals and Amerindian groups remain free to criticize the
 Government. Although many actively and openly oppose government policies, their
 influence on government policy was negligible. The Amerindian Act also prohibits
 the sale of alcohol to Amerindians and requires government permission before any
 Amerindian can accept formal employment. In December Parliament approved a
 motion to "appoint a Special Select Committee to study the Amerindian Act and to
 make recommendations for its revision along democratic lines to enlarge the self-
 determination of Amerindians." The motion passed with the unanimous support of
 all four parties represented in Parliament.
 
 
 465
 In 1992 the Government distributed land titles to some Amerindian communities.
 The APA charged that the titles were distributed just before the elections in an at-
 tempt to win votes and criticized the allocations because they were smaller than rec-
 ommended by the Government Lands Commission in 1968 and did not include min-
 eral rights.
 The Government still holds title to 90 percent of the land claimed by Amerindians
 and through the Amerindian Act, retains the ability to repossess the land titles al-
 ready distributed if it determines that it is in the Amerindians' interest. Several
 large leases and concessions were granted, allowing mining and timber companies
 to operate on traditional Amerindian lands often under contracts and terms never
 made public. Amerindians displaced by timber and mining operations in such cases
 have no legal recourse.
 In 1993 the foreign-owned Barama company began timber operations on 4.2 mil-
 lion acres of primary tropical forest where five Amerindian communities are located.
 Of the 1,200 Amerindians living within the Barama concession only 550 live in gov-
 ernment-recognized Amerindian villages. The rest are scattered along the rivers and
 have no legal protection for their homesteads. The APA claimed that the traditional
 hunting, fishing, and farming lands of the Amerindian communities are being de-
 stroyed and that nine families living inside the Barama concession have been re-
 moved from their land. The APA also claimed that Barama was denying
 Amerindians access to their traditional forest paths and waterways within the
 Barama concession. Barama officials denied these claims, saying that a total of four
 families relocated voluntarily to new housing built at Barama s expense. Barama
 further claimed that it respected the boundaries of Amerindian communities and
 that environmental damage in these areas was often caused by gold miners operat-
 ing without supervision in the region.
 late 1992, the new Government appointed an Amerindian to the new position
 of Minister of Amerindian Affairs. The Minister considers himself a liaison between
 Amerindians and the Government. However, as a junior minister in the Ministry
 of Public Works, Communications, and Regional Development, he has no staff and
 no separate budget. The APA and the Guyanese Organization of Indigenous Peoples
 complained that he is consequently ineffective in the position.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution  provides fundamental
 rights for all persons in Guyana regardless of race, sex, religion, or national origin.
 Guyanese society and political life continue to be influenced by lIongstandin ethnic
 tensions, primarily between Guyanese of African and East Indian descent.e civil
 service and defense and police forces are overwhelmin ly staffed by Afro-Guyanese.
 This is largely the result of historical circumstances and does not reflect a deliberate
 policy of the present Government. Recruitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guyanese
 candidates for the uniformed services generally have met with an unenthusiastic re-
 sponse, with most qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates opting for a business or pro-
 fessional career over military police, or public service.
 People with Disabilities.-duyana has several special schools and training centers
 for the disabled but like the rest of the educational system these are understaffed
 and in severe disrepair. The disabled generally are considered unemployable be-
 cause of the lack of appropriate infrastructure to provide accessibility in both public
 and private facilities. There is no law mandating provision of access for people with
 disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution, which specifically enumerates a worker's right to 'form or belong to trade
 unions." Employers are not required by law to recognize a union in the workplace,
 even if a large majority of workers have indicated their desire to be represented by
 a union. The Minister of Labour sent a new trade union recognition bill to the Attor-
 ney General for comment, but it had not been laid before Parliament by the end
 of the year.
 Most union members work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises, al-
 though in 1993 unions gained recognition in several of Guyana's newly privatized
 industries. Organized labor in Guyana freely associates in one major national fed-
 eration, the Guyana Trades Union Congress (TUC), composed of 22 unions. From
 1988 to 1993, six unions suspended their involvement in the TUC and formed the
 Federation of Independent Trades Unions of Guyana (FITUG) to protest longtand-
 ing political control of the TUC by the PNC. After long negotiations with the FITUG
 unions, the TUC adopted democratic reforms to its constitution in February 1993.
 The FITUG unions returned to the TUC at a special conference in September during
 which a FITUG member was elected president in the TUC's first free elections since
 the mid-1970s.
 
 
 466
 There is a tradition of close ties between Guyana's trade union movement and po-
 litical parties, particularly the PNC which controlled the Government (and thus
 public sector employment) for 28 years until 1992. Historically the two major politi-
 cal parties wielded significant influence over the leadership of a number of unions,
 and trade union officials often served in dual roles as party officials. President
 Cheddi Jagan is on leave as honorary president of Guyana's largest union, the Guy-
 ana Agricultural and General Workers Union, and former President Hoyte is presi-
 dent general of the Guyana Labour Union. Several other unions in the TUC are for-
 mally affiliated with the PNC, and several FITUG unions have close ties with other
 political parties.
 Workers have a generally reco nized right to strike, but public employees provid-
 ing essential services are normally forbidden to strike (a procedure exists for the
 review of their grievances by a tribunal appointed by the Minister of Labour). When
 four public sector unions called a "work to rule" by government employees to protest
 delays in wage negotiations, President Jagan said, "they have a right to strike, but
 they must strike responsibly." Unions representing the water works, the state-
 owned radio stations, and the telephone company called short strikes or "work to
 rule" actions. In October the union representing workers at the state-owned elec-
 tricity company called a strike which lasted 7 days after the Prime Minister forbade
 management from signing a wage agreement that had been negotiated with the
 union.
 Unions representing workers in the sugar, bauxite, timber, and seafood industries
 also staged short strikes. Most of these strikes were called to support negotiations
 for higher wages or better working conditions, although a significant number of
 strikes were the result of interunion recognition battles. Labor disputes are fre-
 quently settled through consultation and dialog without resorting to strikes or other
 industrial action. Unions and their federstions freely maintain relations with recog-
 nized Caribbean and international trade union and professional groups. All three of
 the major international labor federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Ministry of Labour certifies all collective bargaining agreements
 and has never refused to do so. This right is not codified, however, and employers
 are not legally required to recognize unions or bargain with them. F~or two decades
 the TUC's traditional ties (through PNC-affiliated unions) to the former PNC-con-
 trolled government limited the unions' ability to negotiate effectively on behalf of
 workers in both the private and public sectors.
 In 1993 the new Government repealed a regulation requiring the Government and
 all public corporations to engage in collectivebargainingonly with the TUC and not
 with individual unions. The result of that regulation  ad been that salaries and
 working conditions in the Government and public sector enterprises were dictated
 by the Government. However, unions complained about a new regulation that all
 wage settlements with the Government or public corporations had to be approved
 by the Ministry of Finance.
 The Chief Labour Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labour provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. In 1993, 47 collective bargainingagree-
 ments were concluded and certified by the Ministry of Labour, up from 26 the year
 before. The Ministry has a backlog of cases, and insufficient manpower and trans-
 portation severely limit the Ministry's ability to carry out its functions.
 The Ministry of Labour documented no cases of antiunion discrimination during
 1993. However, union leaders make credible charges that workers attempting to
 unionize workplaces are harassed and intimidated and that the Ministry does not
 expeditiously investigate complaints that employers are dismissing workers when
 confronted with union organizing efforts. A foreign-owned timber ompany fired
 workers who went on strike to protest supposed delays by the Ministry of Faabour
 in holding a recognition poll between riva9PNC and PPP unions, but the company
 later rehired all employees who returned to work. There is no legal mechanism to
 require employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to rehire employees fired
 for union activities.
 Guyana has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsor Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it exists.
 d. Minimum Age of Empoyment of Children.-Minimum age laws are set out in
 the Factories Act and the mployment of Young Persons and Children Act. Legally,
 no person under 14 years of age may be employed in any industrial undertaking,
 and no person under 16 maynbe employed at night, except under regulated cir-
 cumstances. The terms "industry" and "factory" as used in the law have been inter-
 preted by the Ministry of Labour to encompass nearly all workplaces except offices
 
 
 and retail shops. According to the law, children under age 14 may be employed only
 in enterprises in which members of the same family are employed. The local eco-
 nomic situation has forced more and mre young children into the work force, how-
 ever, and it is common throughout the country 2o see very young children engaged
 in street trading. While cognizant of the situation, the Ministry of Labour does not
 employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government establishes a public sector
 minimum wage which was *1.35 per day as of July 1, 1993. The Labour Act and
 the Wages Councils Act allow the Labour Ministry to set minimum wages for var-
 ious categories of private employers. In November official minimum wages were
 raised by over 400 percent; the minimum wage for unskilled workers was set at
 $0.17 per hour. Both the legal minimum wage for the private sector and the public
 sector minimum wage are currently insufficient to provide a decent standard of liv-
 ing for a family.
 Hours of employment are set under the Shops Act and the Factories Act and vary
 by industry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day and a 44-hour
 week requires payment of an overtime rate. The law does not provide for at least
 one 24-hour rest period.
 The Factories Act sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Occupa-
 tional Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labour is charged with con duct-
 ing factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace and
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Workers cannot remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
