 MADAGASCAR
 Throughout 1992 Madagascar was ruled by transitional governmental institutions
 established in late 1991 following mass protests against the rule of President Didier
 Ratsiraka by the populist "Forces Vives" (Active Forces) movement. The transitional
 Government, headed by Prime Minister Guy Razanamasy, ruled by decree with the
 advice and consent of the 31-member High Authority of State (HAE) headed by Al-
 bert Zafy, the 130-seat Council for Economic and Social Recovery (CRES), and the
 heads of the Council of Churches. President Ratsiraka remained in office but with
 much reduced powers, and the National Assembly remained suspended. In August
 Malagasy voters a p proved a new constitution which provides or an elected par-
 liamentr form of government headed by a prime minister but with provision for
 a popularly elected president as head of state. Presidential elections, considered by
 international observers to have been generally free and democratic, were held on
 November 25. A runoff election between the top two contenders, Albert Zafy and
 Dider Ratsiraka, will be held in January 1993.
 The gendarmerie and the national police were responsible for internal security
 during this transitional year. They and the Directorate General of Internal and Ex-
 ternal/Investigations and Documentation (DGIDIE) reported to the Prime Minister,
 although most of their persdnnel remained appointees of President Ratsiraka. The
 Presidential Security Guard, a unit of 1,800 men, remained under the direct com-
 mand of the President. Some elements of this and another elite, pro-Ratsiraka army
 unit were involved in a partly successful intimidation campaign to keep voters away
 from the polls during the August constitutional referendum and to disrupt early
 preparations for the presidential election. Violence during and after the referendum
 resulted in at least eight deaths. However, according to credible reports, physical
 mistreatment of detainees, associated particularly with the DGIDIE in the past, did
 not recur in 1992. Madagascar's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year
 for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed
 analysis, were $35 million. These expenditures have not decreased. In the years
 
 
 145
 ahead, the Government may reserve a greater percentage of these expenditures for
 civic action projects.
 Agriculture, especially production of rice, vanilla, and coffee, dominates the Mala-
 gasy economy, employing 80 percent of the work force and creating 35 percent of
 gross domestic product (GDP). Madagascar also has a small industrial base which
 generates about 15 percent of GDP.Per capita GDP is very low, about $230 per
 annum. GDP growth for 1992 was expected to be approximately 1 percent, but living
 standards continued to erode given Madagascar's relatively high rate of population
 growth. Unemployment was high, particularly among youth (60 percent of the popu-
 at on is under age 25). In 1992 the transitional Government had to contend with
 the negative effects of the general strikes in 1991 and was not able to implement
 strong macroeconomic stabilization and reform measures.
 Human rights are more fully protected under the Constitution adopted in August,
 butplitical confrontation and violence occurred throughout much of the year. In
 Marwh government troops used excessive force against unarmed pro-Ratsiraka dem-
 onstrators, killing six people. In a number of instances, pro-Ratsiraka (so-called
 "federalist") supporters initiated violence in protesting efforts within the transitional
 Government to exclude President Ratairaka from future elections. In July members
 of a Forces Vives splinter group temporarily seized the national radio and television
 building in Antananarivo, claiming to have overthrown the transitional Govern-
 ment. Federalist supporters seriously disrupted the transitional Government's con-
 trol, notably in coastal Diego Suarez (Antairanana), Tamatave (Toamasina), and
 Tulear (Toliara). Notwithstanding this pattern of confrontation and violence, free-
 dom of speech, press, and assembly were widely exercised during 1992. There were,
 however, occasional complaints that national television was being pressured into
 providing coverage favorable to the transitional Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-One incident involving excessive
 crowd control measures took a toll in human lives. On March 31, pro-Ratsiraka sup-
 porters marched on the National Forum (the body drafting legislation for the Third
 Republic) to protest efforts inspired by Forces Vives to exclude Ratsiraka from fu-
 ture office. After repeated warnings to turn back, soldiers fired on the demonstra-
 tors as they aproached the security zone of the Forum site, killing six and wound-
 ing several others. As was the case with a similar incident on August 10, 1991-
 when Ratsiraka forces used excessive force in putting down a crowd marching on
 the palace-the Government's investigation was inconclusive and did not result in
 any arrests or convictions.
 Beginning 10 days before the August 19 referendum on the new Constitution,
 there were a number of politically motivated incidents between Ratsiraka federalist
 supporters and the transitional government forces, resulting in a number of deaths.
 Pro-Ratsiraka provocateurs destroyed ballots in Mahajanga and Maroantsetra and
 in other coastal cities, including Toliara and Antisiranana (Diego Suarez), where
 "federated states" were declared. Many polling stations, especially in Antsiranana
 province but also in Toliara, could not open during the referendum due to the pro-
 atsiraka intimidation campaigk. In Toamasina, immediately after the referendum,
 the attempted killingof a localForces Vives leader by federalists touched off vio-
 lence which took the lives of at least 6 people.
 Recurring political violence was especially marked in Antsiranana. The day before
 the referendum, army troops assisted civilian federalists in taking over the provin-
 cial palace, air field, and radio station, and navy commandoes engineered a prison
 break, adding to the insecurity. At least one local Forces Vives leader was killed.
 Occupation of the provincial palace, along with the holding of Forces Vives hostages
 continued for more than 2 months. In October federalists assaulted the airport, and
 the ensuing clash with loyalist soldiers and gendarmes resulted in eight deaths
 among the federalist attackers.
 In 1992 large increases in crime throughout the country, coupled with inadequate
 police response, resulted in a few instances of civilian vigilantes taking summary
 retribution against alleged thieves. There was no official action taken toinvestigate
 the killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no permanent disappearances in 1992. However,
 there were short-term disappearances of Forces Vives militants and journalists due
 to abductions by federalist agitators in Diego Suarez during and after the constitu-
 tional referendum.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of such abuses in 1992.

 Conditions in Malagasy prisons, however, are life threatening. The diet provided
 is inadequate, and family members or charities must augment inmates' daily food
 rations. Those prisoners without relatives in the prison vicinity sometimes go for
 days without food. Single prison cells house up to eight inmates, and each prisoner
 has on average less than 1 square meter of space. Prisoners suffer a wide range of
 medical problems that are not routinely treated, including malnourishment, infec-
 tions, malaria, and tuberculosis, which are exscerbated during the winter months.
 A number of children live in the prisons with their mothers, suffering the same dep-
 rivations, and guards conspire with female inmates to promote prostitution.
 On August  , the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited 14
 detainees (13 of them Malagasy) arrested on July 29, 1992, for an attempted take-
 over of the national radio and television station in Antananarivo. This was the first
 such visit of political detainees in Madagascar by the ICRC.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or ExiLe.-Legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest
 and detention are not always followed. According to the law, in a normal criminal
 case the detainee must be charged or released within 3 days after arrest. An arrest
 warrant may be obtained but is not always required. Generally, defendants in ordi-
 nary criminal cases are charged formally within the specified time frame and, upon
 being charged, are allowed to obtain an attorney. Counsel is readily available, and
 court-apponted counsel is provided for indigents. Bail may be requested by the ac-
 cused or by his attorney immediately after arrest, after being formally charged, or
 during the appeal process. Denial of bail may be appealed.
 Despite these legal provisions, average pretrial detention time exceeds 1 year, and
 3 or 4 years of detention is common, even for crimes for which the maximum pen-
 alty may be 2 years or less. Prisoners may spend years in prison only to be found
 not guilty, with no recourse. According to reliable estimates, around 60 percent of
 Madagascar's prisoners are in pretrial detention. The judicial process remained slow
 in 1992. Under Malagasy law, anyone suspected of activity against the State may
 be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite extension if considered
 necessary by the Government. Two pple initially arrested under this provision
 were eventually formally charged with banditry and were awaiting trial at the end
 of the year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The 1975 Constitution and the new Constitution
 adopted in 1992 provide for an independent judiciary and, in practice, the judiciary
 seems to function without undue influence from the executive. However, the judici-
 ary, unlike the executive and legislative branches, is not a separate branch of gov-
 ernment.
 Malagasy trials are public, and defendants have the right to be present, to
 confront witnesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a presumption of in-
 nocence under the Malagasy Penal Code.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for civil and criminal cases
 carrying limited fines and sentences; the Court of Appeals, which includes a crimi-
 nal court for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and the Supreme Court.
 The judiciary also has a number of special courts designed to handle specific kinds
 of cases under the jurisdiction of the higher courts.
 A constitutional High Court, with a separate and autonomous status, is the body
 for review of laws decrees, and ordinances and for overseeing elections and certify-
 ing their results. t is clearly separated from the judicial hierarchy.
 Extralegal institutions known as "dina" also exist as a means of conflict resolu-
 tion. Dina are special bodies established under specific agreements between villages.
 Technically, dina handle only civil matters between villages; criminal cases are to
 be turned over to the court system. In practice, the dina have been used to settle
 cattle rustling cases, prevalent in the south. Decisions by dna are not subject to
 procedural protection of due' process or to judicial review. Dina are traditional
 means of conflict resolution whose weight of authority depends upon customary con-
 sensus to abide by their rulings.
 A military court has juridiction over all cases involving national security. The
 definition of national security is largely a matter of interpretation by the authori-
 ties, but includes acts constituting a threat to the nation and its political leaders,
 invasion by foreign forces, and riots that could lead to overthrow of the Government.
 In exceptional cases, civilians may be tried in the military court if charged with
 breaking military laws. Military courts, like civilian courts, provide for an appeal
 process and are presided over by civilian magistrates.
 There were no political prisoners tried and sentenced in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 home is inviolable under Malagasy tradition and law, and the State does not inter-
 vene in the private aspects of the lives of the people. There is no known monitoring
 
 
 of telephones or correspondence, and there is no pattern of abuse of authority by
 the police.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression, communication, and press and forbids press censorship; these provisions
 were largely respected in 1992. Since 1989, when press censorship was suspended
 (to be formally abolished in 1990), the print media have openly criticized both the
 Government and the opposition. Opposition parties, independent trade unions, pro-
 fessional associations, and others have regular access to the newspapers and often
 have their statements and declarations published.
 By mid-1991, the state-owned Malagasy Radio-TV (RTM) featured weekly discus-
 sion programs, often including prominent opposition figures. The political content of
 its newscasts was largely factual throughout 1992, and Malagasy television contin-
 ued to broadcast French network news live each evening. However, there were occa-
 sional complaints that national television was being pressured into providing favor-
 able coverage of the transitional Government.
 State radio faced competition from four pirate stations, one of which was financed
 by President Ratsiraka and another by the Forces Vives. In addition, there are other
 private groups ready to begin operation as soon as a new law authorizing private
 broadcasting is passed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Some legal restrictions remain
 on the right of assembly and association. Municipal permits are required before
 holding public meetings and may be denied by the Government if officials believe
 that the meeting poses a threat to the State or endangers national security. Offi-
 cially established security zones are off limits to demonstrators. The proliferation of
 political and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) is indicative of recent relax-
 ations on free association. There are more than 60 political parties in Madagascar,
 25 of them formed in 1992, and some 900 NGO's.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The old and new Constitutions provide for freedom of re-
 ligion. The Government is secular, and there is no discrimination on the basis of
 religious affiliation. Between 40 and 50 percent of the population adheres to Chris-
 tian beliefs, with the remainder following traditional Malagasy beliefs, Islam, and
 other faiths. Missionaries and clergy are permitted to operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is no restriction on travel within the country. All Malagasy must
 obtain official approval for trips outside the country. All residents of Madagascar
 (Malagasy and foreign) require exit visas issued by the Ministry of Interior. There
 is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Most citizens exercised this right in 1992, although the political violence sur-
 rounding the constitutional referendum in August limited voting in some areas. The
 unelected transitional institutions that governed Madagascar in 1992 were largely
 the  results  of   a  popular   mass   opposition  movement    which   in  1991
 extraconstitutionally forced the government of President Ratsiraka to abdicate most
 of its power. The key problem throughout the year revolved around the future par-
 ticipation of President Ratsiraka in the democratic process with transitional gov-
 ernment leaders divided on whether he should be excluded. Attempts by the ro-
 Zafy camp in late September and October to disqualify the presidential candi acy
 of Ratsiraka provoked renewed federalist violence in coastal provinces. On several
 occasions in October, the rail link between Tamatave and Antananarivo was cut by
 saboteurs, which, inter alia, deprived the capital of regular petroleum supplies. The
 transitional Government struck agreements with federalist leaders in late October
 and early November which ensure their cooperation during the presidential election
 campaign in exchange for prompt consideration of federalist grievances. In the end,
 the High Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the transitional Government's elec-
 toral code allowing President Ratsiraka to run for President again; he did in Novem-
 ber, winning a berth in a runoff election in January against Albert Zafy, the top
 vote-getter in round one. Legislative elections are scheduled to follow 2 months
 later. The elected legislature will then select a Prime Minister, who will form a gov-
 ernment.
 Suffrage is universal, with no discrimination based upon sex or minority status,
 but in government women hold less than 5 percent of cabinet-level or parliamentary
 posts; in the judiciary they have a somewhat higher representation. In 1992, for the
 rirst time, a woman participated in a presidential election, finishing fifth with 3.5
 percent of the vote. Balloting, in theory, is secret. Separate ballots are printed for
 
 
 148
 each candidate and distributed to voting sites by the national Government. Costs
 associated with ballots are borne in part by the candidates, and only those can-
 didates garnering a minimum 10 percent of the vote are reimbursed their required
 contribution.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups are considered to be political groups under Malagasy law
 and must register with the Government. The new Constitution provides for the es-
 tablishment of an independent organization charged withpromoting and protecting
 human rights, but it had not been established by year's end
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Madagascar is inhabited by approximately 12 million people. The Malagasy are
 of mixed Malayo-Polynesian and African origins and are divided into 18 distinct
 roups based on regional and ancestral affiliation. These ethnic groups fully and
 freely express their cultural heritages. The Electoral Code of October 1992 includes
 legislation which prohibits traditional leaders from using their cultural authority to
 inifluence voting. However as in 1991, some militant supeorters of President
 Ratsiraka attempted to exploit ethnic tensions, particularly pitting coastal Malagasy
 "Africans" against the Malayo-Indonesian highlanders, generally identified with the
 President's opposition. Ethnic or regional solidarity can also be a determining factor
 in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Pakistani community of about 20,000, primarily engaged in commerce,
 has been in Madagascar since the early part of this century. Few, however, have
 been able to obtain Malagasy citizenshi  since it is customarily bestowed matrilin-
 eally through native Malagasy women. Their shops have often been targets for vio-
 lent attack during civil disturbances. There were few such incidents in 1992, but
 the Indo-Pakistanis remained a frequent target of mistrust and criticism.
 Women have an important, if secondary, role in the business and economic life
 of the country, with many of them managing or owning business concerns or filling
 management positions in state industries. Women in rural areas and among the
 urban poor face greater hardship, bearing the responsibilities of raising a family
 while also engaging in farm labor or other subsistence activities. In education wom-
 en's participation in secondary and higher studies is lower than that of men.
 Under the law, wives have an eqa  say in choosing where a married couple will
 reside, and they receive a more or les equitable distribution of marital property in
 divorce cases. In the case of the death of a husband, a wife inherits one-half of the
 joint marital wealth. A widow receives a pension; however, a widower does not.
 According to various sources, including magistrates, journalists, and women dc-
 tors, violence against women, such as wife beating, is not widespread. Malagasy so-
 ciety tends to resolve conflict through a combination of patience and negotiation,
 and marital confrontation is not considered acceptable. In the rare cases where
 physical abuse is detected, police and legal authorities d intervene, although there
 is no law dealing specifically with violence against women.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Malagasy in both the public and private sectors
 have the right in law-the 1975 Labor Code and the 1992 Constitution-and in
 practice to establish and join labor unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. Unions are required to register with the Government, and registration
 is routinely granted. However, the labor force of 4.9 million is mostly agrarian (80
 percent), and unionized labor accounts for less than 5 percent of the total. Many
 trade union federations are affiliated with political parties. Because the Government
 was transitional during 1992, it exercised very limited control over organized labor.
 The Labor Code and the new Constitution provide for the right to strike. Those
 providing essential services-police, fire fighters, hospital workers-have only a lim-
 ited right to strike. In 199  there were strikes by the railway workers union, by
 Antananarivo bus drivers, at the state-owned power, petroleum, and air transport
 companies, at two ministries, and at the state fishing company. In practice, formal
 public and private sector unions have not played an active role poitically or eco-
 nomically in recent years in Madagascar. They have been overshadowed instead by
 ad ho strie committees which dominated labor agitation to support Forces Vives
 political objectives, particularly in 1991.
 Unions may and do freely affiliate with and participate in international bodies
 and may form federations or confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the 1975 Labor Code,
 and the 1992 Constitution provide or the right to bargain collectively. The Code
 states that collective bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor
 
 
 at either party's behest. Collective bargaining agreements exist but are not common.
 The minimum wage is set by the Government. Other wages are set by employers
 with individual employees. When there is failure to reach agreement, the Ministry
 of Labor convenes a committee of employment inspectors who attempt to resolve the
 matter. If this process fails, the committee refers the matter to the Chairman of the
 Court of Appeals for final arbitration. There were no such cases in 1992.
 The Labor Code formally prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers. In the case of antiunion activity, the union or its
 members may file a petition in civil court challenging the employer.
 Labor laws are applied uniformly throughout the country, including in free trade
 zones. Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites with some regularity.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is explicitly prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code describes a child
 as any person under the age of 18. The minimum age for employment is 14, and
 the use of child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is apparent and immi-
 nent danger. The Government enforces these child labor laws relatively effectively
 in the small wage sector through inspectors from the Ministries of Civil Service, and
 Labor and Social Security. However, in the large subsistence sector, many young
 children work with their parents on family farms at much earlier ages. Similarly,
 in the urban areas many children earn a living as parking attendants and news-
 paper vendors or through other street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and its enforcing legislation
 prescribe the workingconditions and wage scales for employees, which are enforced
 by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security. The law distinguishes between agricul-
 tural and nonagricultural work. There is a 4-hour workweek in nonagricultural
 and servie industries. There are also p rvisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity
 leave, and insurance. There are several administratively determined minimum-wage
 rates in Madagascar, depending upon employment skills. The lowest (for unskilled
 workers) is inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living. Such workers must
 supplement their incomes through subsistence agriculture, petty trade, or reliance
 on the extended famil.y structure. Given insufficient enforcement measures, official
 wage rates are sometimes ignored as high unemployment leads workers to accept
 salaries below the legal wage.
 The Labor Code has rules concerning building and operational safety, machinery
 and moving engines, lifting weight limits, and sanitation standards. Ministry of
 Labor and Social Security inspectors regularly visit industrial work sites, and viola-
 tions of labor code rules are subject to inspection reports. If cited violations are not
 remedied within the specified time frame, the violators may be legally charged and
 subject to penalties. Nevertheless, in several sectors protective measures are lacking
 due to the expense of even minimal protective clothing and other protective devices.
 To date, there have been no published reports on occupational health hazards, al-
 though there is clear evidence that these hazards exist.
