 FIjI
 Fiji is governed by a Westminster-type multi-party
 parliamentary system inherited from the British colonial
 period, with a written constitution providing safeguards to
 protect the traditional communal social systems, including land
 holding rights, of the indigenous Fijians. Fiji's 645,000
 citizens form a multi-racial society made up of indigenous
 Melanesians/Polynesians (44.4 percent), immigrant Indians (50
 percent), and small groups of European, Chinese, and other
 Pacific Islanders (5.6 percent). It is justly proud of its
 human rights record.
 The individual civil and political rights of Fiji's citizens
 are protected by law, a court system which functions both
 effectively and rapidly, a free press, strong democratic
 institutions, and a government which supports cultural
 -diversity. The integrity of the person is respected both in
 law and in practice. There have been no recent developments in
 Fiji that adversely affect its human rights climate.
 Fiji's fourth national elections since independence were held
 in July 1982, and the ruling party was returned with a reduced
 majority. Despite a campaign that some local observers thought
 particularly harsh in tone, the election passed without
 violence, serious incident, or disruption of any government
 services. Charges by both of Fiji's major parties of electoral
 fraud and foreign influence on the electoral process are the
 subject of a special investigation by an independent commission
 of inquiry appointed by the Governor General.
 The close outcome of Fiji's 1982 national elections will
 probably in the long-term cause political leaders of both
 parties to seek a broader base of support in Fiji's several
 ethnic communities. At present, each political party tends to
 be identified with either Fijian or Indian constituents, though
 all have members from both communities. An effort to broaden
 this base of support, prompted by the desire for political
 success, should further defuse what racial tensions do exist in
 Fiji and, eventually, lead to a situation in which race plays
 little or no part in the nation's political life.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 Politically motivated murders by the Government or opposition
 political organizations were unknown in Fiji in 1982.
 b.   Disappearance
 There have been-no known disappearances nor is there any
 evidence of people being abducted, secretly arrested, or
 clandestinely detained.
 c.   Torture
 Torture, which is prohibited by the Constitution, is not
 practiced in Fiji.
 . d.  Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is illegal
 and is neither condoned nor practiced. There are no summary
 executions in Fiji. Treatment of prisoners is impartial and
 
 
 703
 humane. While there are no discriminatory practices by virtue
 of race, it should be noted that approximately 79 percent of
 the prison population is indigenous Fijian. In addition to
 constitutional protections, a law setting out the prisons
 ordinance contains specific regulations on subjects such as
 treatment, visiting rights, and clothing. While prisons are
 overcrowded, legislation exists which permits prisoners to
 serve their time in extramural situations (i.e., work for the
 Government and live outside the prison) for the last twelve
 months of sentence and for any sentence of 12 months or less
 duration. Legislation also allows gainful employment in
 addition to commitment to perform public work while serving an
 extramural sentence. The prisons ordinance is detailed and
 includes provisions for such things as accommodating dietary
 restrictions f-r vegetarians (important to the Indian
 community), and entering prison cells at night. Public
 defenders are available, and the Fiji Red Cross has access to
 prisoners.
 In the past year there have been several reports in the local
 media regarding the maltreatment of prisoners by prison
 employees. The charges have been investigated by the
 government and in at least one instance a prison guard was
 dismissed. These incidents appear to be isolated cases of
 corporal abuse and do not imply the tacit approval of such
 behavior by the Government.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Fiji. Habeas corpus exists
 and is honored in practice, and there is no preventive
 detention. In addition to constitutional safeguards, the law
 establishes detailed rules to be followed by the police during
 arrests. A suspect may be held without charge following arrest
 for a maximum of 24 hours.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel, and
 counselors have free access to defendants. Consultations
 between counselors and defendants may be held in private.
 There is no harassment of defense counsel by the Government.
 Defendants are made fully aware of the charges brought against
 them, and they and their lawyers can inform themselves of the
 evidence on which charges are based. Fiji's courts are
 independent of executive or military control. There are no
 special courts to deal with security or political offences, and
 civilians are not tried by military courts. An ombudsman's
 office actively investigates complaints against the Government
 while protecting the identity of the complainant.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home, and warrants
 issued by a magistrate are required for officials to enter a
 private residence. Illegal entries of the home are neither
 practiced nor condoned.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed in the Fiji Constitution and are
 observed in practice. Although there is only one radio
 station, it is under the administration of an independent
 
 
 704
 broadcasting commission and provides balanced coverage of the
 news in three languages. The press is free and private, and
 there is no censorship or control of the press by the
 Government. However, Fiji has retained from the colonial
 administration an ordinance (dated 1949) which allows the
 Government to order a correction in the press if the Government
 believes its position has been misrepresented. This ordinance,
 though very seldom used, is resented by the press as it
 requires printing equal space and equal placement of the
 Government's statement. There is no interference with academic
 inquiry.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no impediments to assembly or to freedom of
 association, although an ordinance requires obtaining a permit
 one week in advance of any picketing or public demonstration.
 Fiji has an active trade union movement, recognized by the
 government, which jealously guards its rights to organize,
 strike, bargain collectively, and lobby. Fiji's 50 trade
 unions have about 45,000 members. Unions must give a 28-day
 notice of intent before going out on strike in the public
 sector. Fiji's largest trade confederation is associated with
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 recently sponsored that organization's first South Pacific
 regional meeting.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to practice their
 rites. There is no dominant religion in Fiji, nor is any
 singled out for discrimination.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens are free to travel. There are no
 restrictions on repatriation. Passport fees are not
 excessive. There are no refugees in Fiji, nor have any
 refugees applied for admittance. Persons with specific skills
 or who intend to make significant investments in Fiji's economy
 are eligible for residence permits, upon application to the
 government. Fiji's limited land area requires the government
 to examine these applications carefully to prevent
 overpopulation.
 e.' Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the immigrant
 Indian community. Election to the House of Representatives is
 on the basis of communal and national rolls. House elections
 are free and democratic, and a multitude of parties contest the
 seats. During Fiji's most recent national elections (July
 1982), 85.4 percent of the voting-age population participated
 and, until the votes were counted, the outcome of the election
 was uncertain. Members of the Senate are appointed by the Fiji
 Council of Chiefs, the Prime Minister, and the Leader of the
 Opposition.
 Charges of misconduct by both of the major parties contesting
 the election are the subject of an independent one-man
 commission of inquiry appointed by the Governor General.
 Fiji's court system has tried and, in some cases, convicted
 individuals charged with electoral fraud, including a member of
 the governing Alliance Party.
 
 
 705
 The Constitution states that *every person in Fiji is entitled
 to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, that
 is to say, the right whatever his race, place of origin,
 political opinions, color, creed, or sex..' There is no law
 that specifically prohibits discrimination by sex. Women are,
 nevertheless, active in all aspects of social, economic, and
 political life. Professional women are in the minority but are
 influential (for example, the opposition whip in parliament is
 a woman). As is true throughout the South Pacific, women in
 the rural areas play a traditional subordinate role, and tribal
 inheritance is usually based on a patriarchal system. Women,
 however, can and do inherit the status of chief (Fiji's third
 highest ranking chief is a woman). Among the Indian community,
 marriages are still often arranged, but there is growing
 awareness among the women, both Fijian and Indo-Fijian, of
 their rights and obligations to participate more actively in
 social and professional endeavors outside the home.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no such allegations against the Fiji Government
 or of any requests for investigations. Fiji is a member of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission. Fiji's ombudsman
 investigates complaints against the Government while
 maintaining the confidentiality of his relationship with the
 client. A free, independent, and competitive press also serves
 as a watchdog for human rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Fiji's economy is divided between a subsistence agricultural
 sector and a cash-based economy, the former characteristic of
 the outlying islands and the latter typical of the group's two
 main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The per capita Gross
 National Product of Fiji is relatively high for a developing
 nation at $1848. Fiji seeks to distribute economic
 opportunities through regional planning and economic
 incentives, not by penalizing private industry. Private
 enterprise is encouraged -- as is foreign investment -- and the
 government recently created an Economic Development Board
 designed to assist private, domestic, and foreign investors
 develop their projects.
 Within the limits of its resources, Fiji attempts to meet its
 people's social and economic needs on a non-discriminatory
 basis. The Government neither encourages nor condones sexual,
 racial, or religious discrimination. Property may be owned
 individually or in association with others, and that right is
 protected by law.
 Health care has been expanded to cover as many of the outlying
 islands as possible, with an emphasis on preventive medicine.
 Reflecting this expansion of medical services, life expectancy
 at birth has risen seven years in the past two decades to 71.8
 years. Fiji's infant mortality rate is 36.6 per 1,000 live
 births and its population growth rate is 2.4 percent. In the
 last decade the percentage of the total population with access
 to safe water rose dramatically from 47 to 69 percent, and in
 rural areas the percentage of persons with access to safe water
 more than quadrupled, rising from 15 to 62 percent. Fiji's
 rich soil and tropical climate combine to give its people a
 relatively adequate diet. Today the typical Pijian citizen has
 immediately available 99 percent of his nutritional
 
 
 706
 requirements, up five percent from the figure in 1960. These
 figures do not reflect the composition of the diet, which tends
 to be heavy in starches due to the prominent role root crop
 farming plays in traditional agriculture.
 Three-quarter-s of Fiji's population can-read and write, and
 almost every Fiji citizen is to some degree bilingual in
 English and either Fijian or Hindustani. The Government is
 seeking to provide free primary education and virtually all
 children of this age group are enrolled in school, as are 90
 percent of secondary school-age children. World Bank
 statistics on education in Fiji reveal no discrimination
 between sexes with regard to access to education.
 Fiji's.per capita GNP has risen 400 percent since 1960. As is
 frequently the case, however, the distribution of the nation's
 wealth is uneven and skewed in favor of urban centers. To
 remedy this, Fiji's most recent development plan calls for
 increased attention to rural development problems and the
 commitment of resources to improve housing, nutrition, health
 services, and education in the rural areas. Furthermore,
 government support for opening new areas of agricultural
 development, especially cane farming and pine growing projects,
 has provided economic incentives to the rural population.
