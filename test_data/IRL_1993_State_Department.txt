 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of or-
 derly transfer of power. Individual liberties and civil rights are protected by the
 1937 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive governments have had
 to deal with the spillover into the Republic of terrorist violence from Northern Ire.
 land. That violence led authorities to adopt legislation in 1984 granting the police
 increased powers to detain and interrogate those suspected of acts of terrorism. Dur-
 ing 1993 officials continued to show restraint in exercising these powers.
 The economy, based largely on free enterprise, has grown rapidly as a result of
 long-term policies of industrialization and diversification which are agreed upon
 among the Government, the labor unions, and the business community. The econ-
 omy performed well in 1993; exports were strong and the budget deficit was re.
 duced. However, the rate of unemployment was 22 percent.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance to the observance
 and maintenance of human rights. Sigificant discrimination against women contin-
 ued in 1993, although attitudes are changing and legislation seeking to address the
 problem was introduced.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the past, politically motivated
 killings occurred in Ireland as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland. In
 these cases, such groups as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) or the Irish
 National Liberation Army (INLA) usually claimed responsibility. The Government
 used the full force of law to pursue and prosecute such cases wherever possible. No
 political or other extr audicial killings were reported in the Republic in 1993.
 b. _Disappearance.-Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandes-
 tine detention by the authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment are prohibited by laws
 which are observed in practice.
 Efforts were made to ameliorate the problem of prison overcrowding, but it contin-
 ues to have an adverse impact on the psychological well-being of detainees. The
 Irish Council on Civil Liberties noted that prisoners in Ireland have a high suicide
 rate compared to those in England and Wales; that Ireland's largest prison,
 Mountjoy Jail, has no sanitation facilities in the cells; that there is no separate,
 suitable prison for women nor provision of separate secure units for young people,
 resulting in 14- and 15-year-olds being mixed in with the regular adult population;
 and that prison conditions are unacceptable for prisoners suffering from the human
 immunodeficiency virus ( HIV).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that a person
 shall be deprived of personal liberty only in accordance with the law. This is re-
 spected in practice. The Constitution also provides for a judicial determination of
 the legality of a person's detention and requires that the arresting authorities make
 written explanation to the court about the person concerned.
 The use of short-term detention without charges being brought is restricted. It is
 ermitted for a maximum of 48 hours in cases covered by the Offenses Against the
 ate Act of 1939, legislation designed to "prevent actions and conduct calculated
 to undermine public order and the authority of the State." This leislation, reac-
 tivated in 1972, was broadened to include other "scheduled offenses against peace
 and order. The police may arrest and detain for questioning anyone suspected of any
 terrorist offense involving firearms, explosives, membership in an unlawful organi-
 zation, or malicious damage to property. After the 48-hour period, the person must
 be brought before a magistrate, presented with written charges, and given legal rep-
 resentation.
 The omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gave the police increased powers of de-
 tention for interrogation. It took effect in 1987 after implementation of the compan-
 ion Complaints Procedure. The Act gave the police (garda) the authority to detain
 for up to 12 hours a person under reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime.
 Neither incommunicado detention nor exile is used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Fair public trial is provided for by the Constitu-
 tion and respected in practice. A defendant has the right to legal counsel. The courts
 are independent, and jury trial is the norm. There is provision for free legal aid and
 appeal against conviction or sentence. The Constitution provides, however, for the
 creation of "special courts" to deal with cases in which the "ordinary courts are inad-
 equate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of pub-
 lic peace and order." The Offenses Against the State Act formally authorized such
 courts in instances of offenses against national security, particularly cases of politi-
 cal violence perpetrated by terrorist groups likely to intimidate regular juries. Rath-
 er than having juries, these courts have panels of judges, each consisting of an un-
 even number not less than three. Their verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evi-
 dence generally are similar to those of regular courts, except that the sworn state-
 ment of a police Chief Superintendent that the accused is a member of an illegal
 organization is considered prima facie evidence of such membership. Court sessions
 are usually public but may exclude certain persons, other than genuine press rep-
 resentatives. There were 12 special court trials, and 12 convictions, through the end
 of October.
 In an effort to provide adequate legal assistance for those unable to afford law-
 yers, the 1994 budget increases from $3,018,800 (2,000,000 Irish pounds) to almost
 $7,547,000 (5,000,000 Irish pounds) funding for the Legal Aid Board, which provides
 legal assistance to the indigent. Part of the increase is to be used to establish new
 law centers and to enable the 16 full-time and 19 part-time centers to provide im-
 proved services to their clients.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Some
 Irish laws, such as the prohibition of divorce, reflect the point of view of the major-
 
 
 923
 ity of the population. The area of family law-including the rights of illegitimate
 children-is the subject of current debate in which minority religious communities
 have taken a vocal and active role.
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the inviolability of per-
 sonal privacy, family, and home is affirmed by the Supreme Court and generally ob-
 served. The Constitution, however, provides that the State shall enact no law "pro-
 viding for the grant of the dissolution of marriage." A proposal to amend the Con-
 stitution to permit divorce in limited circ-umstances was overwhelmingly defeated in
 a 1986 nationwide referendum. In the same year, the European Court of Human
 Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorce is not a breach of the European Conven-
 tion on Human Rights, to which Ireland is a party. The Government, which as-
 sumed office in January 1993, has pledged to hold another referendum on divorce
 in 1994. It announced plans to introduce legislation safeguarding the economic
 rights of women in marriage before holding the referendum, and in this connection
 the Parliament passed a "matrimonial homes" bill providing for joint ownership of
 the principal residence and furnishings. However, on January 24, 1994, the Su-
 preme Court found the bill unconstitutional.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for by the Con-
 stitution and generally respected in practice. Publication or utterance of n-las-
 phemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense punishable by law. In practice
 this law is directed against pornographic material. Convictions result in sentences
 requiring fines.
 The state-owned radio and television network, on the basis of constitutional provi-
 sions dealing with public order and the authority of the State, has denied airtime
 to members of certain listed political organizations, including Provisional Sinn Fein,
 the legal political front of the illegal Provisional IRA. In 1982, the Irish Supreme
 Court upheld the constitutionality of this policy. Political parties not on the list are
 given access both to publicly owned radio and television facilities and to major inde-
 pendent daily newspapers and criticism of the Gove:nment in such media flourishes.
 A provision of the 1960 Broadcasting Act prohibiting broadcasts on radio or tele-
 vision of Sinn Fein representatives wrs not recertified by the Government upon its
 expiration on January 19, 1994. The Supreme Court had earlier ruled that radio
 and television networks could not prohibit the "nonpolitical" appearance of someone
 simply by virtue of incidental membership in Sinn Fein.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for by the Constitution and respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations,
 such as the Provisional IRA and INLA, however, rere illegal, and membership in
 them is an offense against national security punishable by a maximum prison sen-
 tence of 7 years. Political parties or groups associated with such organizations, such
 as Sinn Fein, are not proscribed, although some of their freedoms may be restricted,
 as described in Section 2.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The Con-
 stitution provides for freedom of re igion, and there are no restrictions upon freedom
 of worship.
 d. Freedorr of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within the country, as well as freedom
 to engage in ioreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation. Irish authorities
 haveaccepted asylum seekers only on a limited basis and apply international defini-
 tions to those who claim refugee status. Some applicants for asylum have been held
 in detention for varying lengths of time- occasionally over a year-pending the ad-
 judication of their applications. Others, such as a group of 27 Kurdish men, women,
 and children, who asked for asylum at Shannon Airport in November 1992, were
 violently forced back onto their aircraft. These Kurds were denied access to a law-
 yer, an interpreter, or a representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Eyewitnesses reported that during the struggle police and immigration officials re-
 sorted to physical and verbal ahuse; many were injured. The Minister for Justice
 aiked the police for a full report, which at year's end was not yet available. The
 Alien Act of 1935 gave the Minister for Justice unlimited discretion in regard to
 treatment of all aliens, including those who qualify for refugee status under inter-
 national law. Although Ireland has ratified the 1951 Geneva Convention Pelating
 to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, their provisions cannot
 be implemented until they have been incorporated into dcmestic legislation.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the end of the Irish Civil War in 1923, periodic elections have resulted in
 the orderly transfer of political power. There are several political parties, and inde-
 pendents may stand for election to either House of Parliament. The constitutional
 requirement that elections be held at least every 5 years has always been met. Ire-
 land uses a proportional votingsystem, and the secrecy of the ballot is fully safe-
 guarded. There is universal suffrage for those over 18 years of age. Only 20 of 166
 parliamentary deputies are women. Women participate in all departments of gov-
 ernment, but are underrepresented at senior levels. There are two women ministers
 and three women ministers of state.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Irish Council for Civil Liberties operates freely and without hindrance as the
 principal independent organization interested in domestic human rights issues.
 The Government has generally ignored efforts by prisoners' rights advocacy
 groups to improve conditions of detention: there was relatively little pressure on the
 Government to do anything; money to improve facilities significantly was lacking;
 and the popular attitude was that prisoners were criminals who deserved harsh
 treatment.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 A criminal law bill dealing with sexual offenses passed on July 7, inter alia, legal-
 ized homosexuality.
 Women.-Women are discriminated against in the areas of equal pay and pro-
 motion to senior positions in both the public and the private sectors and the provi-
 sion of child-care facilities. The Government pledged to implement the recommenda-
 tions of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, publicly released during
 the year. These recommendations include a requirement that at least 40 percent of
 all public appointees be women (see below). The Government created in early 1993
 a new department, Equality and Law Reform, for the purpose of legislating gender
 equality and the prohibition of all forms of discrimination. Women were overrepre-
 sented in the lower grades of the public service and underrepresented in the higher
 grades.
 The Antidiscrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of
 1977 sought to provide protection and redress against gender and pay discrimina-
 tion. The Employment Equality Agency monitors their operation. The number of
 cases has fallen in recent years, but progress in eliminating the differential in the
 key index of average hourly earnings in industry has been very modest. In 1993 the
 average hourly wage for women was 60 percent of what men received and their
 weekly earnings averaged 68 percent of men's weeklypay.
 Violence against women occurs, and while no one has systematically studied the
 extent of the problem, it is believed to be serious. The Rape Crisis Center had 5,009
 inquiries in 1992 about rape, sexual abuse, and child sexual abuse; 25 women who
 claimed to have been raped contacted the Center soon after the crime. Comparable
 figures for 1993 were not available. The Center estimated that 30 percent of rape
 victims report the crime to the police and that 10 percent of those (3 percent of the
 total) go to trial. In addition to rape and other sexual abuse, beatings of women and
 children are common; they are frequently related to alcohol abuse. A number of or-
 ganizations exist which function as lobbying groups on behalf of more effective legis-
 lation, prosecotion of those accused of these crimes, and protection for women. The
 media have expanded coverage of crimes against women. The Rape (Amendment)
 Act of 1990 criminalized rape within marriage and provided ror free legal advice to
 the victim. Women's groups are seeking the extension of this provision to that of
 actual legal representation, as well as increased counseling and other support serv-
 ices for the victims of rape and domestic violence.
 The Prime Minister established the Second Commission on the Status of Women
 in 1990 with the mandate to promote greater equality for women in all facets of
 Irish life. As priority objectives, the Commission identified child care, training and
 education, the development of employment opportunities, legal rights and protec-
 tion, and the appropriate funding of representative bodies and support services. At
 the Governments request, the Commission paid particular attention to the needs of
 the full-time homemaker (only a third of Irish women work outside the home). It
 was in this regard that the Commission obtained from the Government the promise
 of early introduction of legislation providing for automatic joint ownership of the
 family home.
 
 
 925
 The Council for the Status of Women, representing over 100 national women's or-
 ganizations, provides the central focus for pursuit of legislative and other reforms
 to end discrimination against women and to promote fuller participation by women
 in the social, economic, and political life of the country.
 Children.-The Status of Children Act of 1987 and the Child Care Act of 1991
 provide for governmental promotion of the welfare of children. However, there are
 no reliable statistics concerning the enforcement of these laws. In 1992 Ireland rati-
 fied the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. Despite the Convention's provi-
 sion that governments must make the principles and provisions of the Convention
 widely known, the Government had not done so by the end of 1993.
 Children born out of wedlock have the same rights as other children. The Status
 of Children Act abolished the main legal discrimination between the two categories.
 The terms "legitimate" and "illegitimate" may no longer be used in legislation.
 A 1991 seminar organized by the Youth Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
 Unions highlighted the issue of low pay and exploitation of young people still at-
 tending school and engaged in part-time or holiday work. A subsequent survey re-
 vealed that the rates of pay, as established by joint labor committees, were not
 being followed. On the average, female workers over 16 years of age were paid 90
 percent of males hourly rate; females under 16 were paid72 percent of males' rate.
 PeopLe with Disabilties.-'ew public or private buildings have facilities for the
 disabled. Public transport has none. The Dublin Bus Company plans to begin using
 five "low-bottom" buses in January 1994 as a first step in accommodating the dis-
 abled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike. The right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to refrain from
 joining. Antiunion actions before registration of a union are legally prohibited. The
 Industrial Relations Act of 1990 introduced limitations on piciketing but generally
 renewed legal guarantees of immunity to union members and officials for industrial
 actions with regard to terms or conditions of employment. Strikes in 1993 included
 a brief "wildcat" strike at Dublin Airport by Aer Lingua employees, a week-long
 Dublin bus drivers' strike, and a dental assistants' strike which lasted 4 days. The
 Employer-Labor Council mediated a settlement of the latter by offering tl'~e dental
 assistants the amount they wanted as a "special payment" rather than as a raise
 which would apply to all public sector employees.
 About 55 percent of workers in the private and public sectors are members of
 unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited from joining unions or striking,
 but they may form associations to represent them in matters of pay, working condi-
 tions, and general welfare.
 The right to strike is freely exercised in both the public and private sectors. The
 Industrial Relations Act of 1990 prohibits retribution against strikes and union
 leaders; the Government effectively enforces it through the Department of Enter-
 p rise and Employment. A 2-week strike by employees of the state-owned Eletricity
 Supply Board in the spring of 1990 led the Labor Relations Commission to draft a
 code of conduct for inlustrial relations in essential services. The Ministry of Enter-
 prise and Employment promulgated the code in July. Negotiations between business
 and labor on the code's implementation were in progress at year's end. There are
 no restrictions on civil liberties which affect unions.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents unions in beth the
 Republic and Northern Ireland, has 88 member unions with 678,800 members. Both
 the ICTU and the unaffiliated unions are independent of the Government and the
 political parties. Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and
 affiliate with international bodies. The ICTU is affiliated with the European Trade
 Union Confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. Legislation prohibits
 antiunion discrimination. The Anti-Discrimination in Pay Act of 1974 and the Em-
 ployment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment E uality Agency responsible
 for oversight of disputes over allegations of discrimination. If the Agency is unable
 resolve such disputes amicably, the Labor Court becomes responsible for doing so.
 The Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 requires employers guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, which took place in 1993 in the context of a national economic pact, Pro-
 dam tor Economic and Social Progress (PESP), negotiated by representatives of
 unions, employers, farmers, and the Government. The PESP included an agreement
 between the  ongress of Trade Unions and the Federation of Irish Employers estab-
 
 
 926
 lishing standard pay increases for the 3-year period of its duration. The agreement
 also provided for a one-time wage increase of up to 3 percent to be negotiated at
 local level during the second year of the PESP.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission
 which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to the Labor Court. The Labor Court, consisting
 of an employer representative, a trade union representative, and an independent
 chairman, may investigate trade union disputes, recommend terms of settlement,
 engage in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint committees to regulate condi-
 tions of employment and minimum rates of pay for workers in a given trade or in-
 dustry.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years with the written permission of the parents. Hours of employment are
 limited by law for those 15 years of age to 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.
 Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up to 9 hours per day and 40 hours
 per week. These provisions are effectively enforced by the Labor Department.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage legislation.
 However, some workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to specific
 industrial sectors, mainly those that tend to pay lower than average wages. Al-
 though the lowest of these minimum wage rates would not be sufficient to provide
 a decent living for a family of four, additional benefits, including subsidized housing
 and children's allowances, are available to low-income families. Working hours in
 the industrial sector are limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Over-
 time work is limited to 2 hours per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a
 year. As part of the National Economic Pact adopted in 1987, the standard work-
 week has been reduced to 39 hours. The Labor Department is responsible for enforc-
 ing four basic laws dealing with occupational safety that provide adequate and com-
 prehensive coverage. There were no significant complaints from either labor or man-
 agement in 1993 regarding enforcement of these laws.
