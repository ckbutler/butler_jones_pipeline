 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong, a small, densely populated British dependency, is a free society with
 legally protected rights. Its constitutional arrangements are defined by the Letters
 Patent and Royal Instructions. Executive powers are vested in a British Crown-np-
 pinted Governor who holds extensive authority. The judiciary is an independent
 adhering to English common law with certain variations. Fundamental rights
 ultimately rest on oversight by the British Parliament. In practice, however, Hong
 Kong largely controls its own internal affairs.
 In 1995 following 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks between the United Kingdom
 and the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Government implemented legis-
 lation abolishing all appointed seats in the ong Kong Legislative Council
 (LEGCO). In September all 60 LECCO seats were open to direct or indirect ballot-
 ing for the first time. An unprecedented number of independent and party-afilliated
 candidates entered the historic electoral contest. Overall, the elections were free and
 fair-only scattered complaints regarding voter registration and ballot counting
 were received.
 China has announced its intent to dissolve the 1995 LEGCO, district boards, and
 municipal councils in July 1997 when Hong Kong reverts to China, noting that it
 did not agree to the electoral rules adopted by the Hong Kong Government in 1994
 for election to these bodies. China further announced that a PrC-appeinted pre-
 paratory committee will decide how to form the first post-1997 LEGCO.
 A we-nrganized police force maintains public order and is under the firm control
 of civilian authorities. Some members of the police ommitted human rights abuses
 (see Section 1.c.).
 Hong Kong is a major regional and international trade and financial center. It is
 the prnci  ateway for trade and investment with China. The territory's free mar-
 ket economy operates on the basis of minimal government interference and a thriv-
 ing private sector. Per capita gross domestic product surpassed $21,000 in 1994 and
 continued to grow in 1995.

 Human rights activists, journalists, and concerned legislators criticized the Gov-
 ernment for oppsing major human rights initiatives, including the establishment
 of a human rights commission, antidiscrimination provisions in the law, and free-
 dom of information legislation. Human rights problems continued to include some
 instances of excessive use of force by the police, media self-censorship, limitations
 on citizens' ability to change their government, and violence and discrimination
 against women. In June the United Kingdom and China signed an agreement on
 establishing Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal after the 1997 transition, and
 LEGCO approved implementing legislation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial MUing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were at least four instances of death in police custody. The authorities de-
 termined that three were suicides; the fourth is under investigation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other extreme forms of abuse and stipulates punish-
 ment for those who break the law. Disciplinary action can range from dismissal to
 warnings. Criminal proceedings may be undertaken independently of the discipli-
 nary process of the police force. Allegations of excessive use of force are investigated
 by the Complaints Agast Police Offie, whose work is in turn monitored and re-
 viewed by the Police Complaints Council, a body comprised of members of the public
 appointed by the Governor. The Government, however, continued to resist public
 cas for   e creation of an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by
 police.
 Although excessive use of force by police is not widespread, there are occasional
 complaints of force being used to coerce information or confessions during police in-
 terrogations. Human rig ts monitors in Hong Kong are concerned that this may be
 a growing problem and have documented victims' complaints of beatings during in-
 terrogation and, in at least one case, the use of water torture in the 1994-95 period.
 In 1994 government officials reported 1,554 complaints against the police, of which
 only 2 were substantiated by the Police Complaints Council. Human rights groups
 contrast the relatively large number of complaints against the police with the very
 small number of cases substantiated by the Government to argue the need for re-
 vamping a system where the review process appears to favor the police.
 Although conditions vary among prisons, prison conditions generally conform to
 international standards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-British legal protections and common law
 traditions govern the process of arrest and detention and ensure substantial and ef-
 fective legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7Wal.-Hong Kong's judicial and legal systems are orga-
 nized according to principles of British constitutional law and legal precedent and
 feature, among other things, an independent judiciary and trial by jury. The law
 provides for the right to a fair public trial, and this is respected in practice. Accord-
 rag to the agreement signed by the United Kingdom and China in June, Hong
 Kong's Court of Final Appeal will be established formally on July 1, 1997. Incoming
 officials ("team designate") of the post-1997 Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
 gion (SAR) will be responsible for setting up the court and selecting judges. The
 agreement, thus, grants a principal role in the court's establishment and member-
 ship to the Hong Kong SAR government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally respects this right
 in practice. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (I CAC) is vested with
 powers that are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordi-
 nances governing ICAC deprived it of the independent authority to issue arrest or
 search warrants (it must now go to the courts), but it still operates on the assump-
 tion that any excessive, unexplainable assets held by civil servants are considered
 ill-gotten until proven otherwise.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There is a tradition of free speech and press
 as practiced in Great Britain. Numerous views and opinions, including those inde-
 pendent or critical of the British, Hong Kong, and Chinese Governments are aired
 in the mass media, in public forums, and by political groups. International media
 organizations operate freely. Several ordinances permit restrictions of the press, but
 
 
 1105
 
 they are rarely imposed. The Hong Kong Journalists Association continued to criti-
 cize the Government for not taking swift action to do away with these ordinances
 before 1997, warning that the post-June 1997 government might be more prone to
 invoke them.
 After intensive press coverage of violent demonstrations by Vietnamese boat peo-
 ple protesting their return to Vietnam in 1994, the Government changed procedures
 so that such transfers take place where it is difficult for the press to view the oper-
 ation. The media complained about this limitation on their ability to report.
 There are reliable indications that media seLf-censorship is a fact of life, particu-
 larly on issues considered to be sensitive to the PRC. Two local television stations
 decided against airing a documentary on the removal of transplant organs from exe-
 cuted prisoners after Chinese officials expressed strong criticism of the program and
 its producers. Journalists and human rights groups also criticized the release of car-
 toonist Larry Feign from the South China Morning Post (SCMP) staff following pub-
 lished cartoons lampooning PRC leaders. SCMP management explained Feign's re-
 lease as part of an overall staff drawdown, but many Hong Kong journalists--in-
 cluding some on the SCMP staff-view the decision as politically motivated. Accord-
 ing to poll results published in Februaiy by Hong Kong Universit's Social Sciences
 Research Center (SSRC), stjoualists believe that self-censorship remains a
 problem. A 1994 SSRC survey found that 88 percent of respondents believed that
 there was self-censorship in Hong Kong's media, with 57 percent indicating that
 self-censorship occurred where they worked.
 Journalists, human rights groups, and others have criticized the PRC for taking
 retaliatory action against Hong ong businessman Jimmy Lai's business interests
 in China. Lai's daily newspaper Apple, which began publishing in June 1995, and
 Next magazine, which began publishing in 1990, have been critical of China. A
 Hong Kong-based reporter and a photographer working for Next magazine were de-
 tained for several days in Fujian during China's missile tests near the Taiwan coast.
 China also refused journalists* credentials to reporters working for Apple.
 The fate of Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang, arrested in 1994 and sentenced to 12
 years' imprisonment in China for stealing state financial secrets" continues to have
 a chiling effect on his colleagues and others in Hong Kong. On Laptember 27, there
 was a demonstration at the Hong Kong offices of Xinhua news agency to protest his
 continued imprisonment in China. The filming of demonstrators by the Hong Kong
 police raied criticism in the local press. Journalists report that such self-censorship
 is also increasing for commercial reasons, as Hong Kon.5-based media organizations
 which are expanding their ties to China seek to avoid ofiending the Chinese Govern-
 ment. Following PRC    objections to a Hong Kong government proposal to
 "corporatize" the government-owned Radio Television Hong Kong, there have been
 no further efforts by the Government to do so.
 Media and general public access to government information is strictly controlled.
 The Governm'3t opposed freedom of information legislation proposed by LEGCO
 members and instead decided that an administrative code of practice on access to
 government information should be developed. Under the code, civil servants would
 be required to provide information held by the Government, unless there are valid
 reasons not to do so. A pilot scheme to test the legal, practical, and resource i.moplica-
 tions arising from the code began in March. By the end of 1996, the code will be
 extended to the entire Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are practiced
 without significant hindrance, although the amended Societies Ordinance requires
 people to notify the Societies Officer of the formation of a society. The Societies Offi-
 cer may recommend to the Secret ary for Security prohibition of the operation or con-
 tinued operation of a society if he reasonably believes that it ma lbe prejudicial to
 the security of Hong Kong, or to public safety or public order. -While the provision
 in the Ordinance allowing the Government to refuse to register an organization "in-
 compatible with peace, welfare, or good order," or affiliated with a political organiza-
 tion abroad was repealed in 1992, Ch-Oina's National People's Congress included simi-
 lar language in the Basic Law which will become effective in 1997.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Hong Kong Bill of Rights includes a provision pro-
 hibiting discrimination on the basis of religion. Government policy and general prac-
 tice ensure freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel documents are obtainable freely and easily, subject to neither
 arbitrary nor discriminatory practices. There is freedom of movement within Hong
 Kong.
 Hong Kong has never refused to accept nor pushed off Vietnamese boat people.
 Refugee status was automatically accorded them prior to June 1988. However, since
 then asylum seekers have been screened to determine their status and held in pris-
 
 
 1106
 on-like detention centers awaiting resettlement in other countries or repatriation to
 Vietnam. In fiscal year 1995, 2,566 persons took advantage of resettlement incen-
 tives offered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 the Hong Kong Government and repatriated voluntarily to Vietnam. These incen-
 tives were offered only until the end of 1995. On May 12, 1992, the Hong Kong Gov-
 ernment reached agreement with Vietnamese authorities on mandatory repatriation
 (the "Orderly Return Program") of those who have been denied asylum. There were
 860 people repatriated under the Orderly Return Program in 1994. Under the pro-
 gram, people are randomly chosen from the nonrefugee camp population and moved
 to a separate location several days before a flight's scheduled departure. Govern-
 ment security officers then escort all those being mandatorily returned on to the air-
 plane and accompany the flight to Vietnam.
 Some 23,000 people remain in Hong Kong camps, of whom about 1,500 are
 screened-in as refugees but who, for reasons of heaith or criminal acts, have not
 been resettled.
 Voluntary repatriation to Vietnam declined dramatically in the spring of 1995 in
 the wake of both US. congressional and executive branch proposals that hold out
 the promise for resettlement of additional Vietnamese in the United States. Hong
 Kong authorities continue to encounter physical resistance in the camps when at-
 tempting to remove those chosen for the Orderly Return Program flights. There has
 been no recurrence of the level of violence seen in the April 1994 incident at White-
 head Detention Center. Violence that has occurred has taken the form of rock
 throwing and assaults with homemade weapons.
 The number of illegal Chinese immigrants has been estimated by the Hong Kong
 Government to be 10,000. Police sources state that the figure is much higher and
 the press estimates the number to be 24,000. The Government continues to deport
 illegal Chinese immigrants back to the PRC at the rate of approximately 150 per
 day. Only in those rare instances in which a person qualifies as a refugee under
 the terms of the International Agreement on the Status of Refugees is asylum af-
 forded. There are currently 240 ex-China Vietnamese illegal immigrants in Hong
 Kong. The repatriation of these ethnic Vietnamese, who fled from China to Hong
 Kong, continued in 1995, generally without incident.
 A well-known Chinese labor organizer, Han Donfang, remains in Hong Kong. Chi-
 nese government authorities continued to refuse him entry into China as they have
 ever since his expulsion from China in August 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Hong Kong is a free society, with most individual freedoms and rights protected
 by law and custom. Although the Government has moved to democratize district and
 municipal boards and LEGCO, citizens of the territory do not have the right to
 change the government. The Governor is a ppointed by and serves at the pleasure
 of the Crown. He is advised on policy by the executive council which he appoints.
 The LEGCO enacts and funds legislation and also debates policy and questions
 the administration. Although LEGCO's power to initiate legislation is limited (all
 bills with budgetary implications, for example, must be approved by the Govern-
 ment before introduction), it has become increasingly assertive. The Governor has
 ultimate control of the administration of Hong Kong but, by convention, rarely exer-
 cises his full powers. In practice, decisions are reached through consensus. Political
 parties and independent candidates are free to contest seats in free and fair elec-
 tions. Representative government employing universal franchise exists at the local
 district board level.
 All district and municipal board members were elected in 1994 and 1995, respec-
 tively. In 1995 the Government implemented legislation which abolished all ap-
 pointed seats in LEGCO. In September 920,000 voters, by direct or indirect ballot-
 ing, selected members to fill these seats. Candidates of all political persuasions par-
 ticipated in free and fair elections, although there were scattered complaints regard-
 ing voter registration and ballot counting in a few areas. Out of a total of 60 seats,
 there were 20 geographical constituency seats directly elected, 10 seats selected by
 an election committee comprised of 283 locally elected officials, 9 seats selected by
 broad functional (occupational) constituencies, and 21 seats elected by more narrow
 functional groupings which disproportionately represent the economic and profes-
 sional elites and violates the concept of one person-one vote, since voters in func-
 tional constituencies may vote both in a functional and geographic constituency. Al-
 though the elections did not result in a fully representative, democratically elected
 government, they significantly increased voters' ability to influence government de-
 cisionmaking throug a greater number of elected representatives. The PRC has
 
 
 1107
 
 stated that it does not recognize the validity of the September LEGCO elections, and
 that the present LEGCO will "end/terminate" on June 30, 1997.
 The United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), in reviewing the appli-
 cation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to Hong
 Kong, stated that the current electoral system does not conform to the Covenant.
 The November 3, 1995 UNHRC report also criticized the structure of LEGCO, as
 changed under the recent electoral reforms, as still giving "undue weight to the
 views of the business community" and discriminating among voters "on the basis
 of property and functions." The UNHRC, while noting the United Kingdom's res-
 ervation to the ICCPR on the application of universal suffrage in Hong Kong, took
 the view that "once an elected legislative council is established, its election must
 conform" to the ICCPR's call for direct popular election of all seats. The Hong Kong
 Court of Appeal on November 24, 1995, ruled against two Hong Kong plaintiffs who
 challenged the Government on the legality of LEGCO functional constituencies
 under the terms of the Letters Patent and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.
 The Government is continuing efforts to replace Hong Kong Chinese in senior gov-
 ernment positions and has publicly committed to fill all "principal official" posts
 with local officers before 1997. As of April 1995, 70 percent of the Governments top
 directorate-level jobs and 80 percent of administrative and other senior management
 ositions were filled by local staff. Expatriates remaiin key positions in the legal
 department and the judiciary where localization progress has been slower, with 64
 percent of the legal and 46 percent of judiciary officer positions currently localized.
 n addition, localization of mid-to-upper ranks of the police force has been slow. The
 Government's efforts to add Chinese to the Government were opposed by a group
 of expatriate government workers who undertook legal action against the Govern-
 ment, claiming they were being discriminated against under the provisions of the
 Hong Kong B    of ights. TheHong Kong High Court on October 31 ruled on the
 case, taking the position that most of the Government's localization arrangements
 were lawful.
 Women are playing a greater role in politics, with greater numbers running for
 public office in 1994 and 1995 than ever before. In 1995 women comprised 12 per-
 cent of LEGCO, 13 percent of the top Government directorate level posts, and 37
 percent of Government administrative officers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social,
 and Cultural Rights currently applies to Hong Kong through the United Kingdom.
 China has agreed to extend these agreements to Hong Kong beyond 1997, although
 it has indicated that it does not consider itself to be obligated to implement the re-
 quirements under the agreements since China is not a signatory. In October the
 PRC-appointed Preliminary Working Committee's legal subrup issued a statement
 which called for striking key sections from Hong  ong  Bill of Rights Ordinance
 (BOR), including those articles which incorporate the International Convention on
 Civil and Political Rights into Hong Kong law. The subgroup also recommended that
 other public security ordinances amended to conform to the BOR be changed to re-
 store the Government's original prerogatives under these laws. The legal subgroup's
 statement was a recommendation, and to date no action has been taken to ariend
 any section of the Bill of Rights.
 The UNHCR and nongovernmental human rights organizations have full access
 to Hong Kong's camps for Vietnamese beat people.
 Although the Government to date has interposed no official barriers to the forma-
 tion of local human rights groups, some human rights activists believe that provi-
 sions of the Societies Ordinance provide the legal means whereby a future govern-
 ment could do so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In 1994 some LEGCO members supported the introduction of antidiscrimination
 measures addressing the problems of sex, age, race, and age discrimination. The
 Government opposed the legislation and instead introduced its own bills, both
 adopted in 1995, banning discrimination on the basis of sex and disability.
 The Chinese language has equal status with English in many government oper-
 ations except in judicial proceedings. To help remedy the situation in judicial pro-
 ceedings, the Government has increased the number of directorate officers in the
 Legal Aid Department proficient in Chinese from three (out of nine) to seven and
 initiated a pilot scheme for simultaneous interpretation in some court proceedings.
 
 
 1108
 Women.-Violence and discrimination against women remain significant problems
 in Hong Kong society. The only legislation to protect the rights of battered women
 is the 1987 Domestic Violence Ordinance, which enables a woman to seek a 3-month
 injunction against her husband which may be extended to 6 months. In addition,
 domestic violence may be prosecuted as common assault under existing criminal
 statutes. The Government enforces these laws and prosecutes violators. It also funds
 programs and services to stem domestic violence such as family life education coun-
 seling, a hotline service operated by the Social Welfare Department and nongovern-
 mental organizations, 53 family service centers, 2 shelters for women and children,
 temporary housing, legal aid, and child protective services. Many women, however,
 do not seek help when they have been victims of violence, and many instances of
 domestic violence are not reported because of cultural factors and the Government's
 failure to publicize information about the assistance and resources available. Wom-
 en's action groups continue to press for better legal and government protection for
 battered wives.
 Women face discrimination in areas of employment, salary, welfare, inheritance,
 and promotion (see Section 6.e.). Discrimination on the basis of age, particularly in
 hiring practices, is openly practiced, and is not prohibited by law.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education, medical
 care, and protective services. The Government supports child welfare programs in-
 cluding custody, protection, day care, foster care, shelters, and small group homes.
 Assistance is also provided to families. Child abuse and exploitation are not wide-
 spread problems in Hong Kong. Child labor is not a serious problem. The Govern-
 ment remains committed to the human rights and welfare of children. The Inter-
 national Covenant on the Rights of the Child was extended to Hong Kong by the
 United Kingdom in 1994. In 1995 amendments to the law were adopted by LEGCO
 making it easier for abused children to give evidence in court. Legal penalties for
 ill-treatment or neglect of minors were also substantially increased.
 People With Disabilities.-Organizations and individuals representing the inter-
 ests of the disabled claim that discrimination against the physically and mentally
 disabled exists in employment, education, and the provision of some state services.
 Access to public buildings and transportation remain problems for the physically
 disabled. Advocacy groups have urged the Government to do more to encourage
 greater public tolerance of the mentally disabled. The Government has been respon-
 sive, undertaking programs aimed at fostering greater public acceptance of the dis-
 abled. In 1995 LEGCO passed the Antidiscrimination Law to protect the rights of
 the disabled. This Law calls for changes to the building ordinance to improve build-
 ing access for the disabled and sanctions for those who discriminate against the dis-
 abled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic   Minorities.-Racial discrimination  against Filipino
 women, 140,000 of whom work under contract in Hong Kong, has been the focus
 of news reports. Also, despite official reassurance that Philippine workers would be
 welcome after 1997, reports indicate that employers of large numbers of Filipinos-
 hotels and the airport authority-are beginning to employ PRC Chinese instead.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association and the right of workers to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing are provided for by law. Trade
 unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic pre-
 condition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same oc-
 cupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 During 1994, 25 new trade unions were registered. Approximately 562,285 workers
 (or about 21 percent) out of a total labor force of 3 million belong to the 548 reg-
 istered unions, most of which belong to 1 of 3 major trade union federations.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. Even though the Employment Ordinance recognizes
 the right to strike, in practice most workers must sign employment contracts which
 typically state that walking off the * b is a breach of contract and can lead to sum-
 mary dismissal. The Employment Ordinance also permits firms to discharge or de-
 duct wages from staff who are absent on account of a labor dispute.
 Hong Kong labor unions may form federations, confederations, and affiliate with
 international bodies. Any affiliation with foreign labor unions requires the consent
 of the Government. No application for such affiliation has so far been refused. Hong
 Kong's two leading labor federations, the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions
 and the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, were active participants in the
 territory's September LEGCO elections.
 
 
 1109
 As a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong is not a member in
 its own right of the International Labor Organization (ILO). The United Kingdom
 makes declarations on behalf of Hong Kong concerning the latter's obligations re-
 garding the various ILO conventions. To date, Hong Kong has implemented provi-
 sions applying 49 conventions. In the Basic Law, China undertook to continue to
 adhere to these conventions after 1997.
 b. The Right to Oranize and Bargain Collectively.-The ILO convention on the
 right to organize andbargan collectively has been applied to Hong Kong without
 modification since 1975. This convention does not obligate the Government to im-
 pcse collective bargaining by statute. There are no laws which stipulate collective
 a aining on a mandatory basis. Wage rates in a few trades like tailoring and car-
 pentry are now determined collectively in accordance with established trade prac-
 tices and customs rather than as a statutory mechanism.
 In practice, collective bargaining is not widely practiced. Unions generally are not
 powerful enough to force management to engage in collective bargaining. The Gov-
 ernment does not enourage it, since the Government itself does not engage in col-
 lective bargaining with civil mervants' unions but merely "consults" with them. Free
 conciliation services are afforded by the Labor Relations Division of the Department
 of Labor (DOL) to employers and employees involved in disputes which may involve
 statutory benefits andprotion in employment as well as arrears of wages, wages
 instead of notice, and severance pa.  e DOL assists employers and employees in
 dispute to reach amicable settlement, but does not have the authority to impose a
 solution. The DOL is not required by law to allow unions to represent employees
 in these procedings, although it takes a positive attitude towards the participation
 by trade unions in dispute negotiations. The Labor Tribunal Ordinance provides
 that an officer of a registered trade union, who is authorized in writingby a claim-
 ant or defendant to appear as his representative, has the right of audience in the
 Labor Tribunal.
 The law protects workers against antiunion discrimination. Employees who allege
 such discrimination have the right to have their cases heard by the DOL's Labor
 Relations Division. Violation of the antiunion discrimination provisions under the
 Empoyment Ordinance is a criminal offense carrying a maximum fine of $2,564.
 However, employers are not required to reinstate or compensate an employee.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions is highly critical of Hong
 Kong labor legislation's failure to protect the right to strike, and for its provisions
 allowing dismissals and disciplinary action against striking trade unionists. Individ-
 ual labor claims are adjudicated by the Labor Tribunal, a part of the judicial
 branch, which is supposed to provide quick and inexpensive mahinery for resolving
 certain types of disputes. The Tribunal complements the conciliation service pro-
 vided by the Labor Relations Division. Union leaders complain, however, that the
 Tribunal takes too lon an average of 130 days-to hear workers' cases. Labor
 unions and legislators also are concerned about government plans to allow increases
 in imported labor, fearing downward pressure on wages. There are few protections
 for almost 152,000 Filipino, Thai, and Indonesian domestic workers who face depor-
 tation if dismissed by their employers and are thus vulnerable to abuse.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Com ulsory Labor.-Existing labor legislation prohibits
 forced labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment of Children Reg-
 ulations prohibit employment of children under age 15 in any industrial establish-
 ment. Cldren ages 13 and 14 may be employed in certain nonindustrial establish-
 ments, subject to conditions aimed at ensuring a minimum of 9 years' education and
 protecting their safety, health, and welfare. During 1995 the Government continued
 inspections to safeguard against the employment of children. As in past years, few
 violations were found.
 de. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage except for foreign
 omestic workers. In 1995 the minimum   wage for such workers was US$480
 (HK$3,750) a month. ecause the law requires employers of domestic labor to pro-
 vide such workers with housing, worker's compensation insurance, and meals or a
 meal allowance, this wage is sufficient to provide a worker with a decent standard
 of living.
 Aside from a small number of trades and industries where a uniform wage struc-
 ture exists, wage levels are customarily fxed by individual agreement between em-
 ployer and employee and are determined by supply and demand. Despite higher un-
 employment (the unemployment rate in the Fall was 3.5 percent), wage increases
 were given to most workers. Many employees also receive a year-end bonus of a
 monthis pay or more. Some employers in the manufacturing sector provide workers
 
 
 1110
 
 with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment, and free or subsidized
 transport.
 There are no legal restrictions on hours of work for men. The Women and Young
 Persons (Industry) Regulations under the Employment Ordinance control hours and
 conditions of work for women and for young people age 15 to 17. Work hours for
 young people are limited to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 am. and 11 p.m.
 Women are permitted to work only between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m; however, this provi-
 sion is very loosely enforced for persons age 16 or over. Overtime is restricted to
 2 hours per day and 200 days per year for women and is prohibited for all persons
 under age 18 in industrial establishments. The regulations also prohibit women and
 young persons from working underground or, with the exception of males age 16
 and 17, in dangerous trades. The Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections
 to enforce compliance with these regulations. During 1994 there were 8,102 prosecu-
 tions for breaches of various ordinances and regulations. Fines totaling $3.8 million
 were imposed. The employment of underage workers is generally not a serious prob-
 lem.
 The DOL Factory Inspectorate Department (FID) sets basic occupational safety
 and health standards, provides education and publicity, and follows up with enforce-
 ment and inspection in accordance with the Factories and Industrial Undertakings
 Ordinance and subsidiary regulations. The Inspectorate pays particular attention to
 safety in high-risk areas of factories and construction sites, with routine visits to
 such sites. During 1994, 78,621 inspections including 5,733 accident investigations
 were conducted. DOL officials acknowledged that accidents in construction and serv-
 ice sectors remain very high. Apart from routine inspections, the FID also expanded
 special inspections. During these campaigns 23,166 factories, 318 catering establish-
 ments, and 1,295 construction sites were inspected, resulting in 1,571 summons.
 Fines were varied, depending on the seriousness of the violation. There is continued
 need for stronger government enforcement and inspection efforts.
 As part of a complementary effort, the DOL Occupational Health Division inves-
 tigates claims of occupational diseases and injuries at work, conducts environmental
 testing in the workplace, and provides medical examinations to employees in occu-
 pations that involve the handling of hazardous materials. The small number of in-
 spectors-about 200-and the inability of workers to elect their own safety rep-
 resentatives weaken the enforcement of safety and health standards at the work-
 place. There is no specific legal prvision allowing workers to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
