 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state in which the
 Bulgarian Communist Party, dominated since 1954 by Todor
 Zhivkov, holds a monopoly of power and exercises pervasive
 control over political, economic, social, and cultural
 activities. A small second party, totally subservient to the
 Communist party, is represented in the Government and National
 Assembly; no other political parties are tolerated.
 An omnipresent network of state security police and militia
 (uniformed national police) deters or suppresses open
 expressions of opposition to the regime or its policies.
 Military border guards and "internal troops" augment internal
 control.
 All production and commercial facilities, except for small
 private agricultural plots and small-scale businesses that can
 be operated by an individual, family, or a cooperative without
 hired labor, are owned by the State. The party-controlled
 trade unions are used as a vehicle for mobilizing the work
 force to achieve the regime's goals.
 The human rights situation in Bulgaria in 1988 improved
 marginally in some areas, deteriorated in others, and
 continued to be characterized by harsh repression. The
 Bulgarian Constitution specifies the "right to work" but
 identifies such basic human rights as freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and religion, as rights "enjoyed" by the
 citizenry due to "guaranteed" material conditions under the
 Socialist system. Any exercise of these freedoms in a manner
 the Communist Party deems unacceptable is prohibited and
 punishe .
 The limited relaxation of media control seen in 1987 was
 curtailed in 1988. Promised liberalization of passport laws
 did not materialize, although, the number of Bulgarians allowed
 to travel to the West continued to increase. The small number
 of unresolved family reunification cases was also further
 reduced. The Government refused, however, to recognize the
 country's first independent human rights organization, founded
 in January, and harassed, jailed, and sent its members into
 internal and external exile.
 The Government denies the existence of the Turkish minority,
 which comprises 10 percent of the population, and seeks to
 eradicate its cultural identity. Beginning in 1984, the
 Government has compelled members of the minority to change
 their Turkish given and family names to Bulgarian names,
 banned the use of the Turkish language in any public place
 including mosques, and banned the traditional forms of dress
 and some religious practices, such as circumcision. It closed
 many mosques and abolished separate Muslim cemeteries. It has
 forbidden the importation of Korans and the singing and
 playing of Turkish songs even at weddings. It continued in
 1988 the forcible resettlement-of ethnic Turkish families and
 communities in order to disperse them throughout Bulgaria.
 However, systematic job discrimination against ethnic Turks
 cannot be substantiated.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible reports detail hunger, beatings, and degrading
 treatment of prisoners in Bulgaria. Torture does not seem to
 be practiced systematically, although according to a 1988
 letter from human rights activist Tseko Tsekov, published by
 Helsinki Watch, the dentist in Stara Zagora prison is known as
 "the mechanic" and reportedly removed healthy teeth from
 political prisoners in 1985. That same letter catalogued a
 variety of prison abuses witnessed by Tsekov during his
 imprisonment from 1984-85. Although political prisoners are
 in a separate wing in Stara Zagora, elsewhere they are
 quartered with common criminals, drug addicts, and others at
 whose hands they suffer abuse. In April 1985, Tsekov and
 another prisoner shared a cell with the mentally ill. When he
 was initially arrested in 1984, Tsekov was placed in section
 seven of Sofia Central Prison, where criminals condemned to
 death are held. In 1985, while doing prison work, he was
 attacked by another prisoner with a knife.
 Brutal beatings by guards are apparently frequent. Tsekov was
 denied medical treatment, refused fresh water, and kept in
 extreme darkness or light. Prisoners are exposed to the
 elements throughout the year; they are denied water during the
 summer heat and kept in unheated prison cells with no glass in
 the windows during the winter. Outdoor exercise is minimal.
 Other well-informed sources also reported frequent beatings
 and hunger in prison. Some prisoners are apparently kept in
 solitary confinement for long stretches of time. Grigor Simon
 Bozhilov, one of the signatories of an "appeal" to the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting in
 Vienna in early 1987, who was sent into internal exile, became
 ill from the beatings and the cold.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Bulgarian citizens may be detained, tried, and punished for
 many actions which elsewhere are considered political, not
 criminal, in nature. Police interrogation, detention, and
 even arrest may result from unauthorized demonstrations,
 public criticism of the Government, or the mere act of
 entering or approaching a Western embassy.
 The principle of judicial determination of the legality of a
 person's detention exists in Bulgarian law, but it does not
 provide effective relief against state action. The judiciary
 is not independent of executive power, nor is it able to
 provide any effective check on executive actions. Although
 preliminary detention is limited theoretically to 10 days, and
 then only when the evidence appears sufficient to justify an
 
 
 993
 BULGARIA
 indictment, several cases are known of persons subjected to
 longer detention without charges being filed. Following
 arraignment, Bulgarian law permits detention for up to
 6 months before indictment. Under the criminal code, the
 accused must be informed of the charges, but sometimes this
 requirement is not observed. Credible sources indicate that a
 number of human rights activists were detained in 1988
 following a visit to an interned colleague.
 Persons may also be subject to a system of administrative
 control short of imprisonment, by which they are detained at
 their place of residence and required to appear frequently at
 the local police station. Article 39 of the Statutes of the
 People's Militia, under which a number of human rights
 activists are interned, authorizes the militia to place under
 administrative control or house arrest not only those who have
 engaged in criminal activities, but also those who have
 protested "against organs of power" or shown "antisocial
 manifestations." Reports indicate that activist Ilya Minev,
 under such "administrative detention" in his village of
 Septemvri, was required to report to the local militia three
 times a day. In September he was reportedly placed under
 house arrest.
 Another form of punishment and control is forced change of
 domicile or internal exile. A person's right to remain in his
 place of residence may be revoked, and he may be required to
 move far from family and familiar surroundings. Should exiles
 or persons under such administrative controls leave despite
 these prohibitions, they face possible imprisonment. Eduard
 Genov, arrested on April 6, was exiled to the remote village
 of Mikhalkovo for 2 years following his role in the formation
 of an independent human rights organization. In October,
 Genov and his family were expelled from Bulgaria.
 It is not possible to estimate reliably the number of persons
 subject to arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention, or
 summary exile in 1988. The exact number of Turkish detainees
 who may still be incarcerated or in internal exile as a result
 of the 1984-85 assimilation campaign is unknown. However,
 credible reports, including those documented by Amnesty
 International (AI) and Helsinki Watch, indicate that many
 ethnic Turks are still imprisoned or exiled.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, -see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to legal counsel, but
 only after preliminary investigations and indictment, a
 process that can last many weeks. When defense attorneys are
 provided, they often cooperate with the prosecution. In 1988
 authorities hampered a Bulgarian lawyer's efforts to get
 reinstated, following his disbarment for overly-energetic
 defense of a client prosecuted for political reasons. Some
 defense attorneys enjoy reputations for courage and honesty,
 despite pressures from the security apparatus.
 Special court procedures apply in cases involving state
 security. Trials in such cases, and in others with political
 implications, are not public. The number of such trials is
 not known. Taking into account also those captured while
 trying to escape across the country's borders and ethnic Turks
 detained during and since the name-change campaign, the number
 
 
 994
 BULGARIA
 of political prisoners is estimated at several thousand.
 Reports indicate that political prisoners sentenced under the
 first chapter of the penal code are imprisoned in Stara
 Zagora, which has a special "political" wing. Tseko Tsekov
 reported meeting 136 such prisoners there during 1985.
 Others, sentenced under the eighth chapter of the penal code
 for ostensible "administrative" offenses, are sent to the
 other 12 prisons in the country. Their number is unknown.
 The judicial system generally seeks to maintain a semblance of
 observing legal norms, but the courts sometimes apply statutes
 retroactively or extend them to cases of dubious
 applicability. The penal laws are codified, published, and
 readily available for reference, but numerous procedural and
 administrative regulations are not. Such regulations are
 frequently invoked in judicial proceedings, and the defendant
 has little opportunity to question the validity or
 applicability of the regulation in question.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government and Communist Party interfere with and regulate
 the private lives of citizens in many ways. The Constitution
 charges parents with the "obligation" of attending to their
 children's Communist education. Reliable sources indicate
 that in Kurdzali Turkish children aged 3 to 6 are required to
 live in nursery schools during the week and go home only on
 weekends in an effort to "Bulgarianize" them. The Islamic
 rite of male circumcision is effectively banned. There are
 strong pressures on all citizens to become members of and pay
 dues to the mass organizations; the extremely small percentage
 who refuse generally come under official scrutiny and are
 denied advancement at work and other benefits. Children and
 young adults belong to the Pioneers and Komsomol, respectively,
 while their elders belong to the Fatherland Front, and, in the
 case of the elite, the Bulgarian Communist Party.
 The Party and the security apparatus direct an elaborate
 system of informers which is present in virtually all
 workplaces, residential areas, and social organizations to
 monitor the daily lives of Bulgarians for signs of dissent. A
 newspaper article in February 1987 noted the formation of
 "voluntary" detachments at tourist complexes to monitor, in
 conjunction with officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
 "unsuitable acts" and "ideological sabotage" by Western
 tourists. Citizen volunteers assist the uniformed border
 guards. The security forces are presumed to monitor the
 movements of those suspected of unacceptable behavior. Eduard
 Genov's wife was reportedly followed, prior to their exile, as
 were those who contacted her.
 Sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police may not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. However, searches may
 be undertaken in urgent situations before judicial permission
 is given. The authorities are required to issue an itemized
 receipt for property confiscated during a search. A number of
 dissidents were reportedly stopped by the militia in September
 following a visit to a colleague; the car they were riding in
 was searched, and they were stripped. No search warrant was
 provided, although the police did issue a receipt for all of
 the items removed from the vehicle and its passengers.
 
 
 995
 BULGARIA
 The Government discourages private contacts with persons and
 organizations in the West. The wife of one human rights
 activist was reportedly stopped and questioned by militia when
 she tried to approach the U.S. Embassy in 1988. Several other
 Bulgarians privately indicated that they, too, feared to go to
 a Western embassy. The militia outside the U.S. Embassy
 stepped up their vigilance in 1988, stopping many Bulgarian
 citizens and even attempting to stop other Western diplomats
 and Embassy officers whom they did not immediately recognize.
 Despite Embassy protests, this practice has continued.
 In December, Bulgaria stopped jamming Radio Free Europe
 broadcasts. The British Broadcasting Corporation's World
 Service and Voice of America broadcasts are also heard without
 interference.
 Availability of Western publications is tightly controlled;
 only Western Communist Party newspapers, such as L'Unita and
 The Morning Star, are regularly sold at newstands. Reports
 indicate that during 1988 security forces even attempted to
 buy up copies of the Soviet Union's Pravda because of articles
 espousing and explaining the Soviet policy of glasnost
 (openness).
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, other laws provide severe punishment for anyone
 convicted of criticizing the State or spreading "untruthful
 remarks which might increase distrust of state power or cause
 confusion in society." In practice, the voicing of any belief
 or conviction which is contrary to official policy may be
 punished. Orhan Turanov, an ethnic Turk, was reportedly
 arrested and sentenced to lengthy imprisonment in 1987 for
 public praise of Turkey. Unauthorized disclosure of
 information, such as unpublished economic statistics, is
 illegal and subject to serious penalties.
 The regime totally controls Bulgaria's press, radio, and
 television, all of which are state owned. Although censorship
 officially does not exist, the media, as well as writers,
 artists, and those in academic life, operate within implicit
 party and government guidelines and practices. International
 news coverage is usually limited to that provided by the
 government news agency or official Soviet sources, although
 carefully selected articles from the Western press are
 sometimes published in translation.
 Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press typically include
 unauthorized criticism of party and state leaders, of
 Communist ideology, and of other Communist countries,
 particularly the U.S.S.R. Ordinary citizens send criticism,
 suggestions, and complaints by letter to newspapers, as well
 as to National Assembly deputies, on a broad range of topics
 such as inadequate service by public agencies and housing
 shortages. Authorized criticism rarely, if ever, extends
 beyond specific shortcomings or failures of lower-level
 administrative officials.
 The range of tolerated opinion narrowed in 1988, despite party
 leader Todor Zhivkov's call for the "abolition of the
 anonymous nature of criticism." The editors-in-chief of Trud,
 Literaturen Front, and Narodna Kultura, three newspapers most
 
 
 996
 BULGARIA
 inclined to devote even minimal attention to glasnost, were
 replaced in 1988 following the publication of relatively
 adventuresome articles on environmental pollution, alleged
 corruption in a provincial town, the need to reexamine
 history, the role of censorship, and the errors of Stalinist
 thought. The journalist responsible for the articles on
 corruption was expelled from the party. A journalist who
 wrote an article in 1987 exposing corruption in a provincial
 medical clinic was dismissed from her job, judged "mentally
 incompetent and dangerous to society," and threatened with
 forced incarceration in a psychiatric hospital. In a report
 to the Politburo published on April 1, Zhivkov criticized the
 appearance, in "certain newspapers and magazines," of
 "articles which evoke a negative attitude toward definite
 values and ideals of socialism."
 Instances of glasnost in 1988, however, did appear. There was
 prompt and open official reporting on accidents such as plane
 and train crashes, as well as some public "scandals." The
 revocation of Olympic gold medals for two Bulgarian
 weightlifters due to the use of diuretics was reported
 immediately and factually. In July journalist Baruch Shamliev
 wrote an article calling for the opening of "forbidden zones"
 in statistical and historical data for journalists, scholars,
 and even ordinary citizens and was not officially criticized.
 In addition to party control of the media, the severe
 penalties for speaking out on forbidden topics has given rise
 to widespread self-censorship. Annual congresses of the
 official Writers Union adopt acceptable themes for authors,
 and those not following directives are unlikely to see their
 work published. Academic journals do not challenge regime
 policies. Dissatisfied intellectuals reportedly founded a
 group in late 1988, however, calling for increased glasnost
 and more rapid restructuring.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a right'granted only to legally
 constituted organizations, and only for approved purposes.
 Attendance at public demonstrations of support for the
 Government or party is a duty assigned by schools and
 enterprises to their members.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and
 demonstration, but in practice the party decides which social
 and political organizations may exist. Todor Zhivkov, in his
 1988 Politburo report, declared "voluntary associations"
 acceptable only "within the self-governing social communities"
 or "the framework of the mass sociopolitical organizations."
 Lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians, writers, and academics
 belong to professional associations which have the
 party-assigned function of controlling their memberships.
 The law provides punishment for anyone "founding an illegal,
 antistate organization." A number of citizens attempted to
 form an "independent" committee in Ruse early in 1988 to
 express concern about pollution problems. One of the
 participants, Svetlin Rusev, was subsequently removed as head
 of the National Art Gallery and lost his seat on the Central
 Committee.
 In January, the signers of a 1987 appeal to the CSCE in Vienna
 founded Bulgaria's first human rights organization, the
 Independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights. In
 
 
 997
 BULGARIA
 accordance with the Constitution, the group sent a copy of a
 protocol and a petition to the State Council and the Ministry
 of Justice requesting official registration and recognition.
 The Government refused officially to recognize or register the
 group, rendering all of its actions illegal.
 State security forces reportedly detained human rights
 activists and workers attempting to meet in Oborishte in
 September. On December 10, approximately 12 members of the
 Independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights in
 Bulgaria were prevented from traveling to Septemvri to sign a
 declaration marking International Human Rights Day. Noting
 that only "Socialist pluralism" was a legitimate basis of
 association, Todor Zhivkov declared, in his Politburo report,
 "we will not tolerate anarchy."
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, the
 authorities espouse atheism and discourage religion. Openly
 expressed religious conviction is incompatible with party
 membership or attainment of responsible government or other
 positions. Policy directives adopted at the Thirteenth
 Bulgarian Communist Party Congress in April 1986 called for
 increased "ideological work against religious anachronisms"
 and broader acceptance of "the Socialist festive and ritual
 system." Church-state relations are regulated by the
 Committee for Questions of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and
 Religiouc Cults, which is a division of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs. It reviews all clerical appointments and in
 the past has occasionally imposed clergy on local
 congregations over the opposition of the parishioners.
 The regime shows limited religious tolerance in its attitude
 towards Orthodox Christians and mainline Protestants. The
 authorities generally do not interfere with older worshipers
 attending services, but they sometimes try to dissuade young
 people from entering churches. There is a seminary for
 Orthodox priests. Announcements of church events are posted
 outside churches. No religious groups may engage in open
 proselytizing, and foreign missionary activity is banned.
 Religious education of children is prohibited.
 A Bulgarian-language Bible, only 2,000 copies of which were
 published in 1982 and distributed domestically, is now out of
 print, and no Bibles may be imported. Customs officials are
 assiduous in their efforts to discover and confiscate
 religious materials contained in the luggage or vehicles of
 arriving visitors. The Orthodox Church is allowed to print a
 newspaper, however, as well as distill and market some
 alcoholic beverages and sell some religious articles, such as
 candles and small jewelry crosses.
 A number of faiths are recognized or tolerated. The Bulgarian
 Orthodox Church, which was the established church before the
 Communists took power, is the largest, with a reported
 following of 6 million nominal adherents out of a population
 of 9 million. Functioning as a quasi-official church, it
 receives government financial support and echoes government
 propaganda on such themes as peace and disarmament.
 Attendance at Easter services in Sofia's Aleksandur Nevsky
 Cathedral is restricted to those granted special
 
 
 998
 BULGARIA
 "invitations," and police barricades keep all others at least
 a block from the church. Nevertheless, Easter attendance at
 other churches in Sofia and in the provinces was massive in
 1988, as in previous years, despite the presence of large
 numbers of uniformed police.
 The approximately 60,000 Roman Catholics are divided between
 followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. Priests of both
 attended the installation, following a long vacancy, of the
 new Bishop of Plovdiv in July. At age 38, Georgi Ivanov
 Yovchev was appointed Apostolic Administrator in a service
 attended by a standing-room only crowd of worshipers of all
 ages. Bulgaria reportedly has only 32 Catholic priests now,
 as opposed to about 200 when the Communists took power.
 There are a number of Protestant churches with small
 congregations (e.g., Evangelical, Baptist, Methodist,
 Seventh-Day Adventist) in Bulgaria. The Ba'hai faith and the
 Dunovist Sect, an indigenous movement which flourished in
 pre-Communist Bulgaria, are outlawed, however.
 Although Pavel Ignatov, leader of a small Protestant
 congregation, was freed from internal exile in the summer of
 1987, authorities have still not granted his congregation
 recognition as a legitimate church. Reports indicate that
 Ignatov's followers have been dismissed from work because of
 their religious convictions; the group has not been allocated
 a hall as an official meeting place.
 Ethnic Turks comprise the majority of Bulgaria's Muslims, the
 remainder being Slavic Pomaks and Gypsies. Increased measures
 to discourage Islamic practices have figured prominently in
 the Government's campaign to eradicate the cultural identity
 of the Turkish community in Bulgaria. Muslim believers have
 been inhibited in the practice of their religion by the
 closure of many mosques and by prohibitions against the
 religious education of children. Although Sofia's Mosque is
 slowly being renovated, many other mosques in areas with large
 Turkish populations have fallen into disrepair or have been
 converted to other uses or closed. The renovation of the
 architecturally notable Razgrad Mosque has been delayed
 indefinitely, despite its designation as a "monument of
 culture," following the reported discovery of Byzantine ruins
 at the site.
 Copies of the Koran may not be imported and are not generally
 available to Muslims in Bulgaria. Religious practices such as
 male circumcision have been banned since 1985; parents and
 others participating in circumcisions are subject to fine or
 imprisonment. The observance of Muslim holidays is
 discouraged. Many Muslim graveyards have been obliterated,
 and Muslim burial procedures are not permitted. All sermons
 must be delivered in the Bulgarian language.
 Muslim clergymen have been trained in a 6-month course with
 substantial political content offered in Sofia since 1986,
 rather than the standard years-long training elsewhere. The
 new Mufti of Shumen, reportedly a government supporter,
 graduated from that course. The Bulgarian Government,
 following years of refusal, allowed six Bulgarian students
 studying at the Higher Islamic Institute in Tashkent to make
 the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) in 1988.
 The Jewish minority numbers between 3,000 to 5,000 people.
 Historically, Jews in Bulgaria have not suffered religious
 
 
 999
 BULGARIA
 persecution. Visits between the Bulgarian Jewish community
 and Israeli Jews of Bulgarian origin are frequent, although
 subject to government control. Sofia's Sephardic synagogue
 has been promised government funds for refurbishment as a
 cultural monument, but no progress in that project has been
 made, and religious services continue to be held in a small
 anteroom. The anteroom is sufficient to accommodate the small
 number of Jews attending regular weekly services, although it
 is overcrowded on high holy days. The synagogue's
 Bulgarian-Hebrew prayer books date from 1942-1946, but the
 community received a shipment of Hebrew prayer books in 1988.
 The cantor of Sofia's synagogue went to New York for several
 months of cantorial clerical training. No kosher meat is
 available, but Jews are permitted to bake and distribute
 matzoh without hindrance. A Jewish social, cultural, and
 educational organization exists, but it is atheistic and
 political in orientation. It publishes a secular newspaper
 stressing Communist, anti-Zionist themes. This organization
 cosponsored a 2-day symposium in November on the protection of
 Bulgarian Jews during World War II.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where Bulgarians live, work, and
 travel. Citizens are required at all times to carry with them
 personal identity cards stating their legal place of residence
 and work. Without this card they cannot register at a hotel,
 purchase domestic airline tickets, or seek any kind of social
 service such as medical assistance. Use of domestic airline
 service is also subject to 'passport control" at air
 terminals. Changing one's place of residence or work is a
 complicated process unless it is at the Government's
 initiative or convenience. Moves to Sofia and other major
 cities from smaller settlements are especially difficult
 because of the authorities' desire to control urban growth.
 Bulgarians may travel within the country without restriction
 except in border zones, which are particularly sensitive where
 the country adjoins Greece and Turkey. The borders are
 heavily patroled by armed guards and citizen volunteers.
 Newspaper articles in August and September noted the report by
 an informer of an attempt by two young people to flee the
 country, and the capture of two other border "violators." The
 articles praised both the informers and the arresting citizens
 and officers.
 In August, the Government announced a 75 percent reduction in
 the permanently restricted area, encompassing regions that
 foreigners could not visit. Although some of the newly opened
 areas include those with large Turkish populations, a
 significant area along the Turkish, and part of the Greek,
 border remains closed. Yablonovo, reportedly the site of
 violent clashes between security forces and ethnic Turks
 during the 1984-85 name change campaign, was sporadically
 closed to diplomatic travel during 1988. In the past, even
 when officially open to diplomatic travel, foreigners
 attempting to visit were turned away by the militia.
 A Bulgarian citizen needs a passport for external travel and
 an exit visa specifying the destination for each trip. If a
 Bulgarian visits a country not specified in the exit visa or
 is delayed in returning to Bulgaria beyond the stipulated
 period, legal penalties may be imposed. Exit visas may be
 refused for a variety of reasons, e.g., political
 
 
 1000
 BULGARIA
 unreliability, or for no reason. When a Bulgarian is
 successful in obtaining an exit visa, a spouse or minor child
 is almost invariably required to remain in Bulgaria to ensure
 the traveler's return. Although liberalization in passport
 and travel regulations proposed in April have not been
 enacted, there was a substantial increase in the number of
 Bulgarians allowed to travel to the West in 1988.
 In principle, emigration is possible under Bulgarian law, but
 no right of emigration is recognized in practice. The
 Government in 1988 substantially reduced the number of
 unsettled divided family cases involving the United States and
 Western Europe. Bulgarian authorities also allowed a
 dissident family, the Statevs, to emigrate to the United
 States in 1988 but continued to refuse others. Helsinki Watch
 protested to Todor Zhivkov the cases of Ivan Penkov Kutrovsky,
 a human rights activist, and Asen Filipov Stoyanov, an ethnic
 Turk. Both men went on hunger strikes in 1988, seeking
 permission to emigrate from Bulgaria; both have been
 imprisoned. Kutrovsky was reportedly allowed to emigrate to
 the West in late 1988. Other human rights activists who had
 applied for permission to emigrate were issued passports in
 1988; some observers believe the circumstances of their
 departures approached expulsions. Grigor Simov Bozhilov was
 reportedly released from internal exile in the village of
 Kaynardzha and issued a passport. He was apparently denied
 entrance to a Western country due to lack of funds, however,
 and returned to Bulgaria.
 Emigration to Turkey by ethnic Turks has been prohibited since
 1985, despite large numbers of people who reportedly wish to
 leave. In April, as reported by Helsinki Watch, ethnic Turk
 Urkiye Ademova Huseyinova and her son were allowed to emigrate
 to the United*States to join other family members. Although
 48 Turkish children were allowed to join their families in
 Turkey in the 6 months--October 1987 to April 1988--prior to
 the Belgrade Protocol, only two children were allowed to
 emigrate in the subsequent 6 months from April to October
 1988. However, the family of Olympic weightlifter Naim
 Suleymanoglu was permitted to emigrate to Turkey in October.
 The Government encourages the repatriation of ethnic
 Bulgarians residing abroad, although the right of repatriation
 is not guaranteed. A number of Bulgarian-born foreign
 residents and citizens return voluntarily to Bulgaria each
 year to live in retirement. There was a marked trend in that
 direction in 1988 among Bulgarian-born Jews returning from
 Israel. Those who left without permission or who stayed
 abroad without authorization may be accepted for residence
 under an "amnesty" program, but the conditions of this program
 appear designed to ensure that those participating in it will
 be accorded only the status of Bulgarian citizens, without
 regard for rights they may have acquired abroad as citizens of
 otber countries.
 It is Bulgarian policy to return to their home countries
 potential refugees from other Warsaw Pact states who try to
 cross the Bulgarian border into Turkey, Yugoslavia, or
 Greece. In September, 13 Magyar Romanians refused to leave
 the Hungarian Embassy in Sofia unless they were allowed to go
 to Hungary. The Bulgarian Government sided with the Romanian
 demand that they return to Romania. This situation remained
 unresolved-at year's end.
 
 
 1001
 BULGARIA
 The Government continued the forcible resettlement in 1988 of
 ethnic Turks from their local villages to areas with small
 Turkish populations. Reports indicated that many Turks were
 resettled in the Vratsa, Mikhailovgrad, and Vidin areas.
 Turks from Kurdzhali, an area in southeastern Bulgaria with a
 more than 75 percent ethnic Turkish population, were
 reportedly moved to Butan, in the Danubian Region. According
 to some reports, the Government further "encourages"
 resettlement by forcing people from their jobs, or offering
 them jobs with only minimal wages, so that they must move
 elsewhere to seek work. The number of people relocated thus
 far cannot be accurately estimated; there have also been
 reports, which cannot be verified, that a plan to relocate as
 many as 40,000 Turks from Kurdzhali may be under consideration.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change government leadership
 or the system of government. The Constitution declares that
 "organizations directed against the Socialist system of the
 People's Republic of Bulgaria.. .are prohibited." The
 Bulgarian Communist Party leadership, headed since 1954 by
 Todor Zhivkov, governs Bulgaria. Nonparty members are
 effectively denied any role in the formation of regime policy,
 and even rank-and-file party members have little influence
 over party policies-
 The regime tries to maintain the appearance of pluralism
 through the participation of a second "political party," the
 Bulgarian National Agrarian Union, in the Government and the
 National Assembly. However, the Agrarian Party professes no
 differences of view on any issue with the Communist Party.
 Officials maintain there is a "national consensus" on
 government policies and slight differences of opinion only on
 the best means of implementing those policies. Persons
 identified as nonparty (i.e., "independent") also hold
 responsible government positions or National Assembly seats,
 but they are not known to profess views contrary to Communist
 party policies. The Communist and Agrarian Parties, together
 with labor, youth, and other groups, comprise a mass
 organization known as the Fatherland Front, which is wholly
 controlled by the Communist Party. Political pluralism and
 free participation in the political process do not exist. A
 group of approximately 50 dissidents reportedly founded in
 1988, without official permission, a political party called
 "The Green Mass", which plans a party conference for April
 1989.
 The Fatherland Front has been the only organization permitted
 to present candidates for election. Following constitutional
 changes in 1987, so-called multicandidate elections were held
 on the local level in February. Less than 20 percent of these
 elections involved more than one candidate; all candidates
 were prescreened by election commissions and all supported the
 Communist Party.
 Women continue to be underrepresented in policymaking
 positions within the party and government, although they are
 legally assured equal rights with men.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government regards any criticism of its human rights
 record as inadmissible and part of an "anti-Bulgarian
 campaign," and it denounced an April 1986 AI report on
 Bulgaria's Turkish minority in those terms. Government media
 have published numerous articles purporting to show that some
 of the Bulgarian Turks that AI reported killed while resisting
 the name change campaign are still alive and well.
 Members of the Islamic Conference Organization visited
 Bulgaria in 1987 (received by the Government in their
 "individual capacities") and toured Muslim areas of the
 country. Their report, issued in May 1988, was cited in the
 resolutions of the organization at the same time. The
 resolutions were critical of the Bulgarian Government's
 repressive policies toward the "Bulgarian Muslims." The
 Government's response did not substantively address the abuses
 cited.
 Bulgaria's first human rights group, the Independent Society
 for the Protection of Human Rights in Bulgaria, was formed in
 1988. The group, which has a reported membership of about 150
 people, was denied official registration or recognition as a
 legitimate entity. Its leaders, including Chairman Ilya
 Stoyanov Minev, Secretary Tseko Tsekov, and spokesman Eduard
 Genov, were subject to official harassment, imprisonment, and
 internal exile. Subsequently, Genov and his Zamily were
 expelled from the country and resettled in the United States.
 Tsekov was issued a passport and is currently in Vienna.
 Bozhidar and.Minka Statev, members until their emigration to
 the United States, are now the group's foreign
 representatives. Dissident activists were prevented from
 meeting with foreign government officials in October.
 With the declared aim of assisting the Bulgarian Government in
 its professed desire to broaden democracy and human rights in
 Bulgaria, the society issued documents in support of the
 Charter 77 initiative in Czechoslovakia, calling for the
 release of human rights activists from prison and exile, and
 proposing changes in the Constitution and criminal code.
 The Government, refusing to recognize the existence of the
 unofficial group, announced the formation of a Human Rights
 Committee in June. The Government officially registered this
 supposedly independent group, composed of approximately 50
 public figures. In their only action to date, these public
 figures sent a message of protest to the South African
 Government in August, calling for the release of Nelson
 Mandela. AI, requesting to meet government officials dealing
 with human rights in September, was directed to this group as
 its corresponding "nongovernmental Bulgarian entity."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on
 "nationality, origin, creed, sex, race, education, social and
 material status," as well as the "propagation of
 hate.. .because of racial, national, or religious affiliation."
 The Government does not admit the existence of any minority
 ethnic groups and hence even the possibility of
 
 
 1003
 BULGARIA
 discrimination. Census reports, which earlier noted the
 existence of significant numbers of Gypsies, Macedonians, and
 ethnic Turks, now report an almost totally homogeneous
 Bulgarian populace.
 The Government has consistently refused to acknowledge the
 presence of any Turks in Bulgaria, referring only to
 "Bulgarians who were forcibly Islamicized under Ottoman
 rule." Ethnic Turks comprise about 10 percent of the
 population, however, and are subject to severe restrictions
 and discrimination in a systematic effort to destroy their
 cultural identity. During the forced assimilation campaign of
 1984-1985, all Turks were assigned new Bulgarian given and
 family names. Only these names appear on their new identity
 cards, issued from January to March 1985. Because no adult
 Bulgarians received new identity cards during this period, the
 date of issuance effectively functions as a code, signaling
 militiamen and other authority figures who may demand to see
 the card that its bearer is an ethnic Turk. There have been
 reported instances of illegal fines being levied for pretended
 offenses and other discriminatory measures taken by the police
 upon the discovery of ethnic heritage.
 Despite official denials, most Turkish and Islamic social,
 cultural, and religious customs are banned. Public use of the
 Turkish language is forbidden, as is the wearing of
 traditional forms of dress. Turkish weddings are not
 permitted to take place in the streets, as is the traditional
 custom; they must be conducted in closed halls, and the
 singing and playing of Turkish songs is forbidden. Wedding
 parties must request an orchestra from the authorities, who
 will provide a group that will play only Bulgarian music. All
 Turkish weddings reportedly are attended by uniformed
 militiamen. Education in the Turkish language had long been
 banned. Many Muslim religious practices are forbidden. There
 are no longer separate Muslim cemeteries; established
 cemeteries have been destroyed. Only Bulgarian names can now
 appear on tombstones, making impossible the tracing of family
 relationships. The Government has reportedly dispersed entire
 Turkish communities in an effort to disrupt their social
 fabric.
 Systematic job discrimination against ethnic Turks cannot be
 substantiated. There are a few Turkish members of the
 National Assembly, one of whom defected to Turkey in
 September. However, some reports assert that a number of
 Turks have lost their jobs because of resistance to
 Bulgarianization. The Bulgarian press in September carried an
 article vehemently denying reports that "young descendants of
 Bulgarians who had been converted to Islam by force during
 Turkish rule are being used in the army in humiliating posts,
 such as toilet cleaners, guards, and so forth, and this only
 in the construction troops."
 There is pervasive societal discrimination against the small
 Gypsy population, which generally lives in shantytowns and
 occupies the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder.
 The Constitution declares that "women and men enjoy equal
 rights," and there does not appear to be overt discrimination
 as regards educational and professional opportunities. Half
 of all university graduates are women. In 1988, for the first
 time, women were admitted to the army's Vasil Levsky Military
 Academy. Women comprise 49 percent of the "economically
 active population," but, according to government statistics
 
 
 1004
 BULGARIA
 published in 1988, 63 percent of working women perform hard or
 "unattractive" physical labor. The press also reported that
 "feminization in certain fields has become a serious
 problem." Of those with higher education, there tends to be a
 concentration in the fields of education, engineering, and
 public health. Because so many women perform unskilled labor,
 their average salary tends to be lower than that of men.
 Approximately one-third of the members of the elite Bulgarian
 Communist Party, which comprises about 10 percent of the
 population, are women. There are no women in the Politburo,
 however, but there is one in the Council of Ministers.
 Slightly more than 5 percent of the Central Committee members
 are women, and about 10 percent of the candidate members.
 Additionally, in administrative and economic management, there
 are fewer women in the upper ranks of the hierarchy.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Communist Party organizes and totally controls all trade
 unions, which are grouped together in a sole labor central
 called the Central Council of Bulgarian Trade Unions (CCTU).
 The head of the CCTU is a candidate member of the Politburo.
 Among the unions' chief roles are the fostering of their
 members' devotion to the party, the promotion of patriotism
 and "internationalism" (i.e., loyalty to the Soviet Union),
 and the facilitation of the "scientific-technical revolution"
 (i.e., the technological modernization of production). The
 leader of the Bulgarian labor union delegation tor a Balkan
 conference in July declare a main task of unions to be "the
 turning of the Balkans into a nuclear-free zone."
 Workers are not permitted to organize outside the official
 union structure, nor are they allowed to strike, although
 disgruntled workers in Mezdra engaged in a week-long stoppage
 in March 1987. Labor unions have not defended workers
 dismissed from jobs for political transgressions. Security
 authorities may blacklist such workers from certain kinds of
 employment.
 The CCTU is affiliated with the Soviet-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Bulgaria is a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining in Bulgaria. A new labor
 code, in force since January 1987, and a "restructuring" of
 unions in the spring of 1987 were putatively intended to shift
 the locus of union decision from the apex to its base: the
 much proclaimed arrival of "self-management." There is no
 indication, thus far, that the role of unions has
 substantially changed. Bulgaria has established customs-free
 zones in Ruse and Vidin.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution declares that "every able-bodied citizen is
 obliged to do socially useful work." Those who do not work
 may be charged with "vagrancy" or social parasitism; Article
 39 of the statutes of the People's Militia authorizes the
 imposition of "administrative measures," such as house arrest,
 on "people who lead nomad lives or beg as opposed to doing
 
 
 1005
 BULGARIA
 social labor." Compulsory labor may be required of prisoners
 or those in internal exile. Human rights activist Eduard
 Genov, interned in the village of Mikhalkovo prior to being
 exiled, reportedly worked in a mine.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor code adopted in 1986 stipulated 16 years as the
 minimum age for all but certain light work. Persons from 16
 to 18 years of age may not be assigned work designated as
 heavy, harmful, or dangerous; their workweek is either 5
 7-hour days or 6 6-hour days. These restrictions are
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is the local currency equivalent of about
 $120 per month at the official exchange rate, and the average
 wage is the equivalent of about $210 per month. The minimum
 wage is not sufficient for a single wage earner to provide a
 decent standard of living for a family. In families with two
 working spouses, the average wage provides, at best, a modest
 standard of living.
 The workweek for adults is 42.5 hours (5 days of 8.5 hours) in
 most professions and occupations. Paid vacations range from
 14 workdays annually, for those who have worked less than 10
 years, to 18 workdays annually, for those who have worked more
 than 15 years. Additional paid vacation is granted those in
 certain difficult or dangerous occupations. Bulgarian
 practice appears generally to conform to these guidelines,
 although participation in unpaid supplementary "brigades" can
 lengthen working hours on various occasions during the year.
 Trade unions are assigned a role promoting job safety and the
 general social welfare of their members. A national labor
 safety program exists, but standards of enforcement vary
 greatly. Newspaper reports in 1988 indicated that over
 one-third of working women labor in places of "unsatisfactory
 hygiene," and there is concern over the lack of safeguards for
 pregnant working women. Over 50 percent of working women
 reportedly have jobs that do not correspond to their
 "ergonomical requirements." There is also evidence that
 safety considerations do not figure prominently in work
 assignments for prisoners. Eduard Genov reportedly worked on
 a machine that creates dense dust laden with silicon dioxide
 particles.
