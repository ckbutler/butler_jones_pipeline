 GRENADA
 Until December 1984, Grenada was governed by an Interim
 Advisory Council appointed by Governor General Sir Paul Scoon
 on November 15, 1983, to fill the vacuum created by events
 following the bloody internal coup of October 1983. The
 Advisory Council served as an interim government until
 national elections were held on December 3, 1984. In those
 elections, which were free and open and saw a voter turnout
 estimated at 85 percent, the New National Party of Grenada,
 led by now Prime Minister Herbert Blaize won 14 of 15
 parliamentary seats.
 After obtaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1974,
 Grenada was governed under a Westminster-type parliamentary
 system. The first prime minister was Sir Eric Gairy. Gairy
 was accused by his opponents of personal corruption, of
 rigging the 1976 elections, and of using violence to
 intimidate his opposition. On March 13, 1979 the New Jewel
 Movement ousted Sir Eric in a nearly bloodless coup and
 established the People's Revolutionary Government headed by
 Prime Minister Maurice Bishop. The People's Revolutionary
 Government (PRG) under Bishop promised to reestablish an
 elected parliamentary system and to uphold human rights, but
 did not fulfill those commitments. A single party government,
 the Bishop-led PRG suspended the 1974 Constitution,
 arbitrarily imprisoned political opponents, and curtailed
 press and other freedoms.
 Long-standing divisions within the PRG's ruling elite broke
 into the open in September 1983 and on October 19 led to the
 murder of Bishop and a number of his cabinet members as well
 as an unknown number of other people. Under the titular
 leadership of army commander Hudson Austin, a new group
 calling itself the Revolutionary Military Council abolished
 the PRG and declared a 24-hour, shoot-on-sight curfew.
 In the wake of this chaos and recognizing the breakdown in
 civil order that was taking place, Governor General Sir Paul
 Scoon, exercising his authority as head of state, appealed for
 help to other members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
 states, who in turn called on Barbados, Jamaica and the United
 States for assistance.
 U.S. and Caribbean forces landed on Grenada October 25 and,
 after a brief period of combat, succeeded in restoring order
 to the island. The Governor General and the Interim Advisory
 Council he appointed on November 15 reinstated major portions
 of the 1974 Constitution, including its protection of
 fundamental freedoms and basic human rights.
 During 1984, security in the country was maintained by a
 combination of Grenadian police personnel and a Caribbean
 Peace Force (CPF) composed of military and police contingents
 from neighboring countries, with United States military
 support. Training programs to create a Grenadian police force
 capable of maintaining law and order on its own began in 1984.
 At the end of 1984, there were no persons detained without
 charges. The press was free. The political party spectrum
 included a moderate center, the remnants of the leftist New
 Jewel Movement and a party led by former Prime Minister Gairy
 who had been overthrown in 1979. A wide variety of religions
 were being practiced freely.

 GRENADA
 Movement is free in and out of Grenada. The preliminary
 judicial hearings for those accused of murdering former Prime
 Minister Maurice Bishop and others followed generally accepted
 standards of due process, and numerous precautions have been
 taken to protect the legal rights and security of the accused.
 The Grenadian economy is in a state of transition. It suffers
 from past mismanagement, a history of political turmoil and an
 insufficiently maintained and inadequate infrastructure.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings in Grenada in
 1984. The preliminary inquiry of those accused of the murders
 of former Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, three other Ministers
 and two prominent labor leaders, who had been summarily
 executed, allegely by other members of Bishop's own party, on
 October 19, 1983 was completed. There were no insurgent or
 terrorist killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances carried out by official or non-official
 elements.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Several of the accused awaiting trial for the murders of
 Maurice Bishop and members.of his cabinet complained that they
 had been subjected to torture and cruel treatment while in
 prison. In particular, some prisoners charged that
 investigators brought to Grenada from the Barbadian police
 force to look into the involvement of the accused in the
 events of October 1983 used rough treatment during their
 interrogations. When specific allegations of torture were
 made, the prisoners were taken to doctors and no evidence of
 physical harm was found.
 During the first sitting of the High Court in October 1984,
 Bernard Coard, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
 Finance and now one of the 19 defendants, claimed that there
 is a "criminal in charge of the prison who is operating a
 reign of terror." There has been no evidence, however, to
 substantiate these allegations.
 An inquiry by a Grenadian magistrate began in October 1984
 into police charges that four former officials of the PRG
 caused grievous harm to a number of persons held as political
 prisoners by the PRG during its rule from 1979 to 1983. Two
 of the accused are also among the 19 charged with the slaying
 of Bishop and others.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In a series of proclamations by the Governor General in
 November 1983, most provisions of the 1974 Constitution of
 Grenada were reinstated, and certain 'People's Laws' made
 under the PRG were declared still in force. Special legal
 
 
 533
 GRENADA
 provisions to prevent arbitrary arrest and detention came into
 effect on November 15, 1983, with the publication of the
 'Preventive Detention Ordinance 1983'. This first ordinance
 under the Interim Government abolished 'Emergency Powers' and
 created an advisory tribunal to review the cases of persons
 under detention for reasons of security. Section 15 of the
 Constitution, which guarantees legal representation for
 persons detained under emergency laws and written notification
 of the reasons for detention within specified time limits, was
 applied in relation to all persons detained under that
 ordinance.
 The Preventive Detention Ordinance of 1983 also provided that,
 except for cases that would endanger 'public safety, public
 order or defence,* detainees must be released or formally
 charged within 72 hours of being apprehended. This ordinance
 primarily applied to the approximately 48 "security detainees'
 who had been held in connection with the events leading to the
 murder of Maurice Bishop and overthrow of the PRG in October
 1983. According to the Attorney General's office, the
 ordinance is for all practical purposes no longer in effect
 since there are currently no 'detainees' in Grenada. In
 February 1984 formal charges were brought against twenty of
 the forty-eight initially accused, and the rest were
 released.
 Grenadian police retain the right to arrest individuals 'on
 suspicion' without a warrant, but they are required to abide
 by time restrictions as to when those detained must be
 formally charged or released. In 1984 no individuals were
 detained for political reasons.
 Persons in detention are allowed access to a lawyer of their
 own choosing. The 19 persons charged with the murder of
 Bishop and others were re presented at the preliminary inquiry
 by a team of seven Jamaicta defense lawyers.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with murder (or any capital offense) are not eligible. Habeas
 corpus is found in Grenadian law and was respected in 1984.
 There is a fifteen-day period following a court's decision
 during which the defense may apply for a judicial
 determination of the legality of the individual's detention,
 and a two-month period during which a person in detention must
 be charged or released. These time limits were not fully
 adhered to early in 1984 under the interim administration.
 The Government has cited lack of legal staff to prepare
 charges and the ongoing examination of the detainees
 involvement in the October 1983 events as reasons for failure
 to charge them within the legally-required period. By
 mid-year all former detainees had been charged or released,
 and there were no further detentions in which the prescribed
 time limits were violated.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1984, although some members
 of the PRG have remained out of the country voluntarily.
 Other former members of Bishop's Government have come and gone
 freely.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During the PRG years (1979-1983), a preventive detention
 tribunal system effectively removed political cases from the
 judicial system and denied affected citizens a fair trial.
 
 
 534
 GRENADA
 The Interim Government, which was given full legal
 responsibility for all security detainees being held at the
 time of the first ordinance, created an advisory tribunal to
 review the cases of those persons under detention in November
 1983.
 During 1984, as firm evidence adequate to prosecute many of
 the individuals did not develop, they were released. By the
 beginning of the preliminary inquiry in June 1984, of the
 original 48 charged with the murder of Bishop and his
 followers and other bystanders, only 20 people were still in
 custody. The preliminary hearing found that there was
 sufficient evidence to remand 19 of the 20 over for trial on
 eleven counts of murder. One person was charged with 'acting
 or conspiring to procure an alteration in the government,* and
 was released on bail after surrendering his passport, at the
 conclusion of the preliminary inquiry.
 The Grenadian judiciary was independent from interference by
 the Interim Government in 1984. The preliminary inquiry of
 the persons accused of the murder of Maurice Bishop and others
 have been fair. Proceedings have been held in a special
 courtroom constructed on the Richmond Hill compound, in order
 to ensure the safety of the accused, as well as the witnesses
 and jury. The Governor General amended the jury ordinance in
 September 1984 to allow 'not less than thirty nor more than
 sixty persons to serve as jurors,* rather than the previous
 thirty. This expansion of the jurors pool was one more
 indication of efforts being made by the Interim Government to
 ensure a fair, public trial for those accused.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During the state of emergency declared by the Governor General
 on November 4, 1983 following the events of October, there
 were widespread searches for caches of illegal weapons and no
 warrant was needed for members of the Caribbean Peace Force
 (CPF) to enter and search private homes. After the Emergency
 Powers Regulations were revoked by the Governor General on
 November 15, 1983, all foreign and local police forces were
 required by law to be in possession of a warrant in order to
 search a private home. Still there were reported a few
 instances during 1984 in which the CPF, in an effort to locate
 illegal weapons, entered private homes without a search
 warrant.
 There is no arbitrary interference by the state or any
 political organization in the private life of individuals.
 There is no forced membership in any organization, no
 arbitrary monitoring of telephones nor interference with the
 teaching of religion.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Interim Government restored the constitutionally
 guaranteed freedom of speech and press which the PRG had
 suppressed during its years in power. The New Jewel Movement
 (NJM) during the 1979-83 period had banned all newspapers
 except their own officially controlled publications and
 Alister Hughes' 'Grenada Newsletter," the dissemination of
 which was mostly overseas. Hughes was jailed in October 1983
 
 
 535
 GRENADA
 during the events surrounding the murder of Bishop and
 publication of the 'Grenada Newsletter* was interrupted
 briefly. Some individuals during the NJM regime were
 imprisoned for attempting to publish papers the party did not
 like.
 In November 1983, the 'Grenadian Voice', which had been
 suppressed by the NJM, resumed weekly publication with
 technical and financial assistance from other newspaper
 companies in the Caribbean. Its editor and publisher, Leslie
 Pierre, had been imprisoned without charges for over two years
 under the PRG . Alister and Cynthia Hughes continue to
 publish *The Grenada Newsletter'.
 In 1984 there were also three political party organs published
 on a regular schedule, the 'Grenada Guardian' of the Grenada
 United Labor Party (GULP), the 'New Grenadian* of the
 Christian Democratic Labour Party (CDLP), published in
 Trinidad but sold in Grenada, and the 'Indies Times' of the
 Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement (MBPM). The government
 information service publishes a newsletter called 'Newsline"
 which appears on no fixed schedule and which prints official
 statements by the Government and reports on the activities of
 the Governor General.
 During the Bishop regime several 'People's Laws' amended the
 Newspaper Ordnance thus severely limiting private ownership of
 newspaper companies and, in effect, providing for 50 percent
 Grenadian government ownership. The Governor General's
 proclamation on November 11, 1983, revoked the particular text
 of the 'People's Laws' concerning the ordnance and freedom of
 the press was restored in Grenada. The single local radio
 station, 'Radio Grenada," is government owned and operated.
 The transmitters for Radio Grenada were on temporary loan from
 the U.S. Army. Programming is done solely by Grenadians. In
 November 1984, Radio Grenada began giving news reports on
 local political events and free advertising time to the
 political candidates prior to the elections December 3. A new
 transmitter belonging to the Government and designed to
 replace one destroyed in the 1983 military operations began
 operating in November 1984.
 There was no censorship of the media nor abuse of the freedoms
 of speech and press in Grenada in 1984. Opposition viewpoints
 are freely expressed both orally and in writing, and criticism
 of the Government fully tolerated. There is no surveillance
 of political meetings or censorhip of books or media by the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals in Grenada have the right to assemble for any
 purpose, including to protest government policies. Since the
 violent overthrow of the Bishop regime in October 1983, the
 right to hold public meetings was suspended only during the
 state of emergency declared by the Governor General during the
 first half of November 1983. In 1984, there was no government
 control over private or public associations, and permits were
 not required for public meetings.
 Workers in Grenada have the unrestricted right to organize
 independent labor unions and to participate in collective
 bargaining. Unions play a significant role in the Grenadian
 work force. It is estimated that approximately 25 percent of
 the total work force belongs to unions.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 35
 
 
 536
 GRENADA
 Although some unions in Grenada played an active political
 role in the governments of Prime Ministers Gairy and Bishop,
 in 1984 they were largely apolitical and free of government
 control. Individual unionists are personally active in
 various political parties, but they make a point of separating
 their private political involvement from their union
 activities. The Grenada Trade Union Council participates in
 the conferences of the ILO and is affiliated with the ICFTU
 via the Caribbean Congress of Labor.
 Grenada sent a tripartite delegation to the ILO conference in
 Geneva in 1984.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Grenada's predominant religions are Catholic and Anglican.
 Although the PRG attempted to discourage religion,
 particularly among the younger generation, and even jailed
 outspoken clergymen, Grenada remained a religiously active
 country. Religious matters are currently covered on the radio
 and in the newspapers.
 There is freedom to practice the religion of one's choice,
 including Rastafarianism, which was harassed under the
 previous regime. Clergy, including missionaries, travel
 freely. There does not appear to be any advantage or
 disadvantage conferred by adherence to any particular faith,
 nor is there a religious connection with any political party.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada and the right to
 enter and leave is guaranteed all Grenadian citizens.
 Emigration in 1984 was not restricted, and Grenadian citizens
 who left the country were allowed to return freely.
 There have been no 'repatriates' forcibly returned to Grenada
 in 1984, nor any known cases of refugees who have come to
 Grenada.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The principal reason for the appointment of the Interim
 Advisory Council by the Governor General in November 1983 was
 to provide a functioning governmental authority until a
 government was elected under the provisions of the
 Constitution of Grenada. The Governor General immediately
 took steps to return Grenada to a constitutional government by
 means of elections.
 The 1974 Constitution of Grenada was largely reinstated on
 November 15, 1983, and the specifications of the Advisory
 Council and its legislative powers were set out in a
 proclamation. In the interest of returning Grenada to a
 .parliamentary government established under a system of free
 and fair elections," new electoral procedures were outlined in
 an ordinance dated March 19, 1984. The ordinance was adhered
 to during 1984 and a supervisor of elections and staff were
 appointed and island wide voter registration organized. Voter
 identification cards were distributed and polling districts
 organized.
 
 
 537
 GRENADA
 Four political parties formally announced candidates for some
 or all of the country's 15 constituencies. The Grenada United
 Labor Party announced candidatvsor each constituency, and
 the Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement put forth 13 candidates.
 Eighty-five percent of the voters turned out for the elections
 on December 3 which, according to international observers,
 were honest and free from violence. The New National Party
 won 14 of tne 15 parliamentary seats and the Grenada United
 Labor Party won one seat. The Maurice Bishop Patriotic
 Movement obtained only 5 percent of the vote and won no
 parliamentary seats. On December 4 Governor General Sir Paul
 Scoon swore in Herbert Blaize, head of the New National Party,
 as Grenada's Prime Minister.
 The political system is not dominated by any ethnic group, nor
 are there any restrictions which limit participation of any
 elements of the Grenada population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Interim Government of Grenada welcomed the visits of
 several human rights organizations in 1984. Government
 officials met with representatives of non-governmental
 organizations concerned with the state of human rights in
 Grenada, including Amnesty International and Americas Watch.
 The Government also received correspondence from human rights
 organizations, especially those'formed by Grenadians in the
 United Kingdom, with regard to specific cases of alleged human
 rignts violations or individuals. The Advisory Council
 received numerous telexes from trade unions and individuals in
 tne Caribbean, the U.S. and the U.K. which simply "demanded
 the release* of prisoners, some of whom were active in the
 NJM's trade union movement. The Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission (IAHRC) wrote several times to Chairman Brathwaite,
 forwarding "pertinent points" of letters to them alleging
 human rights violations. Letters from recognized human rights
 organizations which requested information on the status of
 individual cases were answered in a timely manner by the
 Government. The Government determined not to respond to
 charges and inquires which it considered to be clearly and
 primarily propaganda efforts by radical groups. Most
 complaints or allegations of human rights violations in
 Grenada concerned specific prisoners at Richmond Hill Prison.
 The Interim Government in Grenada made it clear it had nothing
 to hide regarding its human rights attitudes and practices. A
 combined human rights group including representatives from
 Americas Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union visited
 Grenada in November 1983. In a letter of thanks to Governor
 General Scoon for his having received them, the group
 criticized various aspects of the detention of NJM prisoners
 and made recommendations for correcting alleged abuses. They
 also had critical comments on other security procedures in
 Grenada. Toe Government took steps to investigate the
 problems pointed out. A subsequent visit was made in
 September 1984 by the Americas Watch representative.
 A representative of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) visited Grenada in November 1983, in January
 1984, and from June to July 1984 and reported on conditions
 
 
 538
 GRENADA
 and treatment of detainees at Richmond Hill Prison. The
 Governor General and the Interim Advisory Council relied on
 the ICRC's counsel with regard to the prison situation. A
 visit to Grenada by the OAS Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission (IAHRC) was requested by the Chairman of the
 Advisory Council in August 1984.
 There are no active internal human rights organizations in
 Grenada, but the government has been conscious of
 international human rights matters in 1984. Amnesty
 International reported on human rights in Grenada in its
 'Torture in the 80's' and in the "Amnesty International Report
 1984,' covering a period when the People's Revolutionary
 Government was still-ilpower. Freedom House in its 1984-85
 report rated Grenada 'partly'free" on the basis of the
 pre-election period, noting an advance in freedom under the
 Interim Government and expectation of a return to
 parliamentary democracy responsive to the will of the majority
 as a result of the December election.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The interim administration moved to diminish the role. of the
 Government in the economy, while taking a series of steps to
 promote private sector business and investment activity. It
 revised the investment code, relaxed exchange controls, and
 began divesting several state enterprises. Grenada is
 receiving foreign aid from the U.S. and other sources, which
 is being used to complete the international airport and repair
 ifrastructure. Unemployment has not dropped remained at a
 roughly estimated 30 percent.
 Although the World Bank estimates Grenada's population to be
 113,000, a more realistic estimate would be 90,000. This is
 based on a 1981 census and the results of the 1984 voter
 enumeration process. On the basis of the latest IMF estimate
 of gross domestic product for 1983 ($116 million) and the
 lower population estimate, per capita income is about $1288.
 The World Bank estimate of per capita gross national product
 was $761.50 in 1982., Income distribution is fairly even.
 World Bank statistics estimate population growth at 1.3
 percent a year; the Caribbean Development Bank estimate is .9
 percent.
 Outward migration from Grenada has been a continually
 significant factor in stabilising the population. Infant
 mortality is estimated by the World Bank to be 22.2 per 1000
 live births in 1984. According to statistics from the
 Ministry of Health, the death rate for infants under one year
 was 31.79 per 1000 in 1981, an increase of 8.07 per 1000 over
 1980. Life expectancy in Grenada is 70.8 years, according to
 World Bank data.
 Some basic level of health care is available to all
 Grenadians. According to Project Hope officials who work with
 the Ministry of Health, a significant health care problem is
 the lack of trained personnel. In addition, although there
 are medical care facilities, including a general hospital, six
 health centers, and several 'visiting stations,* these are not
 always in good repair, and medical equipment is frequently old
 or broken down. Methods of recording births, deaths, and
 diseases are not standardized, and thus it is difficult to
 rely on local statistics to estimate the extent to which the
 population's health needs are met.
 
 
 539
 GRENADA
 Adult literacy, according to the World Bank, was 97.8 percent
 in 1979. However, functional illiteracy is high among youths,
 and was estimated at 30 percent in 1980, according to local
 sources. The primary school enrollment ratio was estimated by
 the World Bank to be 104.5 percent in 1980, and there is
 compulsory education for all children ages 5 to 16. Daily
 attendance is highly variable.
 One hiundred percent of the urban population and 77 percent of
 the rural population had access to safe water in 1975,
 according to World Bank data. This may have declined slightly
 by 1984 due to chronic problems of water distribution in the
 urban area near the capital. The same data indicate that the
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption was almost
 90 percent (1977) of nutritional requirements. Although it is
 estimated that malnutrition is not a significant problem in
 Grenada, due in part to the fertility of the land and
 availability of fruits, vegetables and fish to even the
 poorest individual, nutritional status is impacted by high
 levels of gastroenteritis, with 2,311 cases reported by the
 Ministry of Health in 1982.
 While there is no formal, government-sanctioned discrimination
 against women in Grenada, they frequently are paid slightly
 less than men performing the same work. 'Skilled' jobs for
 women such as in spice factories also tend to be the lowest
 paid jobs. In more highly skilled work, women tend to be
 equally paid, although there are fewer of them. One of nine
 members on the Advisory Council was a woman and two were
 elected to Parliament.
