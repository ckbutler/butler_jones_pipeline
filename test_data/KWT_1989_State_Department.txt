 K JWAIT
 Kuwait's Amirs, drawn from the al-Sabah family, have governed
 the country, in consultation with prominent commercial
 families and other community leaders, for over 200 years. The
 1962 Constitution provides for an elected National Assembly
 and details the powers and relationships of the branches of
 the Government and the rights of the citizens. However, the
 Amir can suspend any or all provisions of the Constitution by
 decree. The National Assembly was dissolved from 1976 to 1981
 and again in 1986 when the Amir cited a breakdown in executive
 and legislative branch cooperation at a time when the nation
 faced serious economic and security problems. Since then, the
 Amir has ruled by decree. In addition to suspending the ,
 National Assembly, the 1986 decrees imposed prior censorship
 on the press and added to existing restrictions on the
 political and civil rights of all Kuwaiti residents. The
 Government, however, rarely violates the integrity of the
 individual. There is an independent judicial system.
 Kuwait's Ministry of the Interior supervises the country's
 security apparatus, including the Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), which is responsible for ordinary criminal
 cases, and the Kuwait State Security (KSS), which investigates
 internal security-related offenses. Both are active in
 investigations of terrorism and both work in collaboration
 with the uniformed police. The security organizations can
 deport foreigners summarily.
 The people of Kuwait enjoy a high standard of living, with an
 estimated per capita gross domestic product of $10,370 in
 1988. Most of the country's income derives from oil
 production and commercial investment. Despite the emphasis
 Kuwait places on its open-market economy, expatriates are not
 allowed to own property or majority shares in significant
 local businesses and are subject to restrictive labor laws,
 which were further tightened in 1989.
 Kuwait's human rights situation in 1989 continued to be
 affected by security concerns stemming from the large
 expatriate population and Iranian-inspired subversion.
 According to newly revised census figures, Kuwaiti citizens
 are now a 28-percent minority in their own country, accounting
 in 1988 for only 535,000 out of a population of 1.9 million.
 The Palestinian community numbers about 300,000. Although an
 Iran-Iraq cease-fire took effect in 1988, the Government
 remained preoccupied in 1989 with the internal security
 threat, and serious restrictions on the civil rights of both
 Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis, many of them imposed by the
 Government during the Iran-Iraq war, remained in place. The
 principal human rights concerns included mistreatment of
 prisoners (in both security and criminal cases); lack of due
 process in trials- af security cases; restrictions on freedoms
 of speech, press, and assembly and the right of citizens to
 change their government; and discrimination and violence
 against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated or condoned
 killings.
 
 
 1456
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were credible reports of beatings and physical abuse of
 prisoners in Kuwait's prisons and deportation centers in 1989,
 including beatings on the soles of prisoners' feet. There
 were unconfirmed reports again in 1989 that torture was used
 by state security police to extract information from some of
 the 22 Shi'a convicted in June of plotting to overthrow the
 Government.
 In routine criminal cases, police and security officials
 occasionally employ physical violence in apprehending and
 interrogating persons suspected of committing criminal acts.
 Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to receive rough treatment than
 Kuwaitis, as are persons suspected of serious crimes. There
 were credible reports that an expatriate received a severe
 beating from local police after he was caught in an illicit
 sexual relationship with a young Kuwaiti woman. The beating
 was used to extract a promise of marriage to the Kuwaiti woman
 in lieu of a jail sentence. Evidence of mistreatment during
 interrogation is a defense in Kuwait's courts, and confessions
 or other evidence obtained through torture are not
 admissible.
 By and large, guards treat inmates humanely in Kuwait's
 prisons, but there have been credible reports of occasional
 beatings. Kuwait's legal process, based primarily on the
 Napoleonic code, is also inspired by Islamic law, but
 punishments such as mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. In 1989 there were no reports of persons being
 detained for political reasons, and no reports of arbitrary
 detention. The penal code affirms a person's right to due
 process and stipulates that a detainee may not be held for
 more than 4 days without charge. A prosecutor's approval is
 required for detention periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter,
 the suspect must either be released or charged by a
 prosecutor, who may authorize detention for up to an
 additional 21 days. Further detention pending trial may be
 authorized by a judge. Warrants are required unless a person
 is apprehended in the act of committing an offense. These
 legal safeguards are generally observed. Bail is commonly set
 in all cases, with the amount depending on the nature of the
 crime. Arrests are generally made openly and for specific
 violations of the law. Reports of incommunicado detention are
 rare. Roadblocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings of
 expatriates, especially of South Asians, are used sporadically
 by the police during searches for illegal immigrants and
 contraband liquor. Persons without proper identification may
 be detained by the police.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a noncitizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled without charge or judicial recourse if the
 authorities deem him to be a troublemaker or a security risk.
 With the passage of a new private sector labor law in March,
 expatriates are also subject to deportation for attempting to
 
 
 1457
 K~UWAIT
 change employers before the end of a 3-year period of work for
 their initial sponsor. Expatriates must leave the country if
 they are unable to find work after being released from initial
 employment. Some expatriates have been held in deportation
 centers for extended periods of time, reportedly up to as long
 as 5 years, if they are unable to provide for their own
 transportation out of the country.
 The Government reported 5,750 deportations for 1988, but this
 figure appears not to include the large number of routine
 deportations for immigration and residency violations which
 constitute a majority of cases. It is estimated that about
 15,000 persons were deported in 1988 and estimates for 1989
 range up to 25,000. These numbers correlate with official
 figures showing a decline in the number of expatriate workers
 employed in the public sector, tighter restrictions on
 expatriates employed in the private sector, and a concerted
 effort in 1989 to regularize the residency status of those
 whose claims to residency as "stateless" persons were, in the
 Government's view, unsubstantiated.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and, except for the
 State Security Court, provides for public trials and the right
 of appeal. Judges are appointed by the Amir on the
 recommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals
 serving as judges usually receive lifetime appointments, while
 the many non-Kuwaiti judges serve under 1- to 3-year
 contracts, which are renewable. Judges may be removed by the
 Justice Ministry for cause, but such removal is rare.
 By law, all defendants in felony cases must be represented by
 attorneys, court-appointed if necessary. In misdemeanor
 cases, which include crimes punishable by less than 3 years'
 imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, and the court is not
 required to appoint a defense attorney. The courts give
 consideration to defendants' allegations of police
 mistreatment in reaching verdicts and sentencing. Defendants
 tried in absentia have the right to an additional appeal.
 Legal representation is of adequate quality, including in
 cases where the defendant is assigned counsel. There are no
 reports of government interference in the issuance of verdicts
 or of discrimination against defense counsel. Translation of
 court proceedings, to ensure that they are understood by
 "non-Arabic-speaking defendants, is sometimes inadequate.
 However, trials before the State Security Court, which
 convenes on an ad hoc basis to handle cases deemed of an
 internal security nature, do not meet international standards
 for fair trial. Composed of judges normally serving in other
 courts, this tribunal, with few exceptions, conducts its
 proceedings in closed sessions. In 1989 opening and closing
 trial sessions were open to the public, but most of the
 substantive court proceedings took place during closed
 sessions. State Security Court decisions may hot be
 appealed. Defendants are permitted to have an attorney, who
 is allowed to conduct an active defense on behalf of the
 accused. In July the State Security Court sentenced 22 of 33
 Shi'a suspected of subversion against the State to prison
 terms ranging from 5 to 15 years. The defendants were charged
 with crimes ranging from the publication of literature
 advocating the overthrow of the Government to the planning. of
 
 
 1458
 KUWAIT
 bombings and assassinations. No death penalties were handed
 down in 1989, and the Amir has yet to approve previous death
 sentences:mandated by the court for terrorist attacks,
 including for an attack on the Amir himself in 1985.
 According to the Constitution, military courts have
 jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the
 armed or security forces, except during periods of martial law
 (which has never been declared in Kuwait). The Amir has the
 power to pardon or commute sentences passed by either civilian
 or military courts and does so through the publication of an
 annual list of commutations following Kuwait's independence
 day, February 25. In 1989 the Amir's commutations covered the
 release of 292 prisoners-held for common crimes and reduced
 sentences-for 434 others. The commutations did not apply to
 terrorists or others convicted by the State Security Court.
 There are not known to be any political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual-privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in
 practice. Search warrants are required, unless the police are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime,
 or there is an indication of the presence of illegal alcohol
 or illegal narcotics. Search warrants to enter premises are
 issued by a public prosecutor; Expatriates, and particularly
 laborers and servants who live in accommodations provided by
 their employers, may have their premises searched by the
 police with authorization only of the employer. Items
 arriving by mail for personal or institutional use are not
 usually opened before delivery unless the contents are
 suspected of being pornographic.
 In 1986 the Government restricted Kuwaiti males, right to
 marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval-in advance
 would henceforth be required. The Government's action
 apparently was motivated by concern over how to meet its
 responsibilities towardithe children of non-Kuwaiti spouses
 residing .outside the country. The Government, and the public
 at large, were also concerned about the growing number of
 Kuwaiti males marrying foreigners rather than Kuwaiti women.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions respecting these freedoms are often
 subject to such conditional phrases as "in accordance with
 conditions and manner specified by law." The Kuwaiti or
 foreign resident feels free to offer his opinion in private
 without fear of official retaliation, but no one may make a
 written or public attack upon the Amir and the ruling family,
 upon Islame or upon leaders of other Arab states. Kuwait has
 an active censorship department, which reviews all books,
 films, videotapes, periodicals, and other-material entering
 Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes. Radio and
 television are government owned and controlled.
 The Amir's July 1986 decrees that amended the press law to
 impose prior censorship on the Kuwaiti press and otherwise
 tighten press curbs remain in effect. These decrees also
 authorized the Government to suspend for up to 2 years any
 publication found to be serving foreign states or
 
 
 1459
 KUIWAIT
 organizations, receiving assistance from foreign sources
 without the approval of the Information Ministry, or
 publishing material conflicting with Kuwait's national
 interests. The revised censorship regulations also toughened
 existing penalties for violators, prescribing prison sentences
 of up to 3 years and fines up to $17,000 for offenses by
 publishers, editors, and journalists.
 As before, the press was forbidden to publish material that
 contained direct criticism of the Amir and the ruling family,
 involved official confidential communications or treaties and
 agreements with other states, might disturb relations with
 Arab and friendly states, or, in a final category, "might
 incite people to ccmmit crimes, create hatred, or spread
 dissension among the people." Prior to the Amir's decrees
 there was selective enforcement of the list of proscribed
 topics; violators were usually only issued warnings. Since
 July 1986, however, government censors have reviewed press
 items before their publication and ensured compliance by
 excising offending material or having it rewritten. There
 were no reports in 1989 of journalists arrested or journals
 confiscated. The daily Al-Rai Al-Aam was suspended for 1 week
 in April for publishing an unauthorized report that the Amir
 would visit Iraq and Egypt. In February Al-Rai Al-Aam went to
 press with a blank space on its editorial page in protest
 against the government's censorship of an editorial calling
 for restoration of press freedoms and the National Assembly.
 An estimated 15 foreign journalists residing in Kuwait and
 associated with local newspapers were summarily deported in
 1986, following the July decrees. There have been no reports
 of deportations since that time.
 Since the July 1986 decrees, senior government officials have
 held periodic meetings with Kuwait's chief editors, at which
 the editors have been encouraged to avoid sensationalism and
 publishing items which may be offensive or harmful to state
 security. By law, publishers lose their license, issued by
 the Information Ministry, if their publication does not appear
 for 6 months. On those topics not proscribed by censorship,
 the Kuwaiti press is vigorous and publishes a variety of
 opinions on numerous Middle East and international issues.
 Academic freedom is subject to the same general restkaints
 that apply to the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned. Political activity finds some
 outlet in informal family-based social gatherings known as
 "diwaniyyas." The Constitution affirms the right to private
 assembly, public meetings, processions, and gatherings which
 are peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three people desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately, but to issue a public
 statement) must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by-ignoring the request.
 Professional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies
 are permitted to establish international contacts without
 government interference. Kuwait university students are
 allowed to organize student groups and to vote for their own
 student representatives in vigorously contested annual
 elections. Campus student groups are active and relatively
 free to express their views on international political issues
 
 
 1460
 KUWAIT
 as long as there is no open discussion of domestic politics.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is absolute"
 but must not "conflict with public policy or morals."
 Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Shari'a (Islamic law)
 is, according to the Constitution, "a main source of
 legislation." The ruling family and most of the prominent
 Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims. There are no restraints
 on worship by Shi'a Muslims,/who constitute about 30 percent
 of Kuwit's population. Kuwait has a tiny Arab Christian
 minority; there are a numbed of expatriate Christian
 congregations and churches.j Expatriate practitioners of
 eastern religions (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists) not
 recognized by Islam are not allowed to establish places of
 worship but may worship privately in their homes.
 Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 Before the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1986,
 Islamic pressure groups within that body were able to secure a
 bar on the granting of citizenship- to non-Muslims, prohibition
 of alcoholic beverages, and partial classroom segregation at
 Kuwait University._ The Government accommodated the National
 Assemblyls 4emands for the application of some fundamentalist
 principles but blocked attempts to apply Islamic law across
 the board. Commercial law, for example, is based on Western
 practice.
 d.  Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. Some restriction on
 foreign travel is applied to young men who have not completed,
 or been exempted from, their compulsory military service.
 Those serving in the military must receive permission from the
 Defense Ministry before traveling abroad. Although there are
 no different legal standards regarding the internal or foreign
 travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands
 can prevent their wives and minor children from leaving the
 country.
 There have been instances in which citizens' passports have
 been suspended temporarily. Generally, this has applied to
 criminal suspects. Representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings must receive prior
 permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no'Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto," the
 Government's policy of revoking the citizenship of some
 Kuwaitis is in contradiction to this rule. In some cases,
 such action has been based on the voluntary acquisition by the
 individual of foreign citizenship. An anomalous situation
 has developed, however, in the case of the so-called stateless
 persons residing in Kuwait who-claim not to have any other
 nationality but who are unable to document their claim to
 Kuwaiti citizenship. Recently, the Government denied civil
 identification cards (entitling the bearer to various state
 services) to persons unable to document their claim to Kuwaiti
 
 
 1461
 KUWAIT
 citizenship. Along with this move, the Ministry of Planning
 altered its census figures, subtracting the stateless persons
 from the total number of Kuwaiti citizens. December 1988
 census figures revealed a decrease from 42 to 28 percent for
 the number of actual Kuwaiti citizens as compared to
 expatriates, which would place the number of stateless persons
 at approximately 270,000 (14 percent of the total
 population). Of this number, the vast majority are presumed
 to be persons of Iraqi or Syrian origin who have asserted
 claims to Kuwaiti citizenship in order to take advantage of
 the generous social benefits which the State provides for full
 citizens. Faced with denial of civil identification cards,
 some of the so-called stateless persons have reasserted their
 original nationality, exited the country, and returned to
 Kuwait as expatriates. Many others have simply left the
 country permanently. However, a minority of the stateless are
 persons of Bedouin origin who can neither claim other
 nationality nor produce documentation of Kuwaiti citizenship.
 It is expected that many stateless persons in this latter *
 category will eventually be allowed to retain their residency
 and/or receive Kuwaiti nationality. Accordingly,.census
 figures for the number of Kuwaiti citizens may be revised
 upwards in the future. In the meantime, many stateless
 persons are in bureaucratic limbo due to the revocation of
 their civil identification cards, which are required for
 obtaining employment and official documents, such as
 automobile and marriage licenses.
 All non-Kuwaitis over the age of 21 residing in Kuwait must be
 sponsored by a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not extend
 permanent residence to its expatriate population, and 1987
 amendments to the alien residence law mandate stiffer
 penalties--fines and, in some cases, prison sentences--for
 expatriates who reside in Kuwait illegally or are not properly
 documented. Employers have the power to restrict both job
 mobility and the continued residence in Kuwait of their
 expatriate employees. Many expatriates (including some
 government employees) must surrender their travel documents to
 their employers, thus preventing them from leaving the country
 without the employer's consent. A new private sector labor
 law further restricted the residency rights of expatriate
 workers, providing that foreigners cannot change employers
 until after a 3-year period of employment with their initial'
 sponsor. Those employed by government agencies are given
 residence visas, which require an exit permit or "no
 objection" letter in order for the expatriate to leave the
 country. In accordance with the law, non-Kuwaitis convicted
 of crimes are routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries. Exceptions have been made for those, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees. Some of these persons have been
 permitted to remain in Kuwait or have been sent to third
 countries. While most members of Kuwait's large Palestinian
 population have Jordanian passports, others are stateless and
 carry Lebanese or other Arab laissez-passers. Expatriate
 youths over 21 years of age who travel or study outside Kuwait
 often have difficulty rejoining their families in Kuwait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Kuwait has no formal democratic institutions. Consequently,
 most of its citizens do not have a say in the choice of
 
 
 1462
 
 leaders or in changing the political system. The 1962
 Constitution limited succession to the position of Amir to
 descendants of Mubarak the Great, the ruler at the turn of
 this century. In practice, the ruler and senior family
 members choose the crown prince from either the Al-Jaber or
 the Al-Salem branch of the Al-Sabah family. Under the
 Constitution this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the
 National Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler
 and, under him, in an appointed Council of Ministers,
 currently numbering 24, headed by the Crown Prince, who
 traditionally serves also as Prime Minister.
 At independence Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies elected by secret ballot, plus Cabinet
 members' sitting ex officio. The electoral law provides that
 candidates for the National Assembly be self-nominated, with
 multiple candidates permitted to compete for the 50 seats. A
 "grandfather clause" effectively limits suffrage to adult
 males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a
 residence there until 1959, and their adult male descendants.'
 In 1986 the National Assembly approved an amendment to the
 1966 Nationality Law that delayed for 10 years, until 1996,
 the granting of voting rights to Kuwait's so-called second
 category citizens. The latter are certain long-time Arab and
 non-Arab residents who do not meet the "pre-1920"
 qualification. The Nationality Law was further amended in
 1987 to extend from 20 to 30 years the period that naturalized
 Kuwaitis must wait before acquiring the right to vote.
 Efforts since 1982 to gain suffrage for women have been
 unsuccessful. DiStinctions made on the basis of parentage,
 length of iesidence, and gender establsh a limited class of
 citizenship with the privilege to participate in the political
 system.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir
 in July 1986, remains in effect. The 1986 decrees also
 suspended various constitutional provisions, including Article
 107, which t ecified that, withfn2 months of the Assembly's
 dissolut6ioni either special elections be held for a new
 Assembly or-the dissolved one be reinstated. The Assembly was
 previously dissolved in 1976 and reinstated in 1981. In the
 Assembly's absence, the-Amir rules by decrees having'the force
 of law.
 The dissolution of the Assembly in 1986 reptesented a setback
 for citizens' political rights. Far from being a rubber
 stamp, the Assembly had served over the years as an important
 forum for the expression of diverse political views, some
 sharply at odds with those of the Government.
 There have been reports of former parliamentarians petitioning
 the Amir in 1987, 1988, and 1989 for the Assembly's
 restoration.- In February Kuwait university students initiated
 an active petition drive, supported by a number of university
 professors who were formerly parliamentarians, advocating the
 return of democratic government. Reports indicated that the
 petitions were still in circulation at the end of the year.
 The Government has recently instituted local government
 councils in each of the five governorates. These councils are
 intended to give Kuwaiti citizens more of a voice in issues of
 immediate concern in their daily lives (e.g., sanitation,
 security, and other government services). Many council
 members are former parliamentarians who have traditionally
 supported the Governmenti
 
 
 1463
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their
 leaders, including the heads of the prominent merchant clans
 and the ruling family itself, through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal family-based discussion groups to which
 anyone can come and freely speak his mind. That custom has
 endured, as has the tradition that the Amir should govern in
 consultation with other community leaders. Following the
 Assembly's dissolution in 1986, cabinet ministers instituted
 the practice of setting aside several hours a week to receive
 the public in their offices.
 While most male Kuwaiti citizens can participate directly or
 indirectly in the political process, noncitizens, who greatly
 outnumber Kuwaitis, have no role. Kuwait has been reluctant
 to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, and
 naturalization of even Kuwait-born persons is rare.
 Citizenship has been extended only to a few Palestinian
 families who made significant contributions to Kuwait before
 the early 1970's. The Government established a committee to
 revise criteria for granting citizenship, but to date it has
 been without effect. Expatriates seldom engage in political
 activities for fear of exposing themselves to possible
 deportation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has permitted visits by representatives of
 international human rights organizations. In its 1989 Report,
 covering 1988, Amnesty International (AI) cited instances in
 which it had sought and obtained information on several
 prisoner cases. It noted one case, however, in which it had
 not been able to examine the contents of leaflets produced as
 evidence of advocacy of violence against defendants tried by
 the State Security Court.
 Some prominent Kuwaitis are members of international human
 rights organizations, such as the Arab Organization of Human
 Rights.
 There are no nongovernmental human rights groups in Kuwait
 that deal with domestic human rights. The Government has an
 in-house council on human rights, composed of senior officials
 and working-level experts, but it is difficult to gauge its
 effectiveness since no information about its activities is
 published.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in the society,
 though less so than in some other Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Women have the right to litigate against men
 (for example, in child custody suits). In recent years, more
 
 
 1464
 KUWAIT
 Kuwaiti women have joined the work force and compete for
 government and corporate employment. Some women have reached
 senior government positions, up to the level of assistant
 under secretary and director general. Women are well
 represented in the field of education through the university
 level. In 1986 the Government named the first woman
 prosecutor. Kuwaiti women have also represented Kuwait in
 international financial meetings.
 The Government publicly encourages respectful treatment of
 women, and Article 160 of the Kuwaiti criminal law of 1960
 states that a person who "beats or injures, or causes bodily
 harm or exposes another person's body to disrespect" may be
 sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 2 years and subject
 to fine,. The Government produces no-official statistics on
 domestic abuse. However, a 1986 study indicated that one out
 of three Kuwaiti women surveyed admitted to being subjected to
 insulting or degrading treatment by their husbands, while some
 10 percent claimed to have been beaten by their husbands.
 Most wives do not report abuse because of the social stigma
 that is attached to legal proceedings in such cases. Kuwaiti
 police will intervene in domestic disputes but only in cases
 of visible abuse., Otherwise, there is a marked reticence on
 the part of police to intervene in domestic affairs. Husbands
 arrested in such cases are often verbally admonished and then
 released without charge. There are a large number of
 expatriate (South and Southeast Asian) female domestic
 servants in Kuwait. Although physical and sexual abuse of
 maids is punishable by law, and the press regularly reports
 some of the worst cases, mistreatment of female domestic
 servants is persistent. In at least two instances,
 highlighted by the press in 1989, domestic servants died as a
 result of mistreatment by employers. In both cases, the
 employers were tried and sentenced to prison terms with hard
 labor. Although domestic servants are able to take legal
 recourse against their employers if they so choose, many cases
 involving the abuse of domestic servants go unreported due to
 fear of repercussions from employers.
 There is no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the
 administration of Kuwait's extensive social welfare programs,
 designed to provide housing, family allowances, retirement
 income, medical care, education, and employment. Members of
 Kuwait's Shila minority are less likely to be appointed to
 sensitive government positions. There are credible reports of
 Shila employees in the oil industry in 1987 losing their jobs,
 being transferred to other departments, or denied promotion
 following the series of oil field bombings, attributed to
 Shi'a. Nonetheless, many have achieved great wealth, and
 there is no evidence that they are discriminated against in
 matters of social welfare.
 Foreign residents do not share in many of the rights and
 benefits Kuwaiti nationals enjoy. A new commercial law now
 allows for 100-percent foreign ownership of small commercial
 establishments, such as restaurants and shops, but 51-percent
 Kuwaiti ownership is still required for businesses of
 meaningful size. White-collar and skilled expatriate workers
 earn the same base pay as Kuwaitis but receive less in fringe
 benefits. Benefits restricted to Kuwaiti citizens include
 additional government stipends and social allowances and, in
 general, retirement pensions. Kuwaiti citizens also usually
 receive higher government salaries.. Resident expatriates are
 entitled to medical benefits. Public schooling is offered,
 with some exceptions, only to children of expatriates who

 arrived in Kuwait prior to 1957, although the Government
 subsidizes tuition for students in a number of Arabic-language
 elementary and secondary schools. Kuwaitis are given
 preference for admission to the University of Kuwait. Because
 of limited space for new enrollees, non-Kuwaiti university
 entrants may equal no more than 10 percent of the number of
 Kuwaiti entrants. Unskilled expatriate workers usually are
 not permitted to bring their families to Kuwait.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to establish and join unions.
 Kuwait's labor movement has about 27,000 members, organized
 into 13 unions. All but one of the 13, that of the bank
 workers, are affiliated with the Kuwait Federation of Trade
 Unions (KFTU). Expatriate workers, who comprise about 80
 percent of the roughly 700,000-strong labor force, are
 permitted to join unions after 5 years' residence but only as
 nonvoting members who cannot hold office. Kuwait labor law
 stipulates that any new union must include at least 100
 workers, 15 of whom must be Kuwaitis. Unions are independent
 organizations, though the Government maintains a large
 supervisory role with regard to union financial records.
 Unions must also follow a standard format for internal rules
 and constitutions which includes a prohibition on any
 involvement in domestic political, sectarian, or religious
 issues. Kuwaiti law prevents the establishment of more than
 one union per functional area.
 The vast majority of union members are Kuwaitis. The KFTU,
 grouping together nine civil service unions and three oil
 sector unions, is a member of the International Confederation
 of Arab Trade Unions as well as the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 The right to strike is recognized but is limited by Kuwait's
 labor law, which provides for compulsory negotiation followed
 by arbitration if a settlement cannot be reached between labor
 and management (see Section 6.b.). In recent years there have
 been few work stoppages, and in 1989 there were no reports of
 any. The tranquil labor/management relations situation stems
 in large part from a generous social welfare system and the
 Government's willingness to provide employment for Kuwaitis in
 the public sector, which features one of the most liberal
 government retirement systems in the world.
 Kuwaiti labor law has a provision allowing for compulsory
 dissolution of any union that "commits an act considered to be
 violating the provisions of this law and of the laws connected
 with the preservation of public order and morals." Under the
 law, a union can only be dissolved by a court decision; such a
 court decision can be appealed. No union has been dissolved
 in this manner.
 Union activity is concentrated in the government, banking, and
 oil sectors. Union members have the right to elect
 representatives of their own choosing provided the candidates
 can obtain a "good conduct certificate" (absence of criminal
 record). While non-Kuwaiti workers do not enjoy the same
 union rights as Kuwaitis, there is little display of
 discontent among expatriate workers. There are several
 reasons for this: most expatriates are drawn to Kuwait by
 comparatively high wages; the Government will summarily deport
 
 
 1466
 KUWAIT
 any non-Kuwaiti deemed a troublemaker; and a non-Kuwaiti
 cannot remain in Kuwait without employer sponsorship.
 The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts
 (COE) for a number of years has criticized various
 restrictions contained in the Kuwaiti labor code as being in
 contravention of Convention 87 on Freedom of Association.
 Many of these defects are reported to have been eliminated in
 a draft revised labor code under consideration by the
 Government, but the COE noted in early 1989 that the text of
 the new code was not available. It is not certain when the
 Government may adopt a revised labor code.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Union rights are incorporated in the labor law
 and generally respected in practice. Article 78 of the Kuwait
 labor law states that any employer who "terminates or inflicts
 any penalty on a laborer for the purpose of forcing him to
 join, refrain from joining, or to withdraw from any trade
 union" must either rectify the contravention or be subject to
 fines. Discrimination against union or nonunion employees is
 rare.
 Kiwaiti labor law provides for direct negotiations between
 employers and "laborers or their representatives." If an
 amicable agreement is not reached, the parties may petition
 the Ministry of-Labor and Social Affairs for settlement. If -
 no agreed solution is reached by this.means, the dispute is
 referred to a Labor Arbitration Board composed of officials
 representing the High.Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
 There are no export processing zones in Kuwait.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Kuwaiti'Constitution prohibits forced labor "except in
 cases-specified by law for national emergency and with just
 remuneration.". This prohibition appears to be generally
 respected.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age under Kuwait law is 18 years for full-time
 work and 14 years for part-time work. This law appears to be
 generally observed and enforced, particularly in urban areas,
 by both labor inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs and truant officers of the Ministry of Education.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sector, with the oil
 industry treated separately. The law limits the workweek to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days' leave per year,
 and establishes a compensation schedule for industrial
 accidents. Reflecting the importance of the petroleum
 industry in Kuwait, the law governing employment in this
 sector is more generous than the general laws. It provides
 for a 40-hour workweek, overtime pay for shift work, 30 days'
 annual leave, and a generous sick leave policy. Women are
 permitted to work, except in "dangerous industries and trades
 
 
 1467
 K~UWAIT
 harmful to the health," and are promised "equal remuneration
 to that of a man provided she does the same work." There is
 no legal minimum wage, but this has little impact since Kuwait
 is not a low-wage country.
 By and large, employers appear to respect provisions of the
 labor law and provide suitable working conditions, although
 abuses occur in the treatment of unskilled foreign workers,
 particularly household maids and servants. There were
 credible reports that sizable groups of South Asian expatriate
 workers doing manual labor were not paid promised salaries in
 1988, with similar reports of underpayment of salaries for
 servants and laborers in 1989. In May the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs issued a regulation requiring private
 companies to establish monetary guarantee funds for their
 employees. Private firms are required te set aside
 approximately $525-875, depending on the size of the company,
 as insurance against nonpayment of wages. The labor law does
 not apply to domestic servants and "sea workers."
 A 1979 ministerial decree created a permanent commission to
 coordinate activities in-the field of public health and
 occupational safety. It has had some success in raising
 safety awareness and improving government coordination. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs actively enforces the
 labor laws, and there are penalties for such violations as
 nonpayment or underpayment of wages.
