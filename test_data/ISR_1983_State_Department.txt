 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy which guarantees by law and
 respects in practice the civil, political, and religious rights
 of its citizens. It has an independent judiciary, free
 elections, a multiparty political system, and an elected
 legislature (the Knesset) which may restrict the Government by
 legislation and can bring it down by a vote of no confidence.
 Israeli society is characterized by its openness and by its
 wide-ranging and lively public debate of all issues of popular
 concern. Police and internal security functions are under the
 control of cabinet ministers who must answer to the Knesset
 concerning the actions of personnel for whom they are
 responsible and whose performance is subject to the scrutiny of
 a free press.
 From its founding in 1948 until 1979; a formal state of war
 existed between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors. In 1979,
 as provided in the Camp David Accords, Egypt and Israel signed
 a peace treaty; pursuant to the treaty, Israel returned to
 Egypt, over a three-year period, the portion of the Sinai
 Peninsula that had been under its control since the 1967 war.
 Israelis doubt the sincerity of the claim of other Arab states
 regarding acceptance of Israel's right to exist on the basis of
 U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Terrorist
 incidents within Israel and the absence of peace treaties
 between Israel and its other Arab neighbors make security a
 dominant concern that affects many facets of Israel's national
 life.
 The presence of an Arab minority presents Israel with the
 challenge of accommodating within its society a group which
 does not share the Zionist principles upon which the state was
 founded.
 Israeli forces continued to occupy part of Lebanon during
 1983. On May 17, Israel concluded an agreement with the
 Lebanese Government which provided, inter alia, for the
 withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, a step which Israel
 predicated on the removal of other foreign forces. On
 September 3, Israel redeployed its forces from the Shuf region
 to the Awali River. On November 24, there was an exchange of
 prisoners involving Israel and the Palestine Liberation
 Organization (PLO). Israel released approximately 4,500
 detainees, predominantly Palestinians and Lebanese, in return
 for six Israeli soldiers held by the PLO. In December, about
 4,000 PLO combatants were evacuated from Tripoli, Lebanon.
 Diplomatic efforts in 1983 to bring about the withdrawal of
 Syrian and other PLO forces from Lebanon did not succeed.
 In the wake of the massacre of Palestinians that occurred in
 the Sabra and Shatila camps near Beirut in September 1982,
 Israel established an independent Commission of Inquiry headed
 by Supreme Court Justice Yitzhak Kahan. In its findings,
 *Because of the sharply differing socio-political environments
 in Israel and in the Arab territories which Israel has occupied
 since the 1967 war, the respective human rights situations are
 treated in separate but parallel fashion. The report on the
 occupied territories follows the report for Israel.

 issued in February 1983, the Commission determined that seven
 Israeli civilian and military officials had been remiss in not
 foreseeing the consequences of permitting Lebanese Phalangist
 forces to enter the camps and in not reacting more effectively
 to early reports of atrocities taking place there. As a result
 of the Commission's findings, the Defense Minister relinquished
 his portfolio, the Chief of Military Intelligence was relieved
 of duty, and the Beirut sector commander was reassigned.
 In 1983, the most significant human rights problems for Israel
 derived from the strained relations between the Israeli
 authorities and the Arab inhabitants of the occupied
 territories. These problems were exacerbated as a consequence
 of the Government's continued implementation of its policy of
 strengthening, expanding, and developing Jewish settlements in
 those areas.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 market economy with substantial governmental participation and
 controlled prices for basic commodities. Israeli economic
 policy has been oriented toward social welfare. In recent
 years, Israel has experienced increasing balance of payments
 deficits, rising foreign debt, and triple-digit inflation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitary Deprivation of Life
 There is no indication of such practices by Israeli
 authorities. There have been, however, incidents of
 deprivation of life as a result of terrorist acts. In
 December, six persons were killed and 43 were wounded when an
 Israeli bus in West Jerusalem was destroyed by a terrorist
 bomb; elements of the PLO claimed responsibility for the
 attack, although others associated with the PLO denied its
 involvement. In February, a Jewish demonstrator protesting
 aspects of the Government's Lebanon policy was killed by a
 grenade. In January 1984, an Israeli Jew was arrested in
 connection with the murder.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no reports of such a practice in Israel.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited in Israel, and there were no
 confirmed reports of their occurrence in 1983. Evidence or
 confessions obtained under duress are inadmissable in court,
 and the administrative codes of conduct of the prison and
 police authorities contain stringent sanctions against the use
 of force or brutality. Police officers accused of brutality or
 violence against prisoners or suspects may be prosecuted either
 in administrative courts for violation of the code of conduct
 or in regular criminal courts for criminal assault.
 
 
 1284
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural
 and substantive safeguards are available. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention can be employed in security-related
 cases when it is determined to the satisfaction of a judge that
 formally charging a person would cause sensitive sources of
 evidence to be compromised. Any individual under
 administrative detention is entitled to representation by
 counsel and must be brought before the president of the
 appropriate district court within 48 hours of being taken into
 custody. Each case of administrative detention must be
 submitted to judicial review at least every three months
 thereafter for the entire period of detention. The decision of
 the president of the district court can be appealed to the
 Supreme Court. There were no reports of instances of
 administrative detention in 1983.
 For most of 1983, Israel continued to hold as many as 5,000
 prisoners who were captured during and after the June 1982
 invasion of Lebanon, including members of armed Palestinian and
 Lebanese groups and Syrian forces. In addition, Israeli
 occupation forces made new arrests.
 On November 24, through negotiations facilitated by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a prisoner
 exchange was arranged involving Israel and the PLO.
 Approximately 4,500 prisoners, predominantly Palestinians and
 Lebanese from the Ansar Camp in southern Lebanon, were
 exchanged for six Israelis. The Ansar camp was then closed,
 but it was reopened later in the year to house additional
 detainees, mostly Lebanese. At year's end, there were beleived
 to be about 80 prisoners in the re-opened Ansar Camp, and
 approximately 50 prisoners, also predominantly Lebanese, at a
 facility in Nabatiyah.
 Israel does not accord prisoner-of-war status under the Third
 Geneva Convention to prisoners captured during and after the
 Lebanese conflict who were not members of the armed forces of
 another country. Israel has maintained, however, that such
 detainees are treated in accordance with the provisions of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention in all matters relating to the
 guarantee of humane treatment and conditions of internment. It
 has stated that under the Fourth Geneva Convention it has the
 right to intern persons who constitute a danger to the security
 of the detaining power or its armed forces. The Israeli
 Supreme Court has confirmed the applicability of the standards
 of the Fourth Convention, while holding that, for security
 reasons, Israel is permitted to deny the detainees access to
 family members and legal counsel. Israel has permitted ICRC
 representatives to visit the detainees regularly.
 In addition, Israel continued during the year to hold in Israel
 281 Syrian military personnel captured during the June 1982
 war. (Israel has released to the ICRC 12 ill Syrian
 prisoners.) These prisoners are accorded the status of
 prisoners of war pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention.
 Representatives of the ICRC have been allowed access to them.
 
 
 1285
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 in Israel is independent and effectively insulated from
 political interference. With the exception of security cases,
 all trials are open. In security cases, Israeli law provides
 that part or all of a trial may be closed, with the burden of
 justifying in camera proceedings falling on the prosecution.
 Counsel is present during closed proceedings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of homelife and
 correspondence are fully protected. There are effective legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, limited only by security-based
 censorship provisions, are basic rights in Israel. These
 rights are protected by law and the judiciary, and are broadly
 exercised by citizens and individuals and by an independent and
 vigorous press, which expresses a wide variety of political
 opinion.
 Media censorship is based on British Mandatory emergency
 regulations, according to which the censor may prohibit the
 publication of material which, in his opinion, will harm the
 defense of Israel, the public safety, or public order.
 Censorship decisions may be appealed through the judiciary. In
 practice, censorship of the media is usually limited to
 military security matters. Israeli radio and television are
 run by the independent Israel Broadcast Authority (IBA). The
 Government helps to fund the IBA and appoints its governing
 board, but has almost no control over programming. The
 independence of the IBA is protected by law, subject to the
 censorship provisions.
 Licenses to publish newspapers are required and normally are
 routinely issued. There have been reports, however, that
 applications from Israeli Arabs are scrutinized more clcsely
 than others and sometimes turned down without explanation. In
 March, an Israeli Arab was arrested and released on bail for
 publishing a local paper after he was refused a license by a
 regional official on the basis of the emergency regulations.
 Movies and theater are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic or otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores or likely to create a disturbance of public order. In
 1983, three films were banned, two for pornographic content and
 one because it was deemed harmful to the Israel Defense
 Forces. The Government lodged charges against two Israelis
 responsible for staging a play, "The Patriot," in defiance of
 censorship. The courts, however, permitted the play to be
 performed, thus establishing a precedent denying prior
 restraint of speech.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These are basic rights in Israel, protected, along with the
 right to demonstrate, by law and rulings of the courts. In the
 
 
 1286
 case of political rallies and outdoor meetings beyond an
 established size, permits are required and routinely granted.
 Israeli law forbids tangible public manifestations of support
 for organizations defined as terrorist in nature. Proscribed
 acts include flying the Palestinian flag, displaying
 Palestinian nationalist slogans, and publicly expressing
 support for the PLO. In May, an Israeli Arab who raised a
 Palestinian flag during a march in his village was sentenced to
 five months in jail, with an additional three years suspended.
 Israel has a free and democratic labor movement. The General
 Federation of Labor (Histadrut), Israel's most powerful labor
 organization, comprises 1,600,000 adult members or over 85
 percent of the working population. The membership includes
 160,000 Israeli Arabs or 60 percent of the adult Arab
 population. Israeli workers, including those in the public
 sector, make frequent use of the right to strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel was founded as a Jewish state in which all citizens are
 guaranteed freedom of religion by law. (Muslims, Christians,
 Druze, and other minority religions make up about 17 percent of
 the population.)  The prevailing interpretation of the Jewish
 nature of the state has been secular and not religious. All
 religious groups may maintain contacts with their
 coreligionists outside Israel. Foreign clergy are permitted to
 live in Israel to minister to their coreligionists. Several
 thousand Israeli Muslims make the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca each
 year. There is no operating seminary for Muslim clergy and
 religious functionaries in Israel. Muslims may obtain such
 training in institutions in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, or
 Egypt. The International Center of the Baha'i religion is
 located in Haifa.
 Israel has retained the Ottoman millet system under which each
 religious community is governed in matters of personal status
 by its own religious law and not by civil law. This feature of
 Israeli law gives each religious community great freedom to
 observe its own customs and religion within the area where the
 millet system applies but sometimes causes serious
 inconvenience to individuals who do not follow the dominant
 tradition within one religious community. These difficulties
 do not normally arise in religious worship but do occur in
 areas such as marriage or conversion to Judaism. Within the
 Jewish community, the Orthodox tradition has a dominant
 position.
 A law enacted in 1978 prohibits the offering of bribes or
 material benefits as inducements to religious conversion. In a
 clarification placed in the Knesset record in 1979, the
 Minister of Justice stated that the law is not intended to
 restrict the religious freedom of any community or to impede
 any community from the pursuit of normal educational or
 philanthropic activities. The Attorney General has ordered
 that no action be taken under the law without his express
 permission, and the law has not been employed. It nevertheless
 continues to cause uneasiness among some Christian groups.
 The Law of Return of 1950 (which abolished all restrictions on
 Jewish immigration) and the Citizenship Law of 1952 (which
 granted every Jew the right to citizenship upon arrival in
 Israel) confer an advantage on Jews in matters of immigration
 and citizenship.
 
 
 1287
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country
 and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate, subject to
 governmental review to determine whether military
 service-related obligations have been satisfied. Emergency
 regulations, however, provide that Israeli citizens, by
 military order, may be confined to their neighborhoods or
 villages or barred from travelling to the occupied
 territories. Restrictions of this nature have been applied
 most often to Israeli Arabs. For example, one such individual,
 convicted of belonging to what was described as a hostile
 organization, was confined to his village following his release
 from prison in 1981. In 1983, the confinement order was
 relaxed to permit him to travel within Israel.
 Since 1948, Israel has taken in over a million Jewish refugees
 from Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa and has worked
 toward integrating them into its society and economy.
 Integration of smaller numbers of immigrants continued during
 the year.
 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11,
 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab refugees who left their
 homes in the 1947-48 fighting to return if they are willing to
 live in peace or to be compensated for their losses if they
 choose. Israel has not recognized the validity of this
 resolution, pointing out the losses to its own citizens who
 fled Arab states; it has, however, on occasion indicated
 willingness to take back some refugees in the context of a
 final peace settlement.
 The legal status of the Hebrew-Israelite community (usually
 known as Black Hebrews), which numbers about 1,200 members,
 remained unchanged since the 1982 report. While many community
 members are long-term residents of Israel, having settled in
 the early 1970's, few are in the country legally. They are
 able to exit Israel but cannot return. Approximately 80 Black
 Hebrews renounced their American citizenship and may be
 considered stateless, as the Government of Israel does not
 accept their claim to immigrant status under the Law of Return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system.
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to vote for
 candidates of their choice and to participate in the political
 process.
 There is no legal prohibition against Arab or Arab-oriented
 political parties, but efforts to form such parties have not
 been successful. Israeli Arabs are included in the Knesset
 election lists of several of the Zionist parties, and a
 majority of the Arab electorate voted for Zionist parties in
 the 1981 national elections. Five of the 120 members of the
 Knesset are from the Israeli Arab and Druze communities. The
 non-Zionist Israeli Communist Party, Rakah, derives most of
 its support from Israeli Arabs. In the 1981 elections, the
 Rakah slate won four seats in the Knesset.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 82
 
 
 1288
 Women participate freely in the Israeli political process and
 account for more than 40 percent of the political party
 membership. Nine members of the Knesset are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an office of human rights in the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and several human rights groups
 in Israel work for the protection of individual liberties and
 women's rights. Private groups, such as the Israeli League
 for Human and Civil Rights, the Association for Civil Rights
 in Israel, and Peace Now, freely criticize Israeli Government
 actions in Israel, the occupied territories, and Lebanon.
 They issue statements and reports, hold press conferences, and
 organize demonstrations without governmental interference.
 The Government permits visits to Israel by representatives of
 private international human rights groups, as well as UNESCO,
 WHO, and the ILO. While disputing the applicability of the
 relevant Geneva Conventions, the Government permits the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit
 prisoners in Israel and the occupied territories and, after an
 initial delay, permitted the ICRC to have access to the
 prisoners captured as a result of the war in Lebanon. The
 Govetnment also investigates and replies to inquiries by
 organizations such as Amnesty International. Amnesty
 International is currently investigating the cases of 41
 Israel Defense Forces reservists imprisoned for refusing to
 serve in Lebanon on grounds of conscience. Freedom House
 considers Israel *free"; it does not characterize the
 situation in the occupied territories.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Israel is about four million and has been
 increasing by about 1.7 percent a year. Per capita gross
 national product (GNP) is about $5,425. Unemployment in 1983
 was about five percent.
 Israel has been beset by severe economic problems in recent
 years, with increasing balance of payments deficits, a large
 foreign debt, and triple-digit inflation (190.7 percent in
 1983) the most serious concerns. A complex system of indexing
 (which ties salaries, most financial assets, and pensions to
 the consumer price index) has protected most of the population
 from the damaging effects of the high inflation. The
 Government, concerned by the distorting effect of inflation on
 the economy, has attempted to reduce the rate of price
 increases, but with little success. Israel historically has
 run a balance of payments deficit in order to provide the
 resources to absorb large-scale immigration in the early years
 of statehood, maintain a high defense capability, and raise
 the general standard of living. In recent years, the
 worldwide recession and the strength of the dollar have hurt
 Israeli exports, thereby increasing the payments deficit.
 Substantial financial assistance from abroad, public and
 private, has helped Israel cover the payments gap.
 State education in either secular or religious schools is free
 and compulsory for all Israeli citizens through age 15. The
 primary school enrollment ratio is about 97 percent and the
 adult literacy rate about 81 percent (88 percent for Jews and
 
 
 1289
 48 percent for Arabs). The parallel education systems in
 Israel for Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic
 respectively, show a disparity in quality, with greater
 resources per student going into the Jewish system.
 Israel has an advanced health care system with a high doctor
 to patient ratio. Life expectancy is 72.5 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is 14.1 per 1,000 live births. Although
 safe drinking water is available to the entire population,
 6,000 cases of viral hepatitis were reported in 1982.
 One-third of these were soldiers returning from active duty in
 Lebanon. Figures for the first nine months of 1983 showed a
 10 percent decline in reported cases.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is held by the state
 or quasi-public organizations in trust for the Jewish people.
 According to law, anyone may purchase the remaining seven
 percent of privately-owned land through ordinary commercial
 transactions.
 The Israeli Arab minority has equal rights under the law in
 most respects, and Israeli Arabs have made substantial
 educational and material progress since the founding of the
 state. Some have risen to responsible positions in the civil
 service, generally in the Arab departments of government
 ministries.
 Israeli Arabs, however, are relatively powerless and tend to
 feel alienated. Despite some governmental and private efforts
 to bridge the gap, there is little social interaction with
 Israeli Jews. Israeli Arabs complain that they are denied
 equal access to education, housing, and other services, and
 that they are discriminated against in such areas as
 employment and appointment to government positions.
 Government grants to Arab local councils represent a smaller
 percentage of the budgets of these bodies than is the case for
 government grants to Jewish municipalities. While Arabs make
 up about 16 percent of the population of Israel, less than two
 percent of the persons in senior government positions are
 Arabs, less than three percent of Israeli judges are Arabs,
 and no large bank, industrial enterprise, or agricultural
 undertaking in Israel is headed by an Israeli Arab. Israeli
 Arabs make up three percent of university students and less
 than one percent of the academic positions in Israeli
 universities.
 Druze and Circassians are subject to Israel's military draft,
 and some Bedouin serve voluntarily in special units. Other
 Muslims and Christians are not permitted to serve and
 therefore do not qualify for many of the important economic
 and social benefits that derive from military service. In
 1983, the issue of providing veteran child allowances to
 Yeshiva students who had not served in the defense forces, but
 not to Arabs who also do not perform army service, was debated
 in the Knesset and widely discussed in the media. The
 Attorney General expressed concern that the exclusion of one
 group but not the other could be interpreted as unfairly
 discriminatory. Two Arab members of the Knesset challenged
 the legality of the allowances to the Yeshiva students in the
 Supreme Court, and the Attorney General ruled that the
 allowances must be stopped.
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by law as well as by
 governmental and private organizations. The Equal Opportunity
 
 
 1290
 Law forbids discrimination on account of sex or marital or
 parental status, and employers are legally bound to pay female
 workers a wage equal to that paid male workers for the same or
 generally similar work. Laws and regulations also provide for
 protection of the rights of female employees with respect to
 pregnancy and childbirth. The Prime Minister's office
 includes an adviser on the status of women, and the Civil
 Service Commission and several government ministries have
 officers responsible for promoting fair treatment for women
 and ensuring that the rights of women are protected. A number
 of non-governmental women's organizations also work to advance
 the status of women, ensure equal opportunity in all fields,
 and offer family services such as child care for working
 mothers.
 Over 40 percent of university graduates are women, as are 39
 percent of the work force. Women account for approximately
 two-thirds of the instructors employed in the educational
 system. They occupy about one-fifth of the senior positions
 of the professional grade of the career civil service, are
 well-represented in professional and technical jobs in the
 media, and work in a broad range of the professions and other
 occupations.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories that Israel has occupied since 1967 consist of
 the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza
 Strip. The West Bank and Gaza remain under military
 government. Israel regards East Jerusalem and the Golan
 Heights as subject to Israeli law, jurisdiction, and
 administration.
 The U.N. Security Council and General Assembly have adopted
 resolutions, in which the U.S. concurs, asserting that Israel's
 presence in all these territories is that of an occupying
 power. As such, Israel's governance is subject to the Hague
 Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention
 concerning the protection of civilian populations under
 military occupation.
 Israel declares that it voluntarily observes most of the Fourth
 Geneva Convention's provisions with respect to the West Bank
 and Gaza, even though it does not accept that these areas are
 within the purview of the Convention. Major differences have
 arisen in regard to the applicability of these provisions to
 the introduction of civilian settlers and the use of certain
 forms of punishment, such as collective punishment, in the
 occupied territories. Israel declares that measures of this
 nature are necessary for security reasons.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied territories,
 particularly in the West Bank where the majority of the settled
 Arab population is located, is largely the result of friction
 between occupation authorities and the indigenous Arab
 population. Israel implements policy in the West Bank and Gaza
 through separate civil administrations. These were created in
 1981 and are under the control of the Ministry of Defense.
 They are staffed by military as well as civilian personnel.
 Israel's national police, border police, security service, and
 the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) all have a role in the
 administration of the occupied territories. While the national
 police, which includes local Palestinians in its ranks, is
 seldom the target of criticism, there are frequent complaints
 by West Bankers and Gazans about the actions of the other
 organizations.
 Israel continued in 1983 to establish and expand Jewish
 settlements in the occupied territories, notably and most
 controversially in populous areas of the West Bank. The
 Palestinian inhabitants have been concerned that this and
 associated Israeli practices, including the evolution of a
 different system of laws for the settlers, might be intended to
 lay the groundwork for Israel's eventual annexation of the West
 Bank and Gaza. This concern has been exacerbated by repeated
 statements by the Israeli governing coalition that, at the end
 of the transitional period called for in the Camp David
 Framework, Israel would assert a claim to sovereignty over
 these areas. (The Camp David Framework provides for a
 five-year transitional period for the West Bank and Gaza,
 during which negotiations are to take place to determine their
 final status.) In addition, the scarcity of water in most
 parts of the West Bank and Gaza has constrained both
 agriculture and urban development. As a result, water has
 remained a contentious issue between resident Palestinians and
 the occupying Israelis.
 
 
 1293
 Civil administration authorities have attempted to reshape
 local politics, particularly by blocking the influence of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and by promoting an
 alternate leadership. Israeli support of the quasi-political
 organizations in the West Bank known as the Village Leagues,
 however, diminished in 1983.
 Israel permitted municipal elections to take place in the West
 Bank in 1972 and 1976 but postponed, without rescheduling, the
 elections that were to be held in 1980. Since then, the
 occupation authorities, citing security considerations, have
 removed numbers of elected and appointed officials in the West
 Bank and Gaza. Israel has allowed the establishment of four
 universities in the West Bank where none had existed before (as
 well as a university in Gaza) but has deported faculty members
 for taking political stands that it regards as threatening to
 its security. Israel has permitted outspoken criticism of
 Israeli policy by the East Jerusalem-based Arabic press but has
 often censored articles and editorials on stated security
 grounds and restricted the circulation of Arabic publications
 in the West Bank and Gaza. In addition, Israel has imposed
 broad restrictions on speech and assembly in those areas.
 Arab and Jewish residents continued to suffer from terrorist
 acts in 1983. Historically, responsibility for such acts has
 been claimed by Palestinian organizations located outside the
 occupied territories. In addition, continuing violence by
 settlers against Arabs has not been effectively dealt with by
 the Israeli authorities.
 In the West Bank, and to a somewhat lesser degree in Gaza and
 East Jerusalem, friction between Israelis and Palestinians
 erupted during the year in disturbances of public order. There
 were dozens of terrorist incidents, several of which resulted
 in deaths or serious injuries. There were also retributive
 acts by-both sides, Arab protest demonstrations and strikes,
 and confrontations between Israeli settlers, who were often
 armed, and local inhabitants. Expressions of Palestinian
 nationalist or pro-PLO fervor often led to intervention by
 security forces. During the last part of 1983, the endemic
 tension was heightened by Palestinian concern over the struggle
 between PLO factions in Lebanon.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful and Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There was no evidence in 1983 of political murder by Israeli
 security forces, and murder is neither practiced nor condoned
 by the Israeli Government. Several persons were killed and
 numerous others injured by terrorist attacks. In addition,
 Israelis were killed or injured by stones thrown by local
 Palestinians, and local Palestinians were killed or injured by
 gunfire by security forces and Israeli settlers. Palestinians
 have complained that Israeli security forces do not adequately
 protect them from reprisals by Israeli settlers.
 
 
 1294
 In early July, an Israeli settler was stabbed to death by
 assailants in central Hebron; seven members of an Islamic
 fundamentalist group were arrested and subsequently confessed
 to the crime. In late July, three Arab students on the Hebron
 University campus were killed and over 30 injured by unknown
 attackers, widely believed to be settlers, using automatic
 weapons and grenades. No suspects had been formally charged by
 year's end. In Gaza, two Israeli settlers were killed during
 the year by Arab assailants.
 An Arab villager of Bidiya was killed and a border policeman
 and two other Arabs severely injured in a confrontation over
 settlement construction on disputed land. Two Arabs were
 fatally wounded by security forces in Tulkarm during a
 demonstration, and a youth from Jenin was killed after failing
 to halt at a roadblock. A Nablus girl was killed while
 shopping when an Israeli motorist opened fire on demonstrators
 who had stoned his car. In December, an 11-year old Nablus
 girl was shot to death in her father's bakery; three Israeli
 settlers were placed in custody during the investigation of the
 incident, and were charged in January 1984.
 An Arab resident of Rujaib village was reportedly killed by
 Arabs for selling land to Israeli settlers. Other Arabs
 suspected of assisting the occupation were the targets of
 unsuccessful attacks. There were many incidents during the
 year involving arson, fire bombs, explosives, or gunfire
 against settlers and Arabs in the occupied territories.
 Security forces successfully defused numerous explosive devices
 aimed at the general public. Only one such device, a charge
 placed under an Israeli military vehicle, was specifically
 directed against a military target. Responsibility was
 generally claimed by Palestinian organizations outside the
 occupied territories.
 An Israeli organization calling itself "Terror against Terror"
 claimed responsibility for a series of booby-trapped grenade
 attacks on Arab homes and both Muslim and Christian religious
 sites. Several persons were injured in the incidents.
 In February, an Israeli resident of the West Bank was severely
 injured in an attack by Arab assailants that was believed to
 have been related to his role as a broker in the purchase of
 Arab-owned land.
 In March, Israeli settlers from Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, fired
 without known provocation into a nearby Arab house, injuring a
 small child. Three settlers were arrested, convicted, and
 sentenced to 12 months (later commuted to six months)
 imprisonment. An Israeli court refused to accept the plea of
 self-defense in the case of another Kiryat Arba settler who
 opened fire on an Arab motorist; the settler was convicted and
 sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.
 In April, Alan Goodman, the Israeli accused of killing three
 persons during a shooting assault on the Temple Mount/Haram al
 Sharif in 1982, was found guilty and sentenced to life
 imprisonment.
 
 
 1295
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of individuals disappearing from the
 occupied territories during 1983. The Arabic press, however,
 continued to report the abduction and temporary detention of
 Arabs, including children, by armed Israeli settlers after
 stone-throwing attacks on settler vehicles.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and violators are
 punished. There is no evidence that torture is condoned by
 Israeli authorities.
 Palestinian prisoners complained of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading, treatment in Israeli facilities during the year.
 They alleged that wardens permitted non-Arab prisoners to abuse
 them, that they were denied expeditious and comprehensive
 medical treatment, and that the places of detention were
 unheated and overcrowded. There were credible reports that
 prisoners were sometimes denied the opportunity to bathe or
 shower for extended periods. Allegations of psychological
 pressure, physical mistreatment, and instances of brutality
 during the arrest and interrogation of security suspects
 declined in 1983 from 1982 levels, continuing a downward trend
 over the past several years.
 Some of the charges of mistreatment, especially those involving
 lack of heat or sanitary facilities, seemed to result from
 antiquated or overcrowded places of detention to which not only
 Palestinians are subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under applicable law, individuals may be held in administrative
 detention without formal charges or trial for up to 18 days. A
 civilian or military court may thereafter extend pre-trial
 detention for up to six more months. In 1983, there were no
 reports of such detention for more than 18 days.
 Persons suspected of having committed security offenses are
 subject to military trial. Israeli law does not precisely
 define when a given crime will be considered a security
 offense. The arrest of a sizable number of Arabs has been
 common in the wake of terrorist incidents or when security
 forces disperse a demonstration. Usually, such arrests do not
 result in either formal charges or prolonged detention.
 Persons arrested while demonstrating are tried in military
 courts on security grounds. The security forces can and do
 detain individuals without prompt notification of their
 relatives and apparently without the use of warrants. Several
 hundred suspected security offenders were awaiting trial either
 in Israel or the occupied territories at the end of 1983.
 Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories
 are usually provided the opportunity for bail, access to an
 attorney, and a clear statement of charges. Persons detained
 for security investigations are not permitted bail and
 initially do not have the right to access to an attorney or
 other outside contact. It is not clear whether they are
 informed of the specific charges against them, and many of
 those released from such detention without being charged claim
 ignorance of the reasons for their detention.
 
 
 1296
 Amnesty International, in a special report in February 1983,
 expressed concern over what it regards as the extensive use of
 restriction orders under which, from January 1980 through
 December 1982, 107 persons in Israel and the occupied
 territories were ordered to remain within the confines of their
 town or village (town arrest) for periods of three months or
 more, in some cases for more than two years, as a result of
 extensions or original orders. Such restrictions, which often
 make it difficult for those affected to practice their
 profession or to pursue their course of study, involve no
 formal charges and are ordered by regional military commanders
 with no requirement for judicial approval. Many of those under
 restriction orders are political activists opposed to Israeli
 occupation of the occupied territories or who are outspoken in
 their criticism of Israeli policies and in their support of the
 PLO.
 Lengthy curfews imposed on all or portions of Arab towns,
 cities, and refugee camps are seen as collective punishment by
 those subjected to such measures. There were reports during
 the year that two persons at the Jalazun refugee camp died for
 lack of prompt medical treatment due to a curfew. There was no
 independent confirmation of these reports. Violators of
 curfews or town arrest are subject to fine or imprisonment
 under security regulations.
 Other forms of collective punishment, such as the holding of
 groups of Arab men in town or village squares for long periods,
 have been employed by Israeli authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law as modified by the Israeli authorities remains in
 force in the West Bank for most civil and criminal matters;
 British Mandatory law, as modified, prevails in Gaza. The
 judicial application of these laws, except where security
 offenses or acquisition of land by the authorities is involved,
 has been left in the hands of an Arab judiciary, which acts
 independently of the Israeli authorities. Residents of the
 occupied territories accused of non-security offenses receive
 public trials in local civilian courts. Most cases of offenses
 in the West Bank and Gaza involving Israeli settlers are heard
 in military courts. In East Jerusalem and the Golan, the laws
 obtaining in Israel apply.
 Alleged security offenders are tried in Israeli military
 courts, with a military judge presiding, and are defended by
 counsel. Most military trials are open to the public.
 Consular officers normally have no difficulty in attending any
 court proceedings in which a foreign citizen is involved.
 Trials for individuals accused of serious security offenses,
 however, are sometimes closed to the public, especially when
 security officials are to testify.
 Israeli military courts also claim jurisdiction over security
 offenses committed outside Israel and the occupied
 territories. An American citizen of Palestinian origin was
 sentenced to two years during 1983 for activities in connection
 with a Palestinian organization which occurred only within the
 United States and which were not illegal in the United States.
 
 
 1297
 After Israel's exchange of prisoners with the PLO in November,
 approximately 2,900 non-Israeli-citizen Arabs remained in
 prison for security offenses in Israel or the occupied
 territories.
 Throughout the year, the Israeli Government continued to assert
 claims over additional areas of the West Bank which it
 considers to be state land but which local inhabitants often
 regard as community or private land. Arab users of the land
 frequently complain that they are not provided with any written
 notification of these decisions. Although the authorities have
 extended the time available for the filing of competing claims
 to 30 days from the previous 21-day limit, Arabs argue that the
 period is too brief for them to obtain substantiating
 documentation, some of which is available only in Jordan or
 Turkey. Israeli authorities respond that extensions are
 granted upon request, which appears to be the case in most
 instances. They also maintain that no title is required when
 the claimant can prove he has cultivated the disputed land for
 at least ten years. Some Arabs, however, assert that this
 provision is not always observed. In some cases, the
 authorities have permitted earth-moving work to begin before
 the 30-day period has elapsed.
 There are complaints by Arabs that the practice of adjudicating
 appeals from military orders under which land is seized for
 state purposes by an appeals committee composed of military
 officers does not provide an independent, fair review of the
 dispute. Arabs also maintain that the imposition during 1983
 of Military Order 1060, transferring initial arbitration of
 land title from the Arab courts to another military tribunal,
 likewise prevents a fair evaluation of their claims. An Arab
 claimant who is unsatisfied with the military committee's
 ruling may appeal through the Israeli legal system up to the
 Supreme Court. No such appeals have been filed over the last
 two years.
 Orders of the civil administrations may be appealed to the
 Israeli Supreme Court. Non-judicial administrative orders of
 the military government may be appealed to area military
 commanders and the Supreme Court. No appeal of military court
 verdicts is possible, although the area commander can and does
 exercise the right of commutation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the occupation regulations, military authorities can and
 do enter private homes and institutions without prior judicial
 approval in pursuit of security objectives.
 In 1983, at least two houses of the families of West Bank and
 Gaza residents believed to have been involved in security
 incidents were demolished or sealed and the families
 displaced. During the course of the year, this policy was
 modified to limit the sealing or demolition to the residences
 of individuals held responsible for the offense. There is no
 judicial process prior to a decision to seal or demolish a room
 or house in security cases.
 
 
 1298
 A number of houses and other structures also were demolished in
 the West Bank and Gaza on the grounds that they were
 constructed without proper authorization. In some cases, Arabs
 complained that their houses were constructed in accordance
 with licenses issued by various Arab municipalities but that
 Israeli officials later ruled the site outside of municipal
 jurisdiction. Some of the demolitions were conducted by
 Israeli settlers rather than by the authorities.
 Security forces dispersed several demonstrations by armed
 settlers outside West Bank refugee camps during the year. Both
 Arab villagers and settlers continued to complain of efforts at
 intimidation through the destruction of personal property.
 It is widely believed that mail and telephone services in the
 West Bank and Gaza are monitored. Individuals can be and are
 questioned on their political views by security officials.
 Such inquiries sometimes involve detention overnight.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech
 Freedom of expression is restricted on stated security
 grounds. The Arabic press, most of which is located in East
 Jerusalem, remains outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policy
 and actions. Arrests, prison sentences, land seizures, and
 other politically sensitive stories are generally reported, but
 editorials and articles are frequently censored or excised by
 the Israeli censor. About half of the editorials submitted by
 the Arabic daily Al-Fajr during 1983 were completely excised.
 Materials licensed to be published in East Jerusalem are free
 to circulate there, but require an additional license, which is
 not always granted, for distribution in the West Bank and Gaza.
 The publication license of the Arabic magazine As-Shira was
 withdrawn in August 1983. The magazine was alleged to have
 carried propaganda for extremist PLO factions. Unlicensed
 distribution is illegal and can result in seizure of the
 publications and arrest of those involved in their
 transportation and distribution. Several news dealers in the
 West Bank were detained for distributing certain East Jerusalem
 publications in 1983.
 Arabic educational materials, periodicals, and books
 originating outside Israel are censored for anti-Semitic or
 anti-Israeli content and for encouragement of Palestinian
 nationalism. The occupation authorities maintain a list of
 approximately 1,200 forbidden publications. It includes
 anti-Semitic and official Arab propaganda, publications of the
 PLO's Institute of Palestine Studies, and works by individuals
 identified with other Palestinian organizations opposed to the
 existence of the State of Israel. Possession of such
 publications by a West Bank or Gaza Arab is a criminal
 offense. Restrictions of this kind are usually not applied to
 Israeli residents of the occupied territories.
 Arabic-language radio and television programs from Jordan,
 Syria, and other Arab countries, including broadcasts of the
 Voice of Palestine, are received in the occupied territories.
 
 
 1299
 Foreign journalists have not reported any difficulties in
 meeting with inhabitants of the occupied territories. All
 reporting filed by the foreign press, however, is subject to
 military censorship. Block wardens and other such formal
 surveillance systems are not used in the occupied territories.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Israeli occupation authorities have permitted a wide range
 of labor, professional, and fraternal groups organized before
 1967 to continue to function in the occupied territories. No
 political parties or other groups viewed as political are
 permitted.
 There are approximately 40 labor unions in the occupied
 territories, grouped into two rival federations. No new labor
 unions have been created in the West Bank since the beginning
 of the occupation, and a number of Arab unions have been
 disbanded by the occupation authorities for alleged political
 activities. Strikes are legal as long as they are not
 undertaken for political reasons. There were no reports of
 arrests for labor organizing activity in 1983.
 West Bank unions are relatively small and generally confined to
 urban workers in skilled craft trades. The occupation
 authorities must approve all candidates for office in labor
 union elections, but such elections are held without
 interference. The most recent elections for the leadership of
 the West Bank General Federation of Trade Unions were held in
 September 1983.
 Membership in the Histadrut, the Israeli national labor
 organization, is open to Arab workers from East Jerusalem and
 the Golan Heights. Most Arabs in East Jerusalem have declined
 such association. The Histadrut has ruled that Golan Druze
 construction workers who were absent from work during the 1982
 strike must be returned to their jobs with full rights and has
 taken other steps aimed at equalizing working conditions for
 Israelis and Golan Druze.
 Since 1978, the ILO has regularly sent fact-finding missions to
 Israel and the occupied territories to report on the situation
 of Arab workers. The 1983 visit of the ILO representatives
 took place in March.
 Professional associations, especially those of doctors,
 lawyers, pharmacists, and engineers, are active and frequently
 take public stands on political issues. The West Bank Lawyers
 Association struck in September in protest against revised
 Israeli regulations on the adjudication of land disputes.
 Public gatherings require the permission of the authorities.
 Permission is often withheld from both Arab and Israeli groups
 on the grounds of public order.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religious practice in the occupied
 territories. No groups or sects are banned on religious
 grounds. Muslim and Christian holidays are observed without
 hindrance, and Muslims and Christians operate a variety of
 private schools and institutions. The occupation authorities
 
 
 1300
 tolerate the existence of a number of Islamic fundamentalist
 groups. There has been no reported interference with the
 printing or distribution of religious publications.
 Israel has an exemplary record in protecting Muslim and
 Christian holy places and has usually assured freedom of access
 to them. Some West Bank leaders have been prevented on
 security grounds from entering Jerusalem to attend Friday
 prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque. The Israeli authorities have also
 on occasion barred Jewish groups that have sought access to the
 Temple Mount/Haram al Sharif for public prayers on religious
 and security grounds. At Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque, which is
 also the site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, the military
 government has reduced Muslim worship by setting aside space
 and time for Jewish worshippers. The Mufti of Jerusalem
 complained formally in September about restrictions on worship
 time for Muslims at the Mosque imposed during the Jewish high
 holy days. West Bankers have also complained about the
 continual presence of small groups of armed Israeli troops
 within the Mosque.
 The most serious religious incident during the year was the
 attempt of armed religious zealots to break into the Temple
 Mount/Haram al Sharif in April. The group, which wished to
 establish a permanent Jewish presence at the site, was arrested
 by security forces. Charges against all those arrested were
 subsequently dismissed.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted for most Arabs
 within the occupied territories, but certain categories are
 significantly restricted. Almost 80,000 Arabs travel daily to
 Israel to work. Vehicles owned by inhabitants of the
 territories have distinctive license plates and are frequently
 stopped for security checks. Arab inhabitants of the occupied
 territories are required to obtain permits to stay overnight in
 Israel; West Bank Arabs are normally forbidden to remain in
 Jerusalem after midnight. Several deposed mayors and one
 serving mayor were forbidden to leave their towns during 1983.
 Numerous other West Bankers were under similar restrictions or
 personal curfews, which required them to remain at home from
 dusk to dawn. The deposed mayor of Ramallah, Karim Khalaf,
 continued to be restricted to Jericho, where he was exiled in
 1982 after his removal from office.
 Most inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza are permitted to
 travel abroad, and many thousands do so each year. Exit visas
 are required. In some cases, restrictions-are imposed on
 re-entry. There are also restrictions on certain categories of
 residents, including limitations on the frequency of border
 crossings by young men and occasional temporary collective
 punishment bans on foreign travel by residents of specific
 towns or areas following demonstrations or terrorist acts.
 Travel bans are also imposed on certain individuals, including
 mayors and other leaders, and persons suspected of
 anti-occupation activities. Local inhabitants are sometimes
 prevented from traveling abroad to engage in international
 conferences or political meetings, and are proscribed from
 direct contact with members of the PLO.
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1301
 Despite the formal state of war between Israel and Jordan,
 two-way travel between the West Bank and Jordan has been
 permitted. Inhabitants of the West Bank returning from Jordan,
 as well as other Arabs or persons of Arab descent, are subject
 to search for weapons and contraband. There have been
 complaints that these searches of person and property are
 unnecessarily rigorous and constitute harassment.
 Some former West Bank residents who obtained foreign
 citizenship after emigration from the area have claimed that
 upon returning to their original homes they are denied
 permanent resident status and permitted only to remain as
 tourists for limited periods. There are no official obstacles
 to emigration. Net emigration, primarily for economic reasons,
 approximates 15,000 annually.
 Travel restrictions imposed on a number of prominent Gazans by
 the Israelis in previous years were lifted during 1983. Gazans
 normally do not require prior approval for travel to the West
 Bank. Under special arrangements concluded between Israel and
 Egypt, thousands of Gazans regularly cross the border into
 Egypt, particularly to work or visit relatives in the divided
 city of Rafah.
 Israel permits Golan Heights Druze to return after attending
 schools in Syria. It has not, however, permitted the return of
 Syrians who fled or were expelled from the area during and
 after the 1967 war.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 The West Bank and Gaza are ruled by a military government
 established in the wake of Israel's victory in the 1967 war.
 There is no self-government in these areas at the regional
 level, and only limited Arab administration at the town level;
 villages largely retain their traditional leadership. Arab
 civil servants, institutions, and municipal officials operate
 under the military government. Israeli authorities, however,
 have removed elected and appointed Arab officials, and neither
 these removals nor the subsequent appointment of Arab or
 Israeli replacement officials is subject to review by the
 local inhabitants or their institutions. No formal political
 parties or overtly political organizations are permitted.
 Municipal elections were held in 1972 and 1976 and were widely
 recognized as fair. Elections were scheduled for 1980, but
 were postponed. They have not been rescheduled.
 Twenty-three Arab mayors and municipal councils were elected
 in the 1976 elections. By the end of 1983, 14 of the mayors
 had been dismissed, as well as at least four of the town
 councils. The major towns of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, and El
 Bireh were ruled by Israeli officials; Halhoul and Jericho
 were led by mayors appointed from their town councils.
 Bethlehem was the only major town still governed by its
 elected mayor.
 In July, following the stabbing death of Israeli settler
 Aharon Gross in central Hebron, the town's acting mayor,
 Mustafa An-Natche, was dismissed by the occupation
 
 
 1302
 authorities. An-Naatche, elected Deputy Mayor in 1976, had
 been appointed by the occupation authorities as acting mayor
 after the dismissal and deportation of Mayor Fuad Qawassmeh in
 1980.
 Arab residents of East Jerusalem are permitted and encouraged
 to vote in Jerusalem municipal elections. The Israeli press
 reported that approximately 20 percent of the eligible Arab
 voters participated in the election held in October, although
 some Arab sources claim that the turnout was substantially
 less.
 Arab residents of the West Bank are considered by Jordan to be
 Jordanian citizens and, as such, are to be represented in the
 Jordanian Parliament, which was reconvened in January 1984.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A variety of local groups, both Israeli and Palestinian, are
 concerned with human rights issues. These groups produce
 publications and statements which are circulated in the
 occupied territories. Two noteworthy reports on human rights
 conditions in the occupied territories, published in 1983,
 were prepared respectively by the Tel Aviv-based International
 Center for Peace in the Middle East and by Law in the Service
 of Man, the West Bank affiliate of the International
 Commission of Jurists. Statements on human rights matters,
 including allegations of mistreatment, are published regularly
 in the Arabic press.
 The Israeli Government normally permits international human
 rights groups to visit the territories. In 1983, however, it
 refused such permission to a U.N. General Assembly committee.
 Israeli officials said the refusal was based on an inherent
 bias in the committee's mandate.
 In its 1983 report on Israel and the occupied territories,
 Amnesty International expressed concern over imprisonment of
 "prisoners of conscience," the arbitrary use of administrative
 measures to restrict individuals, including sealing off houses
 and detention without charges or trial, the use of summary
 trials, allegations of mistreatment of prisoners, and the
 killing of demonstrators by security forces. Freedom House
 rates Israel "free," but does not attempt to rate the occupied
 territories.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Living standards in the occupied territories have risen
 substantially throughout the period of Israeli control.
 Official Israeli statistics indicate that unemployment in the
 West Bank and Gaza is as low as one percent, and real per
 capita income has risen 11-12 percent annually since 1968. In
 the West Bank, per capita gross national product (GNP) in 1983
 was over three times the 1968 figure. Much of this increase
 in per capita income can be attributed to the large number of
 Palestinian workers employed in Israel and to the remittances
 of Palestinians working in Arab countries. A large, but
 undetermined portion of the Arab work-force is underemployed
 or engaged in seasonal work.

 Through Israeli occupation, economic life in the West Bank has
 become enmeshed in Israeli regulations. Some are
 characteristic of bureaucracy in Israel. Others may be used
 politically. Arabs complain that they are not provided
 sufficient latitude to develop their own resources. While
 Israel is concerned that funds from the PLO or other hostile
 sources might be brought into the occupied territories under
 the guise of development funds, the Arabs contend that
 development projects which are fully funded by proven local
 sources have not been approved.
 Israeli controls on the export to Israel of West Bank and Gaza
 products, especially agricultural products, restrict the
 market opportunities of local inhabitants. Recently
 introduced restrictions on the extent and type of agricultural
 planting limit potential economic growth. West Bank farmers
 and manufacturers have suffered from periodic Jordanian
 restrictions on their ability to transship their goods through
 Jordan, as well as from occasional Israeli bans on the export
 of products from areas under curfew.
 Israel restricts the construction of new factories through a
 number of regulations. It also limits the import of capital
 from the Arab world, in part by requiring a special permit for
 amounts over $3,000. In the summer of 1983, Israel banned the
 use by inhabitants of the West Bank of personal checkbooks or
 other financial instruments for accounts outside the occupied
 territories or Israel. These restrictions (which have
 included the confiscation of checkbooks for such accounts by
 border officials) are unevenly applied, but appear to have had
 a severe affect on the development budget of some
 municipalities. Israel also restricts entry of Arab funds for
 development programs and educational or philanthropic
 purposes.
 The taking of land for settlements and for military use in the
 occupied territories has strongly affected the lives of Arab
 residents. Land utilized by Israel in this way amounts to
 about one-third of the West Bank. In many cases, those
 affected have had to leave farming to become day laborers.
 There are currently more than 140 non-military settlements in
 the West Bank (excluding unilaterally expanded Jerusalem) and
 Gaza, with a total population of about 30,000. The scarcity
 of water in most parts of the West Bank constrains both
 agriculture and urban development in the region. As a result,
 water use has become a contentious issue between the resident
 Palestinians and the occupying Israelis.
 While urban West Bankers are increasingly sophisticated in
 their social attitudes, including concerning the role of
 women, the rural majority of West Bankers continues to hold
 more traditional, Middle Eastern social values.
 The military government and the U.N. Relief Works Agency
 (UNRWA) meet the basic educational needs of refugee students
 in the West Bank. Overall adjusted primary school enrollment
 has risen from about 56 percent of the school-age population
 in 1967 to about 90 percent in 1983. The number of girls
 receiving education has markedly increased by the end of 1983
 and now represents about 45 percent of the student total.

 The West Bank is served by four universities, one community
 college, and a variety of other higher educational
 institutions, all established or upgraded since the beginning
 of Israeli occupation. Often the scene of demonstrations and
 confrontations with the security forces, most institutions
 were closed for varying periods over the year. In November,
 security authorities closed Bethlehem University for about one
 month after demonstrations. None of the universities receives
 financial support or other assistance from the occupation
 authorities, and representatives of all four have complained
 about restrictions on their operations by the occupation
 authorities.
 The Arab population of the Golan heights is about 14,000,
 mostly Druze and a small percentage of Alawites. Druze
 village councils have complained that they do not receive
 sufficient funds to provide minimal municipal services, and a
 third of the estimated 4,000 school children are reported to
 be studying in substandard classrooms.
 The Gaza Strip's economy advanced marginally in the early
 1980's, compared with real GNP growth rates of over 10 percent
 in the late 1960's and 6-8 percent in the late 1970's. About
 35,000 Gazans work in Israel. Gaza's income from work outside
 the Gaza Strip represents about one-third of its GNP.
 Local employment in the Gaza Strip is highest in the
 agricultural sector, which has remained virtually unchanged in
 recent years. Citrus, grown on about half the cultivated land
 in Gaza, suffered a third poor year in succession in 1982-83.
 Local producers blamed Israeli and Jordanian marketing
 restrictions for much of the decline. Water was also a major
 constraint. Israeli authorities have taken measures to cut
 back on water usage in the Gaza Strip to allow the water table
 to rise.
 Gazans' basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter are
 largely met. UNRWA, private voluntary organizations, and the
 Israeli Government provide special assistance to over 20,000
 persons. With over 460,000 inhabitants on 378 square
 kilometers of land, severe population pressure remains a major
 problem. Housing conditions are crowded in Gaza refugee
 camps, where approximately 200,000 of the 370,000 local
 refugess live. UNRWA statistics indicate that, as of
 mid-1983, approximately 30,000 refugees had left the camps to
 live in government-sponsored communities.
 Gazans suffer from an absence of social and cultural
 activities. Although there is a literary journal, no
 newspapers are published.
 The El Azhar Islamic University offers a four-year
 undergraduate program to about 3,300 Gaza students. Religious
 and intercommunal strife on the campus in 1983 disrupted the
 school year and rekindled local interest in creating a
 secular, two-year technical/vocational college.
