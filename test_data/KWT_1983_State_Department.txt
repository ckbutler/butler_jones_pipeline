 KUWAIT
 
 Kuwait is a small state, dynastically ruled by the Al Sabah
 family. Kuwait's amirs. or rulers, have traditionally governed
 in consultation with members of several commercially powerful
 families and other influential community leaders. The 1962
 Constitution, written after Kuwait gained independence from the
 United Kingdom, contains detailed provisions on the powers and
 relationships of the branches of Government and on the rights of
 citizens. Kuwait's National Assembly has served to
 institutionalize a degree of consultation with the ruling
 family, and equally, to be an outlet for popular expression,
 including criticism of the Government. The current Assembly has
 50 members, elected from a narrow popular base of approximately
 42,000 males (in an officially reported citizen population in
 1980 of 560,0000) who can trace their Kuwaiti nationality
 through the male line to 1920. In addition to its narrow base
 for popular participation, political activity in Kuwait is
 restricted by the official ban on the formation of political
 parties. Political activity finds an outlet in social clubs and
 religious societies, as well as through family or neighborhood
 gatherings known as "diwaniyyas". Labor unions exist, but
 seldom act contrary to the Government's wishes.
 The Kuwait citizenry is 65-70 percent Sunni Muslim; the
 remaining 30-35 percent are Shi'ite Muslim plus a tiny minority
 of Christians. Although the members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority
 perceive themselves as largely excluded from leadership
 positions in the Government, many of them have achieved great
 wealth in the society. In addition, the Iranian revolution has
 made the rulers more responsive to Shi'a sensitivities, while at
 the same time they keep a watchful eye on Shi'a loyalties.
 Meanwhile, the majority Sunni community has been subject to
 internal pressure by the upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism,
 which takes several often conflicting forms, is centered in the
 young, and frequently conflicts with attitudes of the
 traditionally moderate members of the merchant class.
 Kuwaitis are a minority in their own country. Sixty percent, or
 about 950,000, of the populace are non-Kuwaiti. Of these,
 around 350,000 are Palestinian long-term residents of the
 country, many in their second generation. Non-Kuwaitis are
 given due process under the law but have few other civil and
 political rights. Non-Kuwaitis may not own real property nor
 more than 49 percent of a business. They have no direct role in
 the political process. Their presence in Kuwait is dependent on
 having work, which in most cases may be summarily terminated.
 Their freedom to travel outside Kuwait is often limited since
 once abroad, many--including persons who were born and reared in
 Kuwait--have difficulty returning.
 Kuwait's security apparatus is used primarily to maintain
 internal order. It does not engage in political suppression.
 Conscious of being a minority in their own country, the
 Kuwaitis' sense of vulnerability has been heightened by
 increased political turbulence in the region. Security problems
 arising from foreign-inspired terrorism and attempts by agents
 of foreign governments and organizations to subvert elements of
 the population have led to tightened security measures and legal
 restrictions on public gatherings and dissemination of
 "subversive" literature. Increased attention to law and order
 is also viewed by some Kuwaitis as a means to protect their
 society against the threat they perceive to Kuwaiti moral and
 social values from the large foreign population.
 Although the Government restricts the political and civil rights
 (1315)
 
 
 1316
 of all citizens, and particularly those of women and
 expatriates, it does not interfere drastically with the
 integrity of the individual. The long-term trends in respect
 for human rights in Kuwait are a subject of much speculation in
 Kuwait. Internal, socio-economic changes brought on by sudden
 oil-related wealth, coupled in recent years with violent
 revolution in Iran, the Iran-Iraq war, and the perceived failure
 of wealth to solve local and regional political problems, have
 led to a growing demand by vocal and well organized groups for
 stricter controls over public morality and political
 expression. There is also a resurgent Islamic fundamentalist
 movement which advocates adoption of a more stringent legal code
 based on Islamic Shari'a law. Terrorist attacks against vital
 Kuwaiti installations and foreign diplomatic missions in Kuwait
 in December 1983 have deeply affected the country's political
 and social life and will test the Government's commitment to
 Kuwait's democratic institutions in the months ahead. The
 bombings may further strain relations between religious groups
 in Kuwait. There is also evidence of an increased role for
 security organizations as a result of the bombings.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 In 1983 there were no reported incidents of deprivation of life
 for political reasons by the Government. In December 1983
 terrorists, identified by the Government of Kuwait as being
 members of the pro-Iranian Al-Da'wa group, carried out bombing
 attacks against several Kuwaiti Government installations and the
 United States and French embassies in which five people died.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is some evidence that local security forces, without
 authorization, occasionally use physical violence when
 interrogating individuals suspected of committing criminal
 acts. These incidents do not appear to be widespread or
 condoned. Non-Kuwaitis are more likely to receive rough
 treatment than are Kuwaitis, and the seriousness of the
 suspected crime also appears to be a determining factor.
 Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a defense in
 Kuwait's courts and has led to the release of a number of
 suspects.
 The Iranian regime in October 1983 accused Kuwait of torturing
 Iranians who had been detained for illegally entering the
 country. No evidence for these charges exists. Most of the
 detainees appear to have entered Kuwait in an effort to flee
 Iran.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines. Treatment is
 humane, and the Government provides food and other necessities.
 Young offenders, few of whom are imprisoned, are separated from
 persons charged or convicted of serious crimes. There is no
 policy of discriminatory treatment among prisoners for racial or
 
 
 1317
 religious reasons.
 Although the legal process is based in part on Islamic law,
 punishments such as mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 Some fundamentalist members of the National Assembly have
 attempted to force the Government to adopt Islamic law fully,
 and by extension its harsh punishments, as the only basis for
 legal process, but their efforts have not been successful.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. With occasional exceptions, such practices are not
 sanctioned by the Kuwaiti Government. Individuals may not be
 denied due process or held for more than four days without
 charge, and a prosecutor's approval is required for detention
 periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter the suspect must either be
 released or charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize detention
 for up to an additional 21 days. Further detention pending
 trial may be authorized by a judge. Warrants are required
 unless an individual is apprehended in the act of committing an
 offense. These procedures are followed in practice. Road
 blocks and spot checks of outdoor gatherings of expatriates,
 especially of South Asians, are used sporadically by the police
 searching for illegal immigrants and contraband liquor. Persons
 without proper identification may be detained by the police
 under the procedures described above. A number of Kuwaitis and
 non-Kuwaitis were detained and interrogated following terrorist
 bombings in December 1983. While preliminary evidence indicates
 that some detentions were arbitrary, it appears that the
 procedures for prosecutor's approval and formal charges
 described above were followed.
 In 1983, there were no reports of individuals detained for
 political reasons in Kuwait.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a non-citizen, even if a long-term resident in Kuwait,
 may be summarily expelled from the country without a specific
 charge against him if he is considered a troublemaker by the
 authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and provides for public
 trial, the right of appeal, and representation by an attorney of
 one's choice. Failure of the police to respect a suspect's
 rights may provide a defense in the courts. Charges are
 supposed to be stated formally when a suspect is brought before
 a prosecutor, not more than four days after arrest. Trials in
 absentia have occurred. In such cases, the defendant is allowed
 an additional right of appeal. There are no reports of secret
 or unfair trials or of discrimination against defense counsel.
 However, the court-appointed attorney of a defendant unable to
 engage his own lawyer is not always given adequate time to
 prepare a defense. Interpretation of court proceedings to
 ensure their understanding by non-Arabic speaking defendants is
 sometimes inadequate. A special state security court was
 established by Amiri decree in December 1983 to try those
 charged in the terrorist bombings attacks against Kuwaiti and
 foreign diplomatic installations. According to government
 officials, procedures for the state security court will follow
 those of the regular criminal court system. There were no
 prisoners known to be serving sentences for non-violent
 
 
 1318
 political offenses in 1983. According to the Constitution,
 military courts have jurisdiction only over offenses committed
 by members of the armed or security forces, except during
 periods of martial law. The latter provision has proven to be
 theoretical, since martial law has never been declared in
 Kuwait. The Amir has the power to pardon or to commute
 sentences passed by either civilian or military courts and has
 occasionally done so.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 Warrants are required to search, unless the police are in hot
 pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or where there
 is an external indication of the presence of alcohol or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter residences or businesses
 are issued by a public prosecutor. Expatriates, and
 particularly common laborers and servants who live in
 accommodations provided by their employers, may have their
 premises searched by the police with authorization only of the
 employer.
 Although many expatriates in Kuwait are non-Muslims, Kuwait
 absolutely prohibits on religious grounds the sale of alcohol or
 pork products. Beyond these restrictions, the Government does
 not arbitrarily or unnecessarily intervene in the private lives
 of Kuwaiti citizens or expatriates.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees in this area are conditional, being
 modified by such phrases as "in accordance with conditions and
 manner specified by law." The average Kuwaiti or Kuwait
 resident feels free to offer his opinion in private on almost
 any subject and does not fear official retaliation. On the other
 hand, no one may make a written or public attack upon the Amir
 and the ruling family, upon Islam, or upon leaders of friendly
 Arab states. Kuwait has an active censorship department, which
 reviews all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and other
 material entering Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes.
 Items arriving by post for individuals or institutional use are
 usually not opened before delivery, unless the contents are
 suspected of being pornographic. Printed and visual material
 produced within Kuwait is not subject to pre-censorship, but is
 liable to Government action after publication or release. Radio
 and television are Government owned and controlled.
 The Kuwaiti press is not pre-censored and is given wide latitude
 in its content. Articles and editorials critical of Government
 action or of individuals appear infrequently. The press law
 sets down several categories which are restricted. These
 include criticism of the Amir and the ruling family; official
 confidential communications or treaties and agreements with
 other states; material which might disturb relations with Arab
 and friendly states or which might prove embarrassing to their
 heads of state; and a general category of stories which "might
 incite people to commit crimes, create hatred, or spread
 dissensions among the people." Although the list is somewhat
 loosely structured, it is, in fact, interpreted selectively and
 violators are usually only issued warnings. Editors and
 
 
 1319
 publishers are liable to imprisonment and fines for violations,
 but to date there have been no known imprisonments. Publication
 of material from outside of Kuwait which has not been previously
 cleared by the Government and which is critical of 'friendly"
 regimes has occasionally resulted in closure for periods ranging
 from a few days to a month. Editors are generally careful not to
 offend the Government and are responsive to its wishes regarding
 whether or not to publish sensitive reports on Kuwait's foreign
 and domestic policies or those of its neighbors. However, in
 December 1983, a daily newspaper was closed temporarily for
 publishing an article considered offensive by the Government.
 The closure was based on a court order and followed a prior
 warning to the chief editor of the paper. Following terrorist
 bombings in December 1983 the Government reminded local editors
 of existing press laws. The Kuwaiti National Assembly is
 expected to consider again in the near future a
 Government-proposed press law which will detail more explicitly
 the restricted areas, as well as spell out harsher punishments.
 Such a law was rejected by the Assembly in 1982.
 The Government permits the use of languages other than Arabic in
 speech, print, and private schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The formation of political parties is banned in Kuwait. The
 Constitution protects private assembly, public meetings,
 processions, and gatherings which are peaceful and not contrary
 to public morals. However, any group of more than three people
 desiring to meet for public discussion (or to meet privately but
 issue a public statement) must receive explicit, prior
 permission from the Ministry of Interior. The authorities may
 prevent such an assembly merely by ignoring the request. During
 1983 there have been no mass gatherings in Kuwait, except those
 associated with religious observances. In the case of an
 October 1983 Shi'a religious commemoration with potential
 political overtones, security forces were highly evident,
 although they did not interfere with the gatherings.
 Kuwait permits the establishment of trade unions, although only
 government employees and the petroleum and banking industries
 are unionized. In fact, most union members are civil servants.
 Kuwaiti citizens and expatriates residing in Kuwait for five
 years are permitted to join unions, although only Kuwaitis may
 vote in union elections or hold union offices. Kuwait's labor
 unions play only a minor role in the economic life of the
 country, and virtually no political role. Nevertheless, unions
 do serve as an outlet for grievances and their views receive
 some government attention. The right to strike is officially
 recognized, but seldom exercised. Kuwaiti refinery workers of
 the state-owned oil company struck in spring 1983, but returned
 to work after some of their demands were met. There is no
 apparent harassment of professional groups, bar associations,
 scientific bodies, or labor unions, which are also permitted to
 participate in international bodies in their fields. The Kuwait
 Federation of Trade Unions is a member of the World Federation
 of Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute," it states further that its practice is not to
 "conflict with public policy or morals". Kuwait's state
 religion is Islam and the Shari'a (Islamic Law) is, according to
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 84
 
 
 1320
 the Constitution, "a main source of legislation." The ruling
 family and most prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims.
 There is no official policy of discrimination against Shi'a
 Muslims, who constitute about one-third of Kuwait's citizenry,
 but they and members of Kuwait's tiny Arab Christian minority
 are seldom appointed to sensitive government positions.
 There are a number of expatriate Christian congregations in
 Kuwait and several churches. In 1982, the Government banned
 Christmas parties which had been traditionally held in a number
 of the country's hotels and restaurants. Pressure from
 fundamentalist Islamic groups was the unstated reason for the
 restriction. Expatriate practitioners of Eastern religions,
 e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, are not allowed to establish
 places of worship in Kuwait but may worship privately in their
 homes. Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kuwaiti citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside
 the country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military
 service. Those serving in the military must receive permission
 from the Ministry of Defense before traveling abroad. While
 there are no different legal standards regarding the internal or
 foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice
 husbands can prevent their wives and minor children from leaving
 the country.
 There are occasional instances in which citizens' passports are
 suspended temporarily. Generally, this occurs only for criminal
 suspects but has also happened to some outspoken critics of the
 regime. By late 1983, approximately 100 Kuwaitis were barred
 from traveling abroad because of their allegedly illegal stock
 market related activities. Representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings have to receive prior
 permission from the authorities. While the Constitution states
 "no Kuwaiti may be deported from Kuwait or prevented from
 returning thereto", individuals have in the past been stripped
 of Kuwaiti citizenship and deported. Such actions have been
 rare and have generally been based on the voluntary acquisition
 by the individual of foreign citizenship. No such incidents
 occurred in 1983.
 All non-Kuwaitis working in Kuwait must have the sponsorship of
 a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not extend permanent residence
 to its expatriate population. Thus, employers have the power to
 restrict job mobility and the continued residence in Kuwait of
 their expatriate employees. Because Kuwaiti sponsors are
 legally responsible for their employees' actions, many
 expatriates are coerced by their employers into surrendering
 their travel documents, thus preventing them from leaving the
 country without the employer's consent. Such practice also
 extends to some non-Kuwaiti government employees, such as
 teachers. Those employed by government agencies are given
 residence visas which require an exit permit or "no objection"
 letter in order to leave the country. Non-Kuwaitis convicted of
 a crime are routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Refugees arriving in Kuwait, primarily Iranians or Afghans in
 1983, are virtually without exception returned to their home
 country. Among Kuwait's large Palestinian population, most have
 
 
 1321
 Lebanese or Jordanian travel documents. Those Palestinians in
 the country in 1983 have received commitments from the
 Government that they will be allowed to stay.
 In the past few years, as the Government has sought to reduce
 its "permanent resident" foreign community in response to
 economic problems and internal security concerns, fewer
 expatriates who were not already residents have been granted
 permission to enter the country. Also, many expatriates going
 abroad to study have had difficulty reentering Kuwait.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Al Sabah, a family of Bedouin origin, have ruled Kuwait for
 over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution limited succession to
 descendants of the ruler at the turn of this century. In
 practice, the ruler and senior family members choose the Crown
 Prince from either the al-Jabir or the al-Salim branch of the Al
 Sabah. Under the Constitution this choice is confirmed by
 majority vote of the National Assembly. Executive power is
 vested in the ruler and, under him, in an appointed Council of
 Ministers whose chairman by tradition is the Crown Prince.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies, elected by secret'ballot, plus cabinet
 members (presently 15, including the Prime Minister), sitting ex
 officio. Candidates for deputy seats are self-nominated, and
 multiple candidates compete for available seats. The major
 departures from democratic practice in elections are the
 prohibition on party labels and a "grandfather clause" which
 effectively limits suffrage to adult males who resided in Kuwait
 before 1920 and maintained a residence there until 1959, and
 their descendents. Women's suffrage was considered and rejected
 by the National Assembly in 1982.
 The National Assembly can best be described as a body to review
 government policy and programs and to make recommendations. The
 Assembly reviews budgets and questions ministers on a variety of
 subjects, especially their ministries' responsiveness in public
 services. Government policy is criticized in the Assembly. The
 Assembly occasionally rejects government-proposed legislation,
 but this is rare since the Government usually commands a
 sufficient number of votes from loyal deputies plus cabinet
 ministers to maintain a majority.
 In the last year there have been initiatives within the National
 Assembly to enforce greater compliance with Islamic practices.
 The Assembly has also barred citizenship to non-Muslims,
 prohibited all importation of alcoholic beverages, and
 repeatedly attempted to establish Islamic law as the basis for
 all legal process. Assembly members have also pressured, with
 some success, those campuses of Kuwait University which are
 sexually integrated to separate the sexes in the classrooms and
 in other facilities such as cafeterias. The Government has
 accommodated the National Assembly's demands for application of
 some fundamentalist principles in Kuwait. It has, however,
 blocked attempts in the Assembly to apply Islamic law across the
 board and would likely turn aside any attempt to tamper with the
 country's basically laissez-faire economic system.
 Constitutionally, the National Assembly can bring down the
 Government or force individual cabinet members to resign. In
 fact, since the Prime Minister is by tradition also the Crown
 Prince, the Assembly has exercised this right only once in the
 
 
 1322
 country's history. Should the Assembly declare that it is
 unable to work with the Government, the Amir may dismiss the
 Government. He has the option, however, of dismissing the
 Assembly and calling new elections, which is the more likely
 course.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are also an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 *male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their tribal
 and religious leaders, the heads of the prominent merchant
 clans, and to the ruling family itself through a system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal clubs to which anyone can come and freely
 speak his mind. That custom has endured, as has the tradition
 that the Amir should govern in consultation with the other
 community leaders. High-ranking officials are also approachable
 through "wasta," the use of influential family members or
 acquaintances as intermediaries in obtaining favors or a more
 favorable hearing for one's case.
 While Kuwaiti citizens participate to a limited degree in the
 political process, non-citizens, who outnumber Kuwaitis by three
 to two, have no role in that process. Kuwait has been reluctant
 to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, with the
 exception of certain stateless Bedouin. Naturalization of even
 Kuwait-born persons is rare. This anomaly is particularly
 striking for the 350,000 Palestinians, the second largest
 segment of the population. Citizenship has been extended only
 to a few Palestinian families who made significant contributions
 to Kuwait before the early 1970's. While expatriates have
 almost no say in the internal affairs of Kuwait, they are
 permitted considerable freedom in conducting activities
 affecting their home territories or countries. However,
 expatriates who violate sanctions against their involvement in
 Kuwait's affairs or whose activities risk embarrassing Kuwait in
 its relations with another friendly state may be summarily
 deported.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International does not include Kuwait in its 1983
 report. There are no known current requests by nongovernmental
 organizations to examine human rights in Kuwait. Freedom House
 calls Kuwait "partly free." While Kuwait has not taken
 initiatives internationally on most human rights questions, it
 is among the strongest proponents of investigations and
 condemnation of violations against and the promotion of the
 rights and claims of Palestinians.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government has a lavish social welfare program to spread the
 benefits of its $25,152 annual per capita gross national product
 (1981) to all citizens. Programs are designed to provide
 Kuwaitis with housing, family allowances, retirement income,
 medical care, education, and employment. Improved health care
 has resulted in a drop in the infant mortality rate to 30.2 per
 1,000 live births and an increase in life expectancy (1980) to
 70.04 years. Improved health care contributed to a high annual
 The average population growth rate over the last 10 years was
 6.2 percent, reflecting the influx of expatriates as well
 natural increase. Although exact figures are unavailable, very
 few, if any, individuals were below the absolute poverty level
 
 
 1323
 in 1983. Malnutrition has been effectively eliminated. In
 1980, the adult literacy rate for Kuwaitis was 63.4 percent with
 71 percent of those over ten years of age literate. In 1980, 99
 percent of primary school age children were in school.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 40 percent of the population, and
 the expatriate population. Ownership of commercial
 establishments, real estate, and shares on the local stock
 market (the principal sources of private wealth in this
 capitalist economy) is open only to Kuwaitis. Internal economic
 difficulties and the possibility of recession threaten the
 expatriate community by encouraging efforts already underway to'
 reduce the number of long-term resident non-Kuwaitis.
 Expatriates, therefore, feel more insecure than in the past, and
 many have begun to look for employment opportunities outside
 Kuwait.
 Expatriate workers often earn the same base pay as Kuwaitis but
 receive less in fringe benefits. Benefits restricted to Kuwaiti
 citizenship include higher government salaries, additional
 government stipends and social allowances, and in general,
 retirement pensions. Resident expatriates are entitled to
 medical benefits and to elementary and secondary schooling (but
 not kindergarten) for their children in the public schools, but
 Kuwaitis are given preference for admission to the University of
 Kuwait. Many temporary "guest workers" come to Kuwait without
 their families and live in camps or crowded apartments under
 spartan, sometimes unhealthy, conditions. Temporary workers are
 prohibited from changing employers without permission both of
 the original employer and of the Government, a system which is
 sometimes abused by unscrupulous employers to discourage
 attempts by expatriate workers to seek higher pay or better
 working conditions. The Government increasingly favors contract
 workers hired for fixed periods of time. These workers now come
 predominantly from South and East Asian countries and have
 little social contact with the citizen population.
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by tradition
 from freely choosing their place in the society, though less so
 than in other Islamic countries. Nevertheless, some Kuwaiti
 women are outspoken in their demand for more equal treatment.
 In contrast to the practice in some neighboring countries, a
 Kuwaiti woman is permitted to drive a car in public, may wear
 Western dress in public, and has legal access to higher
 education inside and outside the country. Although women are
 yet to join the workforce in large numbers, they are able to
 compete for government and corporate employment and have the
 right to litigate against men (for example, in child custody
 suits). Many women have accumulated substantial personal
 wealth. At times, however, both family and official pressures
 restrict women. For example, the Government has restricted
 women from being assigned abroad in Kuwait's diplomatic
 service. Some prominent, educated women also are wary of
 current fundamentalist trends which may lead the Government to
 restrict their freedoms further as a price for fundamentalist
 restraint on other issues. Ironically, some women students have
 been in the forefront of the growing Sunni fundamentalist
 movement, especially at the university.
