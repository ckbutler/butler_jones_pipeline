 GHANA
 Ghana is governed by the Provisional National Defense Council
 under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant Jerry J. Rawlings,
 who seized power on December 31, 1981, citing a variety of
 abuses of authority by the previous Government, elected in
 1979. Council law 42 vests all executive, legislative,
 judicial, and administrative power in its chairman. In
 practice, government policy develops from a number of close
 advisors, both inside and outside government. The Council was
 recently restored to its original strength of seven members in.
 an effort to achieve participation by individuals representing a
 broader spectrum of Ghanaian political beliefs. A cabinet
 composed of the secretaries (ministers) implements the
 day-to-day activity of government. A strengthened security
 service actively guards against both dissident incursions from
 abroad and internal challenges to the existence of the
 Government. A network of "Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution' is designed as a channel to transmit government
 policies to the citizens and citizen concerns to the
 Government. The major broadcast and print media are
 government-owned and support government policies.
 In 1983, the Government adopted an exceptionally austere
 economic reform program in an effort to redress a quarter
 century of economic mismanagement and political instability
 which caused Ghana to decline from one of Africa's most
 promising states to a level of economic collapse and poverty.
 Remedial measures have included an over 1000 percent
 devaluation, severe structural readjustments, and an emphasis
 upon the rural rather than urban population. In concert with
 the International Monetary Fund, the three-year program has
 begun to have a positive impact and has attracted support from
 foreign donors (including the United States) and international
 financial institutions. The economic growth rate, which was
 negative in 1982, was reversed in 1983 and is expected to reach
 5 percent in 1984, with pre-1983 triple digit inflation reduced
 to 35 percent.
 On the whole, positive trends in human rights identified in the
 second half of 1983 continued during 1984. The universities
 were reopened. The curfew imposed since the assumption of power
 by the Rawlings regime in 1981 was lifted, and the country's
 borders, closed since September 1982, were reopened. A number
 of detainees, including all journalists, were released.
 Physical attacks upon various institutions and groups ceased.
 A freely elected trade union leadership has supplanted a
 government-appointed management group.   Discipline is gradually
 being restored in the uniformed services and the police, and
 among militant political cadres.
 However, systematic violations of internationally defined human
 rights continue to exist. Although the Government has expressed
 its intent to restore democratic practices, there is as yet no
 system of elections or any other method to provide for
 expression of the popular will or for a peaceful change of
 government. Remaining detainees have been incarcerated for over
 two years without having been formally charged. While a public
 tribunal system (parallel to the established court system) has
 been revamped to provide for appeal procedures, its practices
 continue to limit its effectiveness and fairness as an
 alternative system of justice.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The level of politically motivated violence and killing has
 abated considerably since 1982/83. However, the death of one
 person after alleged participation in a coup attempt in March
 1984 resulted in claims that he was summarily executed,
 although the Government claimed that the individual was killed
 while trying to escape from custody. Those who were close to
 the victim and who contradicted the Government's explanation
 did not press formal charges. Senior government legal
 officials have indicated that an inquiry into the
 circumstances of death would have been ordered had there been
 a complaint. One allegation of Government execution of a
 returned exile appeared in the foreign press; the Government
 found the person alive and presented him to the public at an
 Accra press conference.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1984 there were no reported disappearances traceable to
 government action.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture during 1984, but several
 detainees died shortly after release, leading to surmises that
 prolonged incarceration may have been responsible in one way
 or another for their untimely deaths. Also Amnesty
 International's Report for 1984 states that ill-treatment such
 as beatings of certain prisoners occurred in 1983. There are
 recurrent reports that very primitive prison conditions have
 been somewhat improved. Some prisoners have been released to
 reduce overcrowding and systems of weekend furloughs begun for
 certain categories of prisoners pending appeals. Service
 organizations and family members are permitted to provide for
 prisoners, and there are regular church services. The
 Government has moved on several occasions to chastise local
 officials for brutal acts in handling the public but
 occasional minor offenses persist, particularly in  crowd
 control situations and at checkpoints.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Reports of persons arrested or held in detention without
 charge or trial decreased during 1984. Nevertheless,
 beginning in the middle of December 1984 a number of military
 personnel were reportedly detained for questioning in
 connection with suspected dissident activity. Moreover,
 sources indicate that nearly 50 civilian and military
 detainees have remained incarcerated for periods ranging from
 6 to 33 months without being formally charged. In addition,
 senior government legal officers acknowledge that some persons
 are held in jail on remand for prolonged periods prior to
 trial. It is difficult to compile information on the number
 of detainees, as the Government normally does not announce
 detentions or releases. However, in August 1984 a Government
 representative stated that: "Of the persons involved in the
 previous Government, held in detention for investigations into
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 10
 
 
 136
 GHANA
 their conduct whilst in office, only seven are still held.'
 Of the detainees acknowledged to be held by the Government,
 one has been in traction for some months and another has been
 hospitalized for a nervous-disorder.
 Writs of habeas corpus were filed at the high court in Accra
 in 1984 for the release of a total of 36 civilian detainees.
 The first writ covered two journalists and was followed by
 their release. The second application for habeas corpus
 sought the release of 34 detainees, including a number of
 ex-officials from the previous Government. In this case the
 Government successfully maneuvered to have the application
 dismissed through a new law preventing any court from
 inquiring into the grounds for the detention of any Ghanaian
 detained under Council law 2.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional legal safeguards remain available in the
 established court system, which includes high courts, appeal
 courts and a Supreme Court headed by a Chief Justice.
 However, the Rawlings Government also established a number of
 other judicial-type bodies which parallel the older court
 system. These organs include the public tribunals, the
 Citizens' Vetting Committee (recently renamed the Office of
 Revenue Commissioners), the National Investigations Committee,
 the Special Military Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals
 Board. Council law 78, effective December 21, 1983,
 established a new public tribunals board to supervise the
 public tribunals set up originally in 1982. National,
 regional, district, and community public tribunals are
 envisaged; the national regional tribunals already have been
 established in most cases. Critics of the public tribunals,
 however, decry the almost complete absence of trained and
 experienced legal practitioners on the tribunals, and insist
 that accepted rules of evidence and procedure are not always
 followed. Because of the lack of legal safeguards, the Ghana
 Bar Association has boycotted the public tribunals since their
 inception. Government officials acknowledge imperfections but
 defend the new tribunals as a means of providing justice more
 quickly, to more people, with less corruption. They defend
 the ability of laymen to make independent judgments, and have
 instituted a training program for lay officials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There has been a lessening during 1984 of reports of personal
 harassment. Government action reduced the number of
 checkpoints, many unofficial and apparently set up to shake
 down the public. However, in an effort to control smuggling,
 government authorities at ports of entry and exit conducted
 intrusive and unhygienic body searches of travelers. In
 response to widespread crit4.cism, the Government reduced the
 number of such searches and stated its intent to improve the
 conditions under which they are conducted.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns the radio and television stations as well
 as the two principal daily pewspapers. The previously lively
 weekly press has almost disappeared but several small papers
 
 
 137
 GHANA
 have begun to reappear on an irregular basis. All detained
 journalists were freed in 1984 but two died shortly after
 release. The press abides by guided tenets of promoting
 public programs and avoiding criticism of the revolution or of
 Chairman Rawlings and now focuses on uncovering instances of
 waste, fraud, and mismanagement. Allegations of corruption
 generally receive wide coverage and dismissals of officials
 are reported.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Restrictions on peaceful assembly and association continue.
 Police permits are required for public meetings and are
 usually granted, except where the purpose of the meeting is
 suspected to be anti-government in nature. As a result of a
 free election for the leadership of the Trades Union Congress
 in December 1983, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 in 1984 removed Ghana from its list of countries with which
 the ILO has complaints. The Trades Union Congress is a member
 of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity which has its
 headquarters in Accra. The universities opened to complete
 the term which was in progress when they were closed in 1983.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists with no state or otherwise favored
 religion. There is no restriction on the exercise of religion
 or in contacts with others of the same faith. Most Ghanaians,
 including senior government officials, are practicing members
 of a faith. Foreign missionary groups operate freely
 throughout the country. Leaders of organized religion have
 tempered their earlier criticism of the Government, while
 remaining alert to shortcomings and abuses. Church leaders
 generally state that the tone and actions of the Government
 toward the churches have improved markedly in 1984 compared to
 the clashes in early 1983. Government-owned newspapers, on
 the other hand, remain critical of what they occasionally
 consider to be political misuse of the pulpit.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are free to move from one part of the country to
 another without any special permission or pass requirement.
 Since 1983, diplomats have been required to give 48 hours
 notice before traveling outside the greater Accra region.
 While the number is being reduced, there are still a number of
 roadblocks, both official and unofficial, sufficient to
 inhibit travel, especially at night. In addition to questions
 related to security concerns, travelers may be asked for
 receipts for particular items. Failure to have proper
 documentation can lead to forfeiture of the goods and possible
 trial for smuggling.
 As members of the Economic Community of West African States,
 Ghanaians and citizens of other member states are free to
 travel for up to 90 days in West Africa. Ghanaians are
 generally free to exercise this right, as nationals of other
 member states are free to travel to Ghana. The major
 restraint on travel by Ghanaians is the lack of foreign
 exchange. Previously-closed land borders with Togo and the
 Ivory Coast were opened in June 1984, and a midnight to 4:30
 a.m. curfew, which had been in effect since the revolution of
 December 31, 1981, was also lifted.
 
 
 138
 GHANA
 Ghanaians are free to emigrate or to be repatriated from other
 countries unless they are considered a security threat and
 then special permission must be obtained. Passports are
 prized and there are frequent long delays in issuance.
 Applicants for refugee status within Ghana, upon
 certification by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), are granted refugee status and are not
 subject to return to their countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Provisional National Defense Council, chaired by Flight
 Lieutenant Rawlings, exercises total executive and legislative
 power in Ghana. There are no elections and no current
 procedure by which citizens can freely and peacefully choose
 to change their laws, officials, or form of government.
 However, Rawlings' recent appointments to the Council reflect
 a broad spectrum of views. A panel to design new democratic
 structures to replace Ghana's current provisional system is
 currently at work.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permitted several organizations to send
 representatives to Ghana to inquire into the human rights
 situation during the past year. The President of the
 International Press Institute inquired into the fate of
 several imprisoned journalists (the last one was freed in
 July). A representative of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross continued regular visits. The Ghana section of
 Amnesty International held a conference on humanitarian law.
 The International Commission of Jurists sent a representative
 to look into the human rights situation and prepare a report.
 The International Labor Organization received permission to
 send a mission to Ghana.   However, the Government is
 sensitive to any implication that its decisions on human
 rights questions can be affected by external or internal
 pressures. Detainee releases, for example, are not announced
 publicly.
 Within the country there are a number of religious and
 professional bodies concerned about human rights and relevant
 government policies. These institutions during the early days
 of the present Government called attention to human rights
 violations. However, after a number of attacks on their
 members and subsequent detentions (all members of professional
 bodies detained since the December 1981 revolution have since
 been released), they have focused their activities on prison
 reform and emergency feeding programs. Official human rights
 matters are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
 although inquiries from groups such as Amnesty International
 may be answered by any one of a number of agencies and at
 various levels, including cabinet secretaries. Amnesty
 International has shown concern for the lack of adequate legal
 safeguards in the tribunal system and adopted one person found
 guilty by a tribunal as a prisoner of conscience. In its 1984
 report, Amnesty expressed concern about the continued
 detention without trial of real or suspected opponents of the
 Government. Freedom House terms Ghana *not free." Ghana
 participates in the work of the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 in Geneva. Ghana was a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission in Geneva from 197U-1975 and 1980-1983.

 GHANA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ghana is a developing country of 12.2 million citizens
 according to the 1984 census. The population growth rate is
 3.2 percent (1984). Life expectancy at birth is 55.6 years,
 and the infant mortality rate in 1984 was estimated at 76.3
 per 1,000 live births. The per capita gross national product
 was estimated at $356 in 1982. Ghana has a mixed economy,
 with the Government owning a number of enterprises in the
 agricultural, mining, and manufacturing sectors while most
 productive agricultural enterprises, including the key cocoa
 sector, are owned by small farmers. The Government maintains
 a monopoly over the purchase and export of cocoa, coffee, shea
 nuts, and cotton. There is also a substantial private trading
 sector, although the Government favors the state-owned
 companies in national procurement and distribution.
 Ghana adopted an exceptionally austere economic reform program
 in 1983 which has met all targets and is supported by the IMF,
 IBRD, and primary Western donors, including the U.S. The
 recovery program is designed to reverse the country's economic
 decline over the past two decades. Among its features have
 been a devaluation of Ghana's currency by over 1,400 percent;
 establishment of producer and export incentives, e.g.,
 increased prices paid to cocoa and coffee farmers; the
 progressive elimination of subsidies on utilities and
 petroleum products; budgetary stringency; and an emphasis upon
 improving the standard of living in rural areas. The recovery
 program is showing signs of success: real GNP grew at an
 estimated 0.7 percent rate in 1983 and 5.5 percent in 1984,
 and triple digit inflation is targeted to fall to 35 percent
 by the end of 1985. Moreover, the Government worked
 efficiently with the international community in 1983-84 to
 overcome a major drought and food crisis.
 In 1970, the adult literacy rate was estimated to be 30.2
 percent, with the male level at 43.1 percent and the female
 at 18.4 percent. That difference could be attributed partly
 to limited educational facilities and a traditional preference
 for educating male over female children. Current literacy
 rates are not available, but by 1979 primary school enrollment
 ratios indicated improvement in access to education with 69
 percent of school-age children enrolled, 77 percent for boys
 and 60 percent for girls. In 1975, 35 percent of the
 population had access to safe drinking water (86 percent of
 the urban population). A renewed emphasis is now being placed
 on creating or improving wells in rural areas, particularly in
 the northern regions.
 Ethnic discrimination is not a major problem in Ghana.
 Government officials cover the ethnic spectrum. Some ethnic
 concentration occurs in selected professions and at senior
 military and security levels. Women's rights in the economy,
 business, and the civil service, as well as in the home, have
 long been well established and respected. There are two women
 amony the seven members of the ruling Provisional National
 Defense Council, a woman cabinet member, and at least five
 woman in sub-cabinet positions. Although women in urban
 centers and those who have entered modern society encounter
 little bias in most endeavors, some role pressures exist.
 Women in the rural agricultural sector remain subject to the
 cunstraints associated with traditional male-dominant mores,
 in spite of efforts by the Government and more enlightened
 elements in the society to curtail these practices.
