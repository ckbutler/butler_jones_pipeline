 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is one of the world's most impoverished and
 overpopulated countries. During the four-year rule of
 the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) immediately
 following independence, the Government was ineffectively
 administered, the economic situation deteriorated, and
 political assassination was widespread. President Ziaur
 Rahman (Zia) took power as a Martial Law Administrator
 in November, 1975 at the end of a series of coups and
 has gradually been turning over responsibility to
 civilian authorities. There has been a modest but
 broad-based improvement in the quality of public admin-
 istration, the economy and public order. In a nation-
 wide election on June 3, 1978, with a 53 percent voter
 turnout, Zia was elected President by a majority of
 77 percent.
 During the past year, there has been significant pro-
 gress in fulfilling commitments to restore political
 freedoms and to promote economic development. The
 number of political prisoners has been reduced by
 more than half; those released during the year have
 included some vocal opponents of the Government. The
 June Presidential election was conducted fairly,
 though the brevity of the campaign worked against all
 but the front-runner. Parliamentary elections are
 scheduled for February 12,1979. While the Martial
 Law apparatus is still in place, its power has been
 reduced, and the Government has announced it will be
 withdrawn totally after the parliamentary elections.
 In the area of economic rights, the Government has
 committed itself in its agreements with donor countries,
 the United States in particular, to address the needs of
 its poorest citizens.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of   the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State is not aware of any evidence
 or allegations of torture in Bangladesh.
 
 (528)
 
 
 529
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 It is a crime in Bangladesh to coerce or intimidate
 citizens or otherwise abuse police powers, and the
 Bangladesh Government is improving discipline in the
 police force.
 Ordinary prisoners are treated harshly. Prisons are
 generally overcrowded. Released detainees have com-
 plained of inadequate nutrition and medical attention.-
 These conditions result more from a lack of resources
 than from deliberate neglect. Further prisoner releases
 should reduce the overcrowding in the jails and provide
 more access to medical facilities and services now
 insufficiently available. In November 1978, the
 Government announced the appointment of a jail reform
 commission to study all aspects of prison administration
 in the country.
 After an October 1977 coup attempt and during early
 1978, international concern was focused on reports,
 including one by Amnesty International, that two hundred
 or more soldiers were executed for mutiny after summary,
 closed, proceedings. The Bangladesh Government has
 never made any figures public on the number executed nor
 described the methods of judicial procedure used.
 Officials have noted that no civilians were involved and
 that some mutineers -- all military personnel -- were
 accorded the traditional military penalty for mutiny.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The present Government has released over 15,000 prisoners
 since coming to power in 1975. In 1978, 3,931.prisoners
 were freed. These releases have coincided with signifi-
 cant national holidays. In addition to the amnesties,
 there has been a steady trickle of releases through
 habeas corpus petitions to the civil courts.
 Of the over'15,000 detainees released, more than 6,000
 were political prisoners (whom the regime defines as
 persons held without trial). Most of these persons had
 been jailed by the three governments following indepen-
 dence in 1971. Of the 3,931 freed by late 1978, 914
 
 
 530
 were identified as political detainees. While the
 Bangladesh Government has never stated precisely how
 many political prisoners it holds, slightly more than
 500 reportedly remain imprisoned. The Zia Government
 has arrested more than 100 prisoners, including former
 President Mushtaque Ahmed. However, some of these,
 including Mushtaque, have been accused and convicted of
 such non-political crimes as corruption.
 Amnesty International in its annual report for 1977
 estimated that political prisoners in Bangladesh numbered
 10,000-15,000. The difference between this figure and
 the late 1978 estimate of "slightly more than 500"
 reflects releases in the interim as well as differing
 definitions of "political prisoner". Amnesty Interna-
 tional apparently assumes that all prisoners held and
 tried under emergency legislation and Martial Law
 regulations are political prisoners. However, these
 laws and regulations also cover such crimes as murder,
 corruption, hoarding and smuggling, and were designed in
 part to provide "quick justice" in a disorderly country.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 At present, two court systems operate in Bangladesh.
 Civil courts with guarantees of fair and public trials
 have jurisdiction in most cases. However, cases
 involving treason, sedition, corruption, smuggling, and
 other charges which are defined as "anti-state crimes"
 fall under the jurisdiction of Martial Law courts.
 Although Martial Law ordinances originally did not
 permit the individual charged to be represented by
 counsel, under a recently instituted change a defendant
 can be represented by legal counsel exactly as in civil
 courts. Under an amendment to the ordinances in 1977,
 civilian courts may in a few instances review the
 proceedings of the Martial Law courts.
 During 1978, the trend has been toward more liberal
 procedures in trials conducted under authority of
 Martial law. The Government states that with the
 exception of persons charged with murder, most of those
 charged are released on bail. A few Martial Law trials
 have been open to the public; a recent murder trial
 
 
 531
 before a Martial Law panel was extensively reported in
 both the Bengali and English-language press. Martial
 law courts, because they are authorized to try cases
 before all persons charged have been apprehended, are
 apparently speeding the disposition of pending cases and
 therefore reducing the number of persons held in jail
 pending trial.
 Martial Law courts are to cease to operate after the
 withdrawal of Martial Law following the elections in
 February 1979.
 e. Invasion of -the Home
 Bangladeshi authorities do not engage in arbitrary
 invasion of the home. During the previous Mujib regime
 the sanctity of the home was not honored.
 2. Governmefital Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Bangladesh is committed to improving
 the lot of its predominantly rural masses, who are among
 the world's poorest people, with a strategy which
 emphasizes agriculture and rural development rather than
 urban, industrial growth. Through this approach it also
 hopes to alleviate inequities in distribution of income.
 These inequities reflect the basic structure of Bangla-
 desh society: a small urban middle class, a larger group
 of small farmers who earn a modest surplus, and a
 growing mass of marginal farmers and landless laborers.
 Increased food production is central to the Government's
 rural development strategy. By making low-cost ferti-
 lizer, labor-intensive high-yield seeds, irrigation and
 credit more widely available, the Government hopes to
 achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains and to generate
 new labor-intensive growth sectors such as small rural
 industry. Extensive rural public works, including
 Food-for-Work programs, are another element of this
 policy. The Government is also attempting to strengthen
 its family planning efforts. It recently announced a
 major program for a system of rural medics to overcome
 serious deficiencies in rural health care.
 
 
 532
 Despite this new commitment to helping Bangladesh's poor
 majority,the Government's limited resources are inade-
 quate to keep pace with population growth. Serious
 inequities in distribution of income and resources
 persist. Corruption is understood to be widespread in
 both the public and private sector, has been difficult
 to check, and continues to divert resources from economic
 development and social reform. Budget allocations for
 state industries, higher education, urban health,
 utilities and other services, as well as higher wages
 paid to organized labor and public employees, also
 confer disproportionate benefits on the urban classes.
 Farmers with relatively large holdings have more oppor-
 tunities to obtain fertilizer, credit, water and other
 production inputs than do marginal farmers or share-
 croppers.
 In addressing these inequities and the immense needs of
 the poor, the Government rejects a policy of rapid
 redistribution of existing wealth. Because of Bangla-
 desh's limited resources, weak economic institutions
 and low productivity, there is little wealth to distri-
 bute. Consequently, the Government pursues a policy of
 political liberalization which should produce evolution-
 ary social change, and it has adopted a strategy
 which it hopes will promote economic growth and simul-
 taneously increase equity by creating employment and
 bringing more poor people into the process of production.
 3. Respect for Civilian Political Liberties Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 During the initial period of Martial Law the right
 of freedom of expression, including freedom of speech
 and of the press, was curtailed. A demonstration by
 journalists for restoration of press freedom took place
 in Dacca in mid-1978 and was broken up by the police,
 with arrests and injuries. But restrictions have now
 been greatly eased. As noted below, political parties
 now freely express their views in public meetings.
 While the numerous government-owned newspapers carry
 
 
 533
 government-directed news, privately -owned papers,
 including Bangladesh's leading daily, criticize the
 Government, although exercising a degree of self-censor-
 ship.
 Virtually all restrictions on political activity have
 been lifted, and the political scene has resumed its
 former vibrancy. The Government hasnot interfered with
 public meetings called by opposition parties, nor has it
 moved against groups which have criticized government
 policies. The ban on strikes remains technically in
 effect, but no punitive action was taken when various
 groups of public sector employees engaged in "pen down"
 strikes early in 1978. A few labor leaders were arrested
 briefly as a result of incidents arising from demonstra-
 tions during public sector strikes held in late 1978,
 but these strikes were eventually settled through
 negotiations. The Government has promised to promulgate
 in January 1979 a new labor policy providing for the
 full range of union activity.
 Though "secularism" has been eliminated as a state goal
 under the Constitution, there have been no indications
 of government infringement of the rights of minority
 religious communities. In inaugurating a Hindu religious
 conference in March 1978, President Zia reassured the
 country's religious minorities that their rights as
 citizens of Bangladesh would be respected by the Govern-
 ment.
 In the traditional Muslim culture of Bangladesh,
 women are disadvantaged, play a secondary role to men
 and are seldom seen in public. The Constitution,
 however, provides for equal rights for women in all
 spheres of public life, and women hold a few senior
 government positions, including a cabinet level post for
 women's affairs. President Zia has recently given
 personal attention to addressing the needs of women and
 the family.
 
 
 534
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Bangladeshis, including the "Bihari" (non-Bengali, Urdu-
 speaking Muslim) minority, have freedom of movement
 within Bangladesh. All Bangladeshis who are regarded as
 loyal citizens are free to visit or emigrate abroad.
 In 1977 Pakistan agreed to let an additional 25,000
 Biharis migrate to Pakistan. A much larger number of
 Biharis have applied for "repatriation" to Pakistan, but
 Pakistan has not agreed to accept them. The Bangladesh
 Government regards these persons as having forfeited
 their citizenship by reason of opposition to the Bangla-
 desh liberation struggle in 1971.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Zia Government on November 18, 1978 repealed the
 Political Parties Regulation, which specified political
 parties which were allowed to engage in limited government-
 approved activities. There are now over twenty political
 parties active-in Bangladesh, including the formerly
 banned Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (believed to have
 been behind the mutiny of October 1977), Mushtaque
 Ahmed's Democratic League, and Mujib's Awami League.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Bangladesh Government has been willing to allow
 independent outside investigation of alleged human
 rights violations. Amnesty International representa-
 tives visited Bangladesh in 1977 and received some
 cooperation from the Government.
