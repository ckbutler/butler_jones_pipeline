 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence
 of Cape Verde (PAICV), the country's sole political party,
 under the leadership of President Aristides Pereira. Most
 government ministers are also senior members of the party, and
 many of them were leaders of the revolutionary movement to
 free Cape Verde from Portuguese rule. The PAICV is officially
 open to anyone wishing to join, and membership, about 4 percent
 of the voting population, has doubled in the 11 years since
 independence. The Constitution adopted in 1980 declares the
 party "tfie supreme expression of the interests of the popular
 masses." Members of the Popular National Assembly, which is
 formally the supreme organ of the State, are elected from a
 slate of candidates which is proposed to the electorate by the
 partj. The Assembly selects the President, who, as Head of
 State, proposes the Prime Minister to the Assembly. While the
 Assembly does not reverse government/party decisions, deputies
 debate issues openly, and critical views are often reported in
 the media.
 Security responsibilities, which had been divided between the
 military, the security, and police forces, were combined into
 a single government department in February 1986. The
 reorganized Ministry of Defense and Security operates under
 guidelines and leadership approved by the party.
 Cape Verde has few natural resources, and for years Cape
 Verdeans-have emigrated to improve their economic condition.
 (Over 350,000 live abroad.) Cape Verde's development efforts
 for its population of 320,000 have been further hindered by a
 19-year drought which has severely affected employment
 possibilities for the rural population and seriously diminished
 water; upplies. Nonetheless, there has been no starvation
 since independence, which can be, attributed to generous
 foreign assistance,,xemittances from Cape-Verdean emigrants,
 and efficient manageient by the Government. Heavy summer
 rains in 1987 may.signal the end of the drought and hold the
 promise of improvements in the agricultural sector. The
 Government is the largest nonagricultural employer. It
 controls Ibanking, the import of most basic commodities,
 airlines, the press, and schools. Private property rights are
 respected. There is a substantial and growing private sector
 which includes shops, hotels, farms, fishing, small industries
 (such as tuna canning), and the professions.
 Human ,rights were generally respected in Cape Verde during
 1987. However, there were unsubstantiated allegations of
 certain human rights abuses, including the use of temporary
 detention to suppress antigovernment views in a series of
 articles in a Catholic monthly newspaper. The beating death
 of a young man while in police detention was reported in
 November. Responsible police Officials were relieved of their
 duties and detained to be tried.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respec  for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fom:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of politically motivated
 deaths.
 
 
 46
 CAPE VERDE
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported instances of officially inspired
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In November a young man was beaten to death while in detention
 in a local jail on Brava Island. The government press made a
 full report of the incident, and the policeman responsible,
 along with his superior officer, was put under detention to be
 tried according to the law. There was no other evidence of
 torture or other cruel and unusual punishment of prisoners and
 detainees, although unsubstantiated allegations of
 "concentration-camp conditions" in prisons appeared in a local
 monthly newspaper. Conditions in prisons are indeed poor and
 detention facilities antiquated, except in Praia where a new
 prison facility was recently completed. Cape Verde is the
 only country in Africa where capital punishment has been
 outlawed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Some reports surfaced during 1987 of persons being detained
 and tried for the expression of views critical of or different
 from those of the Government. In all known cases, such persons
 were charged with disturbing the peace or demonstrating without
 permission. Jail sentences in these instances were waived or
 very light.
 Cape Verde law requires that an accused person, unless caught
 in the act of committing a crime, be brought before a judge to
 be charged within 48 hours of arrest. In exceptional cases,
 with the concurrence of a court official, the formal charge
 process may be delayed, but it still must take place within 5
 days of arrest. For crimes against state security, however,
 persons may be detained for up to 5 months without trial upon
 a judge's ruling. There is a functioning system of bail, and
 everyone is entitled to representation by an attorney in civil
 or criminal cases. Those unable to afford legal counsel are
 represented by lawyers named by the state-run Lawyers'
 Association.
 There were no known instances of forced exile for political or
 other reasons. Forced labor is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners.
 The judicial system is composed of a Supreme Court, whose
 members are appointed by the Government, regional courts, and
 local popular courts. Trials are conducted by one judge
 without a jury. The autonomous Institute for Judiciary
 Support, to which all private lawyers belong, provides counsel
 for defendants in cases of need. Trials appear to be handled
 expeditiously, and most evidence suggests that the courts
 protect individual rights in criminal cases. Verdicts can be
 appealed.
 The popular tribunals adjudicate minor disputes on a local
 level in rural areas. The "judges,." who are appointees of the
 Ministry of Justice, are usually prominent local citizens
 
 
 47
 CAPE VERDE
 without legal training. Their decisions can be appealed
 within the regular court system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 invioLability of domicile, correspondence, and other means of
 communication. The law requires warrants issued by a judge
 before searches of homes may be conducted. There were no
 known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence during 1987. The Constitution also
 contains the provision that every citizen has the right and
 the duty~tp participate in the political, economic, and
 cultural life of the country. This provision theoretically
 could be used to.force a person's pprticipation in activities
 against his or her will. In practice, there is no evidence to
 suggestthat this provision has been so used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and-Press
 The CGnstitgtion.proclaims freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of-authorship, but it also
 stipulgtes that none of these rights and freedoms may be
 exergised "contrary to national unity." While freedom of the
 p~ess s not-a specific constitutional guarantee, a law
 adopted in December,1985 assures citizens the right to express
 their thoughts in the press, but at the same time the party
 underlined that this right should be exercised responsibly.
 The weekly newspaper, radio, and television are government
 owned-and follow government policies. Occasional articles
 critical of some aspects of government policy are printed or
 broadcast, but this is probably done with prior authorization
 from the Government. Local radio broadcasts carry items from
 Western agencies as well as from Communist countries, generally
 balancing coverage and-identifying sources on controversial
 international issues.
 The Catholic Church's monthly newspaper, which has carried
 criticism of some aspects of life in Cape-Verde, is tolerated
 without interference as long as its articles'are not viewed as
 a threat-to the-Government. On occasion, the editor and  N"
 contgibutors have been called before tribunals to explain their
 article s. There-were no reprisals against the newspaper for
 iti series of articles on human rights abuses.
 Foreign periodicals generally circulate freely ih-Cape'Verde
 even when they contain articles critical of or unflattering to
 the Government, as is sometimes the case with Portuguese
 newspapers. International Tadio broadcasts are received
 clearly without interference. - Almost all movies shown are
 nonpolitical in content, and some are occasionally censored on
 moral grdunds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The-freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate
 is proyided for in the Constitution. As a practical matter,
 however, no organizations opposed to the Government or its
 policies are permitted. Private associations other than
 sports clubs or religious youth groups do not exist. 'The
 establishment of such associations would be subject to
 
 
 48
 CAPE VERDE
 government authorization. Party-sponsored "mass organizations"
 of women and youth are prominent.
 Demonstrations occurred in 1987, supported in part by the
 Catholic Church, protesting such things as new abortion
 legislation and educational reforms. Several small rallies by
 students and unemployed youth in Cape Verde's second largest
 city also occurred. Some participants in these demonstrations
 were arrested and charged with disturbing the peace and
 demonstrating without permission. They were subsequently
 released or given light jail sentences.
 Workers in several sectors are organized into unions within
 the National Union Confederation (NUC). The Confederation is
 affiliated with the PAICV and headed by a high-ranking party
 member. About one-third of the active work force are nominal
 members. Individual unions perform some traditional trade
 union functions and act also as party affiliates. There is no
 reference to strikes or the right to strike in the Constitution
 or in any legislation. In the absence of any legal prohibition
 against strikes, the NUC believes that the right to strike
 exists, but it has never been exercised. Union leadership has
 taken positions on specific issues in opposition to government
 policies in state enterprises. The NUC participates in the
 International Labor Organization and is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, but has not taken
 positions independent of those officially sanctioned by the
 Government. It maintains contact with and receives assistance
 from both Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution requires separation of church and state.
 Freedom of worship is respected by the Government, and members
 of all faiths practice their religion without harassment. At
 least two-thirds of the population, probably including most of
 the government leadership, are nominally Catholic, but the
 dominance of Catholicism does not appear to affect adversely
 other faiths. Evangelical Protestants and Seventh-Day
 Adventists are the two other principal religious communities.
 At least two faiths, the Baha'i and "Christian Rationalism,"
 which were formally banned or suppressed under the Portuguese,
 have been permitted to reestablish themselves and operate
 freely since independence. There are no restrictions on
 religious practices, teaching, or contacts with coreligionists
 outside Cape Verde. The Catholic Church, for example, openly
 opposes birth control methods which are advocated and
 supported by the Government. A few foreign missionaries are
 active in Cape Verde, and more than half the Catholic clergy
 are non-Cape Verdeans.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions
 -on either travel or residence within the country. All resident
 Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either temporarily
 or permanently, must obtain exit permission from the
 Government. Such permission has not been denied for political
 reasons. Emigration has long been an important and recognized
 escape valve from prevailing harsh economic conditions. The
 Government goes to considerable effort to maintain close
 contact with emigre communities and provides every opportunity
 for Cape Verdeans living abroad to maintain their ties with
 
 
 49
 CAPE VERDE
 the homeland, including making provision to vote in elections.
 Repatriation is a constitutional right, and the Government
 does not discourage intending repatriates.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several
 grounds, including activities contrary to the interest of the
 country. However, there are no known cases of the Government
 instituting proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship for
 political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The party's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is inscribed in
 the Conhtitution. Opposition parties are illegal and do not
 exist. Therefore, citizens are unable to change the one-party
 political system through democratic means. The small group of
 men who actually led the struggle for independence occupy
 positions of leadership in both the party and the Government.
 The Secretary General of the party is President of the
 Republic, the Deputy Secretary General is Prime Minister, and
 the third-ranking party official is President of the National
 Assembly.,, Five,other members of.the party's Political
 Commission are also Ministers. Not all ministers or
 secretarieg-of state are party members, but all clearly serve
 at the pleasure of the party.
 Current party membership is about 6,000, which is about
 4 percent of the total adult population and represents a
 doubling in size since independence in 1975. Within this
 elitist party,.there exists a modest scope for meaningful
 political activity. The delegates to the Second Party
 Congress in 1983, and the leadership itself, were elected by
 secret ballot with some-unexpected changes in the order of
 precedence for various ministers. The party leadership also
 made an obvious effort to-give women and persons with less
 solid revolutionary credentials more prominent roles.
 However, women, who comprise 14 percent of the total party
 membership, remain underrepresented. The party membership is
 young (47 percent under 30 years of age), disproportionately
 urban (50 percent in a nation which is two-thirds rural), and
 heavily representative of the bureaucracy (25 percent of party
 members are civil servants or employees of state enterprises).
 National Assembly elections were last held in December 1985.
 A single slate of candidates, all of whom were either party
 members or nominees with party approval, was presented to
 voters. The final list of candidates was selected after three
 stages of local consultations, during which as many as four
 candidates---not necessarily party .members--were discussed fof
 each seat. As a result of this winnowing process, several
 prominent nonparty candidates won party approval and election
 to the Assembly. Twice-yearly Assembly sessions serve to
 ratify- earlier party/government decisions, but issues are
 debated openly with critical interventions reported in the
 media, and voting on these issues is far from unanimous.
 Motions introduced by the Government are not always adopted.
 Deputies criticize government policies and decisions, but
 policy decisions already made by the Council of Ministers are
 not reversed.

 CAPE VERDE
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government in the past has permitted visits by private
 organizations to investigate conditions of persons convicted
 for political or related offenses. There are no known
 instances in which the Government has been the subject of
 resolutions, investigations, or other human rights actions by
 official international organizations. Allegations of human
 rights abuses have been made by a few Cape Verdeans living
 abroad and by a locally published Catholic newspaper, but no
 violations have ever been proved. There are no known official
 or nongovernmental human rights organizations in the country,
 although the Lawyers' Association for the Provision of
 Judicial Support performs some of the functions of such an
 organization.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The country has made substantial strides in providing health
 care, education, and other services to the population. Racial
 discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde, where the vast
 majority of the population shares various proportions of
 Portuguese and African ancestry. Sex discrimination exists,
 although it is banned by the Constitution. Many traditional
 male-oriented values of the Portuguese and African ancestors
 of today's Cape Verdeans are still part of the country's
 culture. The Code of the Family, enacted in October 1981,
 prescribes the full equality of men and women in law, including
 equal pay for equal work, but in practice women have been
 customarily excluded from certain types of employment and are
 often paid less than men. Both the Government and the party
 are making efforts to bring women into various economic and
 social activities where they have been traditionally absent.
 The Government has included women in the labor-intensive
 economic development projects financed by foreign grants. The
 Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with
 party encouragement, to sensitize the Government and Cape
 Verdeans in general to issues affecting women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minimum wages are established by the Government for both civil
 servants and private enterprises. As of January 1, 1987, the
 minimum wage for civil servants was approximately $84 per
 month. Wages for unskilled workers are considerably lower,
 and in rural areas the daily minimum for the least skilled
 types of labor is about $1.62 per day. The minimum age for
 employment is 14, and children under 16 are prohibited from
 working at night, more than 7 hours per day, or in
 establishments where toxic products are used. All enterprises
 submit a yearly report to the Director General of Labor with
 information on salary and ages of each employee. This
 provides the Government with a vehicle for controlling
 employment practices. There does not appear to be an overall
 safety and health code, although some regulations exist in
 this area. The normal workweek for adults is 44 hours over
 5-1/2 days. A worker is entitled to at least 1 free day per
 week. These regulations seem to be respected in practice.
