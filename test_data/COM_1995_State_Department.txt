 COMOROS*
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims
 a fourth, Mayotte, which is still governed by France. The Comoros has a constitu-
 tional government but has been prone to coups since independence in 1975. The
 most recent came on September 28 when foreign-led mercenaries and disaffected
 Comorian troops attempted to overthrow the elected government of President Said
 Mohamed Djohar. French military forces sent to the island 1 week later arrested
 the mercenaries, reinstalled the elected Prime Minister, and freed Djohar but re-
 moved him for "medical treatment" to the French Department of Reunion. Citing
 constitutional provisions that take effect when the President is unable to rule,
 Prime Minister Caabi El Yachroutou declared himself Acting President, formed a co-
 alition Government, and pledged to hold new presidential elections. In January
 1996, President Djohar returned to Comoros to assume his ceremonial duties in ac-
 cordance with an agreement brokered by the Organization for African Unity (OAU).
 Presidential elections were scheduled for March 6 and 16.
 The Comorian Defense Force (FCD) and the Gendarmerie are responsible for in-
 ternal security. Both are under civilian control, but their loyalty is suspect as shown
 by the participation of several hundred soldiers in the September 28 coup. During
 the 1991 elections there were reports of interference by members of the military act-
 Do.n behalf of the Djohar Government. French officers serve as advisers to the
 The economy of this extremely poor country is dominated by agriculture, but there
 is a shortage of arable land; soil erosion exacerbates this problem. Revenues from
 the main crops-vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves-continue to fall, while
 the population (about 500,000) is growing at an extremely high rate of 3.56 percent.
 The per capita income is approximately $400. The Comoros is a part of the French

 franc monetary zone, but the 1994 devaluation of the franc did not improve the im-
 port-dependent economy, and it has had serious short-term consequences on govern-
 ment finances. The Comoros depends heavily on financial assistance from France
 and the European Union.
 The human rights situation did not improve in 1995. The Djohar Government
 abridged freedoms of the press and travel and continued to hold soldiers who had
 allegedly participated in the 1992 coup attempt against the Government. They were
 releasedby the mercenaries who carried out the September 28 coup, and the coali-
 tion Government has granted them amnesty.
 The 1993 trial in the State Security Court of 16 other persons, including two sons
 of former president Abdallah, for participation in the 1992 coup attempt did not
 meet international standards for a fair trial. The Government did permit officials
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Abdallah's sons in
 prison. Prison conditions remained harsh, and societal discrimination against
 women continued to be a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings:
 As far as known, there has been no official investigation into the deaths of two
 persons reportediy killed and secretly buried by the Gendarmerie on the eve of the
 leslative elections in December 1993 on the island of Anjouan.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or            reatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution provides for security of the person, and there were no substan-
 tiated reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment.
 Prison conditions continued to be poor. A lack of proper sanitation, overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and poor diet are common problems. The Government
 admits these problems but has taken no action to remedy them. Those persons im-
 prisoned in connection with the 1992 coup attempt reported that they were held in
 cramped, humid, and poorly ventilated cells without sanitary facilities, especially at
 Kandani barracks in Moroni. The Government claimed to have moved them to the
 regular prison, but press reports of the coup explicitly stated that they had been
 freed from Kandani barracks. While the Government would not permit diplomats to
 visit the two sons of former president Abdallah, who were implicated in the 1992
 coup attempt, it did permit an ICRC official and some political associates to visit
 them. There were no reports of abuse of women in prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution does not specify a time
 limit between arrest and appearance before a magistrate; however according to
 usual procedure the time limit is 48 hours. The law is silent about how long pris-
 oners held for security reasons may be detained without being charged. The soldiers
 arrested after the 1992 coup were apparently tried, but details of that trial are
 sketchy. Their exact number remained unknown, but reliable estimates were about
 17. Those released by th s mercenaries in September have been granted amnesty.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary
 is largely independent, ,nd trials are public. The Supreme Court has the power to
 review the decisions of lower courts, including the Court of Appeals.
 The 1992 Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens before the law and
 the right of all accused persons to defense counsel. However, there are few lawyers
 in the country, making it difficult to obtain legal representation. The Government
 does not provide free legal counsel to the accused. The legal system incorporates Is-
 lamic law as well as French legal codes. Most disputes are settled by village elders
 or by a civilian court of first instance.
 The number of political prisoners held by the Government was not known at
 year's end. Omar Tamou and M'tara Maecha, who admitted to staging the 1992
 coup attempt, were released September 28. The State Security Court trial of 16 per-
 sons (4 in absentia), including the 2 sons of former president Abdallah, held in April
 1993, was judged unfair by international human rights monitors. There was evi-
 dence of executive interference during the trial (see the 1993 report), and defense
 lawyers had limited access to the defendants and case information. At year's end,
 how many, if any, of these people were still being held was unclear.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and property. There were no
 known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, thought, and conscience, and the Government generally respected this right in
 practice with one important exception (see below). Comorians discuss and criticize
 the Government and its leading personalities openly. The several small independent
 newspapers and weekly semiofficial newspaper freely criticize the Government, but
 the latter's editors are selected by the Minister of Information and are usually his
 allies.
 The government-controlled radio station, Radio Comoros, is the only station in the
 country following last year's closure by the Government of the only independent sta-
 tion. Credible sources cite the station's frequent criticism of the Government and
 ties to opposition politicians as the reasons for its closure. Comorians receive broad-
 casts from Mayotte Radio as well as from French television without interference,
 but these carry only limited news about Comoros developments. Satellite antennas
 are popular and amateur radio licenses are issued without hindrance. Foreign news-
 papers are available, as are books from abroad.
 Although there is no university in the Comoros, secondary level teachers and stu-
 dents speak freely, and students occasionally engaged in meetings which criticized
 the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government generally respects these
 rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution designates Islam as the state religion. The Government
 permits non-Muslims to practice their faith, and Christian missionaries work in
 local hospitals and schools but are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are generally freely granted. However, before the September coup, ex-
 presidential candidate Mohamed Taki was refused an exit visa, which he requested
 in order to visit an organization's inauguration in France. The Government claimed
 that he was conspiring to overthrow the Government.
 There are no refugees in the Comoros.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, but it has not yet been fully demonstrated that they, in
 fact, have the ability peacefully to change their government through free and fair
 elections. The Constitution gives legal status to a multiparty system and provides
 for other fundamental rights. Nevertheless, the political system remains unstable,
 and many democratic institutions established by the Constitution, such as the con-
 stitutional council, the senate, and the island councils, have not been created.
 The new coalition Government is made up of President Djohar's ruling Rally for
 Democracy and Renewal (RDR) Party and all major opposition parties, including
 those that participated in the coup. In January 1996, the OAU brokered an agree-
 ment between the Caabi coalition government and President Djohar under which
 Djohar returned to the Comoros and assumed his symbolic and ceremonial functions
 as President. Presidential elections were scheduled to be held on March 6 (first
 round) and March 16 (second round).
 Village chiefs and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics. Tradi-
 tional social, religious, and economic institutions also importantly affect the coun-
 try's political life.
 Traditionally, Comorian society is male-dominated, making it very difficult for
 women to become involved in politics. Women have the right to vote and participate
 in the political process; however, there are no female ministers or members of the
 National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Comoros Human Rights Association, established in 1990, continues to func-
 tion, but many members are unwilling to criticize the Government vigorously for
 fear of losing their civil service positions. The Government cooperates with inter-
 national human rights organizations, including the ICRC. However, it turned down
 a request by a foreign diplomatic mission to visit prisons (see Section 1.c.).
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens regardless of race,
 sex, origin, or religion. The Government generally respects these provisions in prac-
 tice but discourages the practice of religions other than Islan
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but medical authorities, the police, and
 women's groups believe that it is rare. In theory a woman could seek protection
 through the courts in the case of violence, but in reality the issue would most likely
 be addressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Despite constitutional provisions for equality, men have the dominant role in
 Comorian society, and few women hold positions of responsibility in government or
 business. Societal discrimination against women is most apparent outside the major
 towns where women carry heavy farming and child-rearing duties, with fewer op-
 portunities for education and wage employment. In contrast, change in the status
 of women is most evident in the major towns, where growing numbers of women
 are in the labor force and generally receive wages comparable to those of men en-
 gaged in similar work. While legal discrimination exists in some areas, in general,
 inheritance and property rights do not disfavor women; for example, the house the
 father of the bride traditionally provides to the couple at the time of their marriage
 remains her property even in the case of divorce.
 Children.-The Government, while committed to the protection of children's rights
 and welfare in theory, has an extremely limited ability to put this into practice. fop-
 ulation pressure and poverty force some families to place their children into the
 homes of others. These children, often as young as 7 years of age, typically work
 long hours as domestic servants in exchange for food and shelter. The few legal in-
 struments which address the rights and welfare of children are not enforced because
 of a lack of inspectors.
 Female genital mutilation is not generally practiced, and child abuse appears to
 be rare.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that the disabled should not
 be abandoned by the State, and there is no evidence of widespread discrimination
 against the disabled in the provision of education or other services. No legislation
 is in force or pending concerning accessibility to public buildings or services for peo-
 ple with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution allows workers, including most
 public sector workers, to form unions and to strike. Farming on small landholdin,
 subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily activity of most of te
 population. Hence, the wage labor force is small; less than 7,000 including govern-
 ment employees, and less than 2,000 excluding them. Teachers, civil servants, and
 dock workers are unionized. Unions are independent of the Government. Teachers
 and hospital workers go on strike intermittently, mostly because they do not get
 paid for months at a time. There are no laws protecting strikers from retribution,
 but there were no known instances of retribution.
 There are no restrictions on unions joining federations or affiliating with inter-
 national bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain collectively, andstrikes are legal. Wages are set by employers in the small pri-
 vate sector and by the Government, especially the Ministries of Finance and Labor,
 in the larger public sector. The Labor Code, which is only loosely enforced, does not
 set up a system for resolving labor disputes, and it does not prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines 15 years
 as the minimum age for the employment of children. The Ministry of Labor has few
 resources to enforce this provision, but outside of domestic work child labor is not
 an issue due to the general lack of wage employment opportunities. Children gen-
 erally help with the work of their families in the subsistence farming and fishing
 sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in over a decade
 and no longer reflect economic realities. The minimum wage for a laborer is about
 $11 (4,600 Comorian francs) per month. The Government periodically reminds em-
 ployers to respect the Labor Code, which specifies 1 day off per week, plus 1 month
 
 
 of paid vacation per year, but does not set a standard workweek. There are no safe-
 ty or health standards for the minuscule manufacturing sector.
