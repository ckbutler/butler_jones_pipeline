 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence
 of Cape Verde, the country's sole political party. Government
 ministers, in most cases, are also senior members of the
 party. Many of them are former leaders of the revolutionary
 movement to free Cape Verde from Portuguese rule. This party
 leadership, headed by President Pereira, in effect rules the
 country. Party membership has about doubled in the nine years
 since independence, and the leadership group has been expanded
 to include technocrats whose revolutionary credentials are
 less strong. Still, only about five percent of the voting
 population belongs to the party, although it is officially
 open to anyone wishing to join.
 The Constitution adopted in 1980 declares the party 'the
 supreme expression of the interests of the popular masses' and
 designates the Popular National Assembly as the supreme organ
 of the state. The designation of the party as the country's
 governing political organization and the control of the party
 apparatus by senior members effectively limits the permissible
 range of political activity. The Assembly selects the
 President, who, as head of state, proposes the prime minister
 to the Assembly. The Assembly is elected from a slate of
 candidates which is proposed to the electorate by the party.
 Party selection of all candidates for Assembly seats restricts
 the freedom of choice of the individual voter.
 Security responsibilities are divided between the army,
 primarily for external defense, and the security and police
 forces for internal order. Both operate under legal
 guidelines and leadership approved by the party.
 Although Cape Verde is one of the poorest nations in the
 world, sizable amounts of foreign assistance, as well as
 remittances from Cape Verdean emigrants, prevent starvation.
 The current drought, now in its 17th year, drastically limits
 production of even basic necessities. The duration of the
 drought has reduced irrigated areas by about one-half and
 seriously diminished water supplies for domestic and
 industrial use. As three-quarters of the population is rural
 with few employment opportunities apart from farming, Cape
 Verdeans continue to emigrate on a major scale.
 The Government, which is the largest nonagricultural employer,
 also controls banking, the import of basic commodities,
 airlines, the press, and schools. Private property rights are
 respected, and there is a substantial private sector which
 includes shops, hotels, farms, fishing, small industries such
 as tuna canning, and the professions.
 The state of human rights in Cape Verde during 1984 changed
 little from that of 1983. Opposition groups outside the
 country continued to make allegations that dissent was
 suppressed by the Government. There were no reports of
 political killings, disappearances, torture, or arbitrary
 arrest.

 CAPE VERDE
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1984 there were no reported instances of politically
 motivated deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1984 there were no reported instances of officially
 inspired disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Puhishment
 Although there is no evidence of torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment being used in any
 generalized manner, groups of Cape Verdean emigres from time
 to time allege that one or another of these activities takes
 place. Instances of beating during interrogation by security
 officers cannot be ruled out. Stories of torture or degrading
 treatment of those arrested in the 1981 demonstrations against
 agrarian reform (all of whom have been released) are still
 circulated by groups outside the country and, although these
 stories could not be confirmed, they may have had some
 validity. The Government denied them at the time but no
 longer reacts to the reiteration of old charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During 1984 there were no reported instances of people being
 detained, punished, or tried for the expression of views
 critical of or different from those of the Government. Habeas
 corpus exists in Cape Verde and appears to be observed for
 non-political offenses. Cape Verde law requires that those
 arrested be charged within 48 hours. In exceptional cases,
 and then with the concurrence of a procurator or judge, the
 formal charge process may be slightly delayed but must take
 place within five days. However, in cases of alleged crimes
 against state security, persons may be detained for up to five
 months without trial upon a judge's ruling. There is a
 functioning system of bail, and the right of access to a
 lawyer seems to be observed in practice. During 1984 there
 were no known political prisoners held in Cape Verde and no
 instances of forced exile for political or other reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Unless caught in the act, an accused must be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours of arrest to hear evidence from the
 prosecutor who would prefer charges. Counsel is supposed to
 be present for the accused who then may be held in custody,
 released on bail, or released unconditionally. Trials are
 conducted by one judge; a public prosecutor presents the case
 against an accused, who is defended by counsel. There is no
 jury system. Appeal is possible. Trials appear to be handled
 expeditiously. There is also a system of popular tribunals to
 adjudicate minor disputes on a neighborhood or local level in
 rural areas. The 'judges" are usually prominent local
 citizens without legal training, who are appointees of the
 
 
 61
 CAPE VERDE
 Ministry of Justice. Their decisions can be appealed within
 the regular court system.
 The judiciary does not have the authority to determine the
 constitutionality of legislation. Although, according to the
 Constitution, judges are independent, one former judge now
 living outside the country has claimed that one-party rule in
 practice has hampered the functioning of a truly independent
 judiciary. Most evidence suggests, however, that the courts
 protect individual rights in criminal cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the
 inviolability of domicile, correspondence, and other private
 means of communication. In the case of a domicile, the law
 requires search warrants issued by a judge. There were no
 known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence during 1984. The Constitution also
 contains the provision that every citizen has the right and
 the duty to participate in the political, economic, and
 cultural life of the country. This provision theoretically
 could be used to force participation in activities against an
 individual's will. However, in practice, there is no evidence
 to suggest it is being done.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and intellectual creativity, including the
 rights of authorship, are proclaimed in the Constitution. The
 Constitution also stipulates, however, that none of the rights
 and freedoms may be exercised 'contrary to national unity,"
 and it institutionalizes the party's political leadership.
 Moreover, freedom of the press is not a specific
 constitutional guarantee. The weekly newspaper and radio are
 government owned, and follow government policies. Although
 occasional articles critical of some aspects of government
 policy are printed or broadcast, this is probably done with
 prior authorization. International periodicals generally
 circulate freely in Cape Verde, even when they carry articles
 critical of or unflattering to the Government, as is
 frequently the case with Portuguese newspapers. International
 radio broadcasts are received clearly without interference.
 Censorship of movies is practiced, although it is not known if
 the criteria are political or primarily to protect public
 morals. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western
 agencies as well as from Communist countries, generally
 identifying sources on controversial international issues and
 balancing off, for example, Tass reports with others from
 Western sources. It is unlikely that establishment of print
 or other media enterprises not subject to government control
 would be permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate
 is guaranteed in the Constitution. However, as a practical
 matter, no organizations antithetical to government actions or
 policies would be permitted. Private associations other than
 sports clubs or religious youth groups do not exist and would
 
 
 62
 CAPE VERDE
 have to be authorized. Party-sponsored *mass organizations'
 of women and youth are prominent, however.
 Workers in several sectors are organized into unions within
 the national union structure which is affiliated to the sole
 political party and is headed by a high-ranking member of the
 party. Although the national union confederation claims to be
 independent of the party, the two are closely tied.
 Individual unions perform some traditional trade union
 functions and act also as party affiliates. The right to
 strike is guaranteed but is rarely used, even though union
 leadership has taken positions on specific issues opposed to
 government policies in state enterprises. The national union
 confederation participates in the International Labor
 Organization and is affiliated to the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity, but has not taken positions independent of
 those officially sanctioned by the Government. It maintains
 contact with and receives assistance from both Communist and
 non-Communist national unions abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution separates church and state. Freedom of
 worship is respected by the Government, and members of all
 faiths practice their religion without harassment. Two-thirds
 or more of the population, probably including most of the
 government leadership, are nominally Catholic but the
 dominance of Catholicism does not appear to affect adversely
 other faiths. Evangelical Protestants and Seventh-Day
 Adventists are the two other principal religious communities.
 There are no restrictions on religious practices, teaching, or
 contacts with coreligionists outside Cape Verde. A few
 foreign missionaries and foreign members of the clergy are
 active in Cape Verde.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative
 restrictions on either travel or residence within the
 country. However, all resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave
 the country, either temporarily or permanently, must obtain
 exit permission from the Government. Such permission has not
 been denied for political reasons. Emigration has long been
 an important and recognized escape valve from prevailing harsh
 economic conditions. Repatriation is a constitutional right
 of the citizen, and the Government does not discourage
 intending repatriates.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several
 grounds, including activities contrary to the interest of the
 country. However, there are no known cases of the Government
 instituting proceedings to deprive persons of citizenship for
 political reasons. There are at most only a handful of
 foreign refugees in Cape Verde.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The party's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is inscribed in
 the Constitution. Opposition parties do not exist and are not
 permitted. The small group of men who actually led the
 struggle for independence occupy positions of leadership in
 both the party and the Government. The Secretary General of
 
 
 63
 CAPE VERDE
 the party is President of the Republic; the Deputy Secretary
 General is Prime Minister; and the third-ranking party
 official is President of the National Assembly. Altogether,
 eight of nine members of the party's political commission are
 also ministers; the other manages day-to-day activities of the
 party. Not all ministers or secretaries of state are party
 members; however, all clearly serve at the pleasure of the
 party. At the time of the party's second and most recent
 congress in 1983, there were 5,860 members, probably
 representing about five percent of the total adult
 population. This represented a doubling of party membership
 since independence in 1975. Women, at 14 percent of the total
 party membership, are underrepresented. The party is also
 young (47 percent under 30 years of age), disproportionately
 urban (50 percent in a nation which is more than two-thirds
 rural) and heavily representative of the bureaucracy (25
 percent of party members are civil servants or employees of
 state enterprises). Within the elitist party, there exists a
 modest scope for meaningful political activity. The delegates
 to the second party congress and the leadership itself were
 elected by secret ballot with some unexpected changes in the
 order of precedence for various ministers. There was also an
 evident opening at the top level of the party to give
 individuals possessing less solid revolutionary credentials
 more prominent roles; 15 of 42 members and alternates,
 including three women, were elected to the national council
 for the first time.
 The Popular National Assembly, last elected for a five-year
 term in 1980 from a party-approved list of candidates, is
 designated as the supreme organ of the Government. In fact,
 most day-to-day decisions are delegated to the Council of
 Ministers. The Assembly meets twice yearly in sessions at
 which earlier party/government decisions appear to be
 ratified. Although issues are debated openly with critical
 interventions reported in the media, earlier policy decisions
 made by the Council of Ministers are not reversed. Deputies
 who believe the interests of their constituencies are harmed
 by government policies or decisions feel free to criticize
 these policies or decisions and do so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government in the past has permitted visits by private
 organizations to check on conditions of persons convicted for
 political or related offenses. There are no known instances
 in which the Government has been the subject of resolutions,
 investigations, or other human rights actions by official
 international organizations A few Cape Verdean emigrants
 living abroad have consistently made charges of human rights
 violations. These charges may have affected internal
 policies, given the Government's major effort to maintain
 close relations with the large communities of Cape Verdean
 emigrants around the world. There are no known internal
 official or non-governmental human rights organizations in the
 country. Amnesty International in its 1984 Report noted that
 the Government had released 18 persons convicted in 1982 for
 offenses against the security of the state, and repeated its
 charge that there had been insufficient evidence at their
 trial to prove their guilt. Freedom House terms Cape Verde
 "not free."

 CAPE VERDE
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government gives a high priority to the prevention of
 famine, which has been averted since independence through food
 aid provided primarily by Western countries. Up to 20
 percent of donated emergency food is distributed free to the
 old, infirm, or others unable to work. The remainder is sold
 under the terms of agreement with the donor and the proceeds
 used in development projects. The Government also has given
 priority to emergency development programs, financed primarily
 by foreign grants, to provide jobs for agricultural workers
 displaced by drought. Water and soil conservation programs
 and road and school construction are emphasized. Primary
 school attendance (age 7 to 12) has increased 300 percent
 since independence and is now available to about 80 percent of
 this group. Nonetheless, school conditions continue to be
 characterized by overcrowded classrooms and a paucity of
 trained teachers.
 Over the past 150 years recurrent droughts and high
 unemployment (currently about 33 percent) have led to massive
 emigration, resulting in a large Cape Verdean overseas
 population estimated at about 500,000, of whom some 300,000
 live in the United States. Emigrant remittances and official
 aid account for two-thirds of the country's gross national
 product (GNP). (U.S. food and development aid since
 independence exceeds $56 million.) Per capita GNP is
 estimated at about $350. The population of Cape Verde is
 about 310,000 and growing at a rate of 2 percent a year. With
 an infant mortality rate estimated at 76 per 1,000 live births
 and an overall death rate in 1980 of 8 per thousand, life
 expectancy at birth is 62 years. The adult literacy rate is
 37 percent.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde, where
 the vast majority of the population shares various proportions
 of Portuguese-African ancestry. Sex discrimination exists
 sociologically, although banned by the Constitution. Many of
 the traditional, male-oriented values of the Portuguese and
 African ancestors of today's Cape Verdeans are still part of
 the country's culture. Women have been customarily excluded
 from certain types of work and are often paid less than men
 for comparable work. The Government has included women in the
 labor-intensive economic development projects financed by
 foreign grants. Both the Government and the party are making
 efforts to bring women into various economic and social
 activities where they have been traditionally absent. The
 Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with
 party encouragement, to sensitize the Government and Cape
 Verdeans on issues affecting women. The code of the family,
 enacted in October 1981, prescribes full legal equality of men
 and women, including equal pay for equal work.
