 Guyana is a small, multiracial, developing nation. It is the
 only English-speaking country in South America and is
 considered, culturally and politically, to be a part of the
 Caribbean. The Co-operative Republic of Guyana has an
 Executive President, Hugh Desmond Hoyte, who was elected in
 December 1985, as well as a unicameral parliament and an
 independent judiciary. A variety of political parties compete
 for power, the major ones being the ruling Peoples National
 Congress (PNC), the Peoples Progressive Party (PPP), the
 United Force (UF), and the Working Peoples Alliance (WPA).
 Under the 1980 Constitution, presidential, parliamentary, and
 regional elections are to be held every 5 years. Municipal
 elections were scheduled for December 1986, the first time
 since 1970; however, the opposition boycotted the elections,
 alleging that they would not be fair since the ruling party
 controlled the electoral machinery. The unopposed candidates,
 including some political independents nominated by the ruling
 party, were declared elected, but no voting actually took
 place.
 Since 1964, the PNC has dominated political life in Guyana
 through questionable electoral practices. Opposition parties
 and some civic organizations regularly charge fraud. The
 December 1985 elections were no exception, although it is
 widely believed that the PNC, with its well-established
 organization, entrenched incumbency, and divided opposition
 would have been victorious if other parties had made a
 contest. Two international monitoring organizations published
 findings which supported allegations of fraud. No
 international observers were allowed to monitor the 1985
 elections, although the international press covered them.
 Although Guyanese society and political life are influenced by
 strong differences between the Afro-Guyanese and
 Indo-Guyanese, peaceful racial coexistence prevailed in 1986.
 The ruling PNC draws its membership primarily from urban
 Afro-Guyanese. Nevertheless, the Government and the public
 sector include a significant proportion of Indo-Guyanese,
 Muslims, Hindus, and Christians. The police, the Guyana
 Defence Force (GDF), and other seclurity forces are.
 predominantly staffed by Afro-Guyanese, while Indo-Guyanese
 continue to dominate the agricultural and business sectors.
 In 1986 Guyana's human rights climate continued to show
 improvement. Persons are free to pursue private interests,
 and rights to private property are generally respected.
 Social services, while limited in quality, are open to all
 citizens on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. The
 Government recognized the right of opposition newspapers to
 import newsprint and printing presses, and an independent,
 privately owned weekly began publication in December.
 Allegations of police killings and beatings were more
 frequently investigated, although with mixed results. The
 House of Israel, alleged to have been responsible for some
 past political violence, was effectively silenced.
 The Government showed a surprising degree of intolerance of
 political criticism by expelling a Catholic priest and by
 attacking an Anglican bishop in the state-owned media for
 criticizing the conduct of the 1985 general elections. The
 Catholic Church has received some mixed signals: restrictions
 and delays were imposed on its foreign missionaries desiring
 to renew their resident visas, while permission was granted
 
 
 525
 GUYANA
 for a new group, Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity, to
 enter the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known politically motivated killings in Guyana.
 In October, David Hill, known as Rabbi Washington and leader
 of a sect called the House of Israel, together with three of
 his followers, were arrested for murder, convicted of
 manslaughter, and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In recent
 years, it has been widely alleged that the PNC utilized House
 of Israel members to commit acts of physical intimidation and
 even murder against government opponents.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, but there were
 allegations of torture by police. The 1985-86 Guyana Human
 Rights Association (GHRA) Report alleged six specific
 incidents of excessive use of force by police resulting in the
 death of individuals. GHRA also alleged that six prisoners
 were severely beaten by law enforcement authorities. In
 contrast to previous years, both the police and the courts
 investigated these allegations. GHRA, however, said the
 investigations, both by internal police boards of inquiry and
 before the courts, were inadequate. GHRA also charged that
 when inquests were held and a verdict of criminal
 responsibility made, no further action was taken. The police
 rejected the GHRA allegations but made no specific comments on
 the cases in question. In May the press reported the brutal
 torture of an Amerindian. Internal police investigations
 concluded that the three policemen involved had exceeded their
 authority and used unnecessarily excessive force. No decision
 has yet been made whether to bring charges against them. This
 particular case has been debated in the National Assembly. A
 jury acquitted a police corporal in a 1984 shooting death of a
 prisoner.
 Prison conditions in Guyana are spartan. Prisoners' diets are
 considered inadequate, and overcrowding is a problem. In
 August the Government announced the allocation of the
 equivalent of US$325,580 for renovation of the Central
 Georgetown prison. So far, no work has begun.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, no person may be deprived of personal
 liberty except as authorized by law. Individuals are not
 arrested, detained, or exiled for their political views. To
 date, no one has been officially detained under the National
 Security Act, which provides that persons suspected of crimes
 may be held up to 3 months without charge. In the past,
 government officials have sought to use the legal system for
 
 
 526
 GUYA
 political purposes through libel suits against their
 opponents.
 Forced labor is not employed in Guyana. However, the law does
 permit the use of prisoners convicted of criminal acts in work
 crews under appropriate supervision. President Hoyte has
 terminated the policy of voluntary labor by civil servants for
 Hope Estate, a state-owned coconut plantation of the late
 President Forbes Burnham.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guyana maintains the British common law system and legal
 procedures. Half the lawyers and almost all members of the
 Guyanese judiciary were trained in the United Kingdom. The
 Constitution protects the right of anyone charged with a
 criminal offense to a hearing by a court of law, a right that
 is respected. Guyana has a functioning bail system and
 defendants are accorded fair public trials; they are
 represented by counsel, who are court appointed when
 necessary. Timely charges are presented, and appeals can be
 made to higher courts. There are no political prisoners or
 special courts for political security cases.
 Some opposition lawyers complain that the.judiciary is prone
 to grant an excessive number of lengthy postponements in
 trials affecting government or law enforcement officials;
 however, postponements are routinely granted to both the
 defense and prosecution. Delays in judicial proceedings
 reportedly are more often caused by shortages of trained
 personnel and materials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the right to privacy of
 citizens. There have been allegations of government
 surveillance of some political opponents.
 It is widely believed that correspondence from overseas is
 opened. This occurs primarily for the theft of money
 forwarded by overseas Guyanese to relatives and does not
 appear to be the result of government policy. GHRA reported
 that body searches of incoming passengers at Timehri Airport
 have diminished, but the practice does continue. A prominent
 labor leader was recently subjected to a body search prior to
 leaving Guyana.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 However, the Government has direct and indirect control over
 the media through ownership of the country's only daily
 newspaper and only radio station and through import licensing
 of newsprint and printing presses used by other publications.
 Despite their small size, opposition weeklies engage in
 uninhibited criticism of the Government. Government opponents
 allege that the limited quantity of newsprint and the small
 size of these publications is tantamount to censorship. GHRA,
 among others, reports considerable improvement in this area,
 with the approval of import licenses for printing presses for
 the weekly Catholic Standard, the Mirror of the PPP, and the
 WPA's news sheets. President Hoyte has recognized the right
 
 
 527
 GUYANA
 of the opposition press to receive gifts of newsprint from
 overseas and to establish a new weekly newspaper. A new
 independent weekly appeared in December; it is published in
 Trinidad and flown to Guyana.
 Guayanese can receive printed materials from abroad without
 restrictions, but scarce foreign exchange generally is not
 made available by the Government for subscriptions to foreign
 publications. The Caribbean Contact, a monthly regional
 newspaper.published in Barbados that is consistently critical
 of the Guyanese Government, is freely available and sold
 locally for Guyanese currency. Newsweek is the only
 international news magazine still sold for local currency.
 While Guyana does not have an official public television
 station, satellite television transmission from the United
 States is rebroadcast by two local businessmen. They also
 carry regular broadcasts of Cable Network News. Foreign and
 regional radio stations can be heard on mediumwave and
 shortwave.
 The country's only radio station, Guyana Broadcasting
 Corporation (GBC), is highly selective in reporting the views
 and activities of opposition parties, although it reported on
 them more frequently in 1986 than in the past. Some of GBC's
 radio interview and commentary programs allow public criticism
 of the Government, but in general they faithfully reflect
 government policies. The Government still carefully controls
 information on its activities and operations.
 The Government's record on academic freedom is good. Several
 opposition activists in the WPA and GHRA teach at the
 University of Guyana. Opposition parties have organized
 student groups there.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees this freedom, and in general it is
 observed. However, under the Public Order Act, police permits
 are required for open political meetings. At his discretion,
 the police commissioner can refuse permission for a meeting
 without explanation.- In the past, opposition political
 parties have complained of delays in receiving permission from
 the police. GHRA cited five incidents where permits were
 denied or delayed.
 Workers in Guyana are free to join unions and to strike.
 Every year the government-owned sugar industry is hit by a
 number of wildcat strikes; 1986 was no exception. The
 Government has the authority to declare any strike "political
 or illegal" but has not done so since the late 1970's.
 The Guyana Trade Union Congress (TUC) is the sole national
 labor union federation; its 70,000 members and 24 affiliates
 constitute the entire unionized work force. TUC is
 responsible for centralized collective bargaining as the
 result of the controversial 1984 Labor Amendment Act, which
 gave the TUC, rather than individual labor unions, the right
 to bargain on behalf of workers. In March a court ruling on
 the constitutionality of the 1984 Labor Act struck down two
 provisions which designated the TUC as the sole bargaining
 agent for public sector workers and authorized the President
 to freeze and to set public sector wages. The Government won
 a stay of the decision pending appeal. TUC presents
 grievances to the Government and also referees interunion
 representation disputes. TUC also operates a labor college
 
 
 528
 GUYANA
 and participates in international labor forums through its
 affiliation with the Caribbean Congress of Labour and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Over half
 the TUC unions are either linked to or support the ruling
 PNC. Seven unions, including the two largest, are associated
 with the PPP, the WPA, or are politically independent.
 Until September 1984, progovernment unions, which continue to
 have disproportionate voting power in electing the TUC
 executive board, dominated the TUC. At the 1984 annual TUC
 conference, dissident unions narrowly won control of the
 executive board, but the PNC regained strong representation in
 the September 1986 TUC election. Legal actions brought
 against unions which are in opposition to the Government
 appear designed to frustrate union activity.
 Like the unions, trade associations, private organizations,
 and other professional bodies freely maintain relations with
 recognized international groups in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of thought and religion,
 and there is complete religious tolerance in Guyana.
 Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and Baha'is are free to practice
 their religions without restriction. There is no favored or
 official state religion. In the past, foreign missionaries
 were permitted to enter the country to proselytize. In
 January 1986, Guyana expelled a British Jesuit priest, a
 long-time resident, apparently as part of a crackdown on
 foreign religious leaders and clergy who question the political
 system in Guyana. A Barbadian bishop who sought to incestigate
 the priest's expulsion was denied entry into the country.
 Other foreign Catholic priests seeking to renew their resident
 visas encountered bureaucratic delays and were only able to
 obtain limited extensions. Following the 1985 elections, the
 government-owned newspaper published personal attacks on Roman
 Catholic and Anglican bishops for accusing the PNC of election
 fraud and interference with the right of citizens to vote.
 The homes of Anglican and other Christian church leaders who
 had questioned the fairness of the elections were searched.
 Newspapers in the Caribbean, North America, and Europe
 published articles-alleging repression of churches in Guyana.
 According to the GHRA, the commissioner of police subsequently
 wrote letters of apology, stating that the searches were
 unauthorized.
 Despite the allegations of harassment of churches and clergy,
 in September the Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity,
 founded by Mother Teresa of Calcutta, were received by Prime
 Minister Hamilton Green and given permission to work in
 Guyana. In November President Hoyte attended the Triennial
 Anglican Synod held in Georgetown and hosted a reception in
 the bishops' honor.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and is permitted. However, since colonial times,
 travel to certain Amerindian areas requires government
 permission. Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to emigrate,
 and to return to Guyana. Occasionally, opposition politicians
 have been stopped and searched at the international airport,
 but GHRA reported that in 1986 the number of these searches
 
 
 529
 GUYANA
 diminished. According to the United Nations definition of
 "refugee," Guyana is neither a refugee receiving nor
 generating country. There are no displaced persons, and
 citizenship is-not denied on political grounds.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guayanese freely express their political views and are free to
 join or support a variety of political parties. While these
 parties are able to voice their views through the publication
 of party newspapers, they do not have significant access to
 the government-owned media. In 1986 opposition parties
 complained that they continue to experience difficulties in
 obtaining police permission to hold political rallies. For
 over 20 years, former President Burnham, with the assistance
 of the PNC party machine, completely dominated Guyana's
 political, economic, and social life. On August 6, 1985, he
 died and was succeeded by then Prime Minister Hoyte. In
 December 1985, running as the PNC candidate, Prime Minister
 Hoyte was elected President in his own right.
 After the 1985 elections, opposition leaders including the
 Communist PPP leader Cheddi Jagan joined forces to form the
 Patriotic Coalition for Democracy (PCD). The PCD together
 with the GHRA claimed the election was marred by ballot box
 stuffing'and harassment of opposition poll watchers. GHRA
 charged in its 1986 report that the counting of votes was
 generally in the hands of the ruling PNC party. In contrast
 to the 1980 elections, all opposition members accepted their
 seats in the unicameral National Assembly.
 Under President Hoyte, there have been several indications
 that a movement toward political reform and representation is
 in progress, The President has banned overseas proxy and
 postal voting, and preliminary voters' lists were provided to
 all political parties. In October he announced that municipal
 elections would be held in December. Subsequently the
 opposition decided to boycott the elections. All 91 of the
 PNC-nominated candidates, among whom were some political
 independents, were declared elected by default.
 Constitutionally, all citizens 18 years of age or older are
 eligible to participate in the political process and to vote.
 Women have equal legal status. Opposition parties vigorously
 criticize the Government.
 President Hoyte has appointed a number of Indo-Guyanese to
 ministerial and other government positions. Nevertheless race
 is still a factor in political life in Guyana, and parties are
 still basically organized along racial and ethnic lines, a
 situation that predates independence. Although President Hoyte
 is opening up the ruling PNC to other national groups, the
 party remains predominantly Afro-Guyanese. The largest
 opposition party, the PPP, is almost exclusively
 Indo-Guyanese. The WPA, which won its first parliamentary
 seat in 1985, has a multiracial collegial leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government regards outside criticism of its human rights
 practices as interference in internal affairs. In 1986 the
 government-owned media continued to pay increased attention to
 
 
 530
 GUYANA
 human rights matters, reporting more frequently on cases of
 police abuses and subsequent investigations.
 GHRA is a nongovernmental organization formed in 1979 with
 support from trade unions, professional organizations, and
 churches. GHRA issues periodic press releases and publishes
 an annual report on human rights in Guyana. It gathers
 information from members, victims of abuse, trade unionists,
 churchmen, other interested parties, official documents, and
 newspapers. The association seeks to pressure the government
 to recognize human rights concerns and implement adequate
 structural reforms. It has been hampered in its campaign by
 not being able to document and detail its findings.
 The Government strongly denounced GHRA's 1985-86 report which
 contained accusations of police brutality, excessive use of
 force, and discrimination against Amerindians. The
 Government's response to GHRA took the form of vehement
 denunciations of unspecified religious leaders. Anglican
 Bishop Randolph George, a copresident of GHRA, was subjected
 to repeated personal criticisms in the government-owned Guyana
 Chronicle. While denying GHRA's charges, however, the
 Government made no specific response to any of its allegations
 of wrongdoing.
 Although the Government rejects outside criticism of its human
 rights practices, it has frequently criticized violations in
 South Africa and Namibia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits racial discrimination and
 discrimination against women. Although women are found in
 limited numbers in all positions of employment, they continue
 to occupy traditional roles as homemakers.
 There is no pattern of discrimination in housing, employment,
 education, or other social services. Education and medical
 care in the Georgetown hospital are free, although the quality
 of the services is poor. Guyana has a minority population of
 ethnic Amerindians, composed of nine tribal groups, living in
 scattered reservations throughout the interior of the
 country. Relative to most Guyanese, their standard of living
 is low.
 The GHRA claims that Amerindian human rights are constrained
 through government control of their leaders, land titles, and
 access to their reservations by priests and other outsiders.
 However, due to the general poverty of the nation, the
 Amerindians seem to suffer more from neglect than any policy
 of active discrimination.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legislative basis for regulation of conditions of labor is
 the Factories Act of 1947, enacted when Guyana was a British
 colony. By government policy but not by legislation, no one
 under 13 years of age can be employed outside the family.
 According to the Factories Act, no one under 14 can be
 employed in any factory (except for a family-owned operation
 that employs only family members) and no one from 14 to 17 can
 be employed to work between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
 The Ministry of Manpower has in practice so extended the law's
 original definition of "factory" that nearly all workplaces,
 
 
 531
 GUYANA
 except for offices and rental shops, are now considered to be
 "factories." The Factories Act also provides the basis. for
 government regulation of occupational safety and health
 standards. The 8-hour day is the norm. Office workers have a
 40-hour workweek; factory and field workers have a 44-hour
 workweek. Workers are paid either by time or by task.
 The Ministry of Manpower's enforcement of standards--whether
 legislative or government policy--in the workplace is severely
 limited by shortage of funds and shortage of qualified and
 appropriately experienced personnel at all but the senior
 levels.
