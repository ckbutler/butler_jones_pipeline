 EGYPT
 According to its constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. The President, Hosni Mubarak, was reelected unopposed to a third
 6-year term by the People's Assembly in 1993. The President appoints the Cabinet,
 which is responsible to him. His party, the National Democratic Party (NDP), has
 governed since its establishment in 1978. It commands large majorities in the popu-
 larly elected People's Assembly and the partially elected Shura (Consultative) Coun-
 cil. Eleions for the People's Assembly were held in November. The Government re-
 ported that 50 percent of registered voters turned out to vote for over 4,000 can-
 didates vying for 444 seats. The NDP won 71 percent of the seats, independents 25
 percent, and opposition parties 2.9 percent.
 There are several security services in the Ministry of Interior, two of which are
 primarily involved in combating terrorism: the State Security Investigations Sector
 (SSIS), which conducts investigations and interrogates detainees; and the Central
 Security Force (CSF), which enforces curfews and bans on public demonstrations,
 and conducts paramilitary operations against terrorists. Some members of the secu'
 rit.y forces committed serious human rights abuses. Terrorists committed numerous
 serious human rights abuses.
 Egypt is slowly moving from a command economy to a free market system. Manu-
 facturing is still dominated by the public sector while agriculture, the single largest
 employer, is almost entirely in private hands. Remittances from approximately 2
 million Egyptians working abroad are the largest source of foreign currency earn-
 ings, followed by petroleum and tourism. In the past 5 years, the Government has
 enacted significant economic reforms, which have reduced the budget deficit, sta-
 bilized the exchange rate, reduced inflation and interest rates, and built up substan-
 tial reserves.
 The Government generally respects many human rights, but others are restricted
 by the continuing imposition of the emergency law. The ruling NDP dominates the
 political scene to such an extent that the people do not have a meaningful ability
 to change their government.

 The security forces and terrorist groups remained locked in a cycle of violence. In
 fighting the terrorists, the security forces mistreated and tortured prisoners, held
 detainees in prolonged pretrial detention, and allegedly committed extrajudicial
 killings. They occasionaly undertook mass arrests. Aside from the antiterrorist
 campaign, the local plice have abused common criminal suspects. The Government
 prosecuted police o icers accused of abusing detainees, but did not pursue most
 cases or seek adequate punishments. Prison conditions are poor.
 The use of military courts to try civilians continues to infringe on a defendant's
 right to a fair trial before an independent judiciary. For the first time since the mid-
 1960's, the Government tried members of the Muslim Brotherhood in military courts
 on charges of illegal political activities. These trials expanded the jurisdiction of the
 military courts beyond terrorism-related offenses. Although citizens generally ex-
 press themselves freely, the Government continues to restrict freedom of the press.
 State security officers detained journalists for publishing articles critical of the Gov-
 ernment, as well as several lawyers of acusedl terrorists for allegedly engaging in
 illegal activities. In many of these cases the detention appeared to be a form of gov-
 ernment harassment.
 The Government restricts freedom of assembly and association, and does not le-
 gally reconie local human rights groups. However, these groups are allowed to op-
 erate openly.
 Women and Christians face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects
 of the law. Violence against women and children is a problem. Female genital muti-
 lation continues to be widespread, despite government efforts to educate the public
 against it. The Government does not prohibit the mutilation, but has implemented
 new restrictions to curb its practice.
 Terrorist groups, seeking to overthrow the Government and establish an Islamic
 state, continued their attacks on police, Coptic Christians, and tourists. In June
 Egyptian terrorists attempted to sassinate President Mubarak in Ethiopia. Ter-
 rrists were responsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Kihling.-There were no reports of political
 killings. There were several credible reports, however, that security forces were in-
 vlved in what amounted to extrajudicial killings, because they allegedly were is-
 sued shoot-to.kill orders in certain antiterrorist operations.
 According to the Government, 71   risoners died in custody in 1995, compared to
 82 such deaths in 1994 and 97 deaths in 1993. Thirteen of the deaths occurred at
 the New Valley Prison which began receiving prisoners in February. The prison is
 located in a remote desert area and houses suspected and convicted terrorists. Au-
 thorities stated that the 13 inmates died of natural causes or as the result of hunger
 striies. Human rights groups, family members, and defense lawyers alleged that at
 least some of the deaths were the result of torture and denial of food, water, and
 medical treatment. As evidence, they pointed to the prisoners' accounts of torture
 and the failure of prison authorities to provide a report on the cause of death. Au-
 thoritie reportedly denied family members permission to view the bodies of their
 relatives. While denying charges of intentional mistreatment ofprisoners, the Gov-
 ernment stated that during a surpris inspection of the New Valley Prison in June,
 inspectors found that the medical facilities were deficient and ordered them brought
 up to standard.
 Other deaths in custody occurred in Istikbal Torah Prison and Abu Zaabal Prison.
 Government investigations concluded that the prisoners in those cases died of natu-
 ral causes.
 In the case of Islamist lawyer Abdel Harith Madani, who died in police custody
 in April 1994, the Government stated that it had completed the investigation into
 his death but declined to publicize the results.
 In antitermrist operations, the security forces killed approximately 181 suspected
 terrorists, some of them by the excessive use of lethal force. Three civilian bystand-
 ers were killed inadvertently by security forces. Five suspects died while attempting
 to escape arrest. Civilians killed two suspected terrorists, as well as six relatives
 of suspected extremists in apparent vendettas.
 Terrorist groups were responsible for the majority of the deaths in civil unrest.
 They killed approximately 200 people, compared to 141 in 1994. This total included
 approximately 107 police and security officers, as well as 89 civilians. Terrorists ap-
 peared to have increased their attacks on Christians, killing at least 30, including
 6 in Minya Governorate in September. They also attacked churches and other prop-
 erties owned by Christians.   June Egyptian terrorists attempted to assassinate
 
 
 1140
 President Mubarak while he was on a visit to Ethiopia. The President was unhurt
 in the attack, but his bodyguards and Ethiopian security forces returned fire killing
 several assailants.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Of the 11 individuals that local human rights groups claimed had disappeared in
 1994, 6 have since been located in detention facilities, but 5 remain missing. The
 Government has not responded to queries from human rights monitors regarding
 the 5 outstanding cases.
 There were no developments in the case of Mansur Kikhya, a former Libyan for-
 eign minister under Colonel Al-Qadhall and a prominent exiled dissident, who dis-
 appeared in Cairo in 1993. Observers believe that Libyan agents abducted Kikhya.
 His whereabouts are unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the infliction of "physical or moral harm" upon persons
 who have been arrested or detained. However, there is convincing evidence that
 some police and security officers, as well as prison guards, routinely abuse and tor-
 ture detainees.
 Under the Penal Code, torture with the intent of obtaining a confession is punish-
 able by 3 to 5 years imprisonment or hard labor, or execution if the torture results
 in the death of the victim. The mistreatment of a detainee falling short of torture
 is punishable by 1 year's imprisonment or a fine of $65. In addition, victims may
 bring a criminal or civil action for compensation against the responsible government
 agency. There is no statute of limitations in such cases.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there were numerous credible reports of mistreat-
 ment and torture. Police officials said that in some districts confessions in criminal
 cases were coerced because the courts rely heavily on confessions and eyewitness ac-
 counts.
 While the Government has investigated torture complaints in criminal cases and
 punished some offending officers, the punishments are not necessarily in line with
 the seriousness of the offense. In May the Minister of Interior stated that authori-
 ties investigated over 150 officers in the previous year on charges of torture and
 harsh treatment of citizens. Of those who were convicted some were sentenced to
 prison, while others received administrative punishments. he Government has said
 that it will not disclose further details of individual cases of police abuse for fear
 of harming the morale of law enforcement officers waging the ongoing war against
 terrorists.
 Officers of the SSIS allegedly are responsible for most of the torture of suspected
 terrorists. Torture has reportedly taken place in police stations; SSIS offices, includ-
 ing its headquarters in Cairo; and at Central Security Force camps. Torture is used
 to extract information, coerce the victims to end their antigovernment activities, and
 deter others from such activities. Torture victims usually are taken to a SSIS office
 where they are handcuffed, blindfolded, and questioned about their associations, re-
 ligious beliefs, and political views.
 Written records of detainees' whereabouts are not kept while in the custody of the
 state security police. The absence of such a record in the early days of detention
 invites abuse and effectively blocks the investigation of torture complaints. Records
 are maintained only after security forces deliver the detainee to a prison. The secu-
 rity forces also transfer detainees fromprisons to other facilities where they are in-
 te rrogated, tortured, and then returnedto prison. No written records are kept on
 such transfers.
 Victims have reported the following torture methods: detainees are frequently
 strippedto their feet touching the floor
 or fodto stand for prolonged periods; doused with hot and cold water, beaten;
 forced to stand outdoors in cold weather, and subjected to electric shocks. Some vic-
 tims, including female detainees, report that they have been threatened with rape.
 In late 1994, public prosecutors charged a policeman with torture, unlawful deten-
 tion, illegal entry, and excessive use of force in the case of Fateh Al-Bab Abdel
 Moneim who died in police custody in 1994. At year's end, the case was pending
 before the South Cairo Criminal Court.
 In early 1995, a local human rights group reported that Gamal El-Shazly had
 been tortured on Deember 27, 1994, in a police station in Manshayit Nasser, a
 small town in southern Egypt. A representative from the bup reportediy examined
 El-Shazly and found burns on his head and back. He notified the public prosecutor's
 office, which began an investigation.
 Information came to light during the year that in 1994 Saber Ahmed Mahmoud
 was beaten to death by four policemen. The Government later indicted the police-
 men, who were convicted, sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment, and ordered to
 make a small compensation payment to the victim's heirs. In their appeal, the de-
 
 
 1141
 
 fendants argued that the victim died from a preexisting medical condition. The pros-
 ecutor dropped homicide charges and recharged the defendants with excessive use
 of force. The court confirmed the convictions on the lesser charge and upheld the
 6-month prison sentences.
 In April a court sentenced one police officer to 1 year in prison, two officers to
 3 month, and acquitted two others in the 1994 death of Sayyed Hassan Fetouh
 Eleiwa. In November a court sentenced two police officers to 5 years at hard labor
 for the 1994 death of Hassan Salah Sayyed.
 State prosecutors ruled the 1994 death in custody of Eissa Taher Soliman a sui-
 cide and at year's end were still reviewing the 1994 death in custody of Amre
 Mohamed Safwat. There were no new developments in the case of Mohammed Abdel
 Hanid Hassan, who reportedly died in police custody in 1994. State prosecutors also
 closed the books on the following deaths in custody on grounds that the perpetrators
 could not be identified. Mohamed Abdel Haid Hassan, Effat Mohamed Ali Wali,
 EI-Mohammadi Mohamed Mohamed Mursi, and Mohamed Gomaa Abdel Sayyed El-
 Sudani.
 The completion of five new prisons has helped relieve pressure on the congested
 prison system. Nevertheless, overcrowding and unhealthy prison conditions are com-
 mon. Prisoners have claimed that their cells are poorly ventilated, food is inad-
 equate in quantity and nutritional value, and medical services were not always
 available. There were at least 71 reported deaths of persons in police custody (see
 Section L.a.).
 Prisoners at two high security prisons, the New Valley Prison and Torah Prison,
 reported receiving a form of physical and psychological abuse upon their arrival at
 pson known as a "reception party.' Under the supervision of a prison official and
 2r, guards reportedly beat new arrivals for 30 minutes with fists and heavy
 ,lastic sticks. The inmates are then forced to crawl to their cells on their hands and
 nees. Other prisoners allege that they have been stripped to their underwear,
 forced to stand for prolonged periods in cold water, burnt with cigarettes, and sub-
 jected to electric shocks. Some claim that they have been threatened with rape or
 the rape of their relatives.
 The Ministry of Interior continued to ban visits by relatives and lawyers at Al-
 Aqrab Prison and Torah Istiqbal Prison, despite court orders annulling the bans.
 The bans have been in effect since December 1993 and September 1994, respec-
 tively. The Ministry justifies the bans as necessary to prevent cooperation between
 prisoners and terrorists still at large.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-As part of the Government's antiterrorist
 campaign, security forces conducted mass arrests and detained thousands of individ-
 uals without charge. These arrests were authorized under the provisions of the
 Emergency Law, which has been in effect since 1981. Under this law, the police mapy
 obtain an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Interior upon showing that an indh-
 vidual poses a danger to security and public order. This procedure nullifies the con-
 stitutional requirement of obtaining a warrant from a judge or prosecutor upon
 showing that an individual has likely committed a specific crime.
 The Emergency Law allows authorities to detain an individual without charge.
 After 30 days, a detainee has the right to demand a court hearing to challenge the
 legality of the detention order, and may resubmit his motion for a hearing at 1-
 month intervals thereafter. There is no maximum limit to the length of detention
 if the judge continues to uphold the legality of the detention order, or if the detainee
 fails to exercise his right to a hearing.
 Acting under the Emergency Law, security forces detained thousands of individ-
 uals suspected of having information about illegal organizations. In most cases, the
 individuals were released after several days, but in other instances, they were not
 released until after extended periods in detention.
 In January security forces conducted a large operation in the southern province
 of Minya, detaining over 3,000 young men on suspicion of having ties with the Is-
 lamic Group, a terrorist organization, or for failingto provide information about the
 Group. Almost all of the detainees were releasediy March without charges having
 been brought against them.
 From October 1994 to early 1995, the Government maintained a dusk-to-dawn
 curfew on Mallawi and several surrounding villages in Minya province. The Govern-
 ment stated that the curfew was necessary to maintain order and protect citizens
 from attacks by extremists.
 Human rights groups reported that nearly 200 persons detained under the Emer-
 gency Law have been incarcerated for several years without charge. The courts have
 ordered the release of several of these detainees, but prison officials have reportedly
 ignored the orders. Frequently, the Ministry of Interior reissues detention orders,
 sending detainees back to prison.
 
 
 /      1142
 From January through September, security forces detained over 300 members of
 the Muslim Brotherhood on suspicion of engaging in illegal political activities. The
 Brotherhood is an outlawed Islamist organization. The Political Parties Law of 1977
 prohibits the establishment of political- parties based on religion. The Government
 referred 82 of these Muslim Brotherhood detainees to trial in a military court on
 charges of membership in an illegal organization, maintaining links to terrorists,
 and plotting to overthrow the Government (see Section i.e.). Several other detainees
 were released, but the remainder are still being held for investigation.
 In addition to the Emergency Law, the Penal Code also gives the State wide de-
 tention powers. Under the Penal Code prosecutors must bring charges within 48
 hours or release the suspect. However, they may detain a suspect for a maximum
 of 6 months, pending investigation. Arrests under the Penal Code occur openly and
 with warrants issued by a district prosecutor or judge. There is a system of bail.
 The Penal Code contains several provisions to combat extremist violence. These pro-
 visions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreading panic! and 'ob-
 structing the work of authorities."
 In January the Government released Adel Hussein, Secretary General of the So-
 cialist Labor Party, who was detained for questioning in December 1994 concerning
 extremist publications allegedly found in his possession upon his return from a trip
 abroad. No charges were filed.
 In February the widow of Abdel Harith Al-Madani a lawyer who died in custody
 under suspicious circumstances in 1994, was detained for 1 or 2 days. The detention
 came after an international human rights group published a report in which she al-
 leged that the Government had harassed her and her family after the death of her
 husband. After her release, Mrs. A1-Madani declined to make further public com-
 ments on her husband's death. Government-controlled newspapers reported subse-
 quently that she had denounced the human rights report and had denied that she
 had been detained.
 Official sources report the total prison population at approximately 33,000. Of
 these, 150 are convicted terrorists; 2,500 to 4,000 are suspected terrorists either
 charged and awaiting trial, or not charged and awaiting the results of investiga-
 tions. By contrast, a local human rights group estimates that approximately 15,000
 suspected terrorists are in detention. This estimate does do not include the undeter-
 mined number of detainees who have not been officially registered in the prison sys-
 tem (see Section 1..).
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is independent and generally is
 credited with conducting fair trials. However, under the Emergency Law, cases in-
 volving terrorism and national security may be tried in military or State Security
 Courts in which the accused do not receive all the Constitutional guarantees of the
 judicial system.
 There are three levels of regular criminal courts: primary courts, appeals courts,
 and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. The judicial system
 is based on the Napoleonic tradition; hence there are no juries. Criminal cases are
 heard by panels of three judges. Most trials are public, as required by the Constitu-
 tion. Defendants are entitled to the presumption of innocence under the Constitu-
 tion, and have the right to be present at trial, consult with a lawyer in a timely
 way and at public expense if needed, present witnesses and evidence, and review
 government-held evidence.
 The Constitution provides for the independence and immunity of judges, and for-
 bids interference by other authorities in the exercise of their judicial functions. The
 President appoints all judges upon recommendation of the Higher Judicial Council
 a constitutional body composed of senior judges, lawyers, an law professors, and
 chaired by the president of the Court of Cansation. The Council regulates judicial
 promotions salaries, transfers, and disciplinary actions.
 Defense lawyers generally agree that the regular judiciary respects the rights of
 the accused and exercises its independence. In the past, criminal court judges have
 dismissed cases where confessions were obtained by coercion.
 The Constitution provides detainees with the right to counsel, at state expense
 if necessary. In practice, most suspects are able to take advantage of this guarantee.
 The Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate provides free counsel to indigent defendants. How-
 ever, detainees in certain high-security prisons alleged that they were denied access
 to counsel or such access was delayeduntil trial, thus denying counsel the time to
 prepare an adequate defense.
 Human rights groups and defense lawyers have claimed that the Government has
 intimidated lawyers representing terrorist suspects by detaining and questioning
 them on the activities of their clients. On one occasion in 1995, a human rights law-
 yer was detained and interrogated for 2 days by state security following his visit
 to the family of a detainee in Assiyut. The Government contends that some defense
 
 
 1143
 lawyers are suspected of collaborating in terrorist groups and that therefore the de-
 tention is legal.
 The use of military and state security tribunals under the Emergency Law has
 deprived hundreds of civilian defendants of their constitutional right tobe tried by
 an "ordinary judge." In 1992, with extremist violence on the rise, the Government
 began trying cases of persons accused of terrorism and membership in terrorist
 groups before military tribunals. In 1993 the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled
 that the President may invoke the Emergency Law to refer any crime to a military
 court.
 From December 1994 to December 1995, the Government referred approximately
 143 civilian defendants to the military courts. Of these, 61 were charged in three
 separate cases with committing or conspiring to commit terrorist acts. The courts
 sentenced 4 defendants to death, 41 to prison, and acquitted 16.
 In September the Government referred 49 members of the Muslim Brotherhood
 to a military court to stand trial on charges of engaging in illegal political activities,
 including contacts with terrorist groups. 71nhe defen an s were not charged with any
 secific terrorist acts. The trials mark the first time since the mid-1960's that the
 Government has tried civilian defendants in a military court on political charges.
 In October the Government referred an additional 33 individuals, most of them
 Muslim Brotherhood members, to a military court on similar charges. The court
 handed down verdicts in both cases in November. It convicted 54 defendants, acquit-
 ted 27, and ordered the closing of the Brotherhood's headquarters office in Cairo.
 The court sentenced five prominent defendants to 5 years of hard labor. They are:
 Dr. Essam El-Erian, a former member of the People's Assembly and an official in
 the Egyptian Doctor's Syndicate; Mohammed El-Sayed Habib, a former member of
 the People's Assembly and president of the Assiyut University Faculty Club; Abdel
 Moneim Abul Futuh, secretary general of the Arab Doctors' Federation; Mohammed
 Khairat E1-Shater, chairman of the board of El-Mohandes Bank; and El-Sayed
 Mahmeud Ezzat, a professor of medicine at Zagzig University. Forty-nine other de-
 fendants received 3-year sentences.
 Defense lawyers walked out of the first trial, claiming that the trial of civilians
 by a military court was unconstitutional. They subsequently filed a petition with the
 Supreme Constitutional Court challenging the military court's jurisdiction. As of
 late December, the Supreme Court had not ruled on this petition. Meanwhile, the
 military court appointed other lawyers to replace those who walked out. A local
 human rights group that sent observers to the trials and interviewed defense law-
 yers stated that the lawyers lacked sufficient time to prepare their cases and were
 denied the opportunity to question key government witnesses thoroughly.
 The Government defends the use of military    ourts as neessary in terrorism
 cases, mintaining that trials in the civilian courts are protracted, and civilian
 amilies are vulnerable to terrorist threats. Some civilian judges
 have confirmed their fear of trying high visibility terrorism cases because of possible
 reprisal. The Government claims that civilian defendants receive fair trials in the
 military courts and enjoy the same rights as defendants in civilian courts.
 However, the military courts do not guarantee civilian defendants due process be-
 fore an independent triunal. While military judges are lawyers, they are also mili-
 tary officers appointed by the Minister of Defense and subject to military discipline.
 They are not independent or as qualified as civilian judges in applying the civilian
 penal code. There is no appellate process for verdicts issued by military courts- in-
 stead, verdicts are subject to a review by other military judges and confirmed by
 the President, who in practice usually delegates the review function to a senior mili-
 tary officer. Defense attorneys have complained that they have not been given suffi-
 cient time to prepare defenses and that judges tend to rush cases with many defend-
 ants.
 The State Security Courts share jurisdiction with military courts over crimes af-
 fecting national security. The President appoints judges to these courts from the ci-
 vilian judiciary upon the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and, if he choos-
 es to appoint military judges, the Minister of Defense. Verdicts cannot be appealed;
 sentences are subject to confirmation by the President. The President may alter or
 annul a decision of a State Security Court, including a decision to release a defend-
 ant. In 1995 State Security Courts tried at least 20 cases involving over 120 defend-
 ants charged with terrorist acts.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Emergency Lawh has abridged the constitutional prvisions regarding the right to
 privacy. Under the Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other
 means of communication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be
 guaranteed." Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and wire-
 
 
 1144
 
 taps. Courts have dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without sufficient
 cause. Police officials who conduct searches without proper warrants are subject to
 criminal penalties, although these are seldom imposed.
 The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place wiretaps, intercept mail
 and search persons or places without warrants. Security agencies frequently place
 political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, foreigners, and writers under
 surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially international mail), search
 them and their homes, and confiscate personal property.
 According to press reports and a local human rights group, in January security
 forces in Minya Province demolished the homes of 17 individuals who were sus-
 pected of membership in terrorist groups. The Government confirms that the
 demolitions took place, but maintains that they were not authorized. There were no
 further reports of similar demolitions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. Citizens openly speak their views on a wide range of political and
 social issues, including vigorous criticism of the Government.
 There are significant limitations on freedom of the press.
 The Government owns most major daily newspapers and the President appoints
 their editors-in-chief. Although these papers generally follow the government line,
 they frequently criticize government policies.
 Opposition political parties publish their own papers but receive a subsidy from
 the Government and, in some cases, subsidies from foreign interests as well. Most
 are weeklies, with the exception of the centrist daily "Al-Wafd" and "Al-Shaab," the
 semi-weekly of the Islamist-oriented Social Labor Party All have small circulations.
 Opposition newspapers frequently publish tough criticism of the Government, in-
 spiring rejoinders from the government-owned press. They also _give greater promi-
 nence to human rights abuses than the state-run newspapers. All party newspapers
 are required by law to reflect the platform of their party. Some papers have been
 called to account when they have deviated from their party line.
 The Press Law stipulates fines or imprisonment for criticism of the President or
 a foreign head of state. In recent years, opposition party newspapers have, within
 limits, published articles critical of the President and foreign heads of state without
 being charged or harassed.
 Libel laws provide normal protection against malicious rumor mongering and un-
 substantiated reporting. However, the penalties are so minimal and the judicial
 process so long and costly that individuals or officials who are wrongly defamed
 have no realistic legal recourse. This has given some opposition, and even govern-
 ment-controlled, newspapers license to publish rumors. On several occasions in
 1995, the Government detained and interrogated several editors and journalists for
 publishing allegations of official misconduct and corruption. They were released
 within several hours.
 In June the Government obtained quick  assae in the People's Assembly of legis-
 lation to stiffen penalties for criminal ibelan  roaden its definition. The Govern-
 ment introduced the amendments during an evening session without prior consulta-
 tion with the Assembly. Passage was achieved after 2 hours of debate. The change
 allows the police to detain offending editors or journalists under normal criminal
 procedures. However, the vagueness of the definition of criminal libel imposes se-
 vere limitations on press freedom. The new law makes it a crime to publish news
 that may lead to "public panic," or "harms national interests," or "ridicules state in-
 stitutions or the officials governing those institutions.&"
 Opposition to the new law was led by the Press Syndicate, which is dominated
 by the ruling party. The Syndicate declared its "outrage" and unsuccessfully urged
 the President not to sign the measure into law. In response to this opposition, the
 Government stated that it would suspend the implementation of the law, pending
 a review by a committee of interested parties. Nonetheless, in September security
 forces detained and the prosecutor charged with libel under the new law the editor-
 in-chief of Al-Shaab, the Labor Part' a newspaper, in connection with an article crit-
 ical of a cabinet minister's son. In December a journalist and his editor at the oppo-
 sition paper Al-Ahali were sentenced by a criminal court to two year's imprisonment
 and fines of approximately US$15,000 for an article about a police raid.
 Various ministries are authorized to ban or confiscate books and other works of
 art upon obtaining a court order. In addition, the Ministry of Interior regularly con-
 fiscates leaflets and other works by Muslim fundamentalists. During the year, the
 Ministry prevented the public sale of audio cassette tapes by fundamentalist imams
 whose preachings were extreme and in some cases advocated violence against non-
 
 
 1145
 
 Muslims, apostates, and the government. The Ministry of Defense also may ban
 works about sensitive security issues.
 Plays and films must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as
 final productions. Manyplays and films, highly critical of the Government and its
 policies, are not censored. In August the Ministry temporarily banned a play, "The
 Constitution, Gentlemen," when actors began diverging from the script to make ille-
 gal satirical references to President Mubarak and senior government officials. The
 Ministry removed the ban after obtaining a pledge from the acting troupe to abide
 by the script.
 The Ministry of Culture also censors foreign films for viewing in theaters, but it
 is more lenient when the same films are released in video cassette format. Govern-
 ment censors ensure that foreign films made in Egypt portray Egypt in a favorable
 light. Censors review scripts before filming, are present during filming, and have
 the right to review the film before it is sent out of Egypt.
 The Ministry of Information owns and operates all domestic television productions
 and has the right to censor foreign news publications. The Ministry seldom exercises
 its right. However, the Ministry banned three issues of the English-language week-
 ly, "rhe Middle East Times," in 1995. Those isues contained articles on allegations
 of human rights violations; one article reported that security forces had detained the
 widow of Abdel Harith Al-Madani (see Sections l.a. and 1.4.).
 The Islamic Research Institute at A-Azhar University has legal authority to cen-
 sor, but not to confiscate, all publications dealing with the Koran and Islamic scrip-
 tural texts. In recent years the Institute has passed judgment on the suitability of
 nonreligious books and artistic productions.
 In January an administrative court ruled that the sole authority to prohibit publi-
 cation or distribution of books and other works of art resides with the Ministry of
 Culture. This decision voided a 1994 advisory opinion by a judiciary council that had
 expanded Al-Azhar's censorship authority to include visual and audio artistic works.
 In the past, President Mubarak has publicly approved A-Azhar's censorship role,
 but in 1994 he stated that the Government would not allow confiscation of books
 from the market without a court order.
 The Government does not directly restrict academic freedom at universities. How-
 ever, some university professors claim that the Government tightened its control
 over universities in 1994 when a law was passed authorizing university presidents
 to appoint the deans of the various faculties. Under the previous law, faculty deans
 were elected by their peers. The Government has justified the measure as a means
 to combat Islaxnist influence on campus.
 As in recent years, moderate Muslims and secularist writers have found them-
 selves under attack by Islamic extremists. In March an appeals court overturned a
 court-ordered ban on the film "The Emigrant." In 1994 a group of Islamist lawyers
 brought suit against the film, arguing that it violated Islamic tenets in its portrayal
 of the life of the prophet Joseph. The plaintiffs have filed a new suit against the
 film; nonetheless, the film is still being shown in Egypt.
 Hearings in the court case of Cairo University professor Nasser Abu Zeid contin-
 ued into 1996. For the last several years, Islamic fundamentalist lawyers have
 asked the courts to rule that Abu Zeid is an apostate because of his controversial
 views regarding the origin of the Koran, and order him to live separatel from his
 wife. The petitioners a.ed that a an apostate, Abu Zeid shound not aeallowed
 to remain married to a Muslim woman in a Muslim country. After a lower court
 threw out this suit, an appellate court in June gave the plaintiffs standing to pursue
 their suit. Jurists and secular intellectuals criticized the court's decision as an in-
 fringement on the principle of privacy and freedom of expression. The Government
 has joined Abu Zeid in his appeal. Meanwhile, Abu Zeid and his wife are residing
 together abroad.
 b.Freedom   of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--Substantial restrictions on
 these freedoms continue. Under a 1923 law, citizens must obtain approval from the
 Ministry of Interior before holding public meetings, rallies, and protest marches.
 Permits are generally granted for rallies held indoors or on university campuses.
 The police broke up several political rallies in Cairo, Alexandria, and other cities
 during the parliamentary election campaigns in November. The authorities claimed
 that the organizers, who in most cases were opposition party candidates or inde-
 pendents, lacked the requisite permits.
 Under Law 32 of 1964, the Ministry of Social Affairs has extensive authority over
 Egyptian "associations and private foundations," including the right to license and
 dissolve them, confiscate their properties, appoint members to their boards, and in-
 tercede in other administrative matters. Licenses may be revoked if such organiza-
 tions engage in political or religious activities. The law authorizes the Ministry to
 
 
 1146
 
 merge two or more associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that may
 be used to merge an undesirable organization out of existence.
 Since 1985 the Government has refused under Law 32 to license the Egyptian Or-
 anization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the Arab Organization for Human Rights
 (AOHR) on grounds that they are political organizations. Nevertheless, both con-
 tinue to operate openly (see Section 4). Similarly, the request made by Amnesty
 International (Al) in 1990 for legal status for its local chapter is still pending with
 the Government.
 Under 1993 legislation on professional syndicates, an association must elect its
 governing board by at least 50 percent of its general membership. Failing a quorum,
 a second election must be held in which at least 33 percent of the membership votes
 for the board. If such a quorum is impossible, the judiciary may appoint a caretaker
 board until new elections can be set. The law was adopted to prevent well organized
 minorities, specifically Islamists, from capturing or retaining the leadership of pro-
 fessional syndicates. Members of these syndicates have reported that Islamists have
 used such irregular electoral techniques as physically blocking polling places, and
 limiting or changing the location of polling sites.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the
 practice of religious rites. However, there are important limitations. Most Egyptians
 are Muslim, but at least 10 per cent of the population, 5.5 million  ple, belong
 to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest Christian minority in the Middle East.
 There are other small Christian denominations, as well as a Jewish community
 numbering fewer than 50.
 For the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harass-
 ment and maintain links with co-religionists abroad. Under the Constitution, how-
 ever, Islam is the official state religion and primary source of legislation. Accord-
 iely, religious practices that conflict with Islamic law are prohibited. For example,
 it is a crime for non-Muslims to proselytize. At least 5 Christians were detainedin
 1994 and 1995 under this law. All were released after spending several weeks in
 detention.
 Similarly, Muslims face legal problems if they convert to another faith. Authori-
 ties have charged a few converts to Christianity under provisions of the Penal Code
 which prohibit the use of religion to "inite strife, degrade any of the heavenly reli-
 gions or harm national unity or social peace." In other cases, authorities have
 charged such persons with violating laws against falsifying documents, since Mus-
 lim converts to Christianity sometimes attempt to change their names and religious
 affiliation on their identification cards and other official documentation to reflect
 their conversion. These laws were upheld in a 1980 court decision. At least four in-
 dividuals were detained in late 1994 and during 1995 under these laws and re-
 leased.
 There were credible reports that State Security officers in Cairo detained, interro-
 gated, and in at least one case, physically abused, several Christians and converts
 to Christianity in an effort to obtain information about the identities and activities
 of other converts. At least one of these cases was brought to higher authorities and
 is under review.
 An 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is now
 a presidential decree to build or repair a place of worship. Coptic Christians main-
 tain that they frequently have been unable to obtain such authorization, that such
 permits have been delayed, or that they have been blocked by the security forces
 from using the authorizations that have been issued.
 In January the press reported the arrest of three Christians in Alexandria for
 making unauthorized repairs to the bathroom of their church. As a result of these
 restrictions, some communities have been using private buildings and apartments
 for religious services. Since 1992, the situation has improved somewhat as the Gov-
 ernment has increased the number of building permits issued to Christian commu-
 nities to an average of more than 20 per year, compared to the average of 5 permits
 issued annually in the 1980's. Most permits appear to be for the repair of existing
 structures and not for new construction of churches, however. While Christian and
 Muslim reformers urge the abolition of the Ottoman decree, Islamists who oppose
 the spread of Christianity in Egypt defend the building restrictions.
 In 1994 the Alexandria government closed two buildings near the city which had
 been used by Coptic Evangelical Christians since 1990 for church activities. The
 Government claims that the church lacked a building permit. Lawyers for the
 church point out that the closures violated previous court rulings upholding the
 right to conduct religious services in private buildings without prior government ap-
 proval. They also pointed out that the closed buldings were located in an area
 where unlicensed buildings are common. At year's end, the case remained with an
 administrative court in Alexandria.
 
 
 1147
 
 The Government continued to make efforts to extend legal controls to all mosques,
 which by law must be licensed. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of
 the imams o~riciating in moses, and proposes themes for and monitors sermons.
 Of the country's approximately 70,000 mosques, nearly half remain unlicensed and
 operate outside the control of government authorities. In an effort to combat Islamic
 extremists, the Government announced that it intended to bring 10,000 unauthor-
 ized mosques under its control this year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens and foreigners are free to travel within Egpt except in certain
 military areas. Males who have not ompleted ompulsory milhtary service may not
 travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction can be deferred or bypassed. Un-
 married women under 21 must have permission from their fathers to obtain pass-
 orts and travel; married women require the same permission from their husbands.
 Citzns who leave the country have the right to return.
 In May and June, the Ministry of Interior refused a request for permission to
 travel by Omar Abdel Karl, a preb her at a mosbue in Cairo whO ha been banned
 from preaching because of his alleged extremist views.
 In recent years, the Government has denied permission to a small number of
 Christian converts from Islam to travel abroad. In October 1994, security officials
 arrested Ibrahim Sharaf Al-Din, an Egyptian convert, at Cairo airport as he at-
 tempted to enter Egypt from Kenya, where he had been granted asylum and resided
 with his family since the early 1980's. Al-Din was imprisoned for 8 months while
 prosecutors investigated the circumstances of his conversion. He was released with-
 out charge in June, but at year's end was unable to depart Egypt because, according
 to the Government, the prosecutor's case against him is still pending.
 The deportation of citizens and aliens granted political asylum is prohibited and
 is not practiced.
 Egypt hosts thousands of refugees, but only a few are officially allowed to resettle
 permanently.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Chadge Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, citizens do not have a mean-
 ingful ability to change their government.
 In 1993 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October of that year, his reelection was approved by
 96 percent of the voters in a national referendum. Under the Constitution, the elec-
 torate is not presented with a choice among competing presidential candidates. Two
 opposition parties urged the public to boycott the referendum, and two other parties
 urged the public to vote against the President. The other opposition parties en-
 dorsed the President's candidacy.
 An election for the 454-seat People's Assembly was held in November. Run-offs
 took place in December. In the final tally, the NDP won 317 seats, independents
 114, and opposition parties 13. After the second round, 99 of the independents ap-
 plied to join the NDP, but the party accepted only 11 applicants. One Muslim Broth-
 er, running as an independent, was elected. After the election he joined the Socialist
 Labor Party. The election drew an unprecedented 4,000 candidates and a strong
 measure of public interest. It also brought an unprecedented level of campaigning
 by all candidates, including those with assumed safe seats.
 Both rounds of voting were marred by irregularities, many of which appeared to
 result from either inadequate crowd control at polling centers or a breakdown in the
 oversight system, which was designed to ensure the inviolability of the ballot boxes.
 Violent incidents, mostly among supporters of competing candidates, resulted in
 about 20 deaths.
 After the first round, over 100 losing candidates filed complaints in the Adminis-
 trative Courts, alleging ballot-stuffing and other irregularities. The courts agreed
 with many of these claims and invalidated several first-round results. At year's end,
 the Hi her Administrative Court in Cairo was considering about 100 cases on ap-
 peal. This court has the authority to rule on whether irregularities took place, but
 may not remove an elected member of the Assembly.
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call cabinet ministers to explain policy. The executive initiates almost all leg-
 islation. Nevertheless, the Assembly maintains the authority to challenge or re-
 strain the executive in the areas of economic and social policy, but it may not modify
 the budget except with the Government's approval. The Assembly exercises limited
 
 
 1148
 
 influence in the areas of security and foreign policy, and there is little oversight of
 the Interior Ministry's use of Emergency Law powers. Many executive branch initia-
 tives and policies are carried out by regulation through ministerial decree without
 legislative oversight. The military budget is prepared b the executive and not de-
 bated publicly. Roll-call votes in the assembly are rare. Votes are generally reported
 in aggregate terms of yeas and nays, and thus constituents have no independent
 method of checking a member's voting record.
 There are 15 recognized opposition parties. The law empowers the Government
 to bring felony charges against those who form a party without a license. New par-
 ties must be approved by the Parties Committee, a semi-official body including a
 substantial majority of members from the ruling NDP and some members from
 among the independents and opposition parties. Decisions of the Parties Committee
 may be appealed to the civil courts. In 1995 the Parties Committee rejected the ap-
 plication for one new party, the Egyptian Republican Party; a second, the Equality
 Party, was approved on a court appeal. Appeals of rejections of seven other parties
 are pending before a court.
 According to the law, which prohibits political parties based on religion, the Mus-
 lim Brotherhood is an illegal political organization. However, Muslim Brothers are
 publicly known and openly speak their views, but have come under increasingpres-
 sure from the Government (see Sections 1.d. and i.e.). Some have served in the As-
 sembly as independents or as members of other recognized parties. Critics maintain
 that the Government's campaign of arrests of Muslim Brothers was designed to ex-
 clude the Brotherhood from the legislative elections.
 The Constitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for presidential appointees, which
 the President traditionally has used to assure representation for Coptic Christians
 and women. Five women and no Copts were elected in November. However, of the
 10 presidential appointments, 6 were Copts and 4 were women. The National Demo-
 cratic Party had no Coptic candidates.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to license local human rights groups as private entities
 under Law 32 of 1964 (see Section 2.b.). Since 1986 the Government has refused
 to license the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) on grounds that it
 is a political organization and duplicates the activities of an existing, although mori-
 bund, human rights group (see Section 2.b.). The EOHR has appealed the denial in
 the courts, and continues to conduct activities openly, pending a final judicial deter-
 mination of its status.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR), EOHR's parent organization,
 has a long-standing request for registration as a foreign organization with the Min-
 istry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry has not approved the request thus far, stating
 that the issue is dependent on the outcome of efforts within the League of Arab
 States to establish a human rights body.
 A request by Amnesty International (AI) for legal status for its local chapter has
 been pending with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 5 years. In the meantime it
 is allowed to conduct limited activities.
 Despite their nonrecognition, the EOHR and other groups sometimes enjoy the co-
 operation of government officials. The Government allows EOHR field workers to
 visit prisons, to call on some government officials, and to receive funding from for-
 eign human rights organizations. In August a senior government official met with
 leaders of the major human rights groups in Egypt for the first time to exchange
 views in what the groups hope will become a continuing dialogue.
 On the other hand, on at least six occasions during the year the Government
 banned meetings of human rights groups or denied permits for them to hold con-
 ferences. In May the Government denied permission for a video training workshop
 for regional human rights activists sponsored by EOHR and the U.S.-based Lawyers
 Committee for Human Rights. The Government denied the U.S. group permission
 to hold the workshop after its representatives had already traveled to Egypt.
 Other human rights organizations, such as the Center for Human Rights Legal
 Aid, are registered with the Government as corporations under commercial or civil
 law, thus avoiding the obstacles posed by Law 32 (see Section 2.b.).
 In January the Ministry of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory ruling stating
 that such organizations properly should be considered nongovernmental organiza-
 tions as defined by Law 32 and registered accordingly, or face punitive action.
 Human rights advocates expressed their concern that this opinion, as well as a hos-
 tile press campaign against these groups by the government-controlled press, verbal
 attacks by senior government officials, and occasional bans on meetings by the orga-
 
 
 1149
 
 nizations, may presage a move to close them down. However, the Government did
 not close down any group during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality of the sexes and equal treatment of non-
 Muslims, but aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate against
 women and Christians.
 Women.-Family violence against women occurs and is reflected in press accounts
 of specific incidents. Official or nonofficial quantitative data do not exist. In general,
 the intervention of neighbors and extended family members tends to limit the preva-
 lence and scope of such violence. Abuse within the family is rarely discussed pub-
 licly, owing to the value attached to privacy in this traditional society. Several non-
 governmental organizations have begun offering counseling, legal aid, and other
 services to women who are victims of domestic violence.
 The law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and many tradi-
 tional practices discriminate against women. By law, women need their husbands'
 or fathers' permission to obtain a passport or travel abroad (see Section 2.d.). Only
 males can confer citizenship. In rare cases, this means that children born to Egyp-
 tian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individ-
 ual's religion, which for most Egyptians is Islam. A 1979 liberalization of the Family
 Status Law strengthening a Muslim woman's rights to divorce and child custody
 was repealed in 1985 after it was found unconstitutional for conflicting with Islamic
 law. However, in August a proposed new marriage contract won the support of
 Egypt's highest religious figure, the last major step before the Government can
 adopt it. The contract, which applies only to Muslims and would replace the current
 one drafted in 1931, stipulates negotiations between the partners to agree on the
 terms of the marriage, including the woman's right to work, study and travel
 abroad, as well as the man's right to take another wife. The contract also proposes
 agreement on division of roperty and financial settlement in the event of divorce.
 Under the contract, the eases for the wife's right to request a divorce would be
 broadened to include the husband's violation of any of the terms under the new con-
 tract.
 Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, but non-Muslim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' propert,.-Male Muslim heirs have the duty to provide for all family
 members who need assistance.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. Three women are in the Cabinet. Over
 100 officers in the Egyptian diplomatic service are women, including 6 ambassadors.
 There are no female judges. Although there is no legal basis to prohibit female
 judges, a woman under consideration for promotion to magistrate was denied the
 promotion on the basis of gender in 1993 and is suing the Government.
 Social pressure against women pursuing a career is strong, and some Egyptian
 fminists say that arsretIT
 fe   n's rig t a resurgen is  amic fundamentalist trend limits further gains.
 Women's rights advocates also point to other discriminatory traditional or cultural
 attitudes and practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM) and the traditional
 male relative's role in enforcing chastity and appropriate sexual conduct.
 There are a growing number of active women's rights groups working in diverse
 areas, including reforming the Personal Status Code, educating women on their
 legal rights, om-bating FOM and rewriting the marriage contract.
 Children. -The Government remains committed to the protection of children's
 welfare within the limits of its budgetary resources. Many of the resources for chil-
 dren's welfare are provided by international donors, especially in the field of child
 immunization. Child labor is widespread, despite the Government's commitment to
 eradicate it. In education, the Government treats boys and girls equally at the pri-
 mary, secondary, and post-secondary levels.
 FGM is widely condemned by international health experts as damag     to both
 physical and psychological health. Statistics on the prevalence of FGM vary, but
 government and private sources aegree it is common among 70 to 80 per cent o rural
 and poor urban women. The act is generally performed on girls between the ages
 of 7 and 10, probably with equal prevalence among Muslims and Coptic Christians.
 A 1959 decree and subsequent amendments, which described FGM as 'psycho-
 logically harmful," limited the practice to excision. However, the more drastic
 
 
 1150
 
 infibulation is practiced in some parts of southern Egypt. The decree prohibited doc-
 tors from performing the excision in government health facilities; however, following
 public outcry in 1994 over a foreign television broadcast of the circumcision of a 9-
 year-old girl by a barber, the Minister of Health decreed that FGM should be per-
 formed 1 day per week in government facilities only by trained medical personnel.
 In announcing the decision, the Minister argued that making the practice illegal
 would only drive it underground; that it could be eliminated only by a sustained
 educational campaign; and that in the meantime it should be performed in clean,
 safe circumstances.
 Current law stipulates penalties for nonmedical practitioners of FGM. A barber
 was arrested in May for the death of a 10-year-old girl whom he had circumcised,
 the second such death in the child's family at his hands. However, the law does not
 stipulate punishment for parents who violate the law. The Government broadcasts
 television programs condemning the practice, and a number of NGO's work actively
 to educate the public of the health hazards attached to the practice.
 The Sheikh of Al-Azhar, head of the world's oldest institution of Islamic learning,
 issued a decree in 1994 declaring FGM a religiously mandated duty. His ruling is
 opposed by another religious leader, the Grand Mufti, who is the official representa-
 tive of Islam in the Government. Nonetheless, the Sheikh's ruling may hamper gov-
 ernment education efforts.
 People With Disabilities.-There are approximately 5.7 million disabled persons,
 of whom 1.5 million are severely disabled. The Government makes serious efforts
 to address their rights. It works closely with United Nations agencies and other
 international aid donors to design job-training programs for the disabled. The Gov-
 ernment also seeks to increase the public's awareness of the capabilities of the dis-
 abled in television programming, the print media, and in educational material in
 public schools. By law, all businesses must designate 5 percent of their jobs for the
 disabled, who are exempt from normal literacy requirements. Although there is no
 legislation mandating access to public accommodations and transportation, the dis-
 abled may ride government-owned mass transit buses without charge, are given pri-
 ority in obtaining telephones, and receive reductions on customs duties for private
 vehicles.
 Religious Minorities.-The Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before
 the law and prohibits discrimination based on religion. For the most part these con-
 stitutional protections are upheld by the Government. Yet, discriminatory practices
 against Christians still exist.
 The approximately 5.5 million Coptic Christians are the objects of occasional vio-
 lent assaults by Muslim extremists. During the year, extremists were responsible
 for killing at least 30 Copts, most in the Minya governorate in upper Egypt, where
 about 30 to 40 percent of the inhabitants are Christian. According to a senior police
 official in Minya, the extremists were carrying out a plan to assassinate prominent
 Coptic leaders. Many Copts in Minya still fear for their safety.
 Extremists also have obstructed church repairs and construction and harassed
 Copt-owned businesses. Some Christians have complained that the Government is
 lax in protecting Coptic lives and property. Security forces arrest extremists who
 perpetrate violence against Copts, but some members of the Coptic community do
 not believe that the Government is vigorous in its efforts to prevent the attacks and
 does little to correct nonviolent forms of discrimination, including its own.
 There were several credible reports of forced conversions of Coptic children to
 Islam, allegedly carried out by Muslim extremists. In one case, the father of a 15-
 year-old girl wrote to the Speaker of the Shura Council seeking his help in obtaining
 the return of his daughter, whom he claimed had been abducted by the Islamic
 Group in 1992 and forced to convert to Islam. He claimed that the local government
 had refused to help him.
 Government discriminatory practices include: suspected statistical under-rep-
 resentation of the size of the Christian population; anti-Christian discrimination in
 education; a public school ban on the hiring of Christian Arabic teachers as the cur-
 riculum involves the study of the Koran; the production of some Islamic television
 programs with anti-Christian themes; job discrimination in the public sector, the po-
 lice, the armed forces, and other government agencies; reported discrimination
 against Christians in admission to state medical schools; and underrepresentation
 in government. Although there are two Coptic Christians in the Cabinet, there are
 no Coptic governors and no Copts in the upper ranks of the military, police, or diplo-
 matic service. The ruling NDP nominated no Coptic candidates in the November
 parliamentary election.
 
 
 1151
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join trade unions but are not required
 to do so. A union local, or workers' committee, may be formed if 50 employees ex-
 press a desire to organize. Most union members, about 25 per cent of the labor force,
 are empioyed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high administra-
 tive' officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 There are 23 industrial unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade
 Union Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) repeatedly has
 emphasized that a law requiring all trade unions to belong to a single federation
 infringes on the freedom of association. The Government has shown no sign that it
 intends to accept the establishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leader-
 ship asserts that it actively promotes worker interests and that there is no need for
 another federation. ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are
 members of the People's Assembly and the Shura Council. They speak vigorously
 on behalf of worker concerns, but public confrontations between EUF and the Gov-
 ernment are rare. Disputes are more often resolved by consensus behind closed
 doors.
 Some unions within ETUF are affiliated with international trade union organiza-
 tions. Others are in the process of doing so.
 The Government is currently reviewing a new labor law for submission to the Peo-
 ple's Assembly. The law is expected to be debated in the spring of 1996. The pro-
 d law provides statutory authorization for the rights to strike and to collective
 bargaining. Under current labor laws such rights are not adequately guaranteed.
 Even though the right to strike is not guaranteed, strikes occur. The Government
 considers strikes a form of public disturbance and hence illegal.
 Several strikes occurred in 1995 at both private- and public-sector companies. In
 August workers at a government-owned automobile factory staged a 3-day sit-in
 strike to protest a proposed cut in benefits. Although security  a~ce  aaed on
 the scene, no violence was reported, and the parties eventually reached a settle-
 ment.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The draft labor law piovides
 statutory authorization for collective bargaining. Under the current law, unions may
 negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter agrees to such
 negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in the state sec-
 tor. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist in any mean-
 ingful sense because the Government sets wages, benefits, and job classifications by
 law. Larger firms in the private sector generally adhere to such government-man-
 dated standards.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones as in the rest
 of the ountry.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The criminal code authorizes sen-
 tences of hard labor for some crimes.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum ages for employ-
 ment are 12 in non-a  cultural and 6 in agricultural work. Education is compulsory
 until age 15. An employee must be at least age 15 to join a labor union. The Labor
 Law of 1981 states that children age 12 to 15 ma work 6 hours a day but not after
 7 p.m. and not in dangerous or physically demanding activities. Child workers must
 obtain medical certificates and work permits before they are employed.
 The Minister of Health disclosed that 2 million children between the ages of 6 and
 15 are employed. A 1989 study estimated that perhaps 720,000 children work on
 farms. However, children also work as apprentices in repair and craft shops, in
 heavier industries such as brickmaking and textiles, and as workers in leather fac-
 tories and carpet-making. While local trade unions report that the Ministry of Labor
 adequately enforces the labor laws in state-owned enterprises, enforcement in the
 private sector especially in familyaowned enterprises, is lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public-sector employees,
 the minimum wage is approximately $20 (about 65 Egyptian pounds) a month for
 a 6-day, 48-hour workweek. Base pay is supplemented by-a complex system of fringe
 benefits and bonuses that ma     uble or triple a worker's take-home pay. It is
 doubtful that the average family could survive on a worker's base pay at the mini-
 mum wage rate. The minimum wage is also legally binding on the private sector,
 and larger private companies generally observe the requirement and pay bonuses
 as well. Smaller firms do not always pay the minimum wage or bonuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspection are uneven. The law
 prohibits employers from maintaining hazardous working conditions and provides
 legal reoeurse for employees who are asked to work in such conditions.
