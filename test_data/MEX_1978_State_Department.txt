 MEXICO
 Since the close of the 1910 Revolution, Mexico
 has experienced rapid economic and social develop-
 ment with political stability. The high rate
 of economic growth has slowed since 1975. The
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), while
 dominating the political scene, by its breadth
 offers scope for considerable participation
 and debate. A new political reform program has
 increased the number of opposition parties and
 will provide them representation in the Congress.
 The Constitution, laws and much of the political
 discourse consistently affirm or reflect social
 justice and equality as basic ideals of the Revolution.
 A full range of individual rights, guaranteed by the
 Constitution, are-generally respected in practice,
 although the number of accusations of individual human
 rights abuses, connected with anti-terrorism or politi-
 cal opposition, is substantial. The administration of
 President Jose Lopez Portillo has begun to devote
 increasing attention to resolving serious hunan rights
 problems. Mexico has a good human rights record in
 international affairs, having traditionally supported
 the persecuted of other countries and participated
 actively in multilateral approaches to human rights
 issues.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Government policy condemns the use of torture.
 Physical abuse during arrest or confinement is pro-
 nibited by the Constitution. However, there have
 been some cases of both physical and psychological
 abuse by the police. There are allegations that
 
 (290)
 
 
 suspected terrorists have occasionally been killed
 instead of being brought to trial. The Amnesty
 International Report 1977 (See Part 4) stated
 that the use of torture by Federal and state
 personnel to extract confessions still caused
 concern.
 Mistreatment sometimes occurs in the period im-
 mediately following arrest, especially during inter-
 rogation. Credible press reports indicate that sus-
 pected terrorists are more likely to be subjected to
 severe forms of interrogation, including physical
 abuse, than are others detained. Police officers
 who obtain evidence or a confession from a sus-
 pected law breaker by unconstitutional means may
 be prosecuted for such violation, and some are.
 Under Mexican law the confession or evidence
 against the accused obtained by unconstitutional
 means may be admissible if it is substantiated
 by corroborating evidence. A judge, however, may
 invalidate a confession if the accused can prove
 that it was obtained through coercion.
 During their inquiry in the dpring of 1978 (see
 below), representatives of the International League
 for Human Rights (ILHR) found that many of the 100
 prisoners they interviewed were "subjected to tortures
 while illegally detained at the hands of Government
 agents." While the ILHR does not "ascribe to the
 Mexican Government a policy sanctioning or condoning
 such illegal acts," the investigators expressed re-
 gret "that the Government apparently has not yet
 adopted a policy to stop these practices."
 In a September 16 letter, the Attorney General
 reprimanded the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in
 Sinaloa for torture of persons detained for narcotics
 violations; these incidents had been cited in a May
 1978 report by the Sinaloa Bar Association. The
 
 
 Attorney General outlined the Sinaloa Federal
 Judicial Police's responsibilities to the public,
 concluding with the threat that continued abuse of
 human rights would result in removal from office of
 those involved.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions in many Mexican jails are poor due to
 overcrowding, primitive sanitary facilities and
 inadequate diet. In recent years the Mexican
 Government has remodeled or replaced some sub-
 standard facilities. The ILHR mission commended
 the Mexican Government for penal reforms which have
 improved prison conditions throughout the country.
 In 1977 the United States concluded with Mexico a
 prisoner transfer treaty which provided for mutual
 repatriation beginning December 9, 1977. By
 December 1978, 351 Americans and 137 Mexicans had
 been transferred to their own countries.
 During the period January 15 - May 15, 1978, there
 were 32 allegations by American citizens of mis-
 treatment at the time of their arrest. Eight of
 these allegations were substantiated by United States
 consular officers. This represents a slight decline
 over the same period a year ago.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Mexican citizens are guaranteed the right of
 amparo, a constitutional protection providing
 TTle   against "coercive and abusive acts of
 authority." Arbitrary arrest, detention and
 disappearance of suspected political subversives
 have been charged by human rights groups, opposition
 political parties and by the press. In the case
 of arrests for politically motivated crimes, a number
 of the charges appear credible. The Defense Committee
 for Political Prisoners, Disappeared Persons
 and Exiles has asserted that over 360 people
 have disappeared while in the hands of security
 
 
 293
 forces during the past decade and/or have been
 detained incommunicado at various military
 installations. Amnesty International estimated
 in 1977 that there were approximately 200
 political prisoners. As the year ended the
 Government, denying that secret prisons existed
 or that disappearances had occurred, said that
 it would provide an accounting of persons claimed
 to have disappeared.
 The ILHR investigators confirmed much of the sub-
 stance of these charges, concluding that many of
 the 100 prisoners interviewed were detained without
 any warrant or order of arrest. Many of the
 prisoners told the ILHR mission that they were
 initially taken to secret detention centers and held
 incommunicado. According to the ILHR, the great
 majority of illegally detained prisoners who were
 interviewed affirmed that they were held by an anti-
 terrorist vigilante group known as the Brigada Blanca.
 The Mexican Government has consistently denied
 reports that it holds political prisoners, claiming
 that the persons were detained for the commission
 of common crimes. However, in his September 1978
 State of the Nation address President Lopez Portillo
 announced that he intended to send an amnesty bill
 to Congress, stating: "It is well worthwhile to
 open new, free opportunities to those who, under the
 influence of some political motivation, have been
 imprisoned or become fugitives because they committed
 offenses or have formed part of dissident extremist
 groups, but who have not taken part in crimes that
 endanger the life of or threaten bodily harm to
 others."
 In late September 1978 the Mexican Congress passed an
 amnesty bill broader than the President's proposed
 legislation. The new law provides anmnesty to persons
 arrested for, or charged with, politically-inspired
 acts, including those which threatened the lives of,
 or inflicted bodily harm on others, if the.Attorney
 General and the Secretariat of Government certify
 that the person is not a threat to public order. The
 Amnesty law was promulgated on September 28, and the
 
 
 294
 Secretary of Government announced the same day that
 111 persons would initially benefit from it. While
 the law applies only to persons under the jurisdic-
 tion of Federal courts or the courts of the Federal
 District, the Secretary of Government has urged the
 state governors to pass similar laws. A few states
 have already done so. By the end of November 1978
 about 270 persons had benefitted from the federal and
 state amnesty laws.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm, but there are ex-
 ceptions as cited below. The Mexican legal system,
 founded on Roman civil law, does not fully protect
 all rights of prisoners during prearraignment
 interrogation.
 The ILHR mission concluded that many of the alleged
 political prisoners interviewed were effectively
 denied a fair trial and due process of law. On the
 other hand, the ILHR investigators made special note
 of the freedom given defense attorneys under the
 Mexican judicial system.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home without written judicial orders
 is prohibited by the Constitution and this legal
 safeguard is generally effective. It is alleged that
 Mexican police and security forces have sometimes
 invaded homes or business places of suspects without
 appropriate judicial orders.
 2.   Governmental Policied Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The Lopez Portillo Administration is just completing
 the first two years of its six-year term. The Govern-
 ment has successfully begun to address the problems
 of financial stability and inflation. The outlines
 for some of the programs designed to confront longer-
 term problems, such as economic development and job
 creation, are now emerging. President Lopez Portillo
 has called on Mexicans to confront the basic social
 
 
 295
 problems of the nation. There are still great dif-
 ferences in wealth and opportunity between the rich
 and the poor. Pressures of unemployment and under-
 employment have resulted in significant emigration,
 particularly to the United States. The Government
 is beginning to implement the President's pledges to
 adopt a development model that would help all Mexicans,
 to continue redistributing the remaining large under-
 utilized landholdings, to open new lands, and to in-
 crease agricultural productivity. The Government has
 also announced a National Employment Fund to use
 anticipated petroleum revenues for increasing job
 training and job creation. Recent minimum wage legis-
 lation has been designed to narrow the gap between
 rural and urban incomes.
 Faced with critical problems stemming from Mexico's
 growth in population, President Lopez Portillo has
 made a goal of his administration the reduction of
 population growth from 3.5 percent in 1977 to 2.5
 percent by 1982. A campaign to this end, already
 showing positive results in declining fertility
 rates, coincides with a proposed program of preven-
 tive medicine and family nutrition to provide food
 supplements to the poor. Educational policy is
 directed toward providing a basic primary education
 to all youth while aiming higher education toward
 the developmental needs of the country.
 Although specific cases and magnitudes are diffi-
 cult to document, the belief is widespread that
 corruption in Mexico diverts significant resources
 from the poor. The Lopez Portillo Administration
 is prosecuting four cases of high level Government
 corruption as well as numerous lower level cases,
 and the President has spoken of the serious social
 problem of corruption.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 
 
 296
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are guaran-
 teed by the Constitution and respected in practice.
 The media customarily avoid direct criticism of an
 incumbent President, but otherwise conduct a full
 national debate. In September 1978, the President
 announced his intention to send draft legislation to
 Congress that would further guarantee the opposition
 parties access to the media and expand the public's
 right to government information. A wide range of ideas
 is found in the media and intellectual circles. The
 Mexican Government censors movies on moral grounds and
 controls broadcast of television programs on a similar
 basis.
 Freedom of religious belief is a constitutional guaran-
 tee and there are no restrictions on religious practice.
 There are restrictions on Church ownership of
 property and the clergy are denied participation in
 politics by the Constitution. There are few restric-
 tions on freedom of assembly, which is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. Demonstrations and marches require
 permits, which normally are granted. In his 1978 State
 of the Nation address, the President noted that 2,000
 peaceful demonstrations had been held throughout the
 country from December 1976 to August 1978. Student
 demonstrations have declined in number in recent years.
 Tney are generally peaceful, but a recent student pro-
 test in Guadalajara against increased bus fares resulted
 in violence.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 As guaranteed by the Constitution and in practice, Mexican
 citizens may travel anywhere and emigrate freely.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mexican political system is dominated by one
 party: the PRI. Within the PRI and the Government,
 however, there is give and take, wide ideological
 variation and serious concern for the economic
 and social needs of the country. Recent legislation
 has resulted in the provisional registration of three
 additional political parties and four political
 associations. Following the 1979 legislative
 
 
 297
 elections the Chamber of Deputies is to be expanded
 to include these additional entities. Individual
 citizens are free to join the PRI or the minority
 parties and to participate in their activities.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 Government, both in theory and practice. These
 include the right to strike, if legally authorized,
 and freedom of association. In practice the unions
 affiliated with the PRI predominate and there are
 relatively few strikes. Nearly all of those that do
 occur are settled by application of government pres-
 sures within 10-15 days. If a union has complied
 with all of the provisions required by law, the
 Government seldom refuses to grant legal authoriza-
 tion for a strike. There are occasional illegal
 strikes conducted both by legal and unauthorized
 unions. On occasion the state or federal authorities
 have intervened and arrested leaders of such illegal
 strikes.
 The rights of women were significantly improved in
 1975, International Women's Year. The wife of
 President Eaheverria was instrumental in the
 removal of many legal constraints on the equality
 of women with respect to marriage and divorce,
 freedom of movement, rights to property, family
 support and rights of illegitimate children.
 Still, Mexican women are subject to traditions
 and social conditions which prevent them from
 enjoying full and equal access to jobs and wages.
 The participation of women in politics has been
 encouraged. There are four female senators (out
 of 64) and 22 female deputies (out of 237) in the
 Mexican Congress.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Mexico has traditionally welcomed the persecuted
 of other Latin American countries and supported
 multilateral approaches to human rights problems.
 The Mexican Government has been generally coopera-
 
 
 298
 tive with international human rights organizations.
 Mexico's Foreign Secretary supported the general
 thrust of the huaan rights initiatives at the 1978
 General Assembly of the Organization of American
 States and at the 1978 United Nations General
 Assembly. He interpreted those initiatives to
 cover the rights of migratory workers, including
 undocumented Mexican workers in the United States,
 a matter of particular concern to Mexico. The
 Mexican Government has not signed the American
 Convention on Human Rights.
 The Amnesty International Report 1977 included a
 discussion of human rights violations in Mexico.
 During his January 1978 visit to Mexico the
 Secretary General of Amnesty International main-
 tained the organization's position concerning
 these violations in his meetings with government
 officials. The Mexican Government has presented
 some evidence that the prisoners in question were
 charged with common crimes. The 1977 Report
 stated that some of the recommendations made by
 Amnesty International in 1976, e.g., the release
 of prisoners detained for long periods without
 trial had been implemented by the Mexican authori-
 ties but that other problems, described elsewhere
 in this report, still caused concern.
 Mexican authorities cooperated fully with the Inter-
 national League for Human Rights study mission to
 Mexico in the spring of 1978. The Secretary of
 Government promised to investigate the findings of
 the mission and punish officials proven guilty of
 violations of their office. Findings of the mission
 are described elsewhere in this report.
