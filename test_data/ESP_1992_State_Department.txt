 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch, King Juan
 Carlos I. In free and open parliamentary elections in October 1989, Prime Minister
 Felipe Gonzalez was elected to a third term.
 The security forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Civil Guard, and National
 Police) are under the full control of the Government; allegations of human rights
 abuse are investigated, and those found guilty are punished by law. Since 1989,
 there has been a Special Advisor for Human Rights in the Ministry of the Interior
 who is in charge of promoting humanitarian law throughout Spain, as well as train-
 ing senior members of Spain's law enforcement groups in human rights issues. Total
 military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $7,775 million. The Gov-
 ernment's defense budget continues to shrink on a yearly basis.
 The Spanish economy is market based, with primary reliance on private initiative,
 although there are still many public sector enterprises. In 1992 economic growth
 slowed to approximately 1.5 percent. Spain continued to experience high unemploy-
 ment, amounting to approximately 17 percent, although actual unemployment is es-
 timated to be considerably lower because of employment in the extensive under-
 ground economy.
 The fundamental rights of freedom of speech, assembly, press, religion, movement,
 and participation in the political process are provided for in the Constitution of 1978
 and are respected in practice. In 1992 the yrincipal source of human rights abuses
 continued to be the protracted campaign of terrorism waged by the Basque Father-
 land and Freedom (ETA) separatist group, although the numbers of incidents de-
 clined from 1991. The Government's efforts to bring individual terrorists to justice
 resulted in some accusations by detainees of ill treatment. Judicial investigations
 of complaints by both terrorist and criminal suspects that they were abuse in po-
 
 
 912
 lice custody continued, leading to several indictments in one case. Incidents against
 foreigners escalated to include violence, and one immigrant was killed in an
 unprovoked attack.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government forces. In approximately 31 terrorist-re-
 lated incidents from January through November which resulted in deaths or inju-
 ries, approximately 24 people were killed and 68 wounded. The number of incidents
 decreased significantly since 1991, as did the severity of these attacks, resulting in
 fewer deaths and injuries. As in previous years, the vast majority of those killed
 were members of the Civil Guard and the National Police. Of the 31 incidents, 29
 were attributed to the ETA, one to the First of October anti-Fascist Group (GRAPO),
 and one to the Catalan group, Free Land (Terra Lliure).
 In March French authorities, in close cooperation with the Spanish, dealt a severe
 blow to the ETA by arresting three of its top leaders including its military chief.
 Close cooperation with the French continued throughout 1992 with the extradition
 in April of the highest ranking ETA leader ever to be returned from France to
 Spain. The Spanish government also dealt other individual blows to ETA such as
 Lhe arrest in June of an ETA commando in the region of Navarra and the May dis-
 ru ption of commando operations in the Guipuzoa and Vizcaya provinces.
 Violence from other groups such as GRAPO and Terra Lliure continued to de-
 crease throughout 1992; their attacks resulted mostly in material damage and light
 injuries and caused no deaths.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no claims that police or government security forces
 carried out secret arrests or kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Spanish law prohibits the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment. However, charges of abuse during detention continued to be levied by detain-
 ees. During the January and February crackdown on the ETA in Basque country,
 various police units arrested 37 persons who were subsequently charged with terror-
 ist-related crimes; 28 of the 37 filed complaints of abuse and torture by the police.
 According to a nongovernmental organization, all of the detainees were reportedly
 held incommunicado fqr varying periods of time up to 5 days under the antiterrorist
 legislation. Complainants said they were beaten, kicked, and hit with truncheons;
 one woman claimed she was sexually assaulted with objects. Judicial investigations
 were opened into the allegations.
 In April the High Court of Justice for Catalonia charged 16 prison officers and
 guards with ill-treatment after a 2-year judicial investigation into complaints stem-
 ming from a May 1990 incident at Modelo prison in Barcelona. The prosecutor al-
 leged that, in response to a disturbance at the prison, 17 prisoners were forced to
 run a gauntlet of guards who "deliberately and repeatedly" punched, kicked, and
 beat them with rubber truncheons.
 The death of an American citizen after fleeing police in the Canary Islands still
 has not been fully explained and remains under investigation by Spanish judicial
 authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more
 than 72 hours without a hearing. The Penal Code, as reformed in 1988, permits a
 suspected terrorist to be held an additional 2 days without a hearing. Exile is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial. This right is observed in practice. The judi-
 cial structure comprises territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal courts with
 the Supreme Tribunal at its apex. The Constitutional Tribunal has jurisdiction over
 constitutional issues. The European Court of Human Rights is the final arbiter in
 cases concerning human rights.
 Defendants have the right to be represented by an attorney-at state expense for
 the indigent. Also provided is the right to be released on bail unless the court has
 reason to believe that a suspect may flee or may constitute a serious threat to public
 safety. The law provides for an expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. Sus-
 pects may not be confined for more than 2 years before being brought to trial, unless
 a further delay is authorized by a judge. The period of pretrial custody may be ex-
 tended up to 6 years, at the judge's discretion. In practice, pretrial custody generally
 is less than 1 year. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail may face a
 
 
 wait of as long as 5 years before trial. Following conviction, defendants may appeal
 to the next higher court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the Crimi-
 nal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching pri-
 vate property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of the Interior to act
 before obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency." There were no complaints
 that the Minister abused this authority.
 In February the Spanish Parliament passed legislation intended to aid in the
 fight against narcotics trafficking and termrism which broadened police authority
 to search certain residences and detain citizens without a court order. The law was
 passed amidst strong criticism from opposition parties that it was unconstitutional.
 Certain provisions of the law are currently being challenged in the Constitutional
 Court.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for in the Constitution, and the Government scrupulously observes these provisions.
 Opposition viewpoints, both from political parties and other organizations, are freely
 aired and widely reflected in the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-As provided in the Constitu-
 tion, all groups have the right of free assembly and association for political or other
 purposes. This right is fully respected and freely practiced.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion in Spain. Roman Catholicism
 is the predominant religion, and the Catholic Church receives official funding. How-
 ever, other religions are represented and function with full freedom. Adherence to
 a particular faith neither enhances nor diminishes a person's status.
 In February 1990, the Government concluded landmark accords with federations
 of Spanish Jews and Protestants which ended a state of official discrimination
 against the two religions. The accords place Protestants and Jews on an equal legal
 footing with Catholics, except in the matter of financial support from the Govern-
 ment, which both faiths have renounced. Protestant and Jewish students now have
 the right to receive separate religious instruction in public schools as Catholics do.
 In April the Spanish Parliament passed legislation which reaffirms the legal equal-
 ity of all religions including the Muslim faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emiration, and Re-
 patriation--Spanish citizens have complete freedom to travel within and outside
 the country. The Government restricts neither emigration nor repatriation. The law
 on illegal aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40 days prior to expulsion
 but specifies that the detention may not take place in a prison-like setting. Spain
 has a liberal refugee law. Generally, the Government grants refugee status on the
 recommendation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote for Parliament as well as for provincial and
 local bodies. At all levels of government, elections must be held every 4 years. Elec-
 tions were held in May 1991 to elect mayors and municipal councils, as well as
 members of legislatures in 13 of Spain's 17 autonomous regions. Candidates are
 drawn from four major national parties, three major regional parties, and a number
 of minor parties. The next general elections must take place by the fall of 1993.
 Spanish politics contain an important regional element which is particularly
 strong in Catalonia and the Basque countr. These two "autonomous communities7
 support several regional parties that reflect the desires of many Basques and
 Catalans to give political expression to their own linguistic and cultural identities.
 These parties advocate a variety of views and provide a legitimate democratic alter-
 native to separatist groups that advocate achieving independence through terrorist
 violence.
 Participation of women in the political process continued to increase. However,
 under Spain's electoral system, the percentage of votes won determines the number
 of candidates elected from the party list; hence a candidate's place on the list is cru.
 cial in determining election. Since many women candidates have been placed in the
 lower half of the list, the number elected has never reached 25 percent. An increas.
 ing number of women occupy senior positions, such as at the assistant secretary
 level, in Spain's ministries.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Human Rights Association of Spain in Madrid has a well-earned reputation
 for independence and objectivity. The Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in Bar-
 celona ofers seminars on resolving human rights issues through the country's legal
 system. The Foreign Ministry, through an Office of Human Rights Affairs, takes an
 active interest in human rights issues internationally. The Government cooperates
 readily with international organizations (such as the European Commission for the
 Prevention of Torture) investigating allegations of human rights abuses and inter-
 national nongovernmental human rights groups, as well as with independent na-
 tional groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens, and an independent
 Ombudsman actively investigates complaints of human rights abuses by the au-
 thorities.
 During the past 17 years, Spanish women have achieved a greater degree of
 equality under the law, gained increased access to the educational system, and en-
 tered the work force in larger numbers. Nonetheless, traditional attitudes continue
 to result in discrimination.There is considerable regional variation in the extent of
 such discrimination. In 1991 the Women's Institute began to draft an update of the
 1988 plan for equality of opportunities for women that targets several areas of con-
 cern; a second plan is anticipated in early 1993. Although one-third more women
 (mainly those younger than 29 years of age) work outside the home than a decade
 ago, the incidence of such employment in Spain is still relatively low.
 Sexual abuse, violence, and harassment of women in the workplace continued to
 be areas of concern for the Government. In spite of unsympathetic attitudes of some
 police and judicial personnel, the number of reported cases continued to grow, pos-
 sibly indicating an increased awareness among Spanish women of their right to seek
 legal redress. In 1989 Parliament passed a law prohibiting verbal and physical har-
 assment in the workplace, but there were no cases tried under this law in 1992.
 Several levels of government provide a number of institutional remedies, such as
 shelters for battered women. The Government also is attempting through edu-
 cational programs to change public attitudes that contribute to violence against
 women. The Women's Institute has charged that some judges are reluctant to get
 involved in what they feel should remain a domestic problem. Similarly, in smaller
 towns some police officers have been reluctant to accept complaints from battered
 women. To deal with this problem, the Ministry of the Interior initiated a program
 in 1986 that created special sections within police departments to deal with violence
 against women, staffed by specially trained women officers. In 1992 the overall
 number of reports of rape continued to increase.
 Gypsies, a minority group representing 3 percent of the population, continued to
 suffer discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms exist by which
 Gypsies may seek redress, and the Government has stated its commitment to secur-
 ing equal rights and treatment for Gypsies. Cases of discrimination against Gypsies
 by local communities received wide press condemnation in October 1991, and in re-
 apnse, local authorities took positive action to bring peace to those communities.
 The local government in Madrid, for example, began a program in 1991 to relocate
 Gypsy families living in shacks on the outskirts of the capital to housing projects
 in established communities, and toughened enforcement of existing antidg laws
 to assuage fears that such relocations will increase drug-related crime. The program
 to relocate Gypsy families continued in 1992, although cultural differences with the
 communities where the Gypsies are to relocate makes the integration difficult.
 In 1992 Spain's human rights groups and media gave increasing attention to the
 question of human rights for the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa.
 The media criticized police authorities for their alleged mistreatment of northern
 and sub-Saharan Africans illegally in Spain, although there were no confirmed cases
 of abuse. Foreigners were subject to increasing discrimination. Antiforeign graffiti
 and "Stop Immigration" posters proliferated throughout Madrid. African immi-
 grants both Arabs and blacks, increasingly feared for their safety. Police arrested
 tour "a inheads" for the fatal assault on a Moroccan in a Madrid suburb.
 The windows of the principal club catering to immigrants from the Dominican Re-
 public were stoned. Dominican immigrants complained of longstanding and inten-
 sifying harassment by municipal police. When the Dominicans congregated regularly
 at a local plaza, and there were neighborhood complaints, police began frequent
 searches of their identity documents; tensions rose. On November 1, a crowd of
 about 100 Dominicans stoned police officers and their vehicles as they attempted to
 arrest 4 Dominican women who were apparently illegal aliens. On the night of No-
 
 
 915
 vember 13, four masked gunmen fired indiscriminately on a group of Dominicans
 living in an abandoned discotheque, killing one woman and seriously wounding a
 man. The use of military-style munitions caused speculation about the possible in-
 volvement of maverick security agents. An immediate top-priority investigation led
 to the arrest of an off-duty member of the Civil Guard, who was charged with the
 murder of the Dominican woman.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, mal.strates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing without previous authorization. The only requisites for organizing a union
 are the formation of a group of more than two workers and registration with the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Security, which is routinely granted. Spain has over
 200 registered trade unions. The only union presently in existence that is not legally
 registered is the Unified Trade Union of the Civil Guard, which the Constitutional
 Court ruled in 1986 could not b re istered as it purports to represent military per-
 sonnel barred from unionization by the Constitution.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their own representatives,
 determine their own policies, represent their members' interests, and strike. They
 are not restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political
 parties. A strike in nonessential services is legal when it fulfils the requirement
 of 5 days' prior notice. Strikes affecting essential services require 10 days prior no-
 tice and must respect legal minimum service requirements, which are negotiated be-
 tween the emplkyer and the unions. Strikes occur frequently in Spain, although
 most are of short duration. Initial 1992 data, including a May 28 nationwide strike,
 reveal the highest rate of working days lost to strikes since 1988.
 Spanish unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affili-
 ate with international bodies, and they do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively was established by statute in 1980. Trade union and collective
 bargaining rights were extended to all workers in the public sector, except the mili-
 tary services, in 1986. Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to
 include salaries and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to
 fix salary and employment levels if negotiations did not achieve an agreement. Col-
 lective bargaining is widespread in both the private and public sectors. Private sec-
 tor collective bargaining agreements cover 60 percent of workers, although only a
 minority are actually union members. Labor regulations and practices in free trade
 zones and export processing zones are the same as in the rest of the country. Union
 membership in these zones is reportedly higher than the average throughout the
 economy.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. A prominent multi-
 national company was fined heavily in 1991 for discriminating against union orga-
 nizers. One practice that the unions consider discriminatory is the use by employers
 of temporary employment contracts. About 32 percent of the work force is employed
 under this type of contract. The unions believe that employees engaging in union
 organizing under this type of contract are frequently not allowed to renew their con-
 tracts. Legislation adopted in 1990 has given trade unions a role in controlling work
 contracts to prevent abuse of contract and termination actions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is out-
 lawed in Spain and is not practiced. The legislation is effectively enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment as established by statute is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security is primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age is effectively
 enforced in major industries and in the service sector. It is more difficult to control
 on small farms and in family-owned businesses. Legislation prohibiting child labor
 is effectively enforced in the special economic zones (see Section 6.b.). The employ-
 ment of persons under 18 years of age at night, for overtime work, or in sectors con-
 sidered hazardous by the Ministry and the unions is also legally prohibited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for workers over age
 18 is considered sufficient for a decent standard of living. Minimum wages for those
 aged 16 and 17 are less. The minimum wage is revised every year in accordance
 with the consumer price index. A 40-hour workweek is established by law, with a
 minimum unbroken rest period of a day and half following each 40 hours worked.
 Spanish workers receive 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid vacation.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety conditions, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and inef-
 ficient. Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to European Coin-
 
 
 916
 munity directives. The National Institute of Safety and Health within the Ministry
 of Labor has technical responsibility for developing labor standards, but the
 Inspectorate of Labor has responsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial
 action when infractions are found. Workers have legal protection for filing com-
 plaints about hazardous conditions.
