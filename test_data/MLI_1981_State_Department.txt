 MALI
 Mali is a one party state. Political power is concentrated
 in the presidency, which is held by the head of the party.
 The year 1980 witnessed a retrenchment of the Malian leader-
 ship's attempts to restore full civilian control over the
 government and the inability of the single political party,
 the Democratic Union of the Malian People (UDPM), to mobilize
 broad-based political support for President Moussa Traore's
 regime. In 1981 there were some government efforts to resume
 the process. Elections to accomplish a "renewal" of all the
 organs of the single party, the Democratic Union of the
 Malian People (UDPM), were held at three successive local and
 regional levels, preparatory to a UDPM National Congress in
 early 1982. The UDPM has had little success in fostering
 grassroots support for, and identification with, the Traore
 regime.
 Disorder and dissent in the educational sector resulted in
 the closing of the two most important superior schools in
 the country for the academic year 1980-1981, and delayed
 opening of elementary and secondary schools.
 In an important conciliatory gesture, President Traore on
 July 10 granted pardons to all imprisoned or restricted
 teachers, and to all suspended students who were involved in
 the confrontation ketween the government and the educational
 system during the 1979-1981 period. Teachers who had been
 transferred to administrative duties were allowed to return
 to their teaching assignments, and those held in "preventive
 detention" were freed, including the adoptees of Amnesty
 International branches in the United States.
 On October 26, 1981, Mali ratified its adherence to the
 African Human Rights Charter.
 The government is committed to addressing the needs of the
 poor, but an unfavorable decline in the gross national pro-
 duct, corruption and poor management pose enormous obstacles
 to this policy.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution reaffirms the rights and liberties enunci-
 ated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1981,
 there were no new reports, such as were received in 1980, of
 detainees dying as the result of physical mistreatment,
 although some torture probably still exists at certain
 detention centers. Amnesty International in its 1981
 report cited instances where political prisoners were
 believed to have been tortured.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In 1980 there were credible accounts of harsh treatment of
 student dissidents, but there were no new reports in 1981.
 Amnesty International in its 1981 report says that prison
 officials in Bamako's central prison reportedly beat prisoners.

 Precise knowledge of prison conditions is limited, although
 conditions are known to be severe. Amnesty International's
 1981 report describes prison conditions in the first, third
 and fifth districts of Bamako as harsh, with very low hygienic
 and sanitation standards. Prisoners usually have access to
 family, friends, attorneys, and others, except when, as is
 frequent with political prisoners, they are confined in
 remote northern areas where the terrain acts as a maximum
 security environment. Malian law does not recognize the
 principle of habeas corpus or its equivalent. Persons
 awaiting trial are often detained for considerable periods,
 and sufficient funds for their food and upkeep have usually
 not been budgeted by the government. As a result, prison
 conditions are worse if a large number of detainees awaiting
 trial are on hand at a given time.
 c. Disappearances
 Although arrests are often unpublicized, there are no reports
 of instances of clandestine or unacknowledged incarceration or
 disappearance during 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There have been instances of arbitrary arrests and imprison-
 ment, traditionally in connection with 'political offenses."
 In 1981 dissident students and teachers were subject to
 such arrests. There have been instances of both limited and
 prolonged detention without formal charges or trials.
 The confrontation between students and the government during
 the 1979-1980, and 1980-1981 academic years resulted first in
 random arrests of dissidents and later in harsh crowd control
 methods, and culminated in mass arrests and in mistreatment of
 selected dissident leaders.
 In July 1981 the president pardoned all students and teachers
 involved in the confrontations, and all those detained or
 rusticated (exiled to rural areas) have been released.
 There are probably several dozen long-term political prisoners,
 most of whom also have been convicted on corruption charges
 following arrests for "political offenses.0   The number of
 prisoners is probably decreasing as those considered too old
 or too sick to pose a threat to the regime are released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Pretrial and trial proceedings conform, for the most part,
 to French practice. Pretrial proceedings are sometimes
 protracted, lasting up to a month and more. During deten-
 tion, defendants are made available to prosecuting and
 defense attorneys for prolonged questioning, and delays
 may also result from the institution of special courts.
 Trials, on the other hand, are often very short. The Septem-
 ber 1980 trial of 12 leaders of an unauthorized teachers'
 union was completed in one day, and trials for high government
 officials convicted of treason in 1978 were completed in two
 days. Amnesty International has expressed concern that trials
 for political offenses are often held *in camera." The
 appeals process generally results in the presentation of
 important verdicts to the president, who may issue pardons or
 call for a new trial.
 
 
 160
 The brief trials in early March 1981 of alleged participants
 in two recent coup attempts resulted in strong sentences for
 12 of the 14 accused in a late December 1980 coup, only one
 of the seven defendants from a mid-January attempt was con-
 victed. In all, three participants were sentenced to death--
 not carried out--and ten to hard labor at the Taoudenni Salt
 Mines.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Although the constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 home, house-to-house searches sometimes take place in the
 context of some specific political incident or when hoarding
 of scarce commodities is suspected. On a few occasions, the
 government has confiscated property to meet shortages in the
 public sector but has provided receipts for redemption when
 supplies are more plentiful.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The 1974 Malian constitution limits the role of opposition
 to the incumbent regime, or to the national political party,
 and grants substantial powers to the president. Organized
 political activity is permitted only under the auspices of
 the single political party, the UDPM, headed by the president.
 The party incorporates special organizations for women, youth
 and labor.
 Freedom of the press is not guaranteed by the constitution.
 The state controls all Malian media and does not permit any.
 direct criticism of its authority. Private publication of
 unauthorized opinions on political or economic policy quest-
 ions is not permitted and exposes authors, distributors and
 recipients to the possibility of arrest. Divergent views on
 government policy occasionally filter upward, but always with
 the risk of incurring official displeasure against those pro-
 moting such views. President Traore does, however, publicly
 encourage criticism of various government departments during
 his visits within Mali. Press coverage of the March 1981
 trials of alleged coup participants gave balanced treatment
 to defense denials as well as to prosecution claims, with
 more copy actually being devoted to the former.
 The labor movement is weak and controlled by the government.
 Although the constitution guarantees the right to strike and
 the right of all persons to organize and belong to unions or
 professional organizations of their choice, in practice this
 is not the case. Unions must be affiliated with the ruling
 party, and their officials must be acceptable to party
 leaders. Teachers again in 1981 were denied the opportunity
 to elect representatives and organize an independent union.
 Malians are free to assemble for religious and social pur-
 poses.  While the majority religion is Islam, Christian
 missionaries report that in recent years religious freedom
 has been more widespread than at any time in Malian history.
 Although the Baha'i sect is forbidden to propagate its
 views, its members and those of all other sects are free
 to practice their religion without hinderance.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Except for a ban on students' and teachers' travel during
 June through September 1980, freedom of movement in Mali
 has been generally unrestricted, although Malians must obtain
 exit visas to travel abroad. Intercity travelers are some-
 times subject to police checks, especially at nights these
 are allowed by law, ostensibly to restrict movement of
 contraband goods. There are no barriers to emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The only legal political party, the UDPM, is empowered by
 the constitution with wide-ranging powers. President Traore's
 role as secretary general of the party permits him to exercise
 direct control over many aspects of the new legislative system
 as well as over the party itself. The party, established in
 1979, is to function as the main vehicle for articulating the
 popular will but has yet to fulfill that role. There has been
 widespread dissatisfaction with the government's orchestration
 of the process of transition to constitutional and civilian
 rule. This has resulted in apathy and some cynicism about the
 President's commitment to democracy. In the 1979 municipal
 elections, however, the single-party slates proposed for
 several major towns were rejected by the voters, who proposed
 and elected slates more to their liking. The party's 1981
 local elections were wide open to party members and most posts
 were actively contested by many candidates. This reflected a
 desire to allow voters to weed out unpopular leaders.
 Women participate freely in the Malian political process and
 are represented at all levels of the government and the party.
 Women still must face, however, obstacles to political
 participation posed by their traditionally subordinate status.
 A woman cabinet minister (minister of information) was appointed
 late in 1980, there is a female member of the party's Central.
 Executive Bureau, and two female deputies in the 82-seat
 national assembly. The woman's auxiliary of the party, the
 National Union of Malian Women, has strong leadership and
 plays an active role in defending the rights of women.
 The Malian government denounces racism, especially in the
 international arena, but minority ethnic groups are still
 inadequately represented at the higher levels of their own
 region administrations. There are occasional reports of
 efforts to promote Tuareg separatism in the north, and the
 integration of Tuareg's and other nomadic minorities with
 Sahelian governments, including Mali, remains difficult as
 nomads seek to define their own roles within modern state
 structures.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There do not appear to be any currently outstanding requests
 for outside investigation of human rights conditions in
 Mali. Several teachers imprisoned in 19b0 for trade union
 activities were the subject of inquiries by Amnesty Interna-
 tional. They were released in 1981. Amnesty International
 reports a meeting held between President Traore and its
 representatives in Paris on April 17, 1980 during which
 Amnesty International's concerns were discussed. In March
 1981 Amnesty International representatives met with Foreign
 Minister Beye to express concern that torture end and the
 government improve prison conditions.

 4*. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Malis government remains committed to the goal of economic
 development and a better quality of life, and its policies
 are officially focussed on responding to the needs of the
 poor. However, its plans for economic development are
 severely limited by a lack of natural resources and govern-
 ment mismanagement of the economy. The general trend of
 real per capita GNP has drifted downward in the 20-year
 period since independence. Poverty is widespread and all-
 pervasive.
 The steady deterioration in the economic situation of the
 general population can be contrasted with the enrichment
 of certain government officials by corrupt means. President
 Traore has sought publicly to reduce corruption through
 frequent warnings and periodic disciplining of some govern-
 ment officials. Nonetheless, corruption remains a pervasive
 and persistent problem.
 Economic development programs are aimed at improving the
 lives of the country's overwhelmingly rural agricultural and
 nomadic population. Bamako's rapidly increasing indigent
 population, often unemployed and the victim of drought-
 induced dislocation, continues to be the subject of intense
 concern. The population growth rate was 2.6 percent from
 1970-1979, and the total fertility rate was 6.7 percent. The
 percentage of the population below the absolute poverty
 level is approximately 27 percent for urban dwellers and 48
 percent for rural inhabitants. These figures are significant-
 ly lower than those for the .reference group of low income
 Africa south of the Sahara, where 39.7 percent of the urban.
 population and 68.8 percent of the rural population is
 below the absolute poverty level.
 Mali's well-defined family responsibilities play an important
 role in supplying a buffer for many Malians against unemploy-
 ment, deprivation and old age. Through the extended family,
 these responsibilities cover other Malians who, although not
 part of the family, serve in a retainer status and are, in
 turn, extended assistance.
 Access to health care depends on proximity to the larger
 towns; a public health mechanism is provided for salaried
 government employees, but most people receive little or no
 health care. The government has stated its commitment to
 provide health care at the village level and has encouraged
 several donor-supported projects with this aim.
 Life expectancy at birth has increased in the past 10 years
 from 37 years in 1968 to 42 years in 1978. The infant
 mortality rate in 1970 was 190 deaths per 1,000 live births.
 Mali suffered from severe drought in the mid-1970's. The
 percentage of calorie supply available for consumption was
 90 percent of nutritional requirements in 1977, down from 94
 percent in 1970. According to the most recent estimate,
 approximately nine percent of the population has access
 to safe water, this includes 42 percent of the urban
 population and three percent of the rural population.
 According to the constitution, a free education is a right
 of all Malians. The percentage of the budget devoted to
 education has risen to an estimated three percent in 1962 to
 30 percent this year.
 The adult literacy rate was estimated at 10 percent in
 1975. The most recent adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio was 20 percent, with 36 percent of boys and 20 percent
 girls listed as attending. The government announced that
 the 1981-1982 educational enrollment was 300,000 elementary
 students, 20,000 secondary students, and 5,000 higher educat-
 ion students.
