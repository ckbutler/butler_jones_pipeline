 ANGOLA
 Throughout 1993 the Government of the Republic of Angola and the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) remained embroiled in a bru-
 tal civil war. A partial cease-fire took hold during October, permitting the delivery
 of food and medical supplies to some interior towns. Twice during the year the Gov-
 ernment and UNITA initiated negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations
 (U.N.); at year's end these negotiations were continuing. UNITA, led by Jonas
 Savimbi, claimed that the governin party, the Popular Movement for the Libera-
 tion of Angola (MPLA), led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, engaged in mas-
 sive fraud during the multiparty presidential elections in September 1992, with the
 result that the U TA candidate, Savimbi, was deprived of victory. The United Na-
 tions did not accept the UNITA allegation and declared the elections generally free
 and fair.
 Setting the stage for the renewed fighting in 1993 was the failure to complete,
 prior to the September 1992 elections, the demobilization process and the formation
 of the new national army called for in the 1991 Bicesse Peace Accords. While gov-
 ernment military forces demobilized quickly in the expectation of a lasting peace,
 UNITA elements remained prepared for rapid mobilization and had access to arms
 never surrendered during the demobilization process. As a result, UNITA forces
 were able to occupy large parts of the country with little effective opposition by the
 Government. Attempts to counter UNITA advances required the Government vir-
 tually to recreate and rearm its military organization. In the interim the Govern-
 ment relied heavily on its antiriot plice and arming the urban populace for combat
 roles. The result has been a bloody and inconclusive war. Through most of 1993,
 UNITA controlled most of the national territory, including the diamond mines of
 Lunda Norte province, which it used to finance its operations.
 The majority of the population lived in or migrated to the parts of the country
 that remained in government hands.
 Angola has great economic potential with extensive petroleum and diamond re-
 serves, rich agricultural land, and hydroelectric potential, but faces severe macro-
 economic distortions resulting from the war and misguided economic policy. Terri-
 tory under government control suffered from hyperinflation, scarcity of consumer
 goods, massive unemployment and underemployment, and continuing pervasive cor-
 ruption in 1993. Subsistence agriculture, traditionally the main source of income for
 the majority of Angola's approximately 10 million citizens, was severely affected by
 war-related damage, including heavy use of land mines by both the Government and
 UNITA.
 Human rights in Angola deteriorated in 1993 in the face of heightened civil war
 brutalities and the absence of government and UNITA actions to curb egregious vio-
 lations of humanitarian law. Media, eyewitness, and international community re-
 ports indicated that UNITA forces, government military, and internal security forces
 flagrantly disregarded fundamental humanitarian values in their treatment of pris-
 oners of war, their extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians, including women, chil-
 dren and the elderly, and their impediments to delivery of humanitarian assistance
 to civilians in dire need.
 The Government detained prisoners accused of political and other crimes for inde-
 terminate periods of time under inhumane conditions and without due process of
 law, according to a persuasive report published by the Human Rights Subcommittee
 of the National Assembly. UNITA held foreign hostages in Jamba, Huambo and
 other areas under its control. The media published credible allegations of UNqITA
 "ethnic cleansing" in Uige Province bordering Zaire. There were substantiated re-
 ports of government reprisals against Zairians resident in Luanda suburbs, as well
 as "cleansing" during military operations.
 
 
 Despite the overall deterioriation in the human rights situation, there were a few
 isolated improvements. Throughout the year the Government continued to release
 political prisoners. The Government permitted the International Committee of the
 ed Cross (ICRC) to visit LJNITA prisoners in all but one facility. The electronic and
 print media were increasingly free to criticize human rights infractions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and other Extrajudicial Killing.-Journalists credibly reported that
 government forces brutally interrogated and killed suspected UNITA sympathizers
 in Benguela Province. Eyewitnesses reported that police in Huila Province killed un-
 armed civilians indiscriminately. In a wave of violence in January, police and armed
 civilians targeted suspected UNITA supporters who "disappeared" or were killed. As
 the war continued, common criminal violence-became indistinguishable from politi-
 cal violence. Fighting between members of the military and police and among mili-
 tary, police, and bandits in a large open air market on the outskirts of Luanda regu-
 larly resulted in fatalities.
 Media and eyewitness reports noted that UNITA forces ambushed a civilian train
 in Huila Province in May, resulting in a large number of casualties. The first 140
 victims, mainly women and young children, were buried in a mass grave at the site
 of the attack. Many more died en route to or at the hospital in Lubango. In August
 UNITA soldiers attacked three trucks that had left a World Food Program humani-
 tarian relief convoy and killed three truckers. Subsequently, a policeman was killed
 as he examined the booby-trapped corpse of one of the truckers. The following
 month eyewitnesses reported that UNITA forces killed and disemboweled unarmed
 civilians in Bengo Province.
 b. Disappearance.-Both government and UNITA officials reported incidents of
 abduction and disappearance. The Government accused UNITA of abducting and
 killing civilians.
 A considerable number of UNITA adherents remained missing from January con-
 flicts in Huila and Namibe Provinces. The ICRC indicated that despite government
 cooperation, efforts to trace the missing failed because UNITA discouraged family
 members from revealing information to the ICRC. The bodies of some of the missing
 were reportedly burned.
 In 1993 the Government allowed the ICRC to visit all UNITA prisoners through-
 out the country with the exception of the 19 people held in the "Laboratorio" in
 Luanda from mid-March to mid-May. The Laboratorio was known as the Ministry
 of Interior's high-security interrogation facility where torture was allegedly used.
 The Government, with financial support from international nongovernmental or-
 ganizations, employed the mass media and provincial government resources to
 search for family members of orphans and abandoned children.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government and the National Assembly Subcommittee on Human Rights ac-
 knowledged that conditions in Angola's prisons were inhuman. Many prisons, lack-
 ing financial support from the Government, are unable to supply prisoners with food
 and medicine, and prisoners are thus forced to depend on international relief organi-
 zations and their families and friends. The Government allowed subcommittee per-
 sonnel, as well as the ICRC, access to all prisons except the Laboratorio in Luanda.
 According to credible reports government personnel tortured detainees at the
 Laboratorio, holding them incommunicado for months with a daily ration of two
 spoons of rice and one half liter of dirty water. If interrogators were not satisfied
 with the information they were being given, detainees were taken unclothed to a
 cement cell, approximately the size of a large telephone booth with no windows, and
 for 10 minutes at a time subjected to electnc shocks. Reportedly, at the end of these
 sessions they could not see, stand, or walk unassisted for several hours. There were
 credible eyewitness reports of the debilitated physical and mental condition of
 UNITA members upon their release from that facility.
 In January there were credible reports that UITA forces in Uige mutilated un-
 armed civilians.
 In March accounts emerged, reinforced by a video tape, of an incident at Huambo
 where government forces were accused of using a shield of women and children hos-
 tages to cover their retreat. Government sources claim that the women and children
 accompanying the government forces had sought their protection.
 In September first-hand media accounts reported that government forces in
 Benguela Province beat and shot UNITA prisoners in the legs and feet so that they
 would not run away.
 
 
 Also, in September Portuguese television alleged that armed elements of a faction
 of the Enclave of Cabinda Liberation Front (FLEC), a separatist group in Cabinda
 Province, had cut off ears, noses, and lips of unarmed civilians.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1993 the Government mandated the
 transfer of the judicial process and prison system portfolios from the Interior Min-
 istry to the Justice Ministry, but the law was not scheduled to be implemented until
 1994. During 1993 the Interior Ministry systematically, arbitrarily, and secretly de-
 tained individuals for all categories of crime, without trial, for indeterminate periods
 of time. Detainees had no rights. Persons detained in the Laboratorio were held in-
 communicado.
 In January the ICRC reported that there were 1,100 known UNITA sympathizers
 under government detention in Luanda. They had all been released by the end of
 the year and reintegrated into Angolan society.
 At mid-year UNTA held 287 known prisoners in the north; no statistics were
 available for late in the year. Throughout the first half of 1993, UNITA prevented
 the evacuation from Huambo and other UNITA-held areas of more than 400 foreign-
 ers trapped by renewed fighting. These hostages had all been released by year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In October 1991, the Code for Penal Process was
 amended to bring Angola's judicial system in line with international norms; it guar-
 antees a public trial, establishes a system of bail, and recognizes the accused's right
 to counsel and to testify.
 The court system is comprised of municipal and provincial courts (the latter under
 the authority of the Ministry of Justice) of original jurisdiction and a Supreme Court
 at the appellate level. Although the 1992 Law on Constitutional Revision speaks of
 an independent judiciary, as does the 1991 amended Constitution, the President of
 the Republic appoints the Supreme Court judges (for life terms), and no National
 Assembly confirmation is required. Despite legal safeguards provided by law, signifi-
 cant shortcomings in the administration of justice persisted in 1993 and the Interior
 Ministry frequently did not respect due process of law in its arrest and detention
 procedures.
 Municipal courts normally deal with summary cases on a daily basis. Judges are
 normally respected laymen, not licensed lawyers. Provincial courts, under the au-
 thority of the Ministry of Justice are located in the 18 provincial capitals. Judges
 are nominated by the Supreme dourt and attorneys general by the Attorney Gen-
 eral of the Republic. Cases are divided into four categories: criminal, civil and ad-
 ministrative, family, and labor.
 The judge and two laymen selected by the court are to act as jury. Normally cases
 are dispatched by a court within 3 months. The verdict is to be pronounced the day
 following the conclusion of the trial, in the presence of the defendant.
 The Supreme Court has a total of 16 judges, all of whom are appointed by the
 President of the Republic upon recommendation by the Association of Magistrates.
 In 1993 only 9 of the 16 positions were filled. Cases are divided into two categories:
 criminal, and civil and administrative.
 A person caught in the act of a crime can be arrested and detained immediately.
 Otherwise, arrests are supposed to be made openly, with a warrant signed by a
 judge or a provincial attorney general. Following arrest, the attorney general is sup-
 posed to release to the public the grounds for arrest before forwarding a case for
 trail. The prosecuting attorney and defense attorney have a maximum of 90 days
 to prepare a case. Detainees are to be allowed prompt access to family members and
 a lawyer.
 In 1993 the Interior Ministry failed to respect due process of law in its arrest and
 detention procedures. Although the 1992 Law on Constitutional Revision calls for
 an independent judiciary and a constitutional tribunal this tribunal has not yet
 been established. Both the Ministry of Justice and the National Assembly called for
 modernizing laws and enshrining basic legal rights, but practice has not yet caught
 up with these intentions.
 There is no evidence that UNITA has set up a judicial system responsive to inter-
 national judicial norms.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no known specific complaints about arbitrary interference with privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence. However, it was widely thought that the Government con-
 tinued surveillance of certain categories of people, such as the UNITA National As-
 sembly deputies.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-UNITA forces continued to attack and capture municipalities throughout the
 country in 1993, destroying infrastructure, including dams, bridges, electrical py-
 lons, orphanages, schools, hospitals, and medical facilities.
 
 
 In January the oil town of Soyo changed hands several times but ultimately fell
 under UNITA's control. In March UNITA, after 55 days of siege, expelled govern-
 ment forces from Huambo, Angola's second largest city. The death toll in this battle
 was estimated at 15,000, mostly civilians. Government forces were able to retake
 much of Benguela, Huila and Bengo Provinces in August.
 There were credible allegations that both the Government and UNITA engaged
 in indiscriminate killing of civilians and summary executions of prisoners of war.
 Both sides impeded provision of emergency relief supplies and assistance by the
 ICRC, nongovernmental voluntary organizations, and United Nations agencies. In
 UNITA-held Huambo, CARE International officials, visiting in June, described
 looting of supplies and confiscation of equipment by UNITA officials. In March
 UNITA sacke    an orphanage outside Luanda. In August UNITA attacked a World
 Food Program convoy. As many as 30,000 people died during UNITA's siege of the
 city of Cuito, including 30 to 40 children each day who died of malnutrition. UNITA
 allowed only Portuguese and other foreigners to leave Cuito in September, and con-
 tinued to prevent local residents from fleeing.
 More than 20,000 Angolans have suffered amputation due to land mines. Credible
 sources including eyewitnesses reported that both sides conscripted young teenagers
 into military service (see also Section 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Angola's 1991 Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, which was largely respected in 1993. Although the Government con-
 tinues to own the press, there were editorials, articles, and cartoons critical of the
 Government's prosecution of the war and its failure to respond to Angola's worsen-
 ing  economic   and  social crises. Opinions of political opposition    leaders,
 businesseople, and National Assembly deputies critical of the Government on is-
 sues such as human rights also routinely appeared on national radio and television.
 Foreign journalists register with the Government Press Center for access to offi-
 cials and are permitted travel within Angola, although at times the conflict made
 this difficult. Both the Government and UNITA invited journalists to planned press
 events and to visit areas under their control.
 The Angolan Journalists Union (SJA) alleged in 1993 that the Government contin-
 ued to restrict press freedom, including access to controversial public figures. The
 SJA also accused the Government of blocking its attempts to gain information on
 the murder of two Angolan journalists in Lobito in May. The results of the police
 investigation had not been made public at year's end.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution guarantees
 the right of peaceful assembly and association, provided a 3-day notice is given to
 the authorities. In 1993, however, the war, increased violent crime, and a precarious
 security situation in urban areas discouraged normal civic assembly and association
 activities. There were no known violations of the right of assembly by the authori-
 ties.
 Regulations allow the Government to deny required registration to private asso-
 ciations on security grounds. There were no known instances of such denials in
 1993.
 UNITA did not tolerate traditional assembly and association in areas under its
 control.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Religion plays an important role in Angolan society; some
 85 percent of the population is either Roman Catholic or Protestant; the rest is
 animist. There is separation of church and state. Freedom of religion is provided for
 in the Constitution and is accorded in practice. All religious sects are welcome in
 Angola, and links may be maintained with coreligionists in other countries.
 . Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The civil war inhibited freedom of movement within the country. How-
 ever, according to U.N. statistics, over a million people escaped to government-con-
 trolled territory from the interior just ahead of UNITA's advancing troops. At the
 end of 1993, there were reportedly 2 million displaced pqrsons who had fled from
 warfare in the countryside. However, wartime conditions prevented physical access
 to many areas of the country by humanitarian organizations and a precise number
 of persons severely affected by the war remained unavailable.
 Citizens have the right to change residence and workplace, but the scarcity of
 habitable dwellings as well as the massive unemployment and underemployment ef-
 fectively impeded most voluntary changes.
 The Government denied permission to travel abroad to UNITA National Assembly
 deputies following the defection of the first two well-known UNITA personalities
 who were authorized to depart Angola. The Government made it difficult for other
 opposition party members to travel abroad during legislative recess by limiting their
 
 
 5
 access to requisite foreign exchange. MPLA deputies had access to foreign exchange
 at favorable rates.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Angolan people for the first time exercised their constitutional right to change
 their government through peaceful means in the October 1992 presidential elec-
 tions. The 17-year civil war resumed in late October 1992 when UNITA rejected the
 election results. A second round of presidential elections was postponed indefinitely.
 The resumption of the war slowed the democratization process significantly. Con-
 sequently, and despite the elections, governmental power remained in the hands of
 a small MP LA elite.
 Guidelines for local government elections, scheduled to take place 2 years after
 democratic presidential and legislative elections, were elaborated and placed before
 the Council of Ministers. However, the Council did not act on the guidelines because
 of the war.
 The National Assembly consists of 130 deputies elected on a national basis and
 90 elected to represent the provinces. The MPLA-dominated Assembly was active
 during 1993, convoking members of the Government publicly to explain policies on
 a wide range of issues, including human rights and the economy. The Assembly
 passed, and the President promulgated, laws on human rights, the judicial system,
 military service, ethics and conduct of Assembly deputies, and national defense.
 Women occupied 32 of the 220 National Assembly seats. One of the nine Supreme
 Court judges is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Because UNITA controlled most of Angola's national territory, the Government
 had little influence on investigations of human rights abuses in most of the country.
 There were no functioning Angolan nongovernmental human rights associations
 or groups. The two national human rights groups, the Angolan Human Rights Nu-
 cleus and the Angolan Human Rights Association, were inactive in 1993 due to inex-
 perienced leadership and financial difficulties.
 A newly established Human Rights Subcommittee in the MPLA-dominated Par-
 liament was active. Representatives from 11 opposition parties participated in Na-
 tional Assembly debate. The Attorney General and Justice Minister were called to
 testify before the National Assembly eight times on human rights issues.
 The Government allowed the ICRC and members of the Human Rights Sub-
 committee of the National Assembly to visit all political prisoners and prisons with
 the exception of those held in the Laboratorio in Luanda. At the conclusion of the
 Assembly's first session, the Subcommittee published a report critical of the Govern-
 ment, noting that there were laws to protect human rights but no mechanisms to
 enforce the laws. It also noted the abysmal condition of the prisons and the lack
 of due process.
 UNITA did not allow international organizations access to most of the territory
 under its control. Among the few exceptions were Lutheran World Federation activi-
 ties in Cazombo (Moxico province) and the Lundas; UNHCR activities in Uige- and
 Medecins Sans Frontieres in Uige and Huambo. UIDTA cooperated with the iCRC
 regarding visitation of prisoners and hostages in Huambo and in the evacuation of
 415 foreigners from  NITA-held territory. However, UNITA's confrontational rela-
 tionship with international organizations was further tarnished by shooting inci-
 dents at M'Banza Congo, Uige, and Luena, when UNITA fired on clearly marked,
 unarmed humanitarian assistance aircraft. The incident in Luena resulted in one
 death.
 The Government permitted relatively unrestricted access to UNITA-besieged
 cities, spent considerable sums on airdrops of food to the city of Cuito, and sub-
 sidized the international humanitarian assistance effort throughout Angola by pro-
 viding extremely cheap fuel. However, the Government steadfastly blocked attempts
 by international organizations to provide humanitarian assistance to Huambo.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Angolan law stipulates that all citizens are equal regardless of race, ethnic origin,
 sex, religion or, social status. The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Commit-
 tee of Experts has noted that this law omits reference to political opinion. Angola
 is a multiracial society, and in practice there was little evidence of official discrimi-
 nation.
 Women.-Women held senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical
 field), civil service, and political parties. The media occasionally addressed women's
 
 
 issues. The law proclaims equal pay for equal work, but in practice women were not
 compensated equally. Adult women can open a bank account, accept employment,
 and own property without interference from their spouse.
 Little information was available on the extent of violence against women, but it
 is believed to be widespread. The number of assault cases brought by women to
 courts appeared to be increasing. In many besieged cities, women swelled the ranks
 of the handicapped because when they foraged in the fields in search for food to feed
 their family, they often set off land mines. Due to dire economic circumstances, in-
 creasing numbers of women engage in prostitution. The clergy reports that mar-
 riages are breaking down at an alarming rate.
 Children.-The growing presence of street children in Luanda and other cities in-
 dicates a breakdown in Angola's family institutions caused by the war and the dete-
 riorating economy. Young females were accepted into private homes to become do-
 mestics while young males roamed the market places and streets. The living condi-
 tions in government youth hostels were so inhuman the dispossessed chose to sleep
 on city streets. There were no active private children's rights advocacy groups. The
 government-sponsored National Institute for Children was viewed as an MPLA
 organ and was inadequate to address the magnitude of the problem.
 The extent to which female genital mutilation is practiced cannot be verified.
 However, medical authorities say that it may have occurred in limited fashion in
 remote areas of Moxico province, bordering Zaire and Zambia.
 Indigenous People.-Angola's population includes 1 to 2 percent of pre-Bantu stock
 indigenous peoples. Mostly hunters and gatherers, these Khoisan and other linguis-
 tic groups are scattered throughout the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and
 Cuando Cubango. There was no evidence that they suffered from official discrimina-
 tion or harassment, but they do not participate actively in the political or economic
 life of the country and their ability to influence government decisions concerning
 their interests is marginal at best.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The long civil conflict has deep ethnic and
 urban versus rural roots. The MPLA is heavily supported by the Mbundu ethnic
 group, which makes up an estimated 25 percent of the population, and by many city
 dwellers, notably in Luanda. It also has strong backing among the small number
 of white and mixed-race Angolans who occupy technical and governmental positions.
 Election results indicated a high level of support among other ethnic groups apart
 from the Ovimbundu. UNITA has its principal backing among the country's largest
 single ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, who make up an estimated 37 percent of the
 population and are concentrated in the central and southern parts of Angola. The
 Government continued to claim that inflammatory UNITA rhetoric exacerbated eth-
 nic tensions by dwelling on the perceived colonial ties of white and mixed-race Ango-
 lans.
 Foreigners resident in Angola were not immune to deadly violence. In January
 mobs in Luanda, angered by allegations that Zaire was helping UNITA, went on a
 rampage of rape, lynching, and arson against Zaireans and others thought to be
 Zairians. As many as 60 persons perished.
 People with Disabilities.-There are many physically disabled individuals
 throughout Angola, the majority of whom are casualties of land mines and other
 war-related injuries. While there was no obvious discrimination against them, the
 Government did little to ameliorate their physical, financial, or social distress. Phys-
 ical access for the disabled to public buildings is not mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution recognizes the right of Ango-
 lans to form trade unions and to bargain collectively. However, the law governing
 unions has yet to be passed.
 Organized labor is concentrated in the cities. There is no organized labor in agri-
 culture, traditionally the main source of income for the majority of Angolans.
 The National Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA), the official labor union of the
 ruling MPLA, remained the principal workers' organization. Two other groups with-
 out affiliation to a political party, the National Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 of Angola and the Democratic Confederation of Angolan Workers, waited in the
 wings for peace and the new labor union law. The war, the Government's mis-
 management of the economy, and the lack of necessary legislation effectively stifled
 these two organizations. The Union of Angolan Journalists, formed in 1992, was ac-
 tive, respected, and was not harassed by the Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike. Legislation passed in 1991 pro-
 vides the legal framework to strike. The law prohibits lockouts and worker occupa-
 tion of places of employment, and provides protection for nonstriking workers.
 
 
 Strikes by military and police personnel, prison workers, and firemen are prohib-
 ited.
 There were strikes against the Government in 1993 by private fishermen obliged
 to register at the Ministry of Fisheries, and by employees of the state-owned cement
 factory. Settlements of strikes were negotiated expeditiously.
 Laws which allow free labor organizations to affiliate with international labor
 bodies have not been enacted. UNTA, the MPLA labor union, is affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the formerly Soviet-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The new Angolan free trade union federations expect
 to apply for membership in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 as soon as relevant domestic legislation is enacted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Angolan workers have the
 constitutional right to organize and bargain collectively; discrimination against
 union members is prohibited.
 However, in 1993 the Ministry of Labor and Social Security continued to set
 wages and benefits on an annual basis. Salaries for public servants were set at the
 Minister's discretion; salaries of employees of state-owned enterprises were based on
 profits of the previous year and available loans from the National Bank. Loans were
 predicated on profit margins and on the percentage of government ownership. In
 Angola's small private sector, wages are based on multiples of the minimum salary
 set by the Government.
 Angola has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government indicated that in
 mid-1994 it would introduce legislation to prohibit forced labor, reversing laws and
 provisions which had been cited by the ILO for violations of its Convention No. 105.
 The outdated legislation authorizes forced labor for breaches of worker discipline
 and participation in strikes.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14. The Inspector General of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 enforcing labor laws. The Labor Ministry maintains employment centers where pro-
 spective employees register. These centers screen out applicants under the age of
 14. However, children at a much younger age work on family farms and in the infor-
 mal economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1993 the Council of Ministers approved a
 minimum salary for laborers equivalent to $7 per month (by the end of the year
 reduced to $2 by hyperinflation) and for civil servants a minimum salary equivalent
 to $137 per month (reduced to $40).
 The minimum salary was insufficient to support a worker and family. Accord-
 ingly, most workers depended on the thriving informal sector, second jobs at night,
 subsistence farming where security permits, theft, corruption, or remittances from
 abroad to maintain an acceptable standard of living. The normal workweek, estab-
 lished by a 1982 government decree is 44 hours. No information was available on
 d   acy of work conditions or healtih standards, but it was assumed they were gen-
 erally low, given the extreme underdevelopment of the Angolan economy, lack ofen-
 forcement mechanisms, and the war.
