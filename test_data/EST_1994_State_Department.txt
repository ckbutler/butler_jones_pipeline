 ESTONIA
 Estonia, a parliamentary democracy, regained its independence in 1991 after more
 than 50 years of forced annexation by the Soviet Union. The Constitution, adopted
 by referendum in 1992, established a 101-member unicameral legislature (State As-
 sembly) a Prime Minister as Head of Government, and a President as Head of
 State. Free and fair elections were held in 1992 for the State Assembly and the
 President. After more than 2 years of negotiations, on August 31 the armed forces
 of the Russian Federation withdrew from Estonia, although a number of demobi-
 lized Russian officers remain in Estonia.
 Official conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the rees-
 tablishment of the country's independence by about 6 months. However, conversion
 of the police into a Western-type force committed to procedures and safeguards ap-
 propriate to a democratic society is proceeding slowly. The police, ethnically mixed
 and subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, continue to commit human
 rights abuses. The security service, called security police, is also subordinate to the
 same Ministry.
 Estonia has a balanced economy, emphasizing light industrial products and food
 production. It has substantially transformed the centrally planned economy it inher-
 ited into an open market system. Small- and medium-scale  rivatization is moving
 toward completion, and large-scale privatization prorssed significantly in 1994.
 Gross domestic product grew by about 5 percent, and approximately two-thirds of
 Estonian exports (textiles, food products, metals) are now directed to Western mar-
 kets. Unemployment remained low (unofficially about 8 percent), but significantly
 higher rates exist in the predominantly ethnic Russian northeast and in rural areas.
 The major human rights abuse continues to be police mistreatment, including
 physical and psychological abuse, of detainees and prisoners. The substantiai
 noncitizen population, primarily ethnic Russians, is about 28 percent of the total
 population. Treatment of noncitizens continued to be a major issue domestically and
 bilaterally with Russia. The Government extended the deadline for submission of
 residence permit applications for noncitizens established by the 1993 Law on Aliens
 by 1 year because of implementation difficulties. In addition, officials began issuing
 temporary travel documents to eligible noncitizens to enable their departure from
 and return to Estonia. Both the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCE) mission to Estonia, established in 1993 and the CSCE High Commissioner
 on National Minorities declared that they could find no pattern of human rights
 abuses in Estonia. However, both did regard the language requirement, as adminis-
 tered, a hardship for noncitizens. Ethnic-Russians remained concerned about the ap-
 plication of Estonian-language proficiency requirements in seeking employment and
 naturalization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such killing
 in 1994.
 Although the numbers declined, there continued to be reports that prisoners killed
 other prisoners. The State Prosecutor's office reported that prisoners in 1992 had
 killed 32 other persons in custody; in 1993, 11; and, during the first 9 months of
 1994, 2. The State Prosecutor's office investigated all such cases and prosecuted
 when there was sufficient evidence. It obtained 5 convictions in the 1992 cases, with
 2 cases still in court and one finding of self-defense; it also obtained 2 convictions
 in the 1993 cases and I in the 1994 cases.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, but police continued to subject detainees and pris-
 oners to harsh treatment, including physical and psychological abuse and detention
 under overcrowded and extremely unhaealthful conditions. Credible reports of the ex-
 cessive use of force and police brutality during the arrest and questioning of sus-
 pects also continued. In one case, six police officers were convicted of beating detain-
 ees, and given sentences ranging from 30 months to a fine. Another case is still
 pending.
 
 
 The conditions of severe overcrowding and idleness, particularly at the Tallinn
 pretrial detention prison built in 1765, did not change. However, work began on re-
 modeling two buildings which should significantly reduce overcrowding at the
 Tallinn prison. At the invitation of the Ministry of Justice, experts from the Council
 of Europe (COE) studied Estonian prison conditions and made numerous general
 and specific recommendations, some of which were implemented.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, and exile. There were no known instances of Estonian au-
 thorities engaging in such activities. Under the Constitution, a judicial warrant is
 required for an arrest. Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds for ar-
 rest and given immediate access to legal counsel If a person cannot afford a lawyer,
 the State will provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally
 being charged; further detention requires a court order. A person may be held in
 pretrial detention for 2 months; a court order may prolong detention up to a total
 of 12 months. Police rarely violate these limits. Pretrial detainees account for about
 20 percent of the total prison population.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 2Wl.-The Constitution establishes an independent judi-
 cial branch operating through a three-tier court system: rural and city courts, dis-
 trict courts, and a supreme State Court. The district courts and the State Court are
 also courts of "constitutional supervision." At the rural and city level, court decisions
 are made by majority vote with a judge and two lay assessors sitting in judgment.
 Judges and lay assessors must be Estonian citizens. The President nominates and
 the State Assembly confirms the Chief Justice of the State Court. The Chief Justice
 nominates State Court judges who are subject to confirmation by the State Assem-
 bly. He also nominates the rural, city and district judges, whom the President then
 appoints. All judges hold office until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 65.
 The Constitution provides that court proceedings shall be open to the public.
 Courts may hold closed sessions, but only in cases in which state or business secrets
 need to be protected or in cases concerning minors. It further provides that defend-
 ants may present witnesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine
 prosecution witnesses. Defendants have access to prosecution evidence and enjoy a
 presumption of innocence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 Criminal Code which went into effect in 1992 basically revised the Soviet criminal
 code, eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. New codes were being
 drafted at year's end.
 There were no political prisoners being held.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Esto-
 nian law requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. Prosecutors,
 rather than judges, issue such warrants during the investigative stage upon a show-
 ing of probable cause. Once a case has gone to trial, however, judges then issue
 search and seizure warrants.
 The Constitution guarantees secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other
 means of communication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's
 communications. Illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech
 and press are generally respected, and the media are beginning to do more inves-
 tigative reporting. Foreign newspapers and magazines are readily available. Al-
 though the Government still provides most newsprint and printing and distribution
 facilities, the role of private companies is growing rapidly. There are five major na-
 tional Estonian-language and three Russian-language dailies.
 State broadcast media, including one nationwide television channel, continue to
 receive large subsidies, but there are several independent television and radio sta-
 tions. The Government has stopped retransmission of television channels from Rus-
 sia owing to nonpayment of fees, but several Russian-language programs, mostly Es-
 tonian produced, are broadcast over state and private television channels. State-
 funded Russian-language radio broadcasts continued, substantially subsidized by
 funds from the state budget; the State has assured that these subsidies will con-
 tinue.
 There is complete academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoclation.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely but prohibits noncitizens from joining political parties,
 although they may form social groups. Permits for all public gatherings must be ob-
 tained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have wide discre-
 tion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom exercise it.
 
 
 804
 There were no reports of government interference with mass gatherings or political
 rallies.
 c. Freedom of Re! *gon-Freedom of conscience and of religious proselytism is pro-
 vided for by law and honored in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. It also guarantees the right of foreign travel, emigration, and repatri-
 ation for Estonian citizens.
 In July 1993, Parliament enacted the Law on Aliens which defines an alien as
 a person who is not a citizen of Estonia, i.e., a citizen of another country or a state-
 less person. The majority of noncitizens are ethnic Russians (see Section 5). The
 Law on Aliens originally provided a 1-year period in which noncitizens who came
 to reside in Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, and who had permanent registration in
 the former Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, could apply for temporary residence
 permits valid for 3 years. They could also apply for permanent residence at the
 same time. The Law on Aliens envisages that those with temporary residence could
 activate their applications for permanent residence toward the end of the 3-year
 temporary residence period. Following delays and confusion in implementation as
 well as criticism by international human rights observers, the Law on Aliens' appli-
 cation deadline was extended by another year, until July 12, 1995. Despite the ex-
 tension, some international observers have criticized the Law on Aliens as being too
 rigid and as having created too high a barrier for establishing residency.
 No outright restrictions are placed on the right of noncitizens to foreign travel,
 emigration, or repatriation. The Government did begin issuing temporary travel doc-
 uments to noncitizens in June. At first these temporary travel documents, valid for
 only one departure and reentry, were good for 6 months. The Government later ex-
 tended their validity to 2 years in order to accommodate entry visa requirements
 of other countries. The Government began issuing alien's passports in the fall. Regu-
 lations permit issuance to the following categories of resident aliens not in posses-
 sion of any other valid travel document: (1) a person who has been designated as
 stateless; (2) a foreign citizen who lacks the opportunity to obtain a travel document
 of his/her country of origin or of another state; (3) a person who is seeking Estonian
 citizenship and has passed the language examination if required; (4) an alien who
 is permanently departing Estonia.
 The Government does not accord refugee status or asylum. The representative of
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Nordic and Baltic states
 urged Estonia to develop and adopt legislation distinguishing between refugees, ap-
 picants for asylum, and illegal immigrants, and distributdEstonian-language cop-
 ies of the UNHCR handbook on determining refugee status. Estonia had not acted
 on the recommendations by year's end. Amnesty International reported that the
 Government detained 100 asylum seekers, mostly Iraqi Kurds. The organization
 also repeated allegations that some of the asyl seekers had been denied medical
 treatment following a hunger strie. A hijacker who diverted a plane from Russia
 to Estonia in November appied for asylum. Russia requested his extradition. The
 Government had not decided how to proceed by year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. In 1992 they elected their
 first post-Soviet Parliament in accordance with the Constitution adopted by referen-
 dum 3 months earlier. The 101-member Parliament (Riigikogu or State Assembly),
 elected by secret ballot in multiparty elections, confirmed the Prime Minister who
 put together a coalition government based on a slim parliamentary majority. When
 the Parliament passed a vote of no confidence on September 26, the Prime Minister
 and his government resigned, and a new Government was formed with a new Prime
 Minister. The next regular parliamentary elections are scheduled for March 1995.
 The Law on Local Elections adopted in May 1993 permits resident noncitizens to
 vote but not to run for office.
 The citizenship law enacted in 1992 readopted the 1938 citizenship law. According
 to the law, anyone born after 1940 to an Estonian citizen parent is an Estonian citi-
 zen by birth. The parent does not have to be an ethnic Estonian. The law includes
 requirements for naturalization, such as a 2-year residency requirement, to be fol-
 lowed by a 1-year waiting period, as well as knowledge of the Estonian language.
 The implementation law provided that the 2-year residency requirement could be
 met by residency starting on March 30, 1990. Thus, any noncitizen who resided in
 Estoma since that date was eligible to apply for Estonian citizenship as of March
 30, 1992, and for naturalization on March 30, 1993. The law allows the Government
 
 
 805
 to waive requirements for applicants who are ethnic Estonians or who have per-
 formed valuable service to Estonia.
 As of September, some 40,000 pple had applied for and received citizenship.
 Some observers attributed the app cation for naturalization of such a small propor-
 tion of resident noncitizens to: (1) indecision over whether to apply for Estonian citi-
 zenship or citizenship of another country (principally Russia)-thfe latter choice was
 encouraged by both Estonian and Russian nationalists; (2) bureaucratic delays; and
 (3) the Estonian-language proficiency requirement. Those who desire language in-
 struction confront serious problems stemming from an insufficient number of quali-
 fied teachers, lack of funds, poor educational infrastructure, and an examination
 process which some allege is arbitrary.
 Article 16 of the Citizenship Law Implementation Act bars the naturalization of:
 "(1) foreign military personnel on active service; (2) persons who have been in the
 employment of the security and intelligence organizations of the Union of Soviet So-
 cialist Republics; (3) persons who have been convicted of serious criminal offenses
 against people or who have a criminal record of repeated convictions for felonies;
 and (4) persons lacking a legal steady income." The Law on Aliens, which went into
 effect in July 1993, denies residency permits to similar categories of people. How-
 ever, it provides for judicial review of those excluded for residency permits, while
 those excluded from naturalization under the Citizenship Law have no right of ap-
 peal No expulsions of noncitizens, whether legally or illegally resident, were re-
 ported.
 There are no legal impediment to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics; 12 of the 101 members of Parliament are women, and 3 of the 14 government
 ministers who took office in the fall of 1992 were women, of whom only 1 remained
 in office by year's end.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations or interfere in the visits of international and nongovernmental human
 rights groups. In response to criticism about the treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute in 1992 to monitor human rights
 in Estonia, investigate reports of human rights violations, and provide information
 to the international community. In addition, because of tensions surrounding the
 adoption of the elections law and the Law on Aliens in 1993, the President estab-
 lished a roundtable composed of representatives of the Union of Estonian Nationali-
 ties, political parties, and the ethnic Russian population's Representative Assembly.
 In a dition, with financial assistance from the Danish Government, a nongovern-
 mental legal information center opened in Tallinn in October to provide fre legal
 assistance to citizens and noncitizens seeking advice on human rights-related issues.
 In the context of repeated Russian allegations of human rights violations among
 the noncitizen population and the widespread belief among international observers
 that the CSCE mission couldplay a more active role, Estonia agreed to extensions
 in the mission's mandate in Estonia. The CSCE mission acted to address political
 and social tensions and did not find a pattern of human rights violations or abuses
 in Estonia. The Government repeatedly expressed concern about what it deemed bi-
 ased reporting by the mission. By the end of the year, relations between the Govern-
 ment and the mission appeared to be on track again.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, skin color,
 extraction, political or other beliefs, as well as economic or social status or for any
 other reason. Ethnic Russians total nearly 30 percent, and non-Estonians as a whole
 37 percent, of the population of 1.5 million.
 Women.-Women possess the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled
 to equal pay for equal work. Nevertheless, in September the State Statistical Office
 published the results of a study conducted in November 1993 which revealed that,
 on the average, female midgrade specialists in Estonia earned only 60 percent as
 much as their male counterparts. There continue to be female- and male-dominated
 professions. Most women carry major household responsibilities in addition to com-
 prising slightly more than one-half of the work force. Although women's groups have
 undertaken no organized effort to make this an issue of public policy, in March sev-
 eral groups established an Information Center for Women's and.Family Associations
 in order to collect and disseminate information about their activities.
 Public discussion of the role and situation of women in the society increased no-
 ticeably during the year, but little or no attention was paid to the subject of violence
 
 
 806
 against women. Women's groups have not been notably active or effective in assert-
 ing women's rights. The common perception among Estonian women's groups and
 law enforcement officials is that Estonia is not plaged by faily violence. The po-
 lice note that they are rarely called to the scene of domestic violence. Police officials
 say that, in most cases when they are called, the abused spouse declines to press
 charges. There are no laws specifically against spousal abuse.
 Children.-Estonia has demonstrated a strong commitment to the rihts and wel-
 fare of children and in 1992 adopted a strong domestic child protection law, pat-
 terned on the U.N. Convent on on the Rights of the Child. There is no observed pat-
 tern of societal child abuse. However, the nongovernmental Estonian Union for
 Child Welfare is conducting a research project on children and violence in the home
 and school.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-In 1993 the President established a round-
 table to promote constructive dialog among Estonia's ethnic groups and the political
 p~arties representing them. There is a tradition of protection for cultural autonomy,
 dating to a 1925 law. Parliament passed a new cultural autonomy law for minority
 groups in 1993.
 During the years of Estonia's forced annexation by the Soviet Union, large num-
 bers of non-Estnians, predominantly ethnic Russians were encouraged to migrate
 to Estonia to work as laborers and an dministrators. hese workers and their de-
 scendants now comprise a proximately one-third of the total population, whereas
 about 8 percent of the popsation of the pre-1940 republic was ethnic Russian.
 Non-Estonians, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discrimination because of Estonian-language requirements. They are fearful that
 new discriminatory laws may be adopted. Estonian law makes no distinction on the
 basis of lack of citizenship or other such grounds regarding business or property
 ownership (other than land). All residents of Estonia may participate equally in the
 privatization of state-owned housing. Estonian-language requirements for those em-
 ployed in government offices and in the service sector went into effect in 1993.
 The language office liberally grants extensions to persons who can explain their
 failure to meet their requisite competence level in 4 years. Estonian-language train-
 ing is available, but some claim it is too costly. A separate law covering the lan-
 guage requirement for citizenship was passed in 1993. Russian representatives
 charge that the language requirement is too difficult; however, at least one Western
 NGO representative has noted that examiners pass applicants with even minimal
 knowledge of Estonian. The examination fee for either language test-for employ-
 ment or citizenship-is 15 percent of the monthly minimum wage, although it is
 waived for the unemployed.
 In districts where the language of more than one-half of the population is a lan-
 guage other than Estonian, the inhabitants are entitled to receive official informa-
 tion in that language, and the local government may conduct business in that lan-
 guage. (See also Sections 2.d. and 3 for a discussion of laws on citizenship and
 aliens.)
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution contains provisions to protect disabled
 persons against discrimination. While there is no legal discrimination against the
 disabled, little has been done on a societal or governmental level to enable disabled
 people to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law, and very
 little has been done on a voluntary basis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join freely a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian
 Trade Unions (EAKL) came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian
 organization in 1990 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor con-
 federation, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTU). Workers
 were given a choice as to whether or not they wanted to join the EAKL While in
 1990 the AUCCTU claimed to represent 800,000 members in Estonia, in 1992 the
 EAKL claimed to represent about 500,000 members, organized in 30 unions. By
 1994 EAKL's membership had dropped to about 200,000 organized into 25 unions.
 The EAKL explains the drop in membership by the breakup of large government-
 owned enterprises and privatization. EAKL officials estimate that some 40 percent
 of approximately 600,000-strong work force are organized.
 The right to strike is legal, and unions are independent of the Government and
 political parties. There were no strikes in 1994. There are constitutional and statu-
 tory prohibitions against retribution against strikers. Unions may join federations
 freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 
 
 807
 in its infancy. The Government remains by far the biggest employer. According to
 EAKL leaders, few collective barg    agreements have been concluded between
 the management and workers of a specific enterprise. The EARL has, however, con-
 cluded framework agreements with producer associations, which provide the basis
 for specific labor agreements. The EAKL was also involved with developing Esto-
 nia's new Labor Code covering employment contracts, vacation, and occupational
 safety. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination and gives employees the
 right to go to court to enforce their rights. In 1993 Parliament passed a collective
 bargaining law, a collective dispute resolution law, and a shop steward law. EAKL
 officials reported that a court reinstated a union official who alleged dismissal be-
 cause of union activity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Comnulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Labor Inspections Office effectively enforces this prohibi-
 tion.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to labor law, the statu-
 tory minimum age for employment is 16 years. Minors aged 13 through 15 may
 work with written permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor inspector,
 if working is not dangerous to the minor's health, considered immoral, or interferes
 with studies, and provided that the type of work is included on a list the Govern-
 ment has prepared. State authorities effectively enforce minimum age laws through
 inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage and reviews it
 monthly. In September the minimum wage was raised to $36 per month-450 Esto-
 man crowns. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a worker and family
 a decent standard of living. About 3 percent of the work force receive the minimum
 wage. The average wage is about four times the minimum wage.
 The standard workweek was reduced from 41 to 40 hours in 1993. There is a
 mandatory 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety standards are
 satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to implement in practice. The National
 Labor Inspection Board is charged with enforcement but has not been very effective.
 In addition, the central labor unions have occupational health and safety experts
 who, upon request from workers through their local representatives, assist workers
 in bringing employers into compliance with the legal standards. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to con-
 tinued employment.
