 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Government of the Fourth
 Republic, assisted by members of his party, the Congress for Democracy and
 Progress (CDP). In spite of the existence of dozens of political parties, there is little
 viable opposition to the President and his Government. The Government includes
 a strong presidency, a Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the
 President, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The judiciary is
 subject to executive influence.
 On November 15, President Compaore was reelected to a second 7-year term with
 88 percent of the vote; 56 percent of the electorate voted. Both national and inter-
 national observers described the presidential election as substantially free and fair
 and an improvement over the 1997 legislative elections, particularly regarding
 logistical organization of the balloting and the functioning of the polling stations.
 However, there were a limited number of voting irregularities. The national observ-
 ers identified a number of systematic weaknesses in the Electoral Code that pre-
 cluded the serious assurance of a perfectly regular and transparent vote, and a coa-
 lition representing a number of opposition parties boycotted the election. The CDP
 controls 101 of 111 seats in Parliament. International observers considered the 1997
 legislative elections to be substantially free and fair, although a collective of 14 local
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) cited generalized and systematic corruption
 and voter list irregularities. In 1995 the constitutionally mandated (though purely
 consultative) second chamber of Parliament was installed, completing the govern-
 ment structure envisaged in the 1991 Constitution. The Constitution provides for an
 independent judiciary; however, it is subject to executive influence.
 The security apparatus consists of the armed forces, the gendarmerie, controlled
 by the Ministry of Defense, and the police, controlled by the Ministry of Territorial
 Administration. Some members of the security forces on occasion committed human
 rights abuses.
 Over 80 percent of the population of almost 11 million persons engages in subsist-
 ence agriculture. Frequent drought, and limited communication and transportation
 infrastructures, in addition to a 77 percent illiteracy rate, are longstanding prob-
 lems. The 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 made imports more ex-
 pensive for salaried workers and civil servants, but improved the competitiveness
 of livestock and cotton exports. Since 1991 the Government has adopted a series of
 structural adjustment programs designed to open the economy to market forces and
 
 
 26
 to reduce government deficits, while shifting resources to the education and health
 sectors. In recent years, the country has registered strong gains in life expectancy,
 literacy, and school attendance rates, although it remains a very poor country with
 annual per capita income of about $220 (CFA 132,000).
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, but serious problems
 remained in several areas. The presidential election represented a further step to-
 ward democratic government; however, the continued dominance of President
 Compaore and his ruling party limited citizens' right to change their government.
 The death of internationally respected journalist Norbert Zongo, his brother, and
 two other men in a suspicious car fire on December 13 sparked major demonstra-
 tions in Ouagadougou and other cities. At year's end, neither a Government commis-
 sion nor an independent group established t investigate Zongo's death had started
 their work. The security forces continued to mistreat detainees, and prison condi-
 tions remained harsh. Arbitrary detention was a problem, and authorities did not
 ensure detainees due process. A general climate of impunity for members of the se-
 curity forces, along with the lack of progress in identifying or punishing those re-
 sponsible for serious abuses committed in previous years, continued to tarnish the
 Government's record. Courts are subject to executive influence, and authorities do
 not ensure fair trials. The media practices self-censorship. In June the Superior
 Council of Information (CSI), the Government entity responsible for the supervision
 of all media, released new regulations for radio and television stations that reduced
 the number of rights that the stations previously enjoyed. In October 1997, the Gov-
 ernment tightened regulations governing public demonstrations and increased pen-
 alties for violations. Societal discrimination against women persisted. Violence
 against women and children, particularly female genital mutilation (FGM), re-
 mained a problem. The Government took steps to educate citizens about the dangers
 of this practice. Killings of criminal suspects by vigilante mobs remained a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, there was one report of an extrajudicial killing. In late January
 or early February, members of the presidential guard tortured to death the chauf-
 feur of President Compoare's younger brother, Francois, in their barracks. The
 chauffeur and 2 other domestic employees of Francois Compoare were taken to the
 barracks after being accused of stealing money from the President's brother's home.
 The political opposition and the Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights (MBDHP)
 publicly criticized the killing. The status of the 2 surviving employees, who were
 awaiting trial in preventative detention (see Section 1.d.), was unclear at year's end.
 Circumstances surrounding the December 13 death of journalist Nobert Zongo, his
 brother and two companions remained unclear at year's end. Zongo, the editor of
 the weekly newspaper L'Independent and president of the Society of Editors of the
 Private Press, and the three other men died under mysterious circumstances when
 the vehicle they were riding in caught fire on an isolated road connecting
 Ouagadougou and the town of Leo. Holes that could have been caused by gunshots
 were reportedly found in the body of the vehicle. Zongo, an internationally respected
 journalist who had received death threats prior to the fire, was well known for his
 outspoken articles on government scandals, including the torture of Francois
 Compoare's chauffeur who died while in the custody of the presidential guard.
 Zongo's death sparked major demonstrations in Ouagadougou, where rioters sacked
 the headquarters of the ruling CDP party, in Zongo's hometown of Koudougou
 where they burned and looted homes and businesses of prominent CDP officials, and
 in other cities. On December 18, the Government issued a decree setting up an inde-
 pendent commission comprised mostly of civil society and international representa-
 tives to investigate the deaths. A collective of human rights groups, opposition polit-
 ical parties, journalistic organizations, student groups, and trade unions that formed
 in response to Zongo's death xejected the Government's commission claiming that
 it was not sufficiently independent. On December 24, the collective set up its own
 commission. As of year's end, neither commission had begun their investigations.
 No progress was made in punishing those responsible for abuses reported in pre-
 vious years. The major problem with law enforcement remains a general climate of
 impunity for human rights abusers fostered by the failure of the government's inves-
 tigations to result in guilty findings and appropriate sanctions. Inquiries tend to
 continue until they are overshadowed by subsequent incidents or quietly shelved.
 Appeals by human rights organizations generally go ,manswered. The failure to
 prosecute previous abuses remains the most important hindrance to further human
 rights progress.
 
 
 27
 The 1996 incident in which members of the police in the town of Reo shot and
 killed an unarmed villager during an operation to fine owners of unregistered vehi-
 cles remained unresolved. An official investigation into the 1995 shooting death of
 two unarmed high school demonstrators in Garango yielded no results. There were
 no further developments regarding the 1994 corruption scandal that led to the death
 in custody of two suspects under suspicious circumstances.
 To date, the authorities have provided no explanation of the death of Doin Redan,
 who was found dead in 1994 a day after being detained by police. The Government
 continued to make no real effort to investigate the fate of a Ghanaian detainee re-
 portedly killed in 1993 while in police custody. International and local human rights
 groups pressured the official commission investigating the 1991 killing of Clement
 Ouedraogo, a prominent opposition leader, to submit a report of preliminary find-
 ings to the Prime Minister. The report has not been made public and the case re-
 mains open, as do the cases of the 1989 disappearance of Professor Guillaume
 Sessouma, detained for allegedly participating in a coup plot, and of medical student
 Dabo Boukary in 1990, detained following student demonstrations. Credible reports
 indicated that security forces tortured and killed both men. The Government failed
 to respond to students' calls for information on Boukary's death, which was included
 in a list of demands issued during university strikes in 1997.
 There were some killings of criminal suspects by vigilante mobs.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, the mistreatment of detainees, often to extract confessions,
 has been documented for a number of years. There are credible reports that officials
 at Maco prison continued to employ degrading treatment. The Government is not
 known to have taken any disciplinary action against those responsible, and the cli-
 mate of impunity created by the Government's failure to prosecute abusers remains
 the largest obstacle to ending abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and can be life threatening. The federal
 prison in Bobo-Dioulasso, built in 1947, houses about 1,000 prisoners, although it
 was designed to hold less than half that number. There are separate facilities for
 men, women, and children. The prison diet is poor, and inmates often must rely on
 supplemental food from relatives.
 According to human rights monitors, prison visits are granted at the discretion
 of prison authorities. Permission is routinely granted, and advance permission is not
 required.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary detention was a problem, and
 authorities did not ensure due process. The Constitution provides for the right to
 expeditious arraignment and access to legal counsel. The law limits detention for
 investigative purposes without charge to a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a
 single 48-hour period. However, in practice police rarely observe these provisions,
 arbitrary detention was a problem, and authorities did not ensure due process. The
 average time of detention without charge is 1 week, and the law allows judges to
 impose an unlimited number of 6-month "preventative detention" periods.
 On November 15, eight armed policemen temporarily detained opposition Party
 for Democracy and Progress (PDP) deputy Gerard Karambiri and a PDP supporter.
 Police awakened both men in their respective homes in Bobo-Dioulasso in the early
 hours of the morning, apparently searching for opposition parties' materials calling
 for a boycott of the presidential election. The officers lacked the required warrants
 and entered their homes at times other than the 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. "legal hours." Po-
 lice took them to headquarters, interrogated them for about 2 hours, then released
 them. Parliamentarians believe that the detention of Deputy Karambiri was a viola-
 tion of the parliamentary immunity granted to all deputies under the Constitution.
 On November 18, after demanding that the detentions be investigated fully, PDP
 deputies walked out of a National Assembly plenary session in protest. In response
 the governing CDP parliamentary group sent three of its leading deputies to express
 support for the PDP, and National Assembly President Melegue Traore addressed
 a letter to the Prime Minister asking that the incident be investigated. At year's
 end, the Government had not responded.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice the judiciary is subject to executive influence. The Presi-
 dent has extensive appointment and other judicial powers. The Constitution stipu-
 lats that the Head of State is also the President of the Superior Council of the
 Magistrature, which can nominate and remove some high-ranked magistrates -and
 can examine the performance of individual magistrates.
 The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the
 country. Beneath it are 2 Courts of Appeal and 10 provincial courts ("de grande in-
 
 
 stance"). There is also a High Court of Justice, with jurisdiction to try the president
 and senior government officials for treason and other serious crimes. In 1995 the
 National Assembly passed legislation reforming the military court system, making
 military courts less susceptible in principle to executive manipulation; however,
 their independence has not yet been demonstrated.
 In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or traditional courts, presided over
 by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood and village problems, such as divorce
 and inheritance disputes. The population generally respects these decisions but citi-
 zens also may take a case to a formal- court.
 The Constitution provides for the right to public trial, access to counsel, and has
 provisions for bail and appeal. While these rights generally are respected, the ability
 of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains circumscribed by an ignorance of the law
 because 77 percent of the population is illiterate and by a continuing shortage of
 magistrates. Amendments to the Penal Code to make it more relevant to modern
 requirements, such as the revision making FGM a crime, were adopted by Par-
 liament during its last session in 1996 and entered into effect early in 1997.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and in practice the authorities generally do
 .not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. However, in national security
 cases a special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and
 private correspondence without a warrant. By law and under normal circumstances,
 homes may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister
 of Justice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The -1991 Constitution and the 1990 Informa-
 tion Code provide for freedom of speech and of the press. However, in practice these
 freedoms still remain circumscribed by a certain degree of self-censorship. The
 President and his Government remain sensitive to criticism. Provisions in the Code
 granting the Government strong legal powers to intimidate the press through a
 broad interpretation of defamation were removed in 1993. As a result, journalists
 charged with libel may defend themselves in court by presenting evidence in sup-
 port of their allegations. The independent press, particularly the written press, con-
 tinued to exercise greater freedom of expression. However, the suspicious death of
 internationally respected journalist and newspaper editor Norbert Zongo raised seri-
 ous questions on the limits to the exercise of this freedom (see Section l.a.). Zongo
 was well known for his investigative reports on government scandals.
 All media are under the administrative and technical supervision of the Ministry
 of Communication and Culture. The audiovisual media are further regulated by the
 Superior Council of Information (CSI).
 The official media, including the daily newspaper Sidwaya, and the national radio
 and television displayed progovernment bias. The independent press includes 6
 daily and 12 weekly newspapers, and a monthly news magazine. There are 21 thriv-
 ing independent radio stations, 1 private television station, with a very limited
 viewing area, and 1 religious television station. In October the Government divided
 a $180,000 (CFA 10.8 million) grant among 21 different private and independent
 radio stations, publications, and the low-power private television station located in
 Ouagadougou. These media outlets include-stations that are critical of the Govern-
 ment. However, no private radio station was permitted to report on the 1997 legisla-
 tive campaign.
 In June the CSI released new regulations for private and independent radio sta-
 tions, and in August it released new regulations for television. The CSI gave radio
 and television stations 6 months to put the new regulations into effect. Radio sta-
 tions implemented the new rules in late November while teleyision stations have
 until February 1999. The new regulations allowed reinstatement of call-in shows,
 which had previously been suspended in 1997. However, radio stations are held re-
 onsible if their call-in programs threaten the public order or the rights of any
 dparty. At year's end, no station had resumed call-in shows. Under the regula-
 tions, no political party can directly or indirectly own or hold shares in an FM radio
 station. Any assistance from.political parties is forbidden, as is coverage of political
 events. Stations must submit their programming schedules to the CSI 2 months in
 advance for approval. Any subsequent changes to the programming must be submit-
 ted 2 months in advance of the proposed change. FM[ stations are prohibited from
 airing live broadcasts from foreign stations. Community radio stations can no longer
 broadcast paid advertisements, and commercial radio stations must clear all adver-
 tisements with the CSI prior to broadcast. Private and independent radio stations
 may no longer use volunteer employees, upon whom many, stations are heavily de-
 
 
 29
 pendent. All employees must be paid and registered with the National Social Secu-
 rity Office.
 National and international observers reported that the CSI effectively fulfilled its
 responsibilities under the Electoral Code to assure equal media treatment of the
 candidates during the period prior to the November presidential election. The collec-
 tive of independent election observers stated after the election that the press gen-
 erally had been open to the different candidates and that press reporting on can-
 didates' campaigns, with the exception of the national television and state-owned
 newspaper, which initially gave the President more attention that the other two
 candidates, became more balanced after a complaint presented to the CSI early in
 the campaign by Green Party candidate Ram Ouedraogo.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respected this right in practice.
 Political parties and labor unions usually have been allowed to hold meetings and
 rallies without requesting Government permission since early 1990. In October
 1997, the National Assembly passed a law to replace an existing 1992 law regulat-
 ing public demonstrations. The new law requires that authorities be notified in ad-
 vance of planned demonstrations and gives the executive the right to use reasons
 of public order to forbid demonstrations. In addition penalties for violations were in-
 creased from 6 months to 5 years to 2 to 5 years. Permits must be obtained from
 municipal authorities for political marches. Applicants must indicate the date, time,
 duration, and itinerary of the march or rally, and authorities may alter or deny re-
 quests on grounds of public safety. Denials or modifications may be appealed before
 the courts. Several trade union organizations organized marches under this new law.
 that were held without incident.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this in practice. Since early 1990, political parties and labor unions
 usually have been permitted to organize without seeking government permission.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The country is a secular state. Islam,
 Christianity, and traditional religions operate freely without government inter-
 ference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, and authorities re-
 spect this right in practice. Gendarmes routinely stop travelers for identity and cus-
 toms checks and the levying of road taxes at police and military checkpoints. There
 is no restriction on foreign travel.
 Refugees are accepted freely. The Government provides first asylum. The Govern-
 ment cooperated with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The ap-
 proximately 25,000 refugees and displaced persons remaining in the country in
 1997, mostly Tuaregs from Mall and Niger, were repatriated by the beginning of the
 year. A few hundred refugees from the Great Lakes region remain. There were no
 reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a-valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through
 multiparty elections. However, although the November 15 presidential election rep-
 resented a further step toward democratic government, in practice citizens are un-
 able to exercise this right fully due to the continued dominance of the President and
 his ruling party. President Compoare won 88 percent of the vote; 56 percent of the
 eligible voters went to the polls. The irregularities cited by observers in the actual
 voting process were limited in number and scope and did not appear to have an im-
 pact on the ultimate outcome of the election. However, the national observers identi-
 fied a number of systematic weaknesses in the electoral code that precluded a per-
 fectly regular and transparent vote, and a coalition representing a number of opposi-
 tion parties boycotted the election. On November 24, the Supreme Court confirmed
 the final vote count released by the independent National Electoral Commission
 (CENI) on November 18. Neither of the two candidates opposing President
 Compaore contested the results.
 The 1997 legislative elections gave the ruling CDP 101 out of 111 parliamentary
 seats. The victory reflected both general support for policies of the governing party
 and a lack of viable opposition alternatives. While international observers described
 the elections as substantially free and fair, a collective of 14 local NGO's cited gen-
 
 
 eralized and systematic corruption and voter list irregularities. The Supreme Court
 annulled the results in four constituencies because of these irregularities.
 On May 7, the National Assembly approved the establishment of an Independent
 National Electoral. Commission (CENI) to replace the-National Committee for the
 Organization of Elections (CNOE) that supervised the 1997 legislative elections. The
 law creating the CENI gave it responsibility for creating a census bureau, installing
 voting stations and training poll workers, organizing election observation, ensuring
 election security,, and distributing election material. However, developing electoral
 lists is still the responsibility of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Secu-
 rity. The law also called for the CENI to be headed by an elected president and vice
 president who could not come from the hierarchy of any political party. The presi-
 dent and vice president are elected by CENI members. On July 16, the CENI was
 installed with 26 members, of which 6 came from the opposition, 6 from the ruling
 party, 3 from the religious community, 3 from the traditional tribal community, 6
 from the labor movement, and 3 from a human rights organization. A committee of
 six persons from various government ministries is available to advise the CENI.
 However, there were concerns regarding CENI's independence since its funding was
 channeled through the Government, and it was scheduled, to cease operations 60
 days after the election. During the November 15 election, CENI was not able to
 carry out its functions in some of the country's 45 provinces due to inadequate staff-
 mng.
 The Compaore Government includes a strong presidency, a Prime Minister, a
 -Council of Ministers presided over by the President, a two-chamber National Assem-
 bly, and the judiciary. The legislature is independent, but it remains susceptible to
 external influence from the executive branch. .
 In January 1997, the CDP-dominated National Assembly amended the Constitu-
 tion to allow a president to run for an unlimited number of terms. Previously, the
 Constitution had restricted the mandate to two 7-year terms.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 nority group members in politics. However, women are underrepresented in posi-
 tions of responsibility; only-3 of the 29 ministers and 8 of the 111 National Assem-
 bly deputies are women. The President of the Social and Economic Council is a
 woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation.of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude-toward local human rights organizations was mixed.
 According to monitors, the Government did not interfere with the activities of any
 such group during the year, including the Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights
 (MBDHP), an independent group with representation in all 45 provinces. However,
 the Government has failed to answer inquiries from international human rights or-
 ganizations concerning ,past abuses. Amnesty International (AI) is still awaiting the
 results of the Government inquiry into the 1995 killings in Garango, but the Gov-
 ernment has not responded to Al's request for information.
 In 1994 the Government announced the creation of the Office of Ombudsman,
 called tMediateur du Faso." Retired General Marc Garango has appointed to the po-
 sition, which is responsible for mediating disputes between the state and its citi-
 zens. In June- the Ombudsman's Office issued its first activity report, which indi-
 cated that half the cases brought before it dealt with career problems of civil serv-
 ants and the other half with a variety of issues, including land questions and bu-
 reaucratic inaction.
 Section 5. DiscriminationBased on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin. Minority ethnic groups are, like the majority Mossi, represented in the inner
 circles of the Government, and government decisions do not favor one group over
 another.
 Women-Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs .occasionally.
 Cases of wife beating are usually handled through customary law and practice.
 There are no statistics on rape, although it is recognized as a crime. Spousal rape
 is not discussed. There are organizations that counsel rape victims, including Catho-
 lic and Protestant missions, the Association of Women Jurists in Burkina, the
 Burkinabe Movement for Human       Rights, the Association  of Women, and
 Promofemmes, a regional network that works to combat violence against women.
 The Government is attempting to change attitudes toward women, using education
 through the media. The Penal Code explicitly prohibits sexual harassment but has
 
 
 no special laws protecting women against violence other than general laws dealing
 with violence.
 There are no specific constitutional provisions or laws protecting women, who face
 extensive discrimination. In general women continue to occupy a subordinate posi-
 tion and experience discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, property, and
 family rights. Overall, women represent 45 percent of the work force. However, in
 the modern sector women make up one-fourth of the government work force, al-
 though they are usually found in lower paying positions. Women still do much of
 the subsistence" farming work. After the May 1997 parliamentary elections, the Gov-
 ernment created a Ministry of Women's Affairs anda  ointed a woman as minister.
 Children.-The Constitution nominally protects chi  en s rights. The Government
 has demonstrated its commitment to improving the condition of children by adopt-
 ing a national policy to revitalize primary health care through the privatization of
 hospitals, which provided greater autonomy in hospital management. The Govern-
 ment has stated its commitment to improve access to primary education and as of
 1996 had raised the literacy rate to 22 percent. The Government provides free pri-
 mary school education to all children. If a child qualifies on the basis of grades and
 social condition (that is, his/her family is "poor"), free education can continue
 through junior high and high school. In practice, the family condition requirement
 is often ignored giving many children a free education through high school.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary school system and are represented in the secondary and higher educational
 systems, although the percentage decreases significantly beyond the primary level.
 Schools in rural areas have disproportionately fewer female students than schools
 in urban areas. The Government has set up a scholarship program for female sec-
 ondary students to encourage them to stay in school.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, still is practiced wide-
 ly, especially in many rural areas, and usually is performed at an early age. The
 percentage of females who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 70 per-
 cent. The Government has made a strong commitment to eradicate FGM through
 educational efforts, and a national committee campaigns against the practice. The
 Penal Code was revised in 1996 to make FGM a crime, with stricter punishments
 for those involved in its practice. Perpetrators are subject to 6 months to 3 years
 imprisonment and a significant fine. The Government continued its sensitization
 campaign regarding the deleterious effects of this practice. Another form of mutila-
 tion, scarification of the faces of both boys and girls of certain ethnic groups, is
 gradually disappearing.
 People With Disabilities.-While there are modest government subsidies for work-
 shops for the disabled, there is no government mandate or legislation concerning ac-
 cessibility for the disabled. There is no legislation to protect persons with disabilities
 from discrimination. Programs to aid the disabled are limited, but human rights
 groups are not aware of any discrimination against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1962 Labor Code has been amended several
 times during the past decade, most recently in 1996. Under this legislation, workers,
 including civil servants, traditionally have enjoyed a legal right of association, which
 is recognized under the Constitution. There are 4 major labor confederations and
 12 autonomous trade unions linked together by a national confederal committee.
 They represent a wide ideological spectrum; the largest and most vocal member es-
 pouses socialist doctrine. Essential workers, such as police, may not join unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers use strike actions
 to achieve labor goals. For example, the National Union for Tax and Housing Agents
 (SNAID) held a 72-hour protest strike from November 24 to 26. The strike was
 called primarily to demand implementation of incentive and performance bonuses
 for the agents, which they believed they were entitled to as state employees. The
 strike ended after the third day even though the Government did not indicate how
 it would respond to the union's demands.
 Labor unions may affiliate freely with international trade unions. The National
 Confederation of Burkinabe Workers (CNTB) is affiliated with the Brussels-based
 World Confederation of Labor (WCL).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 
 
 labor or management may refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals. Ap-
 peals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modem
 wage sector, but it encompasses only a small percentage of workers.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. The Labor Ministry handles
 complaints about such discrimination, which the plaintiff may appeal to a labor tri-
 bunal. If the tribunal sustains the appeal, the employer must reinstate the worker.
 Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively. Children commonly work with their parents in rural areas
 or in family-owned small businesses in villages and cities.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor but does not enforce this prohibi-
 tion effectively (see Section 6.c.). The labor code sets the minimum age for employ-
 ment at 14 years, the average age for completion of basic primary school. However,
 the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Security, which oversees labor
 standards, lacks the means to enforce this provision adequately, even in the small
 wage sector. Most children actually begin work at an earlier age on small, family
 subsistence farms, in the traditional apprenticeship system, and in the informal sec-
 tor. There are no reports of children under the age of 14 employed in either state
 or large private companies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of-Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period for
 nondomestic workers and a 60 hour workweek for household workers, and estab-
 lishes safety and health provisions. The minimum monthly wage in the formal sec-
 tor, about $45 (CFA 27,089), does not apply to subsistence agriculture, which em-
 ploys about 85 percent of the population. The government last set a minimum wage
 in 1996. It is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family. Wage earners
 usually supplement their income through reliance on the extended family, subsist-
 ence agriculture, or trading in the informal sector.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Employment, Labor,
 and Social Security and the labor tribunals is responsible for overseeing health and
 safety standards in the small industrial and commercial sectors, but these stand-
 ards do not apply in the subsistence agricultural sector. However, the Government's
 Labor Inspector Corps does not have sufficient resources to fulfill its duties ade-
 quately. Every company is required to have a work safety committee. If a workplace
 has been declared unsafe by the government Labor Inspection Office for any reason,
 workers -have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work without jeopardy
 to continued employment. In practice there are indications that this right is re-
 spected, but such declarations are relatively rare.
