 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic with an elected president, a bicameral legis-
 lature, and an independent judicial branch. In November 1994 former President
 Julio Maria Sanguinetti won a narrow election victory. He began his 5-year term
 in March.
 The Interior Ministry administers the country's police departments and the prison
 system and is responsible for domestic security and public safety. The principal
 human rights problems continued to be police abuse and mistreatment of prisoners.
 The economy comprises a mixture of private enterprises and state entities and is
 heavily dependent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. Private property rights
 are respected. The economy grew by an estimated 1 percent in 1995; annual per
 capita gross domestic product was approximately $5,600.
 Pron   onditions remain poor, and professionalism in poice ranks remained
 weak. Court cases often take many years, and failure to adjudicate cases expedi-
 tiously contributed to human rights problems in several areas. A Public Security
 Law passed in July addressed a number of these issues. Implementation of the law,
 however, could face institutional delays. Discrimination against women continued,
 and no steps were taken to address the discrimination faced by the black minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners, but police and prison
 guards continue to commit such abuses. The judicial and parliamentary branches
 of government are responsible for investi ng specific allegations of abuse. How-
 ever, law enforcement officials are seldom convicted and punished for such abuse.
 In August 1994, 1 person was killed and approximately 100 injured (3 seriously)
 when a demonstration turned into a riot. The investigation of police misconduct dur-
 ing this incident is still underway; in May four police officials were charged with
 failure to exercise proper responsibility. These policemen remain on active duty
 while the investigation continues. The 1994 case of a mentally disabled person who
 committed suicide after police abuse remains unresolved.
 Police officers have been charged in other instances. In one week in January,
 eight police officers were charged for various crimes. Figures released in October by
 the Interior Ministry show that a large number of police officers currently on active
 duty have been charged with crimes. Other officials charged with crimes also con-
 tinue to perform their duties while their cases are pending before the slow-moving
 judicial system. The new Law on Public Security calls for improved police training
 and requires that police officers be instructed and directed in their conduct in ac-
 cordance with United Nations codes regardinl the use of force.
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities remain poor but not life
 threatening. As part of the new Law on Public Security, a commission was formed
 in September to study prison conditions and update legislation on penal institutions
 to bring them into compliance with international standards. The commission will
 also pro ose improvements in work, vocational training, and rehabilitation of pris-
 oners. The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires the police to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before making an arrest. The only excep-
 tion is when the accused is apprehended during commission of a crime. The Con-
 stitution also provides the accused with the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 grounds for the detention. Police may hold a detainee incommunicado for 24 hours
 before presenting the case to a judge, at which time the detainee has the right to
 counsel. It is during this 24-hour period that abuse of prisoners sometimes takes
 place, often resulting in forced confessions.

 If the detainee cannot afford a lawyer, the courts appoint a public defender. If the
 crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the accused person is confined
 during the judge's investigation of the charges unless the authorities agree to re-
 lease the person on bail. Approximately 85 percent of all persons currently incarcer-
 ated are awaiting a final decision in their case. Because of the slowness of the judi-
 cial process, the length of time prisoners spend in jail before being sentenced may
 exceed the maximum sentence for their crime. Human rights groups claim that the
 uncertainty as to how long one will be imprisoned is a factor in the tense situation
 that exists in the country's prisons.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary is head-
 ed by a Supreme Court which supervises the work of the lower courts. There is a
 parallel military court system that operates under a military justice code. Two mili-
 tary justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases involving the
 military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state of war or insurrec-
 tion.
 Trial proceedings are usually based on written arguments to the judge, which are
 not routinely made public. Only the prosecutor and defense attorney have access to
 all documents that form part of the written record. Oral argument was introduced
 in 1990, but is only used at the option of individual judges. Most judges have chosen
 to retain the written method, which is a major factor in the slowness of the judicial
 process. There is no legal provision against self-incrimination, and judges may com-
 pel defendants to answer any questions they pose. The defense attorney or prosecu-
 tor may appeal convictions to a higher court, which may acquit the person of the
 crime, confirm the conviction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the Government generally re-
 spects constitutional provisions and safeguards in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the authorities may abridge these rights if persons are deemed
 to be inciting violence or "insulting the nation."
 All elements of the political spectrum freely express their viewpoints in both the
 print and broadcast media. Montevideo alone has 8 daily newspapers and 6 impor-
 tant weeklies; there are also approximately 100 weekly and a few daily newspapers
 throughout the country. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three com-
 mercial television stations. There are about 110 radio stations and 20 television sta-
 tions in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opin-
 ions are free, within the limits contained in the Constitution and the law, and out-
 lines methods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The law calls
 for 3 months' to 2 years' imprisonment for "knowingly divulging false news that
 causes a grave disturbance to the public peace or a grave prejudice to economic in-
 terest of the State" or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their powers." The au-
 thorities use this law intermittently to set and enforce certain limits on freedom of
 the press.
 A radio station that was closed by government decree after an August 1994 riot
 remains closed, but specific charges have not yet been brought against the station
 or its owners.
 The national university is autonomous, and the authorities generally respect aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their government. Uru-
 guay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18
 years of age or older and no restrictions regarding race, sex, religion, or economic
 status. The Colorado Party, the National (Blanco) Party, and the Broad Front coali-
 tion are the three major political groupings. Each allows ideological divisions within
 the party, and each such grouping may field its own slate of candidates in general
 elections. A party therefore may run multiple presidential candidates, each with his
 or her own slate of legislative candidates. In essence, voters express a preference
 for a party slate or list of candidates rather than for a single standard-bearer. The
 party that receives the most overall votes fills the presidency and seats in the Sen-
 ate and Chamber of Deputies are apportioned according to the percentage of votes
 that a party receives.
 Women and blacks face de facto impediments to their participation in politics and
 their employment in government. Onily 1 of the 12 cabinet ministers is a woman.
 The Legislature which was installed in February has two female senators (the first
 since 1973) and six female deputies. The small black minority is not represented in
 the Cabinet or legislature.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights roups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 or disability. Despite these provisions, de facto discrimination exists.
 Women.-Women enjoy equality under the law but face discrimination stemming
 from traditional attitudes and practices.
 Violence against women continues to be a serious problem. In 1995 the number
 of reported cases of family violence doubled, reflecting increased public awareness
 resulting from private organizations focusing attention on the problem. A woman's
 ability to file and sustain a complaint often depends on the attitude of the judge.
 Police and judges lack special training to deal with crimes against women.
 The new Public Security Law provides for sentences from 6 months to 2 years in
 prison for a person found guilty of committing an act of violence or of making con-
 tinuing threats to cause bodily injury to persons related emotionally or legally to
 the perpetrator.
 The work force remains segregated by gender, women, who make up almost one-
 half the work force, tend to be concentrated in lower paying jobs. One-half the stu-
 dents entering universities are women, and they often pursue professional careers
 but are underrepresented in traditionally male professions.
 Children.-The Government is generally committed to protecting children's rights
 and welfare, and there are no patterns of societal abuse. The Government has made
 educational reform a high priority although it has not yet developed legislation to
 implement its objectives. An Institute in the Ministry of Interior oversees implemen-
 tation of the Government's programs for children. However, limited funding is pro-
 vided for children's programs, and many of the Institute's personnel are not trained
 to deal with the problems of minors. Miguelette, the country's largest and most
 problematic detention facility for minors, is currently being used almost exclusively
 for roceasing; there are few minors housed there on a permanent basis.
 The most controversial provision of the new Public Security Law would allow mi-
 nors with a record of violent crimes to be housed in adult prisons. Human rights
 groups adamantly oppose this provision, even though the law stipulates that minors
 would be housed in separate facilities within the prisons.
 People With Disabilities.-The legislature passed a law covering the rights of the
 disabled in 1989, but the Government has not yet implemented it. It does not man-
 date accessibility to existing buildings or public services for people with disabilities;
 new public buildings will be reqiredto have such access. The law is mostly declara-
 tive and fails to stipulate speci ic remedial provisions or sanctions for not complying
 with its measures. The law requires that 4 percent of public sector jobs be reserved
 for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's black minority, approximately
 6 percent of the population, continues to face discrimination. A 1993 report put the
 number of black university graduates at 65, and black professionals at fewer than
 
 
 538
 50. Blacks are practically unrepresented in the bureaucratic, political, and academic
 sectors of society. They lack the educational opportunities and social and political
 connections necessary for entry into these groups. In a February public opinion poll,
 more than three-quarters of the persons interviewed admitted that racial prejudice
 exists, and two-thirds of them named blacks as the group which faces the most dis-
 crimination. While discrimination against blacks is not official, the Government has
 not taken effective steps to deal with this problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that laws should promote
 the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies. In spite of
 this provision, there is almost no legislation concerning union activities. Unions tra-
 ditionally organize and operate freely without government regulation. Civil serv-
 ants, employees of state-run enterprises, and private enterprise workers may join
 unions. An estimated 12 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are
 independent of political party control but have traditionally been more closely asso-
 ciated with the Broad Front, the leftist political coalition.
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, and there were several
 strikes during the year. The Government may regally compel workers to work dur-
 ing a strike if they perform an essential service whose interruption "could cause a
 grave prejudice or risk, provoking suffering to part or all of the society."
 While no institutionalized mechanism exists for resolving workers' complaints
 against employers, the law generally prohibits discriminatory acts by employers, in-
 cluding arbitrary dismissals for union activity. There are no restrictions on the right
 of unions to form confederations or affiliate with international trade union groups.
 However, the one national confederation has chosen not to affiliate officially with
 any of the world federations. Some individual unions are affiliated with inter-
 national trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Collective bargaining between
 companies and their unions determine most private sector salaries. The executive
 branch, acting independently or through tripartite salary councils, determines public
 sector salaries.
 There are no laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination; however, a 1993 executive
 decree established fines for employers engaging in antiunion activities. The law does
 not require employers to reinstate workers fre  or union activities. However, in
 cases of legal haenges by urnion activists, courts tend to set indemnization levels
 that are higher than the normal payment for dismissed workers.
 Union members' claims of discrimination increased during the year. The Ministry
 of Labor reported that it had handled 19 cases. In some of the cases, employers
 agreed to reinstate workers; other cases remained unresolved at year's end.
 All labor legislation fully covers workers employed in special export zones. There
 are no unions in any of these zones, but there are relatively few workers in tradi-
 tionally organizable occupations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its existence.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Child Labor Code protects
 children; the Ministry of Labor and Social Security is responsible for enforcing the
 laws and illegal child labor is not a problem. The law generally does not permit chil-
 dren under 15 years of age to work, but 12-year-olds may be employed if they have
 a special permit. Children under the age of 18 may not perform dangerous,
 fatiguing, or night work. Controls over salaries and hours for children are more
 strict than those for adults. Children over the age of 16 may sue in court for pay-
 ment of wages, and children have the legal right to dispose of their own income.
 However, many children work as street vendors in the expanding informal sector
 or in the agrarian sector, which are generally less strictly regulated and where pay
 is lower.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A legislated minimum monthly wage is in ef-
 fect in both the public and private sectors, and is effectively enforced by the Min-
 istry of Labor. The minimum wage is adjusted whenever public sector wages are ad-
 justed, usually once every 4 months. The minimum wage, which was about $95 (625
 pesos) per month, functions more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a
 true measure of minimum subsistence levels, and it would not provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in industry and 44 hours in commerce, with
 a 36-hour break each week. The law stipulates that industrial workers receive over-
 time compensation for work in excess of 48 hours and establishes their right to 20
 days of paid vacation after a year of employment.

 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security enforces legislation regulating health
 and safety conditions in a generally effective manner. However, some of the regula-
 tions cove. urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural
 workers. Workers have the right to remove themselves from what they consider haz-
 ardous or dangerous conditions.
