 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by the African Party for the Independence of
 Cape Verde, the country's sole political party. Government
 ministers, in most cases, are also senior members of the party.
 Many of these are former leaders of the revolutionary movement
 to free Cape Verde from Portuguese rule. Party membership has
 about doubled in the eight years since independence, and the
 leadership group has been expanded to include technicians with
 less strong revolutionary credentials. Still, only about five
 percent of the voting population belongs to the party, although
 it is officially open to anyone wishing to join.
 The Constitution adopted in 1980 declares the party "the supreme
 expression of the interests of the popular masses' and designates
 the Popular National Assembly as the supreme organ of the state.
 The designation of the party as the country's governing
 political organization and the control of the party apparatus
 exercised by the small group of men who led the revolutionary
 struggle effectively limits the practical exercise of political
 rights. The Assembly selects the President, who, as head of
 state, proposes the Prime Minister to the Assembly. The Prime
 Minister as head of government proposes ministers and other
 senior officials. The Assembly is elected through free
 universal suffrage from a slate of candidates which Is proposed
 to the electorate by the party. Party selection of all
 candidates for Assembly seats restricts the freedom of choice
 of the individual voter..
 Security responsibilities are divided between the Army
 (Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People), primarily for
 external defense, and the security and police forces for internal
 order. Both operate under legal guidelines and leadership
 approved by the party.
 Cape Verde is one of the poorest of the poor nations, and it is
 thwarted in producing basic necessities by a drought now in its
 16th year. This is the fifth (and longest) major drought of
 this century; nearly 80,000 persons died during the previous four.
 At present the country receives sizable amounts of foreign
 assistance, and starvation does not occur. The duration of the
 current drought, however, has reduced irrigated areas by about
 one-half and seriously diminished water supplies for domestic
 use. As three-quarters of the population are rural with few
 options other than farming, and with a paucity of other employ-
 ment opportunities, Cape Verdeans continue to resort to
 emigration on a major scale.
 The Government, which is the largest nonagricultural employer,
 also controls banking, imports of basic commodities, airlines,
 the press, and schools. Private property rights are respected,
 and there is a substantial private sector which includes shops,
 farms, fishing, small industries such as tuna canning, and the
 professions.
 The state of human rights in Cape Verde during 1983 was not
 significantly different than that prevailing in 1982. The
 second party congress was conducted with a degree of openness,
 including election by secret ballot of the Congress participants
 themselves who in turn elected members of the Party's National
 Council, also by secret ballot. Election of municipal officials
 is scheduled for 1984, but the manner of selecting candidates for
 offices is still not known.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 During 1983 there was no reported unlawful or arbitrary depriva-
 tion of life.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1983 there were no reported instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although there is no evidence of torture and cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment being used in any generalized
 manner, groups of Cape Verdean emigres from time to time
 allege that it takes place. In one case during 1983, an
 individual claimed to have been beaten during interrogation.
 Other instances of similar behavior by security officers
 cannot be ruled out. In the above mentioned case, the individual
 filed a complaint against the alleged perpetrator but apparently
 has not yet received satisfaction. Stories of torture or
 degrading treatment of those arrested in the 1981 demonstrations
 against agrarian reform (all of whom have been released) are
 still recycled by groups outside the country and, although they
 cannot be confirmed, they may have had some validity. The
 Government denied them at the time but no longer reacts to the
 reiteration of old charges.
 d. Arbitary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 During 1983 there were no reported instances of people being
 detained, punished, or tried for the expression of views critical
 of or different from those of the Government.
 Habeas corpus exists in Cape Verde and appears to be observed
 for nonpolitical offenses. Cape Verde law requires that
 arrestees be charged within 48 hours. In exceptional cases, and
 then with the concurrence of a procurator or judge, the formal
 charge process may be slightly delayed but must take place
 within five days. However, in cases of alleged crimes against
 state security, persons may be detained for up to five months
 without trial upon a judge's ruling. There is a functioning
 system of bail, and the right of access to a lawyer seems to be
 observed in practice.
 During 1983 there were no known political prisoners held in Cape
 Verde or forced into exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Unless caught in the act, an accused must be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours of arrest to hear evidence from the
 public prosecutor who would prefer charges. Counsel is supposed
 to be present for the accused who is then remanded, released on
 bail, or released unconditionally. The trial itself is heard by
 one judge, with the public prosecutor making the case against the
 accused, who is defended by counsel. There is no jury trial.
 
 
 69
 Appeal is possible. Trials appear to be handled expeditiously.
 There is also a system of popular tribunals to adjudicate minor
 disputes on a neighborhood or local level in rural areas. The
 "Judges" are usually prominent local citizens without legal
 training, who are appointees of the Ministry of Justice. Their
 decisions can be appealed within the regular court system.
 The judiciary does not have the authority to determine the
 constitutionality of legislation. Although according to the
 Constitution judges are independent, one former judge now living
 outside the country has claimed that one-party rule in practice
 has hampered the functioning of a truly independent judiciary..
 Most evidence suggests, however, that the courts protect
 individual rights in criminal cases.
 d. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution recognizes citizens' rights to the inviola-
 bility of domicile, correspondence, and other private means of
 communication. In the case of a domicile, the law requires
 search warrants issued by a judge. There were no known cases
 of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence during 1983.
 The Constitution also contains the provision that every citizen
 has the right and the duty to participate in the political,
 economic, and cultural life of the country. This provision
 could be used to force participation in activities against an
 individual's will, although in practice there is no evidence to
 suggest it is being done.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and intellectual creativity, including the
 rights of authorship, are proclaimed in the Constitution. The
 Constitution also stipulates that none of the rights and
 freedoms granted in it may be exercised "contrary to national
 unity* or the Constitution's principles and objectives. Since
 the principle of the party's political leadership is also
 stated in the Constitution, criticism of the Government's
 policies could be considered unconstitutional, although there
 are no reported cases of this actually occurring. One Cape
 Verdean emigrant who had written and published articles
 antipathetic to the Government of Cape Verde returned to the
 country in 1983, traveled freely throughout, and even
 interviewed former prisoners who claimed to have been tortured
 by police.
 Freedom of the press is not a specific constitutional guarantee.
 The weekly newspaper and radio are government owned. Although
 occasional articles are printed or broadcast critical of some
 aspects of government policy, these are probably done with prior
 authorization. On the other hand, international periodicals
 generally circulate freely in Cape Verde, even when they carry
 articles critical of or unflattering to the Government, as is
 frequently the case with Portuguese newspapers. International
 radio broadcasts are received clearly without interference.
 Censorship of movies is practiced, although it is not known if
 
 
 70
 the criteria are political or primarily to protect public
 morals. Local radio broadcasts carry items from Western agencies
 as well as from Communist countries, generally identifying
 sources on controversial international issues and balancing off,
 for example, Tass reports with others from Western sources. It
 is unlikely that establishment of print or other media enter-
 prises not subject to government control would be welcomed or
 permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to meet, to associate freely, and to demonstrate is
 guaranteed in the Constitution.    However, as a practical
 matter, the practice is untested with regard to organizations
 antithetical to government actions or policies. There are no
 formal associations in Cape Verde organized to oppose government
 policies. During 1983 there were no known instances of persons
 assembling to protest government policies or actions. Private
 associations other than sports clubs or religious youth groups
 do not exist and would have to be authorized. Party-sponsored
 "mass organizations" of women and youth are prominent, however.
 Workers in several sectors are organized into unions within the
 National Union structure which is headed by a high-ranking member
 of the party. Although the National Union claims to be inde-
 pendent of the party, the two are closely tied. Individual
 unions perform some traditional trade union functions and act
 also as party affiliates. The right to strike is guaranteed but
 is rarely used even though union leadership has taken positions
 opposed to government policies in state enterprises. The
 National Union maintains ties with international bodies such
 as the International Labor Organization and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity, but probably has not taken positions
 independent of those officially sanctioned by the Government.
 It maintains ties with, and receives assistance from, both
 Communist and non-Communist national unions abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution separates church and state. Freedom of wor-
 ship is respected by the Government, and members of all faiths
 practice their religion without harassment. Two-thirds or more
 of the population are nominally Catholic, probably including most
 of the government leadership, but the dominance of Catholicism
 does not appear to impact adversely on other faiths. Evan-
 gelical Protestants and Seventh-day Adventists are the two other
 principal minority religious communities. There are no restric-
 tions on religious practices, teaching, or contacts with co-
 religionists outside Cape Verde. A few foreign missionaries and
 foreign members of the clergy are active in Cape Verdi. -ATh
 Government has recently ncminated an Ambassador to the Vatican,
 and President Pereira met with the Pope in 1982. Religious
 leaders do not participate in government affairs, and there are
 no known cases where church leaders have taken positions in
 opposition to government policies. The Catholic Church speaks
 out against artificial contraception, a practice which is
 supported by government agencies for those desiring birth
 control information or devices.
 
 
 71
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no extraordinary legal or administrative restrictions
 on either travel or residence within the country. However, all
 resident Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either
 temporarily or permanently, must obtain exit permission from
 the Government. Such permission has not been denied for
 political reasons. Emigration has long been an important escape
 valve from prevailing harsh economic conditions. Repatriation
 is a constitutional right of the citizen, and the Government
 does not discourage intending repatriates. During the previous
 year, it actively assisted in the resettlement of Cape Verdeans
 who asked to be repatriated from Sao Tome and Principe.
 The law allows for revocation of citizenship on several grounds,
 including activities contrary to the interest of the country.
 However, there are no known cases of persons having been
 deprived of citizenship for political reasons. There are at most
 only a handful of foreign refugees in Cape Verde.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The party's monopoly of power in Cape Verde is inscribed in the
 Constitution. Opposition parties do not exist nor are they
 permitted. The small group of men who actually led the struggle
 for independence occupy positions of leadership-in both the party
 and the Government. The Secretary General of the party is
 President of the Republic; the Deputy Secretary General is Prime
 Minister, and the third-ranking party official is President of
 the National Assembly. Altogether, eight of nine members of the
 party's political commission are also ministers; the other
 manages day to day activities of the party. Not all ministers
 or secretaries of state are party members; however, they clearly
 serve at the pleasure of the party.
 At the time of the party's second congress in June 1983, there
 were 5,860 members, probably representing about five percent of
 the total voting age population. This is a doubling of party
 membership since independence eight years ago. Women, at
 14 percent of the total membership, are underrepresented.
 The party is also young (47 percent under 30 years of age),
 disproportionately urban (50 percent in a nation which is more
 than two-thirds rural) and heavily representative of the
 bureaucracy (25 percent civil servants or employees of state
 enterprises).
 Within this elitist party, there exists at least a modest scope
 for meaningful political activity. The delegates to the party
 congress were elected by secret ballot. The usual jockeying for
 power characteristic of any organized group is prevalent, even
 -n-the leadership group. At the congress itself, the leadership
 was also elected by secret ballot with some unexpected changes
 in the order of precedence-for various ministers. There was also
 an evident opening at the top level of the party to bring indi-
 viduals possessing less solid revolutionary credentials into more
 prominent roles; 15 of 42 members and alternates, including three
 women, were elected to the National Council for the first time.
 One of the decisions of the congress was to hold elections for
 local governmental bodies during 1984. However, until the method
 of selecting candidates is known, the importance of this decision
 for valid political participation cannot be fully assessed.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 6
 
 
 72
 The Popular National Assembly, elected for a five-year term in
 1980 from a party-approved list of candidates, is designated as
 the supreme organ of the Government. In fact, most day-to-day
 decisions are delegated to the Council of Ministers. The
 Assembly meets twice yearly in sessions at which earlier party/
 government decisions appear to be ratified. Although issues are
 debated openly with critical interventions reported in the media,
 earlier policy decisions made by the Council of Ministers are not
 reversed. Deputies responding to the real or perceived interests
 of their individual constituencies which may be at variance with
 government actions feel free to criticize government policies
 and decisions and do so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government in the past has permitted visits by private
 organizations to check on conditions of persons convicted for
 politically related offenses. There are no known instances in
 which the Government has been the subject of resolutions,
 investigations, or other human rights actions by official inter-
 national organizations. A few Cape Verdean emigrants living
 abroad have fairly consistently made charges of human rights
 violations, which may have affected internal policies, given the
 Government's major effort to maintain close relations with the
 large communities of Cape Verdean emigrants around the world.
 There are no known internal official or non-governmental human
 rights organizations in the country.
 Except in areas of specific interest, such as apartheid in South
 Africa or the situation in East Timor, the Government does not
 appear to play an activist role in international efforts to
 improve human rights. In 1983 Amnesty International expressed
 concern about alleged mistreatment of 18 civilians accused of
 crimes against state security and about their trial in a
 military court in 1982. They are now serving sentences imposed
 by this court. Freedom House rates Cape Verde "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government gives a high priority to the prevention of famine,
 which has been averted since independence through food aid
 provided primarily by Western countries. Up to 20 percent of
 donated emfrgency food is distributed free to the old, infirm,
 or others unable to work. The remainder is sold under the terms
 of agreement with the donor and the proceeds used in development
 projects. The Government also has given priority to emergency
 development programs, financed primarily by foreign grants, to
 provide jobs for agricultural workers displaced by drought.
 Water and soil conservation programs and road and school
 construction are emphasized. According to official figures,
 only 27 percent of the population has direct access to water;
 75 percent lack sewage or waste disposal. Primary school
 attendance (ages 7 to 12) has increased 300 percent since inde-
 pendence and is now available to about 80 percent of this group.
 Nonetheless, school conditions continue to be characterized by
 overcrowded classrooms and a paucity of trained teachers.
 Over the past 150 years, recurrent droughts and high unemployment
 (currently about 33 percent) have led to emigration, resulting
 in a large Cape Verdean overseas population estimated at about
 
 
 78
 500,000, of whom some 300,000 live in the United States.
 Emigrant remittances and official aid account for two-thirds of
 the country's gross national product (GNP). (U.S. food and
 development aid since independence exceeds $50 million.) Per
 capita GNP is estimated at about $300. The population of
 Cape Verde is about 300,000 and growing at a rate of 1.2 percent
 a year. With an infant mortality rate estimated at 96 per
 1,000 live births, and an overall death rate in 1980 of eight
 per thousand, life expectancy at birth is 61 years. The adult
 literacy rate is 37 percent.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde, where the
 vast majority of the population shares various proportions of
 Portuguese-African ancestry. Sex discrimination exists socio-
 logically, although banned by the constitution, because many of
 the traditional, male-oriented values of the Portuguese and
 African ancestors of today's Cape Verdeans are still part of
 the country's culture. Women have been customarily excluded
 from certain types of work, and are often paid less than men
 for comparable work. The Government has included women in the
 labor-intensive economic development projects financed by
 foreign grants. Both the Government and the party are making
 efforts to bring women into various economic and social
 activities where they have been traditionally absent. The
 Organization of Cape Verdean Women was founded in 1980, with
 party encouragement, to sensitize the Government and Cape
 Verdeans on issues affecting women. The Code of the Family,
 enacted in October 1981, prescribes full legal equality of men
 and women, including equal pay for equal work.
