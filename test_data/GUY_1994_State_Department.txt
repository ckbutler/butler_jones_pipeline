 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations
 and the Caribbean Community (Caricom), is a small, multiracial developing nation
 with a unicameral Parliament chosen by direct election in a multiparty political sys-
 tem. Dr. Cheddi Jagan, leader of the majority party in Parliament, is Executive
 President. He appoints the Prime Minister and other ministers. Local and inter-
 national observers generally agreed that the 1992 general elections and the 1994
 municipal elections were free and fair.
 The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) and the Guyana Police Force (GPF) comprise
 the security forces. The GPF has primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order throughout Guyana. The police and security forces are subordinate to the Gov-
 ernment. Low pay and a high vacancy rate undermined the ability of the police force
 to carry out its functions, and the Guyana Human Rights Association charged GPF
 members with brutality and shootings.
 Although the economy is largely agricultural, with sugar and rice important ex-
 port earners, gold mimng and timber production are fast-growing industries. De-
 spite 4 straight years of annual economic growth between 6.0 and 8.3 percent, the
 per capita gross domestic product was only about $640. The economy suffers from
 high external debt, shortages of skilled labor, and a deteriorating infrastructure.
 Human rights problems continued to include police abuse of detainees and pris-
 oners, severe delays in the inefficient judicial system, societal violence against
 women and children, and discrimination against the indigenous Amerindians. Police
 abuses were often committed with impunity, and the Police Complaints Authority
 is largely ineffective because it lacks independent power. There are still some limita-
 tions on worker rights, but political control of union activity has diminished.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There was one extrajudicial killing by a member of a community police group (pri-
 vate citizens patrolling their neighborhoods). Rural Police Sergeant Lall (an Indo-
 Guyanese) shot and killed Kenny France (an Afro-Guyanese). Police said that
 France was shot when he and others attempted to prevent Lall and three others
 from arresting France's stepson. As a result, the Guyana Human Rights Association
 (GHRA) charged that the community policing concept was "out of control" and de-
 plored the "untrained citizens" groups increasing access to firearms. According to
 the Minister of Home Affairs, the GPF provides some training and equipment to
 community police groups and often conducts joint patrols with them.
 An alleged extrajudicial killing involved the death of Shivnarine Dalchand, who
 died while in police custody. Police claim Dalchand drowned while attempting to es-
 cape but subsequently said he was rescued but died later. GHRA said this version
 of his death was "challenged by family and eyewitnesses." A post mortem showed
 cause of death to be pulmonary edema, and no additional evidence confirmed this
 to be an extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degraing Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, the GHRA and the press reported a rise
 in the number of reports of police brutality, including beatings and deliberate
 shootings during arrest and detention. The Police Complaints Authority (PCA) sent
 131 complaints to the Police Commissioner, however, this figure includes complaints
 of corruption as well as brutality.
 For example, in August police arrested Sean Austin on a charge of armed robbery.
 The police claimed they shot Austin after he attempted to attack a police officer
 
 
 416
 with a knife. Newspapers cited eyewitnesses as saying the police shot Austin in the
 thigh without provocation, and them shot him twice more in the shoulder and stom-
 ach. Austin survived the shooting and is awaiting trial on a charge of armed rob-
 beiy. There apparently was no further investigation into the shooting.
 In September principal magstrate Paul Fung-a-fat dismissed charges of stealing
 amnumtion against GDF soldier Sean Goodluc, saying he had seen a letter which
 confirmed that Gooduck was beaten while in GDF custody. Gooduck suffered a bro-
 ken arm. The authorities presented no evidence against Gooduck in court, except
 confessions made by three other defendants, all unrepresented by legal counsel. Al-
 though the magistrate dismissed the charges, the GD'F found Goodluck "unsuitable
 for continued military service" and discharged him. They also discharged the GDF
 member who beat him. This was the only allegation of human rights abuse against
 the Guyana Defence Force in recent years.
 Also in September, four police officers were accused of raping a woman who went
 to the police mounted branch in Georgetown seeking police assistance. The authori-
 ties subsequently charged and remanded for trial two of these officers.
 The GHRA alleged that police severely beat Leroy Marshall during the 5 days he
 was in custody before being charged with stealing two gold chains. The police deny
 that Marshall was beaten.
 As in previous years, confessions were occasionally thrown out of court on the
 grounds that they were coerced. The GHRA announced on September 1 that in the
 preceding week it had received 17 complaints of police brutality and shootings from
 various parts of the country, more than in any other single week in its 15-year his-
 tory. The body charged with looking into complaints of police brutality or abuse, the
 Police  omplaints Authority (PCA) has no power to interview  lice officers or wit-
 nesses, and must rely on materia submitted by the police. The government Om-
 budsman lacks the authority to look into allegations of police misconduct.
 In 1993 the Government reported that it charged and placed before the courts 18
 members of the Police Force for criminal offenses including murder, manslaughter,
 rape, robbery, and corruption. (No figures were yet available for 1994.) When they
 brig charges against officers as a result of complaints to the PCA or through other
 means, the authorities routinely suspend them for a few days. If convicted, the
 courts sometimes fine them and order dismissal from their jobs, but rarely impose
 jail sentences for their offenses. In essence, the police force is responsible for inves-
 tigating itself and failed to do so effectively, with the result that members of the
 police force commit abuses with impunity. The PCA reported that in 1993 the Com-
 missioner of Police did not respond to 69 of the 131 complaints (which include cor-
 ruption and other allegations apart from brutality) which it sent for investigation.
 The prison in Georgetown is severely overcrowded and houses only men. Poor
 diet, inadequate medical attention, and underpaid and poorly trained staff charac-
 terize the prison system. After sentencing, all women prisoners are held in the sole
 women's prison in New Amsterdam. The facility's isolated location and lack of ade-
 quate staff make it difficult for family members from other parts of the country to
 visit. Except for the prison at New Amsterdam, prison visiting committees, which
 check on conditions in prisons, were inactive in 1994. Prison authorities continued
 to show receptivity to suggestions for improvement in the prisons and cooperated
 with the GHRA in projects to provide occupational training for some prisoners. The
 GHRA participated in training courses for new prison officers, continuing education
 programs for veteran officers, and discussions on civic education topics with pris-
 oners.
 d. Arbitrarq Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention. The authorities generally respected
 this mandate in practice.
 The law does not require that a court official issue an arrest warrant; a police
 officer may make an arrest based upon an assessment of guilt. The law requires
 that a person arrested and held for more than 48 hours be brought before a court
 to be charged. In practice, the authorities sometimes hold prisoners more than 48
 hours without bringing charges.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial--The Constitution provides that anyone charged
 with a criminal offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law, and the authori-
 ties respect this right in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail system, except in
 murder cases. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal may be made to
 higher courts.
 However, the inefficiency of the judicial system is so great as to undermine due
 process. Shortages of trained court administrative personnel and magistrates, inad-
 equate resources, low salary levels, and the slowness of police in getting cases ready
 
 
 417
 for trial cause extensive delays in judicial proceedings. As a result, the authorities
 often detained prisoners for 3 or 4 years while awaiting trial
 Although the law recognizes the right to legal counsel, in practice, with the excep-
 tion of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford topay. The court
 assigns an attorney to defendants in murder cases. Otherwise, virtually no lawyers
 work pro bono in criminal cases. A small group of lawyers set up a legal aid clinic
 in 1994, but it focuses mainly on civil cases. The Guyana Association of Women
 Lawyers also provides free legal services for civil cases only.
 There are no political prisoners or special courts for political security cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the right to privacy, although some opposition politi-
 cians have claimed instances of government surveillance of political meetings and
 rallies. (Uniformed police officers are routinely present at such rallies.) Police gen-
 erally respected the laws requiring judicially issued search warrants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities generally respected the constitu-
 tional provision for freedom of speech, and Guyanese freely criticize their government
 and its policies.
 The Government's role in the media declined greatly due to the increased avail-
 ability of nongovernment-owned newspapers and the rapid growth of independent
 television. Independent and opposition newspapers frequently criticized the Govern-
 ment in editorials and satirized it in cartoons.
 The government-owned Guyana Television and the two radio stations controlled
 by the government-owned Guyana Broadcasting Corporation offer relatively even-
 handed reporting of local events. Guyana has no private radio stations, but there
 are seven private television stations in Georgetown, and several more in outlying
 towns. Two of the private television stations produce independent newscasts, and
 a third station offers frequent public affairs programming which is often critical of
 the Government.
 There were no restrictions on academic freedom in 1994.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act requires
 police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commissioner has the author-
 ity to refuse permission for a public meeting at his discretion and without expla-
 nation. There was no evidence that he used this authority for political purposes. Po-
 litical parties and other groups held public meetings and rallies throughout the
 country without hindrance in the course of hard-fought municipal and local elec-
 tions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths worship freely. There are no restrictions on foreign religious
 groups proselytizing in Guyana and foreign missionaries work in the country with-
 out hindrance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission, the result of a law dat-
 ing from colonial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. In
 practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas without a permit. Guy-
 anese are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Voters choose members of the unicameral Parliament by direct election in a
 multiparty political system based on proportional representation. The leader of the
 party which obtains a plurality of seats in Parliament during national elections is
 sworn in as Executive   rsident. The President appoints a Cabinet, headed by a
 Prime Minister, which together with the President exercises executive power.
 Guyanese are free to join or support political parties of their choice. Any citizen
 18 years or older may register to vote. L   and foreign observers gnerally consid-
 ered the 1992 national elections, as well as the 1994 municipal and local elections
 in most parts of the countr, to be free, fair, and open.
 There are no legal impeents to women or minorities participating in the politi-
 calprcess, but in practice the indigenous Amerindian minority as  ttle influence
 on decisions affecting its interests (see Section 5). The Cabinet includes two women,
 two persons of Portuguese descent, one of Chinese origin, eight of East Indian ex-
 traction, four Afro-Guyanese, and one Amerindian. The 65-member Parliament in-
 cludes 12 women and 3 Amerindians, representing both major parties. Following the
 1994 municipal elections, a woman became deputy mayor of the capital city of
 Georgetown.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference in 1994. The GHRA is a nongovern-
 mental organization formed in 1979 with the participation of trade unions profes-
 sional organizations, various ethnic groups, and churches. It issues periodic press
 releases and publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. The Govern-
 ment made no official statements on either GHRA or foreign human rights reports.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons in Guyana regard-
 less of race, sex, religion, or national origin.
 Women.-In principle, the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex and commits the Government to ensure equal pay for equal work. However, a
 1988 government-sponsored constitutional amendment rendered the equal pay pro-
 vision unenforceable except in cases in which equal pay for equal work is provided
 for by specific statute. No such statutes have been enacted. Increased activity by
 women's groups led to heightened awareness of sexual harassment. A mining com-
 pany dismissed four men accused of sexually harassing a teenage girl, and m No-
 vember a businessman was charged with indecent assault for alleged sexual harass-
 ment of a female employee. Dismissal because of pregnancy is both legal and com-
 mon.
 Legislation protects women's property rights under common-law marriage, enti-
 tling a woman who separates or divorces to one-half the couple's propr  if she had
 been working and one-third the property if she had been a housewie. However, di-
 vorce by consent remains illegal and there are unequal provisions regarding adul-
 tery as grounds for divorce. The legislation also gave authority to the courts to over-
 turn a man's will in the event it did not provide for his wife.
 Violence against women and children, including domestic violence, is a significant
 problem. Wife beating, rape, and incest are common, but victims rarely report such
 crimes to the authorities. Victims of such abuse who do seek redress from the police
 and the courts often suffer social retribution and additional harassment from the
 authorities charged with pursuing their claims. Because of their economic cir-
 cumstances and the lack of any family shelters or other place of solace victims of
 domestic violence are often trapped in their homes with their abusers. In one case
 in Georgetown in March a man stabbed his common-law wife and threw her into
 a ditch. He was charged with attempted murder, but was discharged by a court
 after his wife pleaded for his release, saying that she could not support their seven
 children without him.
 Children.-An estimated 65 to 86 percent of the population lives in poverty, and
 children are more severely affected than any other group. The severe deterioration
 of the public education and health care systems has stunted children's futures and
 often cut short their lives. Children's lives are also adversely affected by migration.
 Over 3 percent of Guyana's population emigrates every year in search of a brighter
 economic future. As parents migrate, particularly wen planning to enter other
 countries illegally, they often leave their children behind to be raised by other fam-
 ily members, friends, or by other children. The administration of justice for children
 is characterized by a punitive legal system which does not take into account the
 needs of children suffering sexual, physical, or emotional abuse.
 Indigenous People.-The small Amerindian population is composed of nine tribal
 groups, most living in reservations and villages in remote parts of the interior. Their
 standard of living is much lower than that of most Guyanese, and their ability to
 participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation
 of natural resources is limited.
 The Amerindian Act regulates Amerindian life, and is legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation.
 The Act gives the Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and
 what is an Amerindian community, to appoint Amerindian leaders, and to cancel
 or annul decisions made by Amerindian councils. It also prohibits the sale of alcohol
 to Amerindians and requires government permission before any Amerindian can ac-
 cept formal employment, although these provisions generally are not enforced. Both
 individuals and Amerindian groups remain free to criticize the Government. In
 April representatives from all Amerindian communities and tribes met with govern-
 ment officials, including President Jagan, to discuss Amerindian problems.
 In December 1993 Parliament appointed a select committee to recommend revi-
 sions to the Amerindian Act to make it more democratic and enhance Amerindian
 self-determination. Through September, the committee had met only twice. The
 
 
 419
 Minister of Amerindian Affairs, himself an Amerindian, lacks a staff and separate
 budget.
 During its first 2 years in office, the Jagan administration did not distribute any
 land titles to Amerindians, arguing that the land must first be surveyed. The Gov-
 ernment still holds title to 90 percent of the lands claimed by Amerindians and
 through the Amerindian Act may repossess land titles already distributed if it deter-
 mines that it is in the Amerindians interest. The Government is negotiating with
 foreign mining and timber companies for additional concessions on Amerindan-oc-
 cupied land. Amerindians displaced by timber and mining operations in such cases
 have no legal recourse. The Barama company, owned by South Korean and Malay-
 sian investors, continued to develop its 4.2-million-acre timber concession in an area
 where 1,200 Amerindians live, only 550 of them in government-recognized villages.
 The remainder, scattered along rivers in the concession, have no legal protection for
 their homesteads.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Longstanding ethnic tensions, primarily be-
 tween Guyanese of African and East Indian descen, continued to influence uya-
 nese society and political life. The civil service and defense and police forces are
 overwhelmingly staffed by Afro-Guyanese. Recruitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guy-
 anese candidates for the uniformed services generally have met with an
 unenthusiastic response, with most qualified Indo-Guyanese candidates optig for a
 business or professional career over military, police, or public service. The Chief of
 Staff of the Guyana Defence Force and the Deputy Commissioner of Police, however,
 are Indo-Guyanese, and there are other Indo-Guyanese officers in both services.
 People With Disabilities.-Guyana has several special schools and training centers
 for the disabled, but like the rest of the educational system these are understaffed
 and in severe disrepair. The lack of appropriate infrastructure to provide accessibil-
 ity to both public and private facilities makes it veiy difficult to employ the disabled
 outside their homes. There is no law mandating prvision of access for people with
 disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of association
 and specifically enumerates a worker's right to "form or belong to trade unions." The
 law does not require employers to recognze a union in the workplace, even if a large
 majority of workers have indicated their desire to be represented by a union. The
 Minister of Labour sent a new trade union recognition bill to the Attorney General
 for comment in 1993, and the Government presented the bill to Parliament in De-
 cember 1994.
 Most union members work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises. Or-
 ganized labor freely associates in one major national federation, the Guyana Trades
 Union Congress enuC), composed of 22 unions. There is a tradition of close ties be-
 tween the trade union movement and political parties. Historically, the two major
 political parties wielded significant influence over the leadership of a number of
 unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles as party officials.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike, but the law nominally forbids
 public employees providing essential services from striking (a procedure exists for
 the review orfthir grievances by a tribunal appointed by the Minister of Labour).
 However, this rule is not enforced, and employees in essential services went on
 strike three times during the first 9 months of 1994.
 Most strikes in 1994 were illegal, ie., the union leadership did not approve them
 or they did not meet the requirements specified in collective bargaining agreements.
 The newly emergent private sector fired workers on three occasions for engaging in
 ille  industrial actions, but they were usually reinstated after the strike was set-
 Unions and their federations freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean
 and international trade union and professional groups. All three of the major inter-
 national trade union federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Ministry of Labour certifies all collective bargaining agreements
 and has never refused to do so. This right is not codified, however, and employers
 are not legally required to recognize unions or bargain with them.
 Individual unions directly negotiate collective bargaining status, pursuant to the
 1993 repeal of a regulation which required that al[ ollective baraining be n
 tiated through the TUC. Unions remain unhappy with the prvision granting the
 Ministry of Finance veto power over wage contracts negotiated by other ministries.
 In one case, the Ministry of Finance forced the Ministry of Public Service to renege
 on a contract the latter signed with the four principal public service unions by an-
 
 
 nouncing that the Government did not have the funds to pay promised wage in-
 creases.
 The Chief Labour Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labour provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. The Ministry of Labour certified 50 col-
 lective bargaining agreements in the first 9 months of 1994, up from 47 for all of
 1993. The Ministry has a backlog of cases, and insufficient manpower and transpor-
 tation severely limit the Ministry's ability to carry out its function.
 The Ministry of Labour investigated possible antiunion discrimination at Con-
 tinental Industries. Continental was accused of denying would-be union organizers
 access to workers and of firing workers engaged in union organization.
 Union leaders make credible charges that workers attempting to unionize work-
 places are frequently harassed and intimidated and that the Ministry does not expe-
 ditiously investigate complaints that employers dismiss workers when confronted
 with union organizing efforts. There is no legal mechanism to require employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination to rehire employees fired for union activi-
 ties.
 Guyana has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Factories Act and the Em-
 ployment of Young Persons and Children Act set out minimum age requirements.
 Legally, no person under 14 years of age may be employed in any industrial under-
 taking, and no person under 16 may be employed at night, except under regulated
 circumstances. The law permits children under age 14 to be employed only in enter-
 prises in which members of the same family are employed. Poverty-stricken young
 children work, however, and it is common throughout the country to see very young
 children engaged in street trading. While cognizant of the situation, the Ministry
 of Labour does not employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government establishes a public sector
 minimum wage which was the equivalent of $4.00 per day as of July 1. The Labour
 Act and the Wages Councils Act allow the Labour Ministry to set minimum wages
 for various categories of private employers.
 The Government raised official minimum wages by over 400 percent in November
 1993; it set the minimum wage for unskilled workers at the equivalent of $0.17 per
 hour. Both the legal _minimum wage for the private sector and the public sector min-
 imum wage are insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a family. There
 is no enforcement mechanism, and unorganized workers, particularly women and
 children, are frequently paid less than what is legally required.
 The Shops Act and the Factories Act set hours of employment, which vary by in-
 dustry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day or a 44-hour week
 requires payment of an overtime rate; however, if the initial contract stipulates a
 48-hour workweek, then the overtime rate only applies to hours worked in excess
 of 48 hours. The law does not provide for at least one 24-hour rest period.
 The Factories Act also sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The GO-
 cupation Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labour is charged with con-
 ducting factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Workers cannot remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
