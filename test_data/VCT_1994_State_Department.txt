 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organization of Eastern Car-
 ibbean States, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a parliamentary democracy. Prime
 Minister James F. Mitchell and his New Democratic Party (NDP) returned to power
 for an unprecedented third term in free and fair elections held in February.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police, the only security force in the country, includes a
 Coast Guard and a small Special Services Unit with some paramilitary training.
 The force is controlled by and responsive to the Government, but there continued
 to be occasional reports of the use of force and other extralegal means to elicit con-
 fessions from suspects.
 St. Vincent has a young population, a high rate of illiteracy, and serious unem-
 ployment, possibly as high as 40 percent. The leading export product is bananas,
 which also represents the major source of foreign exchange earnings. The banana
 industry throughout the Windward Islands suffered a severe downturn in 1993-94,
 and St. Vincent has not escaped the negative impact. Efforts toward nontraditional
 economic diversification met with some success in new agricultural products, luxuy
 tourism expansion, and in some industrial sectors.
 The countrys human rights problems continued to include police use of physical
 abuse to extract confessions, the Government's failure to punish those involved in
 such abuse, inadequate and overcrowded prisons, and an overburdened court sys-
 tm.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From
 a. Political and Other Extrra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Tortu and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forma of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and there were no reports of such practices. However, a
 very high percentage of convictions (estimated at 90 percent by the regional human
 rights group, Caribbean Rights) continue to be based on confessions. Many of these
 confessions resulted from unwarranted police practices, including physical abuse
 during detention, illegal search and seizure, and not properly informing those ar-
 rested of their rights. There were no known instances of the Government trying,
 convicting, and punishing police officers involved in such abuses.
 There is no independent review bard to monitor police activity and to hear public
 complaints about police misconduct. Caribbean Rights has advocated such a board
 to protect the rights of citizens complaining of these activities.
 a     nadequate and overcrowded prisons remain a serious problem. These conditions
 are particularly harsh for juvenile offenders. There is a small facility for delinquent
 boys, but it is seriously inadequate and is generally used for those alrady convicted
 through the criminal system. In one case police forced three youths aged 13, 14, and
 15 to sit in a police station for nearly 2 days awaiting processing of their case. Al-
 though separate legal statutes exist for youthful offenders there are no separate
 magistrates or prosecutors to hear these cases.
 d. Arbitraiy Arrest, Detention, or Eile.-The Constitution provides for persons de-
 tained for criminal offenses to receive a fair hearing within a reasonable time by
 an impartial court. The Government made progress in addressing the problem of
 slow administration of justice resulting from a backlog of cases in 1993 by increas-
 ing the number of magistrates from two to four. While this reduced the backlog,
 complaints remain regarding police practices in bringig cases to court. Some de-
 fense attorneys claim this has caused 6- to 12-month delays in preliminary inquiries
 for serious crimes.
 There were no reports of instances of arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile.
 e. Denial   Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for public trials before
 an independent and impartial court. The court appoints attrneys for indigent d-
 fendants only when the defendant is charged with a capital offense. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty and may appeal cases to a regional high
 court system and ultimately to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are
 no sepaate security or military court systems. There are no politicapisners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary search and seizure or other government intrusions
 into the private life of individual citizens, and there   no reports of such abuses.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. There are two major newspapeand nd numerous smaller, partisan
 publications; all are privately owned, and most are openly critical of the Govern-
 ment's policies. There were no reports of government censorship or interference with
 the operation the he press. Opposition political parties had equal access to all forms
 of media during the 1994 elections.
 The lone television station in St. Vinent is privately owned and operates without
 government interference. The Government controls programmin     or the govern-
 ment-owned radio station. There are no call-in talk shows; the Government canceled
 such a show in 1988, claiming it was politically slanted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Reltgion.-All religions are free to practice and proselytize. The
 Constitution provides protection for these rights.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights and the authorities honor them in
 practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through regularly scheduled
 free and fair elections. St. Vincent has a long history of multiparty parliamentary
 democracy. During the 1994 campaign, the two opposition parties united to chal-
 lenge the ruling New Democratic Party. The effort was successful to the extent that
 the "Unity" coalition won 3 of 15 parliamentary seats-the NDP held all 15 prior
 to the election. Since the new Parliament convened, the opposition complained that
 the ruling party has not complied with what the opposition asserts is a constitu-
 tional obligation to answer questions it puts forth. Two separate cases of voting
 irregularities were filed against the Government following the 1994 elections, but
 the courts found them to be groundless.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Opposition political groups and the Vincentian press often comment on human
 rights matters of local concern. The St. Vincent Human Rights Association, affiliated
 with the regional body Caribbean Rights, closely monitors government and police ac-
 tivities, especially with respect to treatment of prisoners, publicizing any cases of
 abuse. The Government is generally responsive to public and private inquiries about
 its human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law regardless of race,
 sex, or religion, and the Government adheres to this provision.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs in St. Vincent, but the Government has
 failed to take steps to determine the seriousness of the problem. Although some vic-
 tims of domestic violence are reluctant to press charges, women were increasingly
 willing to report such incidents to police and the National Council of Women. Pen-
 alties for violent crimes against women are identical to those involving acts of as-
 sault perpetrated against men. Depending on the magnitude of the offense and the
 age of the victim, the penalty for rape is generally 10 or more years in prison. There
 are no mechanisms to enforce support payments by men who father children-legiti-
 mately or otherwise.
 The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Women's Affairs has a women's desk which
 assists the National Council of Women with seminars, training programs, and pub-
 lic relations. The minimum wage law specifies that women should receive equal pay
 for equal work.
 Chddren.-The Social Welfare Office is the government agency responsible for
 monitoring and protecting the welfare of children. The police are the enforcement
 arm-the Social Welfare Office refers all reports of child abuse to the police for ac-
 tion. Marion House, a social services agency established by the Catholic Church in
 1989, provides counseling and therapy services. Its director said that the problem
 of child abuse is still underreported. The legal age of consent in St. Vincent is 15.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation covering those with dis-
 abilities. Most severely handicapped people rarely leave their homes because of the
 poor road system and ack of affordable wheelchairs. The Government partially sup-
 
 
 ports a school for the disabled which has two branches. A separate, small rehabilita-
 tion center treats about five persons daily.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law, Vincentians have the right to form unions,
 organize employees, and strike; these rights are generally respectedd in practice.
 However, there is no legislation for compulsory recognition of trade unions, and-
 given the high level of unemployment-participation in unions has decreased to
 about 10 percent of the work force. Several existing unions united in 1994 to form
 a new union, the National Congress of Labour. This move toward unification reflects
 the need for unions to combine in order to survive. There were no major strikes in
 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no legal obstacles
 to organizing unions; however, no law requires employers to recognize a particular
 union as an exclusive bargaining agent. Some companies offer packages of benefits
 with terms of employment better than, or comparable to, what a union can normally
 obtain through negotiations. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers against union members and orgamzers. Generally effective mechanisms exist for
 resolving complaints. The authorities can order employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination for firing workers without cause (including for participation in union
 activities) to reinstate the workers.
 There are no export processing zones in St. Vincent.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law sets the minimum work-
 ing age at 16, although a worker must be 18 to receive a national insurance card.
 The labor inspection office of the Ministry of Labour monitors and enforces this pro-
 vision, and employers generally respect it in practice. There is no known child labor
 except for children working on family-owned banana plantations, particularly during
 harvest time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, which were last
 promulgated in 1989. They vary by sector and type of work and are specified for
 several skilled categories, including attendants, packers, cleaners, porters, watch-
 men and clerks. In agriculture the wage for workers provided shelter is $0.82
 (EC$2.25) per hour, skilled industrial workera earn $7.36 (EC$20) per day, and un-
 skilled workers earn $3.68 (EC$10) per day. In many sectors the minimum wage
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for workers and their families,
 but most workers earn more than the minimum. There is no legislation concerning
 the length of the workweek; however, the generalapractice is to work 40 hours in
 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks.
 According to the Ministry of Labour, legislation concerning occupational safety
 and health is outdated. The most recent legislation, the Factories Act of 1955, has
 some regulations concerning only factories, but enforcement of these regulations is
 ineffective due to a lack ofinspectors. Workers can remove themselves from dan-
 gerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
