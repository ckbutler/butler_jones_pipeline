 MALDIVES,
 Maldives is a far-flung country of 153,000 people
 spread over some 1200 islands in the Indian Ocean; the
 capital (Male) is 400 miles from its nearest neighbor,
 Sri Lanka. The country was governed as a hereditary
 sultanate for centuries. A British protectorate from
 1887 to 1965, Maldives in the past several decades experi-
 mented with various forms of government, including an
 elected sultanate and republicanism. The present system
 provides for a strong executive president, assisted by a
 council of ministers, and an elected parliament, called
 "majlis," with legislative powers. Economic and political
 power are concentrated in the hands of a small traditional
 elite. Personal and authoritarian rule has historically
 been the norm, and Maldives' Islamic society traditionally
 has been governed by the principles of sharia law. The
 modern constitution of 1968 guarantees basic human rights,
 but in the political sphere in particular these concepts
 are new to Maldives and their practice is in a state of
 evolution. Maldives, on June 26, 1981, celebrated the
 golden jubilee of its majlis. In July 1981 President
 Gayoom suggested a model for a new constitution formulated
 by scholars and foreign legal experts. The president's
 submission was in compliance with a motion passed by the
 majlis in 1979 seeking a new constitution which would more
 accurately define the powers of the president and the
 separation of powers among the presidency, the majlis
 and the judiciary. Economically, Maldives has been
 experiencing rapid modernization in the past few years.
 The government is committed to providing basic human
 needs and improving the quality of life, in a country
 which is listed by the United Nations as one of the
 world's poorest.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Under the Maldivian constitution, no person may be
 penalized except as convicted under sharia law (Islamic
 code) or on conditions specified by law, and "under no
 circumstances can an injury be inflicted." The government
 does not condone torture. There were no known allegations
 of torture during 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no prisons in Maldives; there is a
 "detention center." The population of Maldives is very
 small, and residential communities are often restricted
 to a single island where everyone knows everyone. Crimes
 of violence are relatively rare. Common forms of
 punishment for crimes are fines, payment of compensation,
 house arrest and banishment to a sparsely inhabited island
 where the person must earn his own living under the
 watchful eye of authorities. Severe forms of corporal
 punishment provided for in sharia law are not imposed in
 Maldives.

 c. Disappearance
 There were no known allegations of abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detention by official or quasi-
 official security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Maldives has a long history of banishing influential
 persons for political reasons. Often such persons later
 returned to positions of power and responsibility (such
 as the present Maldives representative to the UN). Ten
 persons associated with the former regime have been
 sentenced to banishment or house arrest on charges related
 to security of the state or creating disaffection toward
 the government. Several persons, including former president
 Ibrahim Nasir, who is resident in Singapore, have been
 under the investigation on charges that they fomented an
 aborted coup in 1980, employing foreign mercenaries.
 Maldives radio reported September 7 that Nasir would be
 tried in absentia in Maldives' high court, on charges of
 alleged misappropriation and embezzlement of government
 funds. No official figure on detention or banishment after
 conviction are available. In a July 1980 press interview
 a high government official said that 15 persons were under
 arrest at the time in relation to the coup attempt: nine
 in detention, five under house arrest and one in exile. In
 April 1981, three of the alleged coup leaders were con-
 victed of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment.
 Amnesty International expressed concern over these persons'
 lack of access to family or counsel during the year before
 their trial and their lack of access to legal counsel during
 the proceedings. Others were questioned and released.
 According to law, a suspect may be detained for two weeks
 or placed under house arrest while a case is being investi-
 gated. By authority of the president, detentions may be
 extended another month. In practice, it appears suspects
 are detained for longer periods in some cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system of Maldives is derived from traditional
 Islamic law, but a body of civil law is developing to meet
 circumstances of modernization. The system is administered
 by secular officials: a chief justice, lesser judges and
 legal officials known as "qazis", who are trained in Male
 and assigned to islands throughout the country. The govern-
 ment has established a high court to try major cases. Legal
 officials are appointed by the president and function under
 the ministry of justice; there is also an attorney general.
 In the islands, hearings are open to the public, the accused
 has the right to defend himself, proceedings are recorded,
 and there is a right of appeal to the central government in
 Male.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 According to the constitution, private premises and
 dwelling places shall be respected and shall not be tres-
 passed, save under conditions stipulated by law. There are
 no reports of practices to the contrary.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Maldivian constitution provides that every person
 has freedom of speech, press, assembly and association, so
 long as provisions of sharia and civil law are not
 contravened. However, there does not appear to be a tra-
 dition of exercising certain of these freedoms, such as
 that of assembly, and there is some government sensitivity
 about others. The number of newspapers in Maldives is
 limited; there is no prior censorship, although all publi-
 cations must be registered with the government. Newspapers
 exercise self-censorship, since journalists are subject to
 prosecution if articles are deemed to contravene such laws
 as one prohibiting arousal of ill feelings against a law-
 fully formed government. Maldives is an Islamic state. A
 Maldivian citizen is, by definition, a Muslim; other
 religions are not proscribed, but there are no places of
 worship for religions other than Islam. Associations such
 as clubs, parties and companies which do not contravene
 rules of behavior prescribed by sharia and civil law are
 permitted, but must register with the government. There
 are no trade unions, nor have there been any known efforts
 to form them.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to travel within and outside their
 country. The government discourages Maldivians from changing
 islands of residence primarily in order to contain growth
 in over-populated Male, where more than 20 percent of the
 population now lives. Wide dispersal of population is
 economically inefficient and makes provisions of services
 difficult, but the government is determined not to mandate
 consolidation of population on larger islands. Instead it
 hopes to attract voluntary relocation through making the
 islands more attractive and bringing services to the people.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no organized political parties in Maldives.
 Candidates stand for election to the citizens' majlis, or
 parliament. Political rallies are not the custom, and
 candidates campaign on the basis of personal approaches.
 Participation in the political system is open to all citi-
 zens 21 years of'age or older. Women have the vote and
 hold political office. The presidency is limited to men,
 and the president is chosen by the majlis and then confirmed
 or rejected in a national referendum by secret ballot.
 Islamic and Maldivian traditions limit women's role in
 society and political process, but women who wish to do so
 share in the country's educational and modernizing efforts
 and serve as government officials and as delegates to
 conferences abroad.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no known requests for outside investi-
 gations of any alleged violations of human rights in the
 Maldives. There are no local human rights organizations.

 4. Economic and Social Conditions
 The 153,000 Maldivians live in communities of from
 several hundred to as many as 1,000 persons on some 200
 islands scattered the 512-mile length and 81-mile breadth
 of the country. The economic base of Maldives is limited,
 with no natural resources except fishing grounds. Fishing
 is the main source of individual income; agriculture is
 minimal (mainly coconut-growing), and basic food staples
 such as rice, sugar, and meat have to be imported.
 Maldives is considered one of the least developed of the
 developing countries, a status borne out by its relatively
 low life expectancy at birth (47 years) and high infant
 mortality rate (121 per 1000 live births). Only 15 percent
 of the total population of Maldives (54 percent in urban
 areas) is considered to have access to safe water. The
 government is. making strenuous efforts to spread its
 limited health facilities to the outer atolls with the aim
 of having a community health center on the main islands of
 each of 19 atolls.
 With a calorie supply available for consumption of
 90 percent of nutritional requirements (up from 81 percent
 in 1969-71), malnutrition is not a major problem, but the
 variety and quality of food leaves much to be desired. Many
 fruits and vegetables are imported by the central and
 northern atolls, because reliable transportation from the
 fruit- and vegetable-growing southern atolls is virtually
 nonexistent. When the two ships financed by the O~gani-
 zation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' fund are purchased
 and operating, severe problems of distribution between the
 undeveloped south and north and the relatively developed
 center will be significantly alleviated. The government
 has also been pursuing a program of enlarging and mechan-
 izing the traditional fishing fleet. The government is
 engaged in constructing and staffing primary schools and
 nonformal education centers on the main islands of the
 atolls, but the isolation of the remotest islands makes
 obtaining any kind of formal education extremely difficult.
 The only secondary schools are in the capital, Male.
 Recently an institute has been established (with an
 American director) which is preparing Maldivian llth and
 12th graders to take general college examination (advanced)
 examinations. There is no university in Maldives. While
 literacy is 82 percent overall according to the 1977
 census, the percentage of those who are considered to read
 at "satisfactory" or "very good" levels is 44 percent for
 men and 41 percent for women. Females are thus considered
 to participate almost equally in the education system. The
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio is 36..2 percent.
 The government sought to meet severe shortages of trained
 personnel by sending several promising students and govern-
 ment employees to India, the Middle East, and England for
 undergraduate and graduate study. Most, if not all, of
 these higher studies have been funded by the country enrol-
 ling the Maldivian student or an international organization.
 Dozens of teachers, mainly from Sri Lanka, have provided
 staff for schools in the capital of Male. The per capita
 GNP of Maldives was estimated by the World Bank in 1978 to
 be $160. with an economy basically dependent on traditional
 fishing (involving about 30 percent of the male population),
 harvesting coconuts.(for coir rope), and rudimentary sub-
 sistence farming in some of the atolls, there is little
 room for growth in the traditional sectors without an
 
 
 1049
 improved transportation and distribution system. A large
 proportion of the population is unemployed or under-
 employed, but the government is pursuing development in two
 relatively new sectors -- tourism and manufacturing -- in
 order to put people to work and generate badly needed
 foreign exchange. Maldives' economy was dealt a shock
 when the British pulled out of their air base in Gan
 (Addu atoll in the far south), terminating 3,000 Maldivian
 jobs. Most of the unemployed flocked to the capital, Male,
 severely crowding the city and straining social services.
 Crime became a problem for the first time in Maldives'
 history.
 With assistance of foreign governments and. inter-
 national agencies, the government is undertaking programs
 to improve the economy, foster rural development (AID is
 funding an integrated development in the remote Raa
 atoll) and provide educational, health and social services
 to the people, particularly in the outer atolls. The
 government is committed to fulfilling basic human needs
 but must contend with budgetary constraints, inadequate
 trained manpower, and the dispersal of the small population
 over a wide area, making political and economic inte-
 gration always an upward struggle.
