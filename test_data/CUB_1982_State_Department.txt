 CUBA
 Cuba is a tightly controlled Marxist-Leninist state
 dominated by the Cuban Communist Party. Domestic and
 foreign policies are made by President Fidel Castro and a
 small elite within the Communist Party Political Bureau
 and Secretariat. A facade of participation in the
 political process has been erected by the party at the
 local level through a system of "popular* assemblies and
 mass organizations covering youth, women, workers, farmers
 and ubiquitous neighborhood "Committees for the Defense of
 the Revolution." In practice, however, the assemblies are
 permitted only to endorse prior decisions reached by the
 top party leadership. They have not expanded popular
 participation in the Government. The assemblies and mass.
 organizations provide participation only within tightly
 controlled and officially approved bounds.
 A major objective of the Cuban government since at least
 the mid-1970's has been institutionalization of the
 Marxist-Leninist system throughout  ll aspects of Cuban
 life. All pre-1959 political parties and organizations
 have disappeared or been restructured to fit within the
 mass organization network, thus ensuring individual
 subordination to and compliance with state policies.
 Opposition is not permitted and can result in punishment
 at the discretion of the-Government. Freedom House in its
 1982 report, noted that 'hundreds of thousands are
 formally discriminated against as opponents of the system.'
 Under the 1976 Constitution, the Government may restrict
 any right or freedom when exercised in 'opposition to the
 state.' Communist Party rule has thus imposed total
 domination by the Party leadership over the individual in
 all spheres of activity -- cultural, economic, and
 political. No public dissent is allowed. The press and
 media are organs of the Party or the state. Freedom of
 speech does not exist.
 The Cuban economy faces a period of prolonged belt-
 tightening, with the greatest effect likely to be felt by
 the average Cuban consumer. Although most Cubans have the
 basic necessities, the list of rationed food and consumer
 items is growing and shortages are common. unemployment
 is growing, and Cuba's poor economic prospects are a major
 source of discontent and emigration pressure.
 Emigration has been used traditionally as an "escape
 valve' to relieve domestic pressures. As a result of
 political and economic pressures, well over a million
 Cubans, more than 10% of the island's population, have
 fled their country in the past 24 years. An estimated
 200,000 persons still in Cuba have already applied to
 emigrate, despite the severe sanctions applied by the
 Government against anyone asking to leave, and the number
 of those wishing to depart but fearful of the regime's
 punishment may be between one and two million.
 Cuba has not shown itself open to moral suasion on human
 rights issues from international groups or foreign
 governments. Up to 1,000 political prisoners are still
 held in Cuban jails. Some Cubans who have become
 naturalized U.S. citizens and returned to Cuba have been
 seized and held incomunicado, and access by American
 consular officers is not permitted to such prisoners.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were allegations in 1981 and 1982 that several
 people, reportedly convicted of political offenses, had
 been executed. In its 1982 report Amnesty International
 expressed concern that the death penalty countinued to be
 imposed for politically-motivated offenses.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been several recent disappearances of American
 citizens of Cuban origin during family visits in Cuba.
 The Cuban Government does not recognize the United States
 citizenship of these dual nationals. It provides no
 information on detentions, arrests or custody of such
 persons and refuses to permit consular access to them by
 the US Interests Section. Under public pressure, the
 Cuban Government has sometimes responded only that such an
 individual is under suspicion, has been charged with
 %subversive" activities, or is "working for a foreign
 power.*
 c. Torture
 In spite of the fact that the Cuban Constitution
 proscribes torture and states that *the person who has
 been arrested or the prisoner is inviolable in his
 personal integrity,' credible reports of physical and
 psychological torture in 1982 have been made by current
 and former political prisoners. Reported practices,
 include prolonged maintenance of prisoners in the nude at
 low temperature and in complete darkness.
 d.Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In 1971, the Cuban authorities implemented a plan to
 replace an earlier policy of compulsory political
 re-education, which included recantation of past
 opposition to the revolution. Under the current political
 re-education scheme, some prisoners work at prison
 facilities and receive monthly salaries for work performed
 satisfactorily. Those accepting the re-education regime
 are granted various rights and privileges, such as home
 visits, visits by family, and possibly early release,
 depending on their prison category.
 In December 1982, a recently released long-time political
 prisoner, the poet Armando Valladares, told two
 sub-committees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that
 repression of political prisoners is 'ferocious.' The
 Cuban police harassed his mother, Valladares reported,
 forcing her to send a letter denouncing him which was
 dictated by a Cuban secret policeman who had shown his
 sister an approved court order sending her to jail if her
 mother did not cooperate. Valladares described the
 imprisonment of children and stated that physical and
 psychological torture was common. He claimed one man was
 severly beaten outside his cell on December 17, 1981,
 while he watched, and that he himself had also been
 physically mistreated. He testified that he had been
 denied food for a period of more than 40 days in 1974,
 resulting in the loss of use of his legs. Valladares
 asserted that the medical treatment he was receiving for
 his paralysis was withdrawn prior to his release and that
 he was not allowed to go into the open air or receive
 visitors or correspondence. He was also mistreated by
 guards.
 
 
 463
 Other reports of abuse continue, particularly with respect
 to the treatment of several hundred political prisoners who
 have persistently refused to participate in the Government's
 re-education scheme. These prisoners refuse to take part in
 official prison duties and activities or to wear prison
 uniforms. Amnesty International, in its 1982 report, noted
 that these prisoners' already poor conditions deteriorated
 sharply during 1981 and expressed deep concern about reports
 that prison authorities have several times withdrawn food,
 medical treatment, and special diets from political
 prisoners, many of whom are old and sick, because of their
 refusal to accept prison regulations. It was also charged
 that the prisoners had been beaten by prison guards.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The 1976 Constitution states that *none of the freedoms
 which are recognized for citizens can be exercised contrary
 to ... the existence and the objective of the Socialist
 State, or contrary to the decision of the Cuban people to
 build socialism and communism. Violation of this principle
 can be punished by law.' Repression of all freedoms is thus
 accorded legal authority by Cuba's own Constitution. In
 practical terms, this clause often translates into the
 imprisonment of individuals who are exercising basic
 freedoms included in the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights, of which Cuba is a signator. Freedom House asserted
 that 'hundreds' of political prisoners 'who have refused to
 recant continue to be held in difficult conditions, and new
 arrests are frequent.0
 Based on estimates from a wide variety of sources, Cuba
 continues to hold up to 1,000 political prisoners. Freedom
 House noted that there are *reports of psychiatric
 institutions also being used to incarcerate.*
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Cuban Constitution specifies that the courts shall be "a
 system of state organs independent of all others.' In
 practice, however, independent courts do not exist. All
 courts are subordinated to the National Assembly of People's
 Government and the Council of State. The 1977 Judicial
 System Law confirmed provisions of a 1973 law disbanding the
 revolutionary tribunals which until then had been empowered
 to deal specifically with "counter-revolutionary offenses.
 Such political offenses now fall within the competence of
 the state security chambers of the higher-ranking people's
 courts. The courts appoint lawyers to represent all
 defendants. Defendants may also hire their own attorneys
 through the lawyers' guild.
 Amnesty International, in its 1982 report, claims more than
 50 political prisoners had received additional sentences
 without fair hearing because of their 'rebellious attitude'
 and several political prisoners who had completed their
 sentences were not released. They were reportedly given an
 additional year in prison. Among them were Jose Oscar
 Rodriguez Terrero, Pedro Santana Canejo, Manuel Hernandez
 Cruz, Eduardo Capote Rodriguez, and Sergio Montes de Oca.
 Some of the 50 reportedly went on a hunger strike to protest
 their additional sentences.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Cuban Constitution states that "the home is inviolable.
 No one can enter the home of another against his will,
 except in those cases foreseen by law.' In practice,
 however, the individual has scant legal protection against
 arbitrary search and seizure. In a rigidly controlled state
 like Cuba, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of
 invasion of the home.
 
 
 464
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The freedoms of speech and press do not exist in Cuba. The
 legal system prevents any expression of disagreement with
 the socialist system. All print and electronic media are
 government-owned; material published in Cuba is approved by
 government censors in the Ministry of Culture. No one is
 allowed openly to oppose the system or Castro. Members of
 the artistic community have been jailed for not conforming
 to government guidelines on art. Their families have also
 been penalized. Dissenting views on important policy issues
 do not appear in the media. No criticism of the Party or
 Government is permitted, except to correct administrative
 errors or comment on local issues. Open criticism of
 officials is only permitted when approved at the top level.
 Freedom House contends that 'writing or speaking against the
 system, even in private is severely repressed.' The Cuban
 Government does some jamming of Voice of America broadcasts
 and permits very few non-communist publications to circulate
 in Cuba. As a result, Cuban citizens receive a controlled
 version of world news. Freedom of expression is hindered as
 well by the existence of a widespread informer system, part
 of which is institutionalized through the Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is not a right guaranteed by the Cuban
 Constitution. All group activities are controlled and
 monitored by the Communist Party and the political block
 committees known as Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution. These committees are an important instrument of
 mass control and mobilization, engaging in a wide range of
 activities in the name of "revolutionary vigilance.'
 All labor unions are also controlled by the state and the
 Cuban Communist Party. The Cuban Constitution does not
 recognize the right to strike. There is no collective
 bargaining. Nearly all Cuban workers belong to the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers, which serves primarily as an
 instrument of the state to maintain political and work
 discipline, spur worker effort and productivity and hold
 down labor costs, rather than to seek wage and benefit
 improvements and defend worker interests.
 Labor-management relations are administered by the Ministry
 of Labor. Union members can vote for the officers of the
 local sections, but not for the municipal, provincial, and
 national officers who represent the union within the
 ministry that regulates their particular industry.   While
 the state actively encourages individuals to participate in
 civic organizations, these organizations serve primarily as
 a means of social control. Secondarily, they offer the
 individual a limited channel for expressing his views and
 for advancing his own career as long as he remains within
 clearly defined parameters of officially sanctioned
 acceptability.
 C. Freedom of Religion
 The Cuban Constitution guarantees the right to profess
 and practice any religion. The Constitution also states,
 however, that it is illegal to 'put one's faith or religious
 belief in opposition to the Constitution." Communist Party
 membership is considered to be inconsistent with the
 exercise of religious beliefs, thus effectively excluding
 those who practice religion from positions of authority in
 the Government or armed forces. There are also reports that
 persons who practice regular religious observance are
 
 
 465
 discriminated against in employment, housing, and
 schooling. Members of religious groups such as Catholics,
 Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists, Jews, and
 others who disagree with the Cuban Government on such
 matters as employment practices, education, or compulsory
 military service have been subject to prosecution for their
 dissent. They have also been subject to loss of jobs and
 denial of entrance to a university.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Cuba is not formally controlled. Foreign
 travel, however, is rarely available to the vast majority of
 the Cuban people. Those who wish to travel abroad even
 temporarily must obtain an exit permit from the Government.
 People of an economically-productive age are rarely granted
 permission to travel outside the country, even on a
 temporary basis. People who ask permission to leave
 permanently are stripped of their jobs, their ration cards,
 and their housing. Their children are not permitted to
 attend school.
 Cuba's penal code makes it illegal to enter or leave the
 country without specific authorization. Some of the Cubans
 who arrived in the United States in 1980 from the port of
 Mariel subsequently changed their minds and sought to return
 to Cuba. The Cuban Government has refused to permit their
 return. A few Cubans have returned to Cuba without such
 permissions their treatment in Cuba is not known.
 Sixteen Cubans who sought asylum in the Venezuelan Embassy
 in 1979-80 are still in Venezuelan diplomatic residences,
 and the Cuban Government has consistently refused to permit
 them to depart the country. Thirty-three Cubans (some
 ex-military) are still in asylum at the Peruvian Embassy;
 negotiations to allow them to depart the country have been
 unsuccessful.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cuba is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state dominated by
 President Fidel Castro and by a group of Communist Party
 officials most of whom trace their relationship with Castro
 back to the 1950's and the beginnings of the revolution in
 the Sierra Maestra mountains. The Communist Party is Cuba's
 only legal political party. After the revolution, the
 Castro Government either abolished or brought under its
 control all existing 'mass organizations.* It also created
 several new organizations such as the Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution. As a result most sectors of
 Cuban society -- labor,'women, youth, and artists, for
 example -- are highly organized.
 The Government encourages all Cubans, including children, to
 participate in *mass organizations.' The Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution, for example, claim a total
 membership of 5,500,000, or almost 80 percent of the adult
 population. The Territorial Militias were created in 1980.
 With a current membership of 500,000, the Territorial
 Militias were originally projected to reach one million.
 Although ostensibly a home defense organization, the
 militias serve purposes similar to those of other *mass
 organizations.' These mass organizations are used more for
 political and economic mobilization than for popular
 representation. They use both persuasion and coercion to
 channel the energies of the people toward goals established
 by the Communist Party.
 
 
 466
 Citizens can discuss local issues (e.g., public trans-
 portation, sanitation, and crime prevention) within the
 People's Assemblies established in 1976. They have,
 however, no right to participate in decisions on larger
 national issues or in the selection of senior members of the
 Government. The People's Assemblies represented a Cuban
 attempt at decentralization through creation of a system of
 municipal (county), regional, and provincial assemblies
 which oversee local administrations and elect delegates to a
 481-member National Assembly of People's Government,
 theoretically the highest legislative body in Cuba.
 Although direct elections are held on the municipal level,
 all deputies are chosen by a party-controlled nominating
 procedure, i.e. candidates for election are nominated by
 meetings of mass-organizations and military bodies. The
 National Assembly has not developed any real political
 power, and none appears to have been intended.
 Cuba has constitutionally outlawed discrimination against
 women and minorities. However, few women hold high
 positions in government, in spite of publicly-proclaimed
 efforts of the Party to promote them. Of the 225 members
 (full and alternate) of the Communist Party Central
 Committee elected in December 1980, 18 are women. One
 Politburo member, an alternate member, is a woman.
 Blacks and other minorities are poorly represented in the
 top levels of government. While they comprise more than one
 quarter of the population their percentage in the Central
 Committee (full and alternate members) is about 10 to 15
 percent. Only one of the members (full and alternate) of
 the Politburo is black.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 There were no known instances in 1982 or previously of the
 Cuban Government permitting foreign investigators to inquire
 into the state of human rights in Cuba. Representatives of
 Amnesty International were allowed to visit Cuba in 1977,
 but only private individuals. The Cuban Government has
 neither signed the American Convention on Human Rights nor
 allowed the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit
 Cuba. Several international, non-governmental human rights
 organizations have commented on the Cuban situation.
 Amnesty International's 1982 report stated that that
 organization's 'concerns were the arbitrary resentencing of
 political prisoners who had completed their sentences; the
 imprisonment of prisoners of conscience; the imprisonment of
 people charged with criminal offenses where the real reasons
 for their imprisonment appeared to be political; allegations
 of ill-treatment of political detainees; trial procedures
 which fell short of internationally recognized legal
 standards; and the imposition of the death penaty." Freedom
 House, in its 1982 report, classified Cuba as 'Not Free.*
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation.
 Cuba is a Marxist-Leninist state with a centrally planned
 economy. The Soviet Union provided Cuba in 1982 with
 economic assistance estimated at well over $400 per capita
 annually. GNP is estimated at $900 - 1100 (1981). Despite
 efforts to diversify, Cuba's economy is largely based upon
 the single crop of sugar, with its fluctuating prices.
 Although Cuba's Constitution guarantees the right to work,
 underemployment is endemic, and there are signs of
 structural unemployment, unusual for a communist state.
 
 
 467
 Castro warned in his July 26 speech for 1982 that Cubans
 faced difficult economic times ahead and that the work week
 would be reduced for many workers, owing to the lack of
 foreign exchange needed to import materials for many local
 industries. More recently, Cuba informed its hard currency
 creditors that it could not meet payments falling due in the
 near future, owing to low world sugar prices and the lack of
 short-term credit facilities from foreign banks. The
 National Bank of Cuba requested all its hard currency
 creditors to reschedule about $2.8 billion in medium and
 long term debt over a ten-year period, postponing all
 repayments of principal until 1986.
 Free education and health care are readily available in
 Cuba, whose 9.85 million population (1981) is growing at a
 rate of 1.6 percent (1980). Life expectancy at birth is 73
 years (1980), and the infant mortality rate is 26 per 1,000
 live births (1981). With tremendous emphasis placed on
 education, Cuba's literacy rate in 1975 reportedly reached
 96 percent in 1975. There is a shortage of adequate
 housing, particularly in the urban areas.
 Although the ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to basic nutritional requirements was
 118 percent in 1977, food supplies are controlled by a
 strict rationing system. Each adult is alloted only 2.5
 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of chicken, and four ounces of
 coffee per month. To obtain even these meager portions
 requires hours of waiting in lines and dealing with the
 bureaucracy.
 Occasionally items are offered at higher prices free of the
 rationing system in a series of farmers' free markets, but
 both the quantity and the variety of goods available at such
 markets has decreased dramatically in 1982. This decrease
 was the direct result of a campaign by the Government
 against 'middlemen' who were selling goods in these markets
 at a mark-up.
 Although some small farmers and some former tenant farmers
 hold title to their land, the right to own private property,
 either individually or in association with others, is not
 fully recognized in Cuba. Most large firms were
 nationalized soon after the revolution, and small businesses
 (e.g. corner stores, newsstands, beauty shops) were
 nationalized in the 1960's.
