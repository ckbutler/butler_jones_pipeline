 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven small
 dynastically ruled Arab shaykhdoms (emirates), formed in 1971,
 when Great Britain relinquished its special treaty relationship
 with the rulers. Under the Provisional Constitution, adopted
 in 1971 and still in effect, political control in each emirate
 remains in the hands of a hereditary ruling family. While the
 Constitution appears to confer a broad range of human rights
 (including freedom of expression, assembly and a right to form
 associations), legally most such rights are subject to
 subsequent legislation and provide neither a judicial check on
 use of authority nor democratic elections. The Provisional
 Constitution is primarily a treaty relationship among the seven
 emirate governments and has little application to the relations
 between each ruling family and the population of its emirate.
 The rulers of the seven emirates or their deputies form the
 Supreme Council, the nation's highest executive and legislative
 body. The Council elects from among its own members a
 president, a vice presidenti and a prime minister, who in turn
 appoint ministers to a federal cabinet. A National Assembly of
 40 members, appointed by the rulers of each emirate on a
 proportional basis, reviews new legislation and government
 operations. Although the National Assembly's role is advisory,
 it serves as a focal point for debate of public issues and its
 views appear to be given serious consideration by the
 Government.
 The seven emirates are unequal in size, population, natural
 resources, and economic development. Abu Dhabi, the largest
 and wealthiest, serves as the national capital and plays a
 predominant role in the federation. Under Abu Dhabi's ruler,
 Shaykh Zayid, who is also president of the country,
 considerable progress has been made toward the formation of an
 effective central government structure. However, the
 individual emirates continue to exercise extensive authority
 over their own economic resources and development planning,
 police and security forces, law courts, and social welfare
 policies. Human rights performances among individual emirates
 are similar enough to allow the entire country to be treated as
 a whole in this report.
 Two trends affecting human rights have become evident in 1983.
 The first is a trend toward the extension of the jurisdiction
 of Islamic Shari'a law and with it, use of corporal
 punishment. For example, the Emirate of Sharjah has just
 reinstated application of Shari's penalties on alcohol
 offenses, and there is some momentum in the other emirates for
 similar action. Caning is often applied for such offenses.
 Although such penalties appear disproportionate by secular
 standards, there are no reports of applications of harsher
 traditional punishments (amputation or stoning).
 A second trend--expulsion of foreign residents--raises the
 possibility that summary deportation procedures have at times
 been applied in an arbitrary manner and in some cases have
 created hardship by forcing people to depart who had nowhere
 else to go. About 80 percent of the Emirates' 1.2 million
 residents are foreign guest workers. Its citizens, although
 concerned about being so outnumbered, have tolerated these
 levels of foreign population because economic development
 programs required them. The economic contraction caused by
 lower oil revenues has provided the first opportunity to reduce
 these numbers. Since a foreigner's residence depends on his
 employment, lay-offs mean loss of residence permits as well.
 There have been reports that some foreign residents
 
 (1449)
 
 
 1450
 holding expired residence permits have been deported
 summarily. No instances of such deportations have been
 confirmed and new reports have tapered off in the second half
 of 1983. The Government no longer seems so concerned that
 holders of expired resident documents will attempt to remain in
 the Emirates illegally. The more normal technique to reduce
 the foreign population is to refuse to renew work permits when
 they expire, which gives most foreign workers adequate time to
 arrange their departure. There is still the possiblity that
 aliens who previously enjoyed permanent residence could be
 forced to leave so quickly that hardship could result. Few
 foreigners are offered citizenship, despite the fact that
 thousands, particularly professional-level resident aliens,
 have lived and worked there for many years, often occupying
 extremely responsible positions in government and business.
 Public officials have indicated that the Government is
 concerned about cases of individual hardship caused by its new
 policies, and appears to be giving such long-term residents
 more time to find other employment in the Emirates or establish
 homes elsewhere.
 Nationals enjoy important benefits in real estate, business
 ownership, and government scholarships. (Some foreigners have
 had government-financed scholarships, but this practice is
 declining.) Expatriates benefit from inexpensive health care
 and public education through the primary grades. Most foreign
 workers find wages and living conditions better than in their
 homelands, even during these times of decreasing oil revenues,
 budget cuts, and relative financial stringency.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fromt
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no reports during 1983 of persons having been
 killed unlawfully or arbitrarily.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, clandestine detentions, or secret abductions
 were reported in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of torture. There is no evidence that the
 authorities condone mistreatment of prisoners or that abuse is
 practiced either during detention or after transfer to prison.
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading
 treatment. Some emirates, including Abu Dhabi and most
 recently Sharjah (the latter for alcohol offenses only), apply
 traditional Islamic procedures and penalties in criminal cases
 which are tried in religious (Shari'a) courts. Caning,
 applied with a light bamboo cane and restricted arm movement,
 is painful but is not seriously injurious. Transgressions by
 Muslims of Shari'a law (possession of alcohol or publicly
 violating the Ramadan Fast, for example,) are punished by
 public caning, in addition to fines and/or imprisonment.
 Caning is sometimes added to other sentences for criminal
 offenses. There were instances of public caning in 1983,
 mainly for alcohol offenses, but no cases reported have
 
 
 1451
 involved non-Muslims. In criminal cases, foreigners are
 usually deported after they have completed their criminal
 sentences. All sentences involving capital punishment must be
 approved by the ruler of the local emirate in which the crime
 occurred. No death sentences or executions took place in
 1983. Theoretically, the amputation of a hand for theft may be
 imposed by Shari'a courts, but such a sentence has not been
 carried out for many years. Theft generally brings
 imprisonment, and deportation if the offender is foreign.
 Prison conditions, while uncomfortable because of overcrowding
 and lack of air conditioning, are tolerable. Prison diet and
 medical care are adequate. Incarcerated individuals are
 permitted visits from family members, lawyers, and if
 expatriates, from consular officials, although consular access
 is occasionally.difficult to obtain.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without
 probable cause, and prolonged detention without trial is rare.
 An individual is usually charged within a few days. No report
 of arbitrary arrest or prolonged detention was received in
 1983. Although the Provisional Constitution does not
 specifically guarantee habeas corpus, police are generally
 required to report any arrest to a designated court judge
 within 24 hours. The judge then determines if there is
 sufficient evidence for a trial. If so, the individual is
 brought to trial fairly promptly; if not, he is released.
 There have been no reports in recent years of exile as a form
 of punishment. Summary deportations of resident aliens have
 been widely reported but no actual case has been confirmed.
 Although such deportations probably do occur, it is difficult
 to assess whether the procedures involved contain adequate
 safeguards against arbitrariness.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Courts in the United Arab Emirates, both civil and religious,
 are staffed with experienced judges drawn from other Arab
 countries. There are no jury trials. In civil courts, the
 accused may be-represented by the counsel of his choice; no
 public defender system exists. Crimes and penalties are
 defined by law (civil or Shari'a) and the accused is presumed
 innocent until found guilty. In Shari's courts, lawyers are
 not permitted in the courtroom; the judge hears testimony and
 then defines the crime and the penalty in accordance with
 religious sources.
 Public access to trials is limited to those with a concern
 regarding the case; if political or security matters are
 involved, access would be severely restricted. No such trials
 took place in 1983. The Provisional Constitution provides for
 judicial review by a Federal Supreme Court. However, it
 appears that the accused has no right of appeal to this court;
 rather, he must depend on the judge or a concerned governmental
 body to raise the constitutional question on his behalf. In
 cases which are not politically sensitive (or do not involve a
 ruler's immediate family members), the local ruler does not
 interfere in the judicial process, except occasionally to
 commute a sentence or issue a pardon. Because most judges are
 themselves guest workers on limited employment contracts, they
 do not have the independence needed to restrain authorities in
 a politically sensitive case. Special labor courts have been
 
 
 1452
 
 established to handle disputes between workers and employers
 and are widely believed to be fair in their judgments.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Since the extended family remains the building block of
 politics in each emirate, invasion of the home of a citizen by
 a ruler's police would have to be justified to prominent
 members of that person's tribe. As a result individual privacy
 is highly respected by the society. The Provisional
 Constitution guarantees that dwellings are not to be entered
 arbitrarily, and the police are usually required to show
 probable cause of criminal activity before searching a private
 home. Although-foreigners appear to be covered by this
 protection, without tribal influence or a right to remain in
 the country, they are in a weaker position to challenge a
 police search than a citizen would be. There were no reports
 of arbitrary searches of private dwellings during 1983. In
 previous years, such interference has occurred when national
 security considerations were involved.
 The state generally does not enforce Islamic customs such as
 restrictions on clothing styles or limitations on women's role
 in society. Non-Muslims are free to purchase and privately
 consume alcoholic beverages, but in some emirates the Islamic
 moral precept against use of such beverages is imposed on
 Muslims by state action.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech,
 communication, religion, and assembly "within the limits of the
 law*. Individuals (citizens and foreigners) may express their
 views orally on a 'wide range of public issues without fear of
 official harassment. Radio and television are owned by the
 Federal Ministry of Information and Culture or by individual
 emirate governments. Newspapers are privately owned, but some
 are dependent on federal or local subsidies. Sensitive
 subjects, including critical treatment of the Government or
 society, religion, or inter-Arab disputes, are avoided. There
 is television censorship of Western entertainment that might
 offend conservative Muslim sensibilities. While statutory
 authority exists, actual enforcement varies so much, especially
 among different emirates, as to suggest there is no clearly
 defined list of what is impermissible. A press law codifies
 the powers of censorship, media closure, and control of
 reporting. In practice, editors have learned by experience
 what is tolerated. Mild criticism of poor execution of
 government policy is permitted; criticism of the policy itself
 or its formulation is not. Visits by foreign journalists
 require Ministry of Information approval. Books, films,
 periodicals, and foreign newspapers are occasionally censored
 for coverage of subjects considered pornographic, derogatory of
 the Arabs or Islam, favorable to Israel, or critical of the
 ruling families, but most Western publications are freely
 available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Provisional Constitution confers the right of assembly, but
 since the Government prefers that the massive foreign
 
 
 1453
 population not be politically mobilized, this right is subject
 to tight regulation. Clubs and other organizations must be
 licensed by the federal or local emirate governments. Labor
 unions do not exist. Organized public gatherings must have a
 permit. Thus, by declining to issue a license or permit,
 governmental authorities can and do ban political or labor
 union activities. Foreign residents who are involved in
 organizing labor unions may find that their work permits are
 revoked or at least not renewed. Strikes are not permitted.
 However, the employees of a prominent newspaper collectively
 stopped work for a few days in 1983 to protest the failure of
 the publisher to pay their salaries. There was no official
 interference with this strike or sanctions against those who
 refused to work. There are no institutionalized
 worker-management consultations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Provisional Constitution establishes Islam as the state
 religion. Minority Shi'a Muslims are not restricted in their
 religious practices. Non-Muslims (virtually all of whom are
 aliens) are free to practice their faiths so long as this "does
 not conflict with public policy or violate public morals."
 Christian churches and schools are officially tolerated and
 have occasionally received support from individual rulers,
 although the Government discourages construction of churches in
 high profile locations. Traditional resistance to religious
 proselytizing of Muslims remains strong. The Ministry of
 Education has required church-run private schools to enforce
 stricter sex segregation and to strengthen Arabic/Islamic
 studies for their Muslim students. While there is no
 systematic government discrimination, in a Sunni Muslim
 dominated society where ties of family and religion remain all
 important, Shi'a Muslims and non-Muslims may be disadvantaged
 somewhat in competing for jobs or government largess.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restraints on freedom of movement within the
 country, although visits to certain areas, such as oil
 installations, require prior permission from security
 authorities. Foreign travel and emigration for all citizens
 are unrestricted. Exit visas are not required and women no
 longer need the permission of a male relative to leave the
 country. The right of return is extended to all citizens.
 Palestinian residents with expired travel documents, usually
 from Lebanon, have been denied re-entry by both the United Arab
 Emirates and Lebanon and have had to shuttle between the two
 countries before convincing one to accept them. Although the
 country does not have formalized procedures for handling
 refugees or applications for political asylum, its expanding
 employment opportunities have provided a temporary haven for
 many people of the area who left their own countries for
 economic or political reasons. During the past year, many
 Iranians have sought to enter the country, often illegally, and
 mainly by boat. Some have been allowed to remain,. especially
 if they can demonstrate that they face retribution or
 persecution if repatriated. Increasingly, however, because of
 tensions emanating from the Iraq/Iran War, heightened security
 concerns, and the economic downturn, most "boat people" are
 Intercepted by coast guard vessels and.sent back. In the few
 tases where permission to remain is granted, it is done
 %nformally, i.e., the persons concerned quietly remain in the
 
 
 1454
 country. The Government has extended assistance to specific
 groups of refugees on an ad hoc basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Since the federation is an association of pre-existing
 political entities, the role of the rulers is not defined by
 the Provisional Constitution. Rather, their functions have
 evolved from traditional patriarchal concepts of authority
 exercised in tribal societies. Primogeniture is an important
 element in choosing a successor; however, a ruling family would
 generally not select a member who was incapable of ruling
 responsibly or who was opposed by a large part of the society.
 The leading clan within the tribal society owes its position
 among other clans to tradition. Intermarriage between the
 ruling family and other influential families of other clans
 creates a net of informal channels which form the traditional
 basis for some participation in the political process. Even a
 foreign resident can seek benefits or the redress of a
 grievance through this system if a citizen-patron chooses to
 champion his case. Rulers try to develop a consensus before
 acting, a decision-making process that is often indecisive, but
 which lessens the need for harsh measures to compel
 compliance. The much-treasured custom which permits any member
 of the society to petition the ruler in person is a force which
 tends to prevent the latter from becoming absolute or too
 remote from his subjects.
 The Provisional Constitution, adopted in 1971 and still in
 force, left the traditional political system in each emirate
 intact, and in effect extended that system to the
 federal-national level. Executive and legislative powers
 remain firmly in the hands of the seven rulers, meeting as the
 Supreme Council of the federation. They appoint a cabinet and
 choose one of their number to act as chief of state. In
 practice the president has been the ruler of Abu Dhabi, while
 the vice president and prime minister have come from Dubai's
 ruling family. To supplement traditional channels of
 consultation and widen the political base of the federation,
 the Provisional Constitution has established an advisory
 National Consultative Council whose 40 members are appointed by
 the individual rulers; their numbers are proportionate to the
 size and importance of the emirates they represent. The
 Council is consulted on all laws issued by the Cabinet. While
 its views are not binding on the Government, in practice they
 are given serious consideration.
 A small and privileged minority among the large numbers of
 expatriates, few citizens feel aggrieved. There is no
 suffrage, for males or females, and women play no public
 political role. Foreigners are expected to refrain from
 political activities; they jeopardize their residence status if
 they become involved in efforts to challenge the supremacy of
 citizens or if their activities could serve to embarrass the
 countrywith foreign governments.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The United Arab Emirates is responsive to foreign criticism of
 its human rights performance. Sensitivity to allegations of
 mistreatment of lower income foreign workers has resulted in
 efforts to give them more legal protection by improving and
 updating the labor law. No human rights group visited the
 country in 1983. Amnesty International did not report on the
 
 
 1455
 Emirates in its 1981, 1982, or 1983 reports. Freedom House, in
 its 1983 report, classifies the United Arab Emirates as "partly
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Oil income stabilized after a sharp decline in the first half
 of 1983. With a per capita gross domestic product of $26,000
 per resident, the Emirates still has ample funds for continued
 economic and social development. The per capita income of the
 lowest-paid foreign workers is far below the average, but is
 still about three times more than most could earn in their own
 countries. Medical treatment is free to all citizens and
 partially subsidized for foreign residents. Within the last
 decade, life expectancy for citizens has increased from 55.4
 years to 62.6 because of improved health care and sanitary
 conditions. The 1983 U.N. population data shows infant
 mortality at 43 per 1,000 live births, a significant decrease
 from 65 per 1,000 as reported in 1982. Previous figures had
 aroused public concern and prompted the Ministry of Health to
 improve child care practices regarding sanitation and nutrition.
 Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the two most industrialized emirates, have
 undertaken programs to expand the number of low-cost housing
 units. Water and electricity are provided to residential users
 at subsidized prices. As it has very limited arable land and
 sparse water resources, most food is imported and the water is
 desalinated. Citizens, and foreigners to a more limited
 extent, may buy some basic commodities at subsidized prices.
 Virtually the entire population has access to safe drinking
 water.
 Primary and secondary education is free for all citizens.
 Foreigners have access to free primary education; in an effort
 to reduce the foreign population and discourage families from
 putting down roots, foreigners must now pay for students
 entering secondary school. Primary education is compulsory for
 nationals from ages 6 to 12. Within the last few years,
 teacher training programs have been expanded and large numbers
 of new schools built.
 There are now 139,800 children of all nationalities attending
 392 primary and secondary schools. The most reliable estimates
 put the literacy rate at about 56 percent. Girls account for
 about 48 percent of primary school enrollment. Traditional
 conservatism and strong family pressures, plus the
 still-honored tradition of girls marrying in their early teens,
 have prevented many women from continuing their education
 beyond the primary level. This in turn has limited the role of
 female citizens in the economic and cultural life of the
 country. The number of women in the workforce is minimal.
 However, the Government is encouraging female citizens to
 pursue their education up to university level, and some are
 beginning to find employment in the news media and government
 offices, as well as in the traditionally accepted fields of
 health and education. Women are permitted to drive automobiles
 and may appear in public unveiled. Under Shari'a law, a woman
 must specify grounds for divorce whereas a man need not. A
 wife's right to hold her own property is effectively protected,
 but under Shari'a inheritance laws daughters receive less than
 sons.
 The largest economic enterprises are state-owned, or combine
 state ownership with private equity participation. Otherwise,
 commerce is relatively unrestricted, except for laws designed
 to ensure that citizens share in and control the nation's
 economic life. Citizen and non-citizen rights to private
 property are protected under both religious and civil law. In
 accordance with both Islamic law and local custom, the title to
 previously unclaimed real property reverts to the rulers.
 They, in turn, sell or allocate land to citizens. The latter
 are also accorded preference in issuance of business licenses
 and the right to buy shares in semi-public enterprises.
