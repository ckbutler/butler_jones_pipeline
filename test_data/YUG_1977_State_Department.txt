 YUGOSLAVIA
 Practically speaking, Yugoslav citizens, unlike
 those in other Communist countries, enjoy broad
 freedom of movement and access to foreign publica-
 tions, newspapers, radio, and television broadcasts.
 Freedom of speech and artistic creativity have been
 more widespread than in Warsaw Pact countries.
 Nevertheless, certain restrictions must be observed --
 not attacking President Tito, the League of Communists
 of Yugoslavia (LCY), or the principles of "brotherhood
 and unity" of Yugoslavia's diverse peoples.
 Through its control of political power the LCY
 exerts a major influence on the interpretation and
 implementation of the Constitution and law. More
 stringent political controls have been introduced
 since 1971, as the regime strives to keep ultimate
 power in the hands of a few, and in response to
 challenges within and outside the Party from
 nationalist, liberal and pro-Soviet forces. The
 regime tends to interpret written and even oral
 criticism as political "crimes," and it determines
 the course of justice in political cases.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned by the authorities nor
 have there been any substantiated reports of its
 practice. The Constitution guarantees the integrity
 of the person and expressly prohibits forced con-
 fessions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been bcai6unl-alegations of-treament
 which would appear to donstitute cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment. For example, some political
 prisoners have reportedly been held in solitary
 confinement for extended periods and there have been
 unconfirmed reports of beatings of prisoners by
 police. We are not able to judge the accuracy of these
 reports.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest,
 although large numbers of suspects have reportedly
 been picked up for-questioning after terrorist acts.
 Normally, arraignment quickly follows arrest.
 Indictment must be brought within three months, except
 that the investigating judge can request from the
 court an extension of three months or even longer with
 justification.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public, except in
 cases involving military or national security questions
 when the judge has the authority to hold proceedings
 in camera. Government controls on the media also
 affect the degree and nature of publicity accorded the
 proceedings. Impartiality probably varies widely.
 There is the possibility of acquittal in non-political
 cases. The accused has the right to counsel and
 Yugoslav lawyers have often vigorously defended their
 clients. There have been cases reported in which the
 authorities are said to have influenced testimony of
 witnesses.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslavcode of criminal procedure contains
 elaborate provisions for conducting searches; including
 the requirement for a court order except under certain
 limited circumstances. Although the possibility of
 abuse is not to be ruled out, there are no indications
 of widespread violations.
 2. Governmental Policies relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government's'record in promoting fulfillment of
 basic needs for food, shelter, health care, and
 education is credible. The regime's communist credo
 demands attention to such needs, although its means
 are limited by economic factors.

 A privileged minority uses its position to acquire
 perquisites, e.g., weekend houses. There is, however,
 little evidence that significant resources are being
 diverted. The poor are largely victims of structural
 features of the economy, and the regime genuinely
 seeks to improve their lot.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought is generally upheld, but there are
 strong restrictions on public expression of thoughts
 and opinions. Criticism of government policies may
 be considered hostile propaganda, a punishable offense.
 The advocacy of dissident political ideas is not
 permitted. In a recent, rare case, a judge whose
 private diary entries expressed separatist and
 pluralist views was convicted in part on the evidence
 contained in the diary. He has since been amnestied.
 Rights of religion and assembly are guaranteed in the
 Constitution, but are honored under controlled
 conditions. Religious organizations may not engage
 in political and non-religious activities as defined
 by the government and LCY. Constraints are imposed
 on proselytizing activities and religious education.
 No political gatherings are authorized except on the
 authority of official bodies.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed
 in the Constitution and is not infringed in practice.
 Yugoslavs travel abroad at will, although an unknown
 number of "dissidents" have been denied passports
 on national security grounds. Hundreds of thousands
 of Yugoslav workers are currently working in Western
 Europe. There are no restrictions on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in Political Process
 The Constitution has provisions guaranteeing partici-
 pation in the political process and the "self-management"
 system encourages wide participation in the decision-
 making process on both political and economic issues.
 
 
 325
 But the LCY's control of political power and restrictions
 against unauthorized political expression effectively
 limit such participation.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Yugoslavia is a member of the UN Human Rights Commission,
 and its delegation chief was chairman of the recent
 session in Geneva. There is nothing in the record,
 though, that would suggest any particular receptivity
 to outside investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. The question has not arisen in recent years.
 In all likelihood the Yugoslavs would insist that such
 matters are internal and would resist outside investi-
 gation on grounds of national sovereignty.
 The overall incidence of political arrests is down from
 1974 and the political situation is more stable from the
 regime standpoint. In November, 1977, the Yugoslav
 Government announced an amnesty reportedly affecting
 over 700 prisoners or detainees, including over 200 who
 had been held for political offenses. Among those
 released were all of the most highly-publicized cases.
