 JORDAN
 The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy that was ruled
 by King Hussein bin Talal from 1952 until his death in February 1999. On February
 7, 1999, King Hussein's eldest son, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Hussein, acceded to
 the throne. The Constitution concentrates a high degree of executive and legislative
 authority in the King, who determines domestic and foreign policy. In the King's ab-
 sence, a regent, whose authority is outlined in the Constitution and in royal decrees,
 assumes many of these responsibilities. The Prime Minister and other members of
 the Cabinet are appointed by the King and manage the daily affairs of government.
 The Parliament consists of the 40-member Senate, appointed by the King, and the
 80-member Chamber of Deputies, which is elected every 4 years. Since the 1989
 elections and the lifting of most aspects of martial law in 1991, the lower house has
 asserted itself only intermittently on domestic and foreign policy issues. Over 500
 candidates competed in the November 1997 parliamentary elections, despite a boy-
 cott by Islamist and other parties. The election was marred by reports of registra-
 tion irregularities, fraud, and restrictions on the press and on campaign materials.
 According to the Constitution, the judiciary is independent of other branches of gov-
 ernment; however, in practice it is susceptible to political pressure and interference
 by the executive.
 General police functions are the responsibility of the Public Security Directorate
 (PSD). The PSD, the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), and the military share
 
 
 1718
 
 responsibility for maintaining internal security and have authority to monitor the
 activities of persons believed to be security threats. The State Security Court- and
 broad police powers are vestiges of martial law, which was in place from 1967 to
 1991. The security forces continue to commit human rights abuses.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with significant government participation in indus-
 try, transportation, and communications. The country has few natural resources and
 relies heavily on foreign assistance and remittances from citizens working abroad.
 The economy has suffered from chronically high unemployment since the late
 1980's. As part of a structural adjustment program, the Government in recent years
 has removed subsidies on several staple goods and lifted price controls on others.
 During the year the Government maintained price controls on bread, while controls
 on soft drinks, fruits, and vegetables were lifted. Wages have remained stagnant,
 which is continuing to erode the purchasing power of most citizens. Exporters have
 not yet found adequate replacement markets for those lost as a result of United Na-
 tions sanctions against Iraq. Additional trade with Iraq under the "oil for food" reso-
 lution has not affected the economy significantly. High expectations that significant
 markets would develop in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel following the 1994 sign-
 ing of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty have not been realized. Per capita gross domes-
 tic product in 1997 was approximately $860.
 The Government's human rights record was uneven, and significant problems re-
 main, including: Allegations of instances of extrajudicial killings; abuse and mis-
 treatment of detainees; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of accountability within
 the security services; prolonged detention without charge; lack of due process of law
 and interference in the judicial process; infringements on citizens' privacy rights;
 harassment of members of opposition political parties and the press; and significant
 restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association. Amendments to
 the Press and Publications Law that were enacted and promulgated in September
 place major restrictions on the ability of journalists and publications to function and
 report freely. The Government imposes some limits on freedom of religion, and there
 is official 'and societal discrimination against adherents of the Baha'i faith. There
 are some restrictions on freedom of movement. Citizens do not have the right to
 change their government, although they may participate in the political system
 through political parties and municipal and parliamentary elections. Restrictions on
 women's rights, violence against women and children, and abuse of foreign servants
 are problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security services continue to be
 reluctant to conduct transparent investigations into allegations of wrongful deaths
 during police detention.
 On September 26, 1997, security forces from the GID detained 29-year-old Ismail
 Suleiman Ajarmeh, who then was held incommunicado for nearly 5 months follow-
 ing his arrest. Neither his family nor the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) was allowed to see him during that time. The Minister of the Interior re-
 ported that on February 11 Ajarmeh had committed suicide while in detention by
 "throwing himself down a stairwell." Two members of Parliament requested that an
 investigation be conducted into his death, but none has been announced. News-
 papers also quoted the Minister of the Interior as saying that Ajarmah had been
 a suspect in the September 1997 attack on Israeli security personnel in Amman.
 Ajarmeh's family stated publicly that he had died as a result of torture in detention.
 In February riots took place in the southern city of Ma'an after police attempted
 to stop a demonstration. The city was placed under curfew for 1 week, and house-
 to-house searches were conducted (see Sections 1.d and 2.b.). During altercations be-
 tween security forces and the demonstrators, one citizen, Mohammad A-Khattab,
 was shot and killed. A government investigation concluded that A-Khattab had
 been shot by a demonstrator rather than by a member of the security forces and
 cited as proof the type of ammunition that was used in the shooting. A suspect was
 arrested after the incident. The Government did not allow an independent autopsy
 tobe conducted to verify the Government's claim that 7mm instead of vice 9mm am-
 munition had been used. The press cited alleged witness accounts that Al-Khattab
 had been shot in the back by security forces while fleeing the conflict.
 On March 12, a police operation in Um Jamal to arrest two Masaeed tribesmen
 resulted in the death of both suspects and led to a later clash on March 17 in which
 automatic gunfire was exchanged and three more Masaeed killed. Reports indicated
 that heavy handed behavior by security forces was partly to blame for the violence.
 
 
 1719
 There were no developments in the investigation of the police officers involved in
 the alleged wrongful deaths of Samer Muhammad Ziyad, who died in June 1997,
 Younis Mahmoud Abu Dawlah, who died in December 1996, or Mahmoud Khalifah,
 who died in June 1995. All three men died while in police custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law provides prisoners with the right to humane treatment, the police
 and security forces sometimes abuse detainees physically and verbally during deten-
 tion and interrogation. Allegations of torture are difficult to verify because security
 officials frequently deny detainees timely access to lawyers. The most frequently al-
 leged methods of torture are sleep deprivation, beatings, and extended solitary con-
 finement. Defendants in high-profile cases before the state security court have
 claimed to have undergone physical and psychological abuse while in detention.
 Government officials deny allegations of torture and abuse.
 Human rights organizations reported that there were 18 complaints of persons
 who were beaten while in police custody. There are believed to be many more un-
 documented incidents that were not documented. The family of Ismail Suleiman
 Ajarmeh, who died in police custody, claimed that he died as a result of torture (see
 Section l.a.).
 In February police detained journalist Abd A-Hadi A-Majali and subjected him
 to verbal threats, sleep deprivation, and other forms of abuse intended to intimidate
 him (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.).
 In late September and early October, Filipino and other foreign workers allegedly
 were abused physically after being arrested at their homes in Amman (see Sections
 1.d. and 6.e.).
 Prisons and local police detention facilities are Spartan, and on the whole are se-
 verely overcrowded and understaffed. In a section of one detention center, for exam-
 ple, there are three times as many inmates as beds, and medical supplies and treat-
 ment appear inadequate. In July authorities transferred 46 detainees to the remote
 Al-Jafr prison in eastern Jordan, a facility that had not been in use since the 1970's.
 Prisoners detained on national security grounds often are kept in separate prisons
 maintained by the GID, where conditions are similar to other facilities.
 With some exceptions, the ICRC is permitted unrestricted access to prisoners and
 rison facilities, including GID facilities. However, for 2 months during the year and
 for 3 months at the end of 1997, the ICRC suspended visits to facilities where secu-
 rity detainees were being held because the authorities refused to give the ICRC ac-
 cess to two detainees. One of the detainees, Ismail Suleiman Ajarmeh, died on Feb-
 ruary 11 after nearly 5 months in detention (see Section l.a.). Local human rights
 monitors are allowed to visit prisons, but complain that they are required to go
 through a lengthy and difficult procedure with the authorities to obtain permission
 for such visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The security forces arbitrarily arrest and
 detain citizens. Under the Constitution, citizens are subject to arrest, trial, and pun-
 ishment for the defamation of heads of state, dissemination of "false or exaggerated
 information outside the country which attacks state dignity," or defamation of public
 officials.
 The Criminal Code requires that legal authorities file formal charges within 10
 days of an arrest. However, the courts routinely grant requests from prosecutors for
 15-day extensions as provided by law. This practice generally extends pretrial deten-
 tion for protracted periods of time. In cases involving state security, the authorities
 frequently hold defendants in lengthy pretrial detention, do not provide defendants
 with the written charges against them, and do not allow defendants to meet with
 their lawyers until shortly before trial. Defendants before the state security court
 usually-meet with their attorneys only 1 or 2 days before their trial.
 The Government detains persons, including journalists, for varying amounts of
 time for what-appear to be political reasons. During the year, most such detainees
 were released within 90 days. However, one detainee was held for 4 months, and
 some for as-little as 3 days. Approximately 300 persons, including many Iraqi na-
 tionals, are known to have been detained for security reasons during the year. Many
 of the Iraqis are believed to have been deported subsequently. However, this num-
 ber apparently represents only a small proportion of the total number of security
 detainees; many more are believed to have been detained during the year.
 The Government uses the threat of detention to intimidate journalists into prac-
 ticing self-censorship (see Section 2.a.). Typically, a journalist.who has criticized a
 government official or policy is detained for 5 to 10 days. While in detention, the
 journalist may experience abuse (see Section 2.a.). Charges are filed rarely. Convic-
 tions are rare, but proceedings may last several years, with defendants required to
 
 
 1720
 appear in court regularly, only to be informed that another in a series of continu-
 ances has been issued in their case.
 Following -February demonstrations in Ma'an (see Section -l.a.), security forces
 conducted house-to-house searches for weapons and detained more thah 140 per-
 sons; All of the suspects were released over a period of months, except opposition
 figure Laith Shubaylat, who was tried and convicted of inciting the riots and sen-
 tenced to 9 months in prison. In May the King offered to pardon Shubaylat, but
 Shubaylat rejected the pardon on the grounds that he was appealing his conviction
 and that only an individual who had been finally convicted of a crime or made an
 admission of guilt could benefit from a royal pardon. -
 In February police detained journalist Abd Al-Hadi A1-Majali for 5 days during
 which time he was subjected to psychological abuse. He was detained for authoriz-
 ing the printing of a caricature mocking the Government's response to the Ma'an
 demonstrations (see Sections _.c.-and 2.a.).
 On the evening of September 30, 105 Filipino workers were arrested at their
 homes by security forces in Amman. Similar arrests continued over the next 2
 weeks. Although 90 of those originally arrested attempted to show the police their
 residence cards attesting to their legal status in Jordan, all were transported to jail
 where they were refused access to telephones to contact their employers and access
 to the facility's toilets. Some of those arrested allegedly were abused physically by
 the arresting officers. Several were private maids employed by foreign embassy per-
 sonnel. Foreign workers of other nationalities, including Sri Lankans, Egyptians,
 and Iraqis also were arrested in the raids, but the exact numbers of these groups
 is not known (see Sections 1.c. and 6.e.).
 During the year, human rights organizations reported more than 20 cases of arbi-
 trary detention. They believe that there were many more such cases that-were not
 documented. In one case, a 21-year-old man, Basil Abu Ghoshe, was detained late
 in the year despite already having served his 5-year sentence for murder. The au-
 thorities claimed that they had to detain him for his own pKotection because of
 threats from a rival tribe.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary;, however, the judiciary is subject to pressure from the executive
 branch. A judge's appointment to, advancement within, and dismissal from the judi-
 ciary are determined by a committee whose members are appointed by the King.
 The Ministry of Justice has great influence over a judge's career and often subverts
 the judicial system in favor of the executive branch. There have been numerous alle-
 gations that judges have been "reassigned" temporarily to another court or judicial
 district in order to remove them from a particular proceeding. In one instance, the
 Minister of Justice allegediy formed a special appeals :court panel to try several
 counts related to an influential member of society who had been charged with the
 sale of children to foreign adoptive parents in order to avoid a trial before the regu-
 lar court of appeals. In February Judge Farouk Al-Kilani was forced to retire from
 the Supreme Court, to which he had been appointed recently. Kilani alleged that
 he was asked to step down because of his involvement in the High Court of Justice's
 decision that rejected the legality of the May 1997 amendments to the Press and
 Publications Law. (The Court ruled that the amendments had been approved in an
 unconstitutional manner on an emergency basis.) Judges also complain of unlawful
 telephone surveillance.
 The judicial system consists of several types of courts. Most criminal cases are
 tried in civilian courts, which include the appeals courts, the Court of Cassation,
 and the Supreme Court. Cases involving sedition, armed insurrection, financial
 crimes, drug trafficking, and offenses -against the King are tried in the State Secu-
 rity Court. In January 1997, the Parliament passed amendments to the law govern-
 ing the State Security Court that effectively extended its mandate indefinitely. The
 amendments had been rejected earlier by the lower house's judicial committee as
 "undemocratic" and contrary, to the principle of judicial independence. Islamic, or
 Shari'a, courts, have jurisdiction over marriage and divorce among Muslims and in-
 heritance cases involving both Muslims and non-Muslims (see Section 5).
 Most trials-in the civilian courts are open. Defendants are entitled to legal coun-
 sel, may challenge witnesses, and have the right to appeal. Defendants facing the
 death penalty or life imprisonment must be represented by legal counsel. Public de-
 fenders are provided-if the defendant in such cases cannot afford to hire legal coun-
 sel. Shari'a regards the testimony of one man to be equal to the testimony of two
 women. This -technically applies only in religious courts but in the past has been
 imposed in civil courts as well, regardless of religion.
 The State Security Court consists of a panel of three judges who may be either
 civilians or military officers. Sessions frequently are closed to the public. Defendants
 
 
 1721
 tried in the State Security Court often are held in pretrial detention without access
 to lawyers, although they are visited by representatives of the ICRC. In the State
 Security Court, judges have inquired into allegations that defendants were tortured
 and have allowed the testimony of physicians regarding these allegations. To date
 the Court has not invalidated a confession obtained under duress, but on review,
 the Court of Cassation has ruled that the State Security Court cannot issue a death
 sentence on the basis of such a confession alone. Defendants in the State Security
 Court have the right to appeal their sentences to the Court of Cassation, which is
 authorized to review issues of both fact and law. Appeals are automatic for cases
 involving the death penalty.
 In the past, defense attorneys have challenged the appointment of military judges
 to the State Security Court to try civilian cases as contrary to the concept of an
 independent judiciary. Military judges appear to receive adequate training in civil
 law and procedure and State Security Court decisions are subject to review by the
 Court of Cassation.
 In the past, the press routinely has carried details of cases tried before the State
 Security Court. However, provisions of the amended Press and Publication Law pro-
 hibit press coverage of any case that is under investigation without explicit permis-
 sion from the authorities.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution requires that security forces obtain a warrant from the Prosecutor Gen-
 eral or a judge before conducting searches or otherwise interfering with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence. The security services generally respect these con-
 stitutional restrictions; however, in security cases, the authorities sometimes-in
 violation of the law--obtain warrants retroactively or obtain pre-approved warrants.
 Security officers reportedly monitor telephone conversations, read correspondence,
 and engage in surveillance of persons who are considered to pose a threat to the
 Government or national security. While these practices are not believed to be wide-
 spread, the law permits them if the Government obtains a court order. Judges com-
 plain of unlawful telephone surveillance (see Section I.e.).
 On occasion the Government blocked the entry of foreign publications (see Section
 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, the Government imposes some restrictions on these rights.
 Restrictive amendments to the Press and Publications Law promulgated in Septem-
 ber, combined with a new Press Association Law passed in July, impose stringent
 restraints on the operation of newspapers. The Government also intimidates jour-
 nalists to encourage self-censorship. Private citizens may be prosecuted for slander-
 ing the royal family, the Government, or foreign leaders and for sowing sedition.
 Citizens generally do not hesitate to criticize the Government openly, but are more
 circumspect in regard to the King and the royal family.
 The Press Association Law limits the practice of journalism to Jordan Press Asso-
 ciation (JPA) members, potentially excluding dozens of practicing journalists from
 the profession, and forbidding publishers from hiring non-journalists. By year's end,
 no publishers or journalists had been cited for violating the law.
 The Press and Publications Law grants the Government wide discretionary pow-
 ers to issue fines, withdraw licenses, and order shutdowns to control the editorial
 content of newspapers. The law forbids reporting on criminal cases at any stage of
 the investigation into any case or crime without prior authorization from the public
 prosecutor. Details of court proceedings may not be published without a court's per-
 mission. Violations of this section of the Press and Publications Law entail a fine
 of between $7,000 and $14,000 (5,OOQ and 10,000 dinars). The publication of a news-
 paper or periodical without a license entails the same fine.
 It is illegal under the Press Law to publish news, opinion, information, reports,
 caricatures, or photos that disparage the King or the royal family, pertain to the
 armed forces or security services, harm national unity, disparage religion, offend an
 individual or harm his reputation, disparage the heads of friendly states, harm the
 country's relations with other nations, promote perversion or lead to moral corrup-
 tion, shake confidence in the national currency, or feature false news or rumors.
 The Press and Publications Law also provides that those who seek to obtain a
 newspaper license must show proof of capital of $700,000 (500,000 dinars) for a
 daily, $140,000 (100,000 dinars) for most other publications, and $7,000 (5,000 di-
 nars) for specialized publications. Furthermore, the editor-in-chief of a newspaper
 now is required under the law to be a citizen and to have 8 years of experience as
 a full-time journalist.
 
 
 1722
 
 -Persons accused of violating the Press and Publications Law are tried in a special
 court for press and copyright cases. Journalists also are prosecuted for criminal and
 security violations in connection with their work. Although many cases are dis-
 missed before trial, many other cases linger on for years. No one has been charged
 under the Law, but the Government routinely has used detention and prosecution
 or the threat of prosecution to intimidate journalists and to encourage self-censor-
 ship (see Section 1.d.).
 The Penal Code authorizes the State to take action against any person who incites
 violence, defames heads of state, disseminates "false or exaggerated information out-
 side the country which attacks state dignity," or defames a public official.
 In October 1997, 500 copies of the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Article
 19's report on press freedoms in Jordan arriving by airfreight from London were
 confiscated at Queen Alia airport. The publications were to be distributed at an-Ar-
 ticle 19-sponsored conference in Amman on freedom of expression in Jordan. Article
 19 later distributed other copies of the report at its workshop without incident.
 In September 1997, the Government shut down 13 Weekly newspapers for not
 meeting the arbitrary capitalization standard ($420,000-300,000 dinars) required
 in the May 1997 Press and Publications Law amendments. The weeklies resumed
 publication in February after Jordan's High Court of Justice nullified the amend-
 ments on constitutional grounds.
 In February security forces detained journalist Abd Al-Hadi AI-Majali for 5 days
 at the GID facility, where police subjected him to verbal threats against his person
 and his family, sleep deprivation, and other forms of abuse designed to intimidate
 him. A-Majali was detained for authorizing the printing of a caricature mocking the
 Government's response to demonstrations in Ma an (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.).
 On April 9, the day of the murder of a prominent Jordanian lawyer, his son, and
 his psychiatrist, police from the general security department entered the offices of
 the daily newspaper Al-Arab A-Yawm and physically blocked the entrance so that
 copies of the newspaper could not be distributed until that day's issue was reviewed
 and approved by the press authority. On April 10, journalists Nabil Ghishan and
 Linda Ma'aya were charged with violation of an order of non-publication, although
 the publication had occurred before the newspaper had received an order. Since its
 founding in May 1997, journalists from Al-Arab Al-Yawm have been indicted in 12
 separate cases for violation of the Press and Publications Law; 10 of the cases re-
 main open and 2 others were suspended.
 In April journalist Yousef Ghishan was arrested at his home at midnight. During
 the course of the arrest, his home was searched- and police accused Ghishan of
 issuing a pro-Islamist bulletin. In May Ghishan was called before the GID about a
 parody he had written entitled "The Dog and the Gazelle." Security agents there in-
 sultedand threatened him. He also has been required to appear in court weekly,
 along with journalist Omar Nadi, in a case brought against them in January 1997
 for slandering a Member of Parliament and a government minister.
 Journalist Hussein El Amoush was arrested three times during the year.
 At year's end, the Government dropped all pending charges against journalists
 that previously had been brought under the Press and Publications Law. However,
 suits brought by individual plaintiffs under the same law still are pending.
 The Government is the sole broadcaster of radio and television programs. The
 Government has commercial agreements with the British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC); the London-based Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC), and Radio Monte
 Carlo that allow them to simulcast their regional programs using local radio trans-
 mitters. Radio and television news broadcasts are more restricted than the print
 media. Jordan Television (JTV) reports only the Government's position on controver-
 sial matters. International satellite television and Israeli and Syrian television
 broadcasts are available and unrestricted.-
 Despite a March 1997 government announcement ending the predistribution cen-
 sorship of publications entering the country, in October 1997, the Government
 blocked the distribution of 54 issues of imported Arabic-language publications and
 16 issues of British newspapers. During 1998 the Government also barred 12 issues
 of Al Quds Al Arabi and 35 issues of Al Hayat from entering the country.
 No university professors were dismissed for their political views during the year.
 However, intellectuals believe that there are no safeguards to prevent such dismis-
 sals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The-Government restricts free-
 dom of assembly. Citizens must obtain permits for public gatherings. The Govern-
 ment granted almost no permits for peaceful demonstrations during the year. The
 Government denies permits for public protests and rallies that it determines pose
 a threat to security. During the U.N.-Iraq crisis in February, the Government de-
 nied all requests for permits to demonstrate in connection with the crisis. Also in
 
 
 1723
 
 February riots took place in Ma'an after police attempted to stop a demonstration.
 One citizen was-killed and more than 140 persons later were detained (see Sections
 l.a. and l.d.). In April the Government also denied permits to members of Palestin-
 ian communities in the region to hold a series of protests to mark the 50th anniver-
 sary of the creation of the state of Israel. Public demonstrations were prohibited in
 August. after U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.
 The Government restricts freedom of association. The Government requires but
 routinely grants approval for conferences, workshops, and seminars.
 The Government routinely licenses political parties and other associations. There
 are currently 20 licensed political parties. Membership in an unlicensed political
 party is illegal. The Government may deny licenses to parties that it decides do not
 meet a list of political criteria contained in the Political Parties Law. The High
 Court of Justice may dissolve a party if it violates the Constitution or the Political
 Parties Law.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 religion and provides for "personal freedom;" however, the Government imposes
 some restrictions on the freedom of religion. According to the Constitution, Islam
 is the state religion. Sunni Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population.
 Islamic institutions are managed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Trusts,
 which appoints imams and subsidizes certain activities sponsored by mosques. The
 Political Parties Law prohibits houses of worship from being used for political party
 activity. The law was designed primarily to prevent Islamist parliamentarians from
 preaching in mosques. Religious instruction is mandatory for all Muslim students
 in public schools. Christian and Baha'i students are not required to attend courses
 in Islam.
 The Government does not interfere with public worship by the country's Christian
 minority. Established religious groups, which include Islam, Roman Catholicism, Ar-
 menian Orthodoxy, and Greek Orthodoxy, as well as the Baptist Church, the Angli-
 can Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Assyrian Church, enjoy official gov-
 ernment recognition. The Government does not recognize the Baha'i faith as a reli-
 gion but does not prohibit the practice of the faith. However, Baha'is face both offi-
 cial and societal discrimination. The Government does not record the bearer's reli-
 gion on national identity cards issued to Baha'is, nor does it register property be-
 longing to the community. Unlike Christian denominations, the Baha'i community
 does not have its own court to adjudicate personal status and family matters. Bahai
 personal status matters are heard in Islamic law courts.
 The Government does not recognize Jehovah's Witnesses, the United -Pentecostal
 Church, the Church of Christ, the Assembly of God, or the Church of Jesus Christ
 of Latter-Day Saints, but each denomination is allowed to conduct religious services
 and activities without interference.
 The law prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing Muslims. Muslims who convert
 to other faiths complain of social and government discrimination. The Government
 does not fully recognize the legality of such conversions. Under Shari'a converts are
 regarded as apostates and legally may be denied their property and other rights.
 However, this principle is not applied. Converts from Islam do not fall under the
 jurisdiction of their new religion's laws in matters of personal status -and still are
 considered Muslims under Shari'a, although the reverse is not true. Christians are
 subject to aspects of Shari'a that designate how inheritances are distributed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for the right of citizens to travel freely abroad and
 within the country except in designated military areas; however, there are some re-
 strictions on freedom of movement. The law requires that all women, including for-
 eign women married to citizens, obtain written permission from a male guardian-
 usually their father or husband-to apply for a Jordanian passport. A woman travel-
 ing abroad with children also may be required to show written authorization from
 her spouse before departure. Authorities enforce requests from fathers-to prevent
 their children from departing the country, even when the children are traveling
 with their mothers.
 Jordanians with full citizenship receive passports that are valid for 5 years. Most
 Palestinians living in Jordan are -citizens and receive passports that are valid for
 5 years. However, approximately 150,000 Palestinian residents-most refugees or
 children of refugees who arrived from Gaza after 1967--do not qualify for citizen-
 ship. They receive 2-year passports valid for travel only. Following the country's ad-
 ministrative and legal disengagement from the West Bank in 1988, Palestinians re-
 siding in the West Bank received 2-year passports valid for travel only; instead of
 the 5-year Jordanian passport that they had received previously. In October 1995,
 King Hussein announced that West Bank residents without other travel documenta-
 tion would again be eligible to receive 5-year passports. However, the Government
 
 
 1724
 
 has stressed that these passports are for travel only and do not connote citizenship,
 which only can be- shown by presenting one's "national number," a  civil registration
 number accorded at birth or upon naturalization to persons holding citizenship. The
 national number is recorded- on national identity cards and in family registration
 books, which are issued only to Jordanian citizens. Following a successful lawsuit
 in December 1997 by a West Bank resident who, prior to 1988, had held a Jor-
 danian passport (the authorities had refused to issue the plaintiff a new passport),
 the authorities have begun to issue 5-year Jordanian passports to those who are
 deemed to be noncitizens of Palestinian origin. However, such residents do not enjoy
 the rights of citizens because they have no national number. All Palestinians must
 obtain permits from the Ministry of the Interior for travel between Jordan and the
 Israeli-occupied territories. Such permission is granted routinely.
 The Constitution prohibits the deportation of citizens. The Government respects
 this prohibition, but has deported Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who
 hold Jordanian passports but do not enjoy the rights of citizens.
 In December the Government prevented a substantial number of the 70 Jor-
 danians invited to a conference for Palestinian opposition groups in Damascus from
 attending. According to the Jordan Times, Minister of Interior Nayef Al Qadi stated
 that if the Government had information that a particular person's travel would "en-
 danger Jordan's interests and its relations" with certain countries, the Government
 would "never hesitate" to bar such travel-
 The Government generally cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR). There is no law or statute that provides for the grant
 of refugee status to asylum seekers. The UNHCR must resettle refugees in other
 countries. However, in April the Ministry of Interior signed a memorandum of un-
 derstanding with the UNHCR concerning the status and treatment of refugees.
 Under the agreement, the Government admits asylum seekers, including those who
 have entered the country clandestinely, and respects the UNUCR's eligibility deter-
 minations under the refugee definitions set forth in the 1951 U.N. Convention Re-
 lating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The agreement provides pro-
 tections against refoulement (the forcible return of refugees) from the country, and
 recognizes the legal definition of a refugee as set forth in the U.N. Convention. Since
 1996 the UNHCR has held regular seminars to train law enforcement officials in
 international refugee law, including specialized courses for policewomen. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum. Since 1991 17,131 persons have sought asylum
 through the UNHCR, and in approximately 5,000 cases (approximately 30 percent)
 applicants have been accorded refugee status.  �
 According to unconfirmed reports, in February several hundred Iraqi nationals at-
 tempting to enter the country clandestinely were refused entry. In addition, persons
 have been deported involuntarily to Syria.
 The Government estimates that over 180,000 Iraqis reside- in the country. Since
 1991 thousands of Iraqis have applied for refugee status and received legal and ma-
 terial assistance from the UNHCR. During the year, 10,214 persons applied for, and
 790 were accorded, refugee status. The UNHCR also received applications for refu-
 gee status during the year from Sudanese, Syrian, and Libyan asylum seekers.
 Although the children of asylum seekers previously were not allowed to attend
 public schools, the Government now allows all Iraqis to enroll in school,- regardless
 of their status. However, the requirement that children provide copies of their Iraqi
 school certificates in order to-enroll still places impediments in the way of many ref-
 ugee children.
 During the U.N.-Iraq crises in February and November, the Government an-
 nounced that it would not accept a large-scale influx of Iraqi refugees in the event
 of hostilities, but said- that it would facilitate assistance for potential Iraqi refugees
 on the Iraqi side of the border.
 Over 1.35 million Palestinian refugees are registered in Jordan with the United
 Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The UNRWA counts another 800,000
 Palestinians as either displaced persons from the 1967 war, arrivals following the
 1967 war, or returnees from the Gulf between 1990 and 1991.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government. The King has sole
 discretionary authority to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,
 to dissolve Parliament, and to establish public policy. Appointments made by the
 King to high government posts do not require legislative approval. Executive power
 is vested in the King (or, in his absence, in the Regent), who exercises his power
 through his ministers in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. A range
 
 
 1725
 
 of these authorities were ceded to former Crown Prince Hassan while he was Regent
 during the summer and fall.
 The Parliament is composed of the 40-member Senate, appointed by the King, and
 the popularly elected 80-member Chamber of Deputies. The Parliament is empow-
 ered by the Constitution to approve, reject, and amend legislation proposed by the
 Cabinet. A group of 10 senators or deputies may submit draft bills for consideration;
 however, in practice Members of Parliament ask the Government to initiate legisla-
 tion for consideration. Opposition Members of Parliament have complained that at-
 tempts by members of the lower house to initiate legislation receive no response
 from the Government. The King proposes and dismisses extraordinary sessions of
 Parliament and may postpone regular sessions for up to 60 days. By law, if the Gov-
 ernment amends or enacts a law when Parliament is not in session, it must submit
 the law to Parliament for consideration during the next session. However, this does
 not always occur.
 The Electoral Law and the distribution of parliamentary seats deliberately favor
 regions with populations known for their traditional, pro-Hashemite views, i.e.,
 rural and southern Jordan.
 Over 500 candidates competed in the November 1997 parliamentary elections, de-
 spite a boycott by Islamist and other parties. There were-many reports of registra-
 tion irregularities and fraud on the part of candidates. Restrictions on the press and
 on campaign materials also had a negative effect on 'the campaign, which elicited
 much debate over the fairness of the Electoral Law and its implementation. Voter
 turnout was significantly lower in most urban areas than in rural areas. Centrist
 candidates with ties to major tribes dominate the new Parliament.
 The so-called one-man, one-vote amendment to the Electoral Law was ratified by
 Parliament in January of 1997, nearly 4 years after it was first proposed by royal
 decree. The amendment allows voters to choose only one candidate in multiple-seat
 districts. In the largely tribal society, citizens tend to cast their first vote for family
 members, and any additional votes in accordance with their political leanings.
 Hence, the amendment limits the chances of some nontribal candidates, including
 women, to be elected.
 Women have the right to vote, and women's groups encourage women to vote and
 to be active in the political process. There are no women in the Cabinet, although
 there was one female minister in the previous government. Fifteen women were
 elected to municipal posts in 1997, bringing the total number of women in such
 posts to 28, including one as mayor of Khirbet Al Wahadneh, near Ajloun. None of
 the 17 female candidates won seats in the November 1997 parliamentary elections.
 Of the 80 seats in the lower house, 9 are reserved for Christians, 6 for Bedouins,
 and 3 for the Circassian or Chechen ethnic minorities.
 The Palestinian community, estimated to be slightly over half of the total popu-
 lation, is not represented proportionately in the Government Only 4 of 23 ministers,
 5 of 40 senators, and 10 of 80 lower house deputies are of Palestinian origin. The
 electoral system gives greater representation to areas that have a majority of inhab-
 itants of non-Palestinian origin.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups investigate allegations of human
 rights abuses and publish and disseminate findings critical of government policy.
 However, the Press and Publications Law restricts the publication of information
 about the military and security services, which, in effect, prevents the publication
 by local groups of reports alleging torture and other abuses committed by the secu-
 rity services.
 The local chapters of the AOHR and the Jordanian Human Rights Organization
 (JHRO) are registered with the Government. The AOHR has drawn public attention
 to alleged human rights abuses and a range of other political issues and has pressed
 the Government to bring charges against political detainees or to release them
 promptly. It asserts that the Government responds to only about 10 percent of the
 complaints that it submits on behalf of individuals alleged to have suffered human
 rights violations by the authorities.
 The ICRC generally is permitted full and unrestricted access to detainees, includ-
 ing those held by the GID and the military intelligence directorate. However, begin-
 ning in September 1997, the ICRC was not allowed to visit prisoner Ismail Ajarmeh,
 who was detained by the GID (see Section L.a.). As a result, the ICRC suspended
 its visits to GID detention facilities during the last 3 months of 1997 and the first
 2 months of 1998. After Ajarmeh's reported suicide, the ICRC resumed visits to GID
 detainees. In May the ICRC suspended visits to a GID facility for 3 weeks when
 its representatives again were refused access to a prisoner.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the law does not distinguish between citizens on the basis of race,
 women and minorities are treated differently under the law and may face discrimi-
 nation in employment, housing, and other areas.
 Women.-Violence against women over the age of 15 is common. Reported inci-
 dents of violence against women do not reflect the full extent of the problem. Medi-
 cal experts acknowledge that spousal abuse occurs frequently. However, cultural
 norms discourage victims from seeking medical or legal help' and frustrate an objec-
 tive assessment of the extent of such abuse.
 Abused women have the right to file a complaint in court against their spouses
 for physical abuse, but, in practice familial and societal pressures discourage them
 from seeking legal remedies. Marital rape is legal. NGO's such as the Jordanian
 Women's Union, which has a telephone hot line for victims of domestic violence, pro-
 vide assistance in such matters. Wife. beating is technically grounds for divorce, but
 the husband may seek to demonstrate that he has authority from the Koran to cor-
 rect an irreligious or disobedient wife by striking her.
 The Criminal Code allows leniency for a person found guilty of committing a
 "crime of honor," a euphemism that refers to a violent assault against a female by
 a male relative for alleged sexual misconduct. Law enforcement treatment of men
 accused of "honor crimes" reflects widespread unwillingness to condemn or take ac-
 tion against the problem. More than-20.-such-murders were reported during the year
 in which the victims were shot, strangled, stabbed, bludgeoned, and burned to
 death. Human rights monitors believe that many more such crimes were committed
 but not documented as honor crimes: Moreover, most "crimes- of honor" are not re-
 ported by the press. The actual number of "honor crimes" is believed by a local ex-
 pert to be four times as high. One forensic-medical examiner estimates that 25 per-
 cent of all murders committed in the country-are "honor" crimes. The police regu-
 larly imprison women who are potential victims of "honor crimes" for their own pro-
 tection. There were up to 50 women- involuntarily detained in this form of "protec-
 tive custody" during the year.
 According to the law, a "crime of honor" defense may be invoked by a defendant
 accused of murder who "surprises his wife or any close-female relative" in an act
 of adultery or fornication, in which case the perpetrator of the "honor crime" is
 judged not guilty of murder. Although few defendants can meet the stringent re-
 quirements for a "crime of hono ' de ense (i.e., the defendant personally must have
 witnessed the-female victim engagingin sexual relations), they are not tried for the
 crime of murder, and convicted.offenders rarely.spend more than 2 years in prison.
 (In contrast to "or crimes,", the maximum penalty for first-degree murder is death,
 and the maximum penalty -for-second-degree murder is 15 years.) Such defenses
 commonly rely onthe male relative'having acted in the heat of passion upon hear-
 ing of a female ,relative's alleged -sexual transgression, usually without any inves-
 tigation on -the part of the -assailant to determine the veracity of the allegation be-
 fore committing the assault. Women may-not invoke this defense for murdering a
 male relative under the-same circumstances, nor-may they use it for killing men
 who attempt to rape, sexually harass, or otherwise threaten their "honor."
 In January the Criminal Court sentenced a 22-year-old man, Mohammad Abed,
 to just 6 months in prison after he was found guilty of murdering his younger sister
 in March 1997. Abed pleaded not guilty to shooting his 19-year-old sister, Hanan,
 on the-grounds that he had committed the crime in a "fit of fury" to "cleanse the
 family honor" after he heard that she had been "going out to eat with another man,
 and was receiving gifts and money from him."
 Yasmine Abdullah, age 20, was shot to death by her 32-year-old brother Sirhan
 in March. According to the defendant's court testimony, Yasmine had been raped
 by a member of her family, thereby "tarnishing the family's honor" The victim origi-
 nally had sought the protection of the police, but returned to her family's home after
 her father signed a statement promising that he would not harm his daughter. The
 same day that she was released, Yasmine's brother shot her four times in the chest,
 killing her instantly. Sirhan Abdullah was originally sentenced to 1 year in prison
 for the murder, but served only 6 months and was released in October.
 Also in March the Criminal Court dismissed murder charges against Salih Salam
 and Mariam Salamah. They had been accused of murdering a 5-day-old baby that
 they had conceived out of wedlock. The child's father confessed to killing his daugh-
 ter in order to "protect his honor."
 In June two cousins, Ahmoad Salem and-Hussein Faleh, had their sentences for
 the murder of-their aunt reduced to 15 years in prison. The court found that the
 crime had not been premeditated. The charges were amended after the court con-
 cluded that the defendants had not meant to kill their aunt, but rather thought that
 
 
 1727
 they were shooting their 17-year-old cousin, who had become pregnant out of wed-
 lock.
 Women experience legal discrimination in matters of pension and social security
 benefits, inheritance, divorce, and the value of court testimony. A woman's testi-
 mony is worth only half that of a man's (see Section i.e.). The Government provides
 men with more generous social security benefits than women. The Government con-
 tinues pension payments of deceased male civil servants to their heirs but discon-
 tinues payments of deceased female civil servants.
 Under Shari'a female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance,
 and the non-Muslim widows of Muslim spouses have no inheritance rights. A sole
 female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male
 relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs
 have the duty to provide for all family members who need assistance. Under Shari'a
 men are able to divorce their spouses more easily than women. Marriage and di-
 vorce matters for Christians are adjudicated by special courts for each denomina-
 tion. Married women are ineligible for work in the diplomatic service, and, until re-
 cently, most women in the diplomatic corps automatically were assigned to adminis-
 trative positions. There are five female judges in the country.
 The law requires a married woman to obtain her husband's permission to obtain
 a passport (see Section 2.d.). Married women do not have the legal right to transmit
 citizenship to their children. Furthermore, women may not petition for citizenship
 for their non-Jordanian husbands. The husbands themselves may apply for citizen-
 ship after fulfilling a requirement of 15 years continuous residence. Once they have
 obtained citizenship, they may apply to transmit the citizenship to their children.
 However, in practice such an application may take years, and in many cases citizen-
 ship ultimately still may be denied to the husband and children. Such children be-
 come stateless and lack the rights of citizen children, such as to attend school or
 seek other government services. Civil law grants women equal pay for equal work,
 but in practice this law often is ignored.
 Social pressures discourage many women from pursuing professional careers.
 Nonetheless, women have employment opportunities in many professions, including
 engineering, medicine, education, and the law. Women constitute approximately 14
 percent of the work force and 45 percent of university students. Women's groups
 stress that the problem of discrimination is not only one of law, but also of women's
 lack of awareness of their rights or unwillingness to assert those rights. The United
 Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 1995 that women Who work
 in agriculture average 15-hour days and earn less than men. The Jordanian chapter
 of the Business and Professional Women's Club gives seminars on women's rights
 and assists women in establishing small businesses. Members of the royal family
 work actively to improve the status of women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare in the
 areas of education and health. However, government efforts in these areas are con-
 strained by limited financial resources. Education is compulsory~to age 15, but chil-
 dren who do not attend school or attend infrequently are not considered truant. The
 law prohibits corporal punishment in schools. The children of Iraqi citizens living
 in Jordan without residence permits now are permitted to attend school, however,
 many still are unable to do so (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government safeguards some children's rights, especially regarding child
 labor. Although the law prohibits children under the age of 16 from working, child
 peddlers work the streets of Amman. The Ministry of Social Development has a
 committee to address the problem and in some cases removes the children from the
 streets, returns them to their families or to juvenile centers, and may provide the
 families with a monthly stipend. However, the children often return to the streets.
 Although the problem is difficult to quantify, social and health workers believe
 that there is a significant incidence of child abuse in families, and that the incidence
 of child sexual abuse is significantly higher than reported. The law specifies punish-
 ment for abuses against children. Rape or sodomy of a child under 15 years of age
 carries the death penalty.
 Illegitimate children are entitled to the same rights under the law as legitimate
 children. However, in practice they suffer severe discrimination in a society that
 does not tolerate adultery. Most illegitimate children become wards of the State or
 live a meager existence on the fringes of society. In either case, their prospects for
 marriage and gainful employment are limited.
 People With Disabilities.-High unemployment in the general population restricts
 job opportunities for disabled persons, estimated by the Ministry of Social Develop-
 ment to number 100,000. Eighty percent of disabled citizens receive monetary as-
 sistance from the Gover GovernmentGovernment passed legislation in 1993 requiring
 future public buildings to accommodate the needs of the disabled and to retrofit ex-
 
 
 1728
 isting public buildings, but implementation has been slow. Since 1993 the Special
 Education Department of the Ministry of Social Development has enrolled approxi-
 mately 10,000 mentally and physically disabled persons in public and private sector
 training courses. It has placed approximately 400 disabled persons in public and pri-
 vate sector jobs. The law requires that 2 percent of the available jobs be reserved
 for the physically disabled. Private organizations and members of the royal family
 actively promote programs to protect and promote the interests of the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The country's indigenous people, nomadic Bedouin and East
 Bank town dwellers, traditionally have been the backbone of popular support for the
 Hashemite monarchy. As a result, they generally have enjoyed considerable influ-
 ence within the political system. They are represented disproportionately in senior
 military, security, and civil service jobs. Nevertheless, many Bedouin in rural areas
 are severely disadvantaged economically.
 Religious Minorities.-In general Christians do not suffer discrimination. Chris-
 tians hold government positions and are represented in the media and academia ap-
 proximately in proportion to their presence in the general population, which is esti-
 mated at 6 percent. Baha'is face some societal and official discrimination. Their
 faith is not recognized officially, and Baha'is are classified as -Muslims on official
 documents, such as the national identity card. Christian and Baha'i children in pub-
 lic schools are not required to participate in Islamic religious instruction.
 National/Racial IEthnic Minorities.-The Government granted citizenship to all
 Palestinians who fled to Jordan in the period after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and
 to a large number of refugees and displaced persons who arrived as a result of the
 1967 war. However, most refugees who fled Gaza after 1967 are not entitled to citi-
 zenship and are issued 2-year passports valid for travel only. In October 1995, King
 Hussein announced that West Bank residents without other travel documentation
 would be eligible to receive 5-year Jordanian passports. However, The Government
 has stressed that these passports are for travel only and do not connote citizenship
 (see Section 2.d.). Palestinians residing in Jordan suffer discrimination in appoint-
 ments to positions in the Government and the military, and in the granting of uni-
 versity scholarships.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in the private sector and in some state-
 owned companies have the right to establish and join unions. Unions must be reg-
 istered to be considered legal. The law prohibits union membership for noncitizens.
 Over 30 percent of the work force is organized into 17 unions. Although union mem-
 bership in the General Federation of Jordanian Trade Unions (GFJTU), the sole
 trade federation, is not mandatory, all unions belong to it. The Government sub-
 sidizes and audits the GFJT~s salaries and activities. Union officials are elected
 by secret ballot to 4-year terms. Although the Government cosponsors and approves
 the timing of these elections, it does not interfere in the choice of candidates.
 Labor laws mandate that workers must obtain permission from the Government
 in order to strike. Unions generally do not seek approval for a strike, but workers
 use the threat of a strike as a negotiating tactic. Strikes are prohibited if a labor
 dispute is under mediation or arbitration. If a settlement is not reached through me-
 diation, the Ministry of Labor may refer the dispute to an industrial tribunal by
 agreement of both parties. The tribunal is an independent arbitration panel of
 judges appointed by the Ministry of Labor. The decisions of the panel are binding
 legally. If only one party agrees, the Ministry of Labor refers the dispute to the
 Council of Ministers and then to Parliament. Labor law prohibits employers from
 dismissing a worker during a labor dispute. There were no reported strikes during
 the year.
 The GFJTU belongs to the Arab Labor Organization, the International Confed-
 eration of Arab Trade-Unions, and to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have, and exercise,
 the right to bargain collectively. The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion, but the ICFTU claims that the Government does not protect adequately em-
 ployees from antiunion discrimination and that the Government has dismissed pub-
 lic-sector employees for political reasons. Workers may lodge complaints of
 antiunion discrimination with the Ministry of Labor, which is authorized to order
 the reinstatement of employees discharged for union activities. There were no com-
 plaints of antiunion discrimination lodged with the Ministry of Labor during the
 year.
 The national labor laws apply in the free trade zones in Aqaba and Zarqa. Private
 sector employees in these zones belong to one national union that covers both zones
 and have the right to bargain collectively.
 
 
 1729
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids compul-
 sory labor except in a state of emergency such as war or natural disaster. Compul-
 sory labor is not practiced. The law does not prohibit specifically forced or compul-
 sory labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur.
 d.Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Labor law
 forbids children under the age of 16 from working full time except as apprentices.
 At age 13, children may begin part-time training for up to 6 hours a day, with night
 work prohibited. Ministry of Labor inspectors attempt to enforce the law on child
 labor, but in practice, enforcement often does not extend to some small family busi-
 nesses that employ underage children. Education is compulsory to age 15. Families
 in remote areas frequently keep school-age children at home to work. Child peddlers
 work on the streets of Amman (see Section 5). The law does not prohibit specifically
 forced or compulsory labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur
 (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The Gov-
 ernment periodically adjusts a minimum wage schedule for various trades, based on
 the recommendations of an advisory panel representing workers, employers, and the
 Government. The lowest minimum wage rate on the schedule is about $112 (80 di-
 nars) per month, including allowances. Workers earning the lowest wages find it dif-
 ficult to provide a decent standard of living for their families. The Government esti-
 mates that the poverty level is at a monthly wage of about $91 (65 dinars) per
 month for a family of three. A study conducted by the Ministry of Social Develop-
 ment found that 150,000 families, or 21 percent of citizens, live at or below the pov-
 erty level. Nine percent live in "abject" poverty. The Government provides some, but
 often minimal, assistance to 33,000 indigent families.
 The law prohibits most workers from working more than the customary 48 hours
 per week. Hotel, restaurant and cinema employees may work up to 54 hours per
 week. Workers may not work more than 16 hours in any continuous period or more
 than 60 hours of overtime per month. Employees are entitled to 1 day off each week.
 The law does not apply to domestic servants, who do not have a legal forum to
 address their labor grievances and have no standing to sue in court for nonpayment
 of wages. Abuse of domestic servants, most of whom are foreign, is widespread. Im-
 prisonment of maids and illegal confiscation of travel documents by employers is
 common. Complaints of beatings, insufficient food, and rape generally are not re-
 ported to officials by victims, who fear losing their work permits and being returned
 to their country. Domestic servants generally are not given days off and frequently
 are required to work around the clock.
 On September 30, 105 Filipino workers were arrested at their homes by security
 forces in Amman. Similar arrests occurred over the next 2 weeks. Although 90 of
 those arrested attempted to show police their residence cards attesting to their legal
 status in Jordan, all were transported to jail where they were refused access to tele-
 phones to contact their employers. Foreign workers of other nationalities, including
 ri Lankans, Egyptians, and Iraqis, also apparently were arrested in the raids, but
 the exact number of these groups is unknown (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d.). In Novem-
 ber a 21-year-old Sri Lankan, Subramaniam Kanagarani, was admitted to Al Bashir
 hospital in Amman after she had been "deposited" at her agent's doorstep by her
 employer with lesions on her body, including infected burns, bloody and blackened
 eyes, welts on her stomach and back, and unusual swelling on her hands and feet.
 According to the Jordan Times, she appeared to be severely underweight and to
 have been tied up for long periods of time. The authorities released no information
 about whether charges would be filed against the alleged perpetrators of the abuse.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements for workers, includ-
 ing the presence of bathrooms, drinking water, and first aid equipment at work
 sites. The Ministry of Labor generally enforces health and safety standards. The law
 does not require employers to report industrial accidents or occupational diseases
 to the Ministry of Labor. Workers do not have a statutory right to remove them-
 selves form hazardous conditions without risking the loss of their jobs.
