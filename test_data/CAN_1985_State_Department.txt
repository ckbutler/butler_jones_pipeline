 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy in the British
 Commonwealth with a federal parliamentary form of government
 and strong democratic traditions. By universal suffrage,
 voters elect representatives in the multiparty political
 system at local, Provincial, and Federal levels. Government
 responsibilities are defined by a national Constitution
 subject to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Federal and Provincial election mandates last a maximum of 5
 years. Elections are completely free and often result in a
 changeover of power to opposition parties.
 National and local law enforcement are carried out by the
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police and various Provincial and
 municipal police forces. Canada's armed forces are under the
 authority of the elected civilian government and have no role
 in domestic law enforcement except in extreme circumstances
 under the War Measures Act (last invoked in 1970 during the
 terrorist kidnappings in Quebec). All such forces are under
 the strict control of civilian governments.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship. The Federal and
 Provincial Governments exercise moderate controls over areas
 such as communications and energy in order to encourage
 Canadian cultural identity and ownership.
 Respect for fundamental human rights in Canada is based on the
 well-established principle of the rule of law. It is firmly
 established in the Constitution and respected in numerous
 Federal and Provincial laws which relate to Canadian
 political, cultural, and social practices. The Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised Constitution in
 1982, guarantees fundamental rights to everyone. The
 Parliament or Provincial legislatures may enact limited
 exceptions to certain Charter provisions for up to 5 years
 (renewable for another 5).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There was no politically motivated killing by the Government
 or its domestic opposition in 1985. However, international
 terrorist acts did occur in Canada. In March 1985, Armenian
 terrorists attacked the Turkish Embassy in Ottawa, killing a
 Canadian security guard. Sikh terrorists are suspected of
 having planted bombs in June on two commercial planes
 departing from Canadian airports. The first plane, an Air
 India flight carrying over 300 (mainly Canadian) passengers
 and crew, crashed into the ocean near Ireland, killing all
 aboard. Salvagers are currently working to raise parts of the
 wreckage to ascertain the cause of the crash. The second
 incident involved a Canadian Pacific Airlines plane that left
 from Vancouver. A bomb planted in the plane's luggage
 exploded while being transferred in Japan's Narita Airport,
 killing two Japanese baggage handlers and'wounding four
 others. Security officials surmise that the bomb may have
 been aimed at another Air India flight, due to leave from
 Japan. Terrorist activities in Canada in 1985 have led to

 CANADA
 better security arrangements for airports and diplomatic
 buildings.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention,,and politically motivated
 disappearances have not occurred in Canada.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Legal prohibition of these, abuses is carefully respected in
 practice. Prison conditions generally are adequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution, subject. to override provisions, prohibits
 arbitrary detention and imprisonment. A person has the right
 to be informed promptly of reasons for his arrest or detention
 and to retain counsel without delay. Habeas corpus exists and
 is honored. Accused persons are generally released on bail
 pending trial. There are provisions for judicial review at
 specified-intervals in pretrial detention cases.
 Acts which may override the Constitution include the War
 Measures Act of 1914, augmented by a 1981 Federal Cabinet
 order, which permits a declaration of a state of emergency
 with suspension of certain basic civil liberties in the event
 of war or peacetime crisis. In addition, the 1939 Official
 Secrets Act, which prohibits the private possession,
 distribution, and publication of information deemed
 prejudicial to the interests of the state, provides that
 individuals under suspicion may be arrested without a
 warrant.
 Canada prohibits the use of any form of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both civil and criminal matters, the presumption of
 innocence and the right to a public trial are fundamental
 features of the Canadian legal system. Defendants have the
 right to counsel of their choice. Persons charged with.
 criminal offenses under Federal law may generally take
 advantage of Provincial legal aid programs subsidized by the
 Federal Government. These rights and protections are
 respected in practice.
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. Judges
 are appointed by either the Federal or Provincial Government,
 depending on the level and jurisdiction of the court. Secure
 tenure of judges and standards set by Provincial law societies
 contribute to judicial independence and impartiality.
 The Official Secrets Act allows for trials under its provisions
 to be held in secret and includes presumption in favor of the
 state. Prosecutions under this statute are extremely rare, and
 convictions are hard to maintain in the appellate process.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Federal and Provincial Governments do not interfere with
 the basic rights of individuals except when there is a
 
 
 939
 CANADA
 reasonable presumption that an individual is involved in
 criminal activity. Police officials face judicial penalties
 if they abuse a person's privacy (for example, through
 surreptitious entry or the monitoring of telephones and mail)
 without first obtaining a search warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to insure
 freedom of speech and press. The desire to protect collective
 as well as individual rights has led to special protection for
 language and cultural rights, particularly in the Province of
 Quebec.
 The new Charter of Rights and Freedoms, although granting all
 Canadians freedom of thought, belief, opinion, and expression,
 subjects those freedoms "only to such reasonable limits
 prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free
 and democratic society." The "reasonable'limits" exception
 enables Federal and Provincial Governments to legislate
 against pornography and hate literature and allows the
 existence of Provincial film boards. In 1985, two persons
 were convicted on charges stemming from this legislation. One
 was sentenced to 15 months in prison on charges of knowingly
 spreading false news likely to cause racial hatred by
 distributing a pamphlet which proclaimed that the Holocaust
 was a hoax. The other was fined $5,000 for allegedly having
 willfully promoted hatred against an identifiable group by
 teaching his high school students that the Holocaust was a
 hoax and that an international Jewish conspiracy existed.
 Both are appealing their convictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Associations representing a full range of political opinion
 may organize and espouse their views freely.
 Canadian labor unions represent 40 percent of the
 nonagricultural work force and enjoy wide freedom of action.
 Canadian law recognizes the right of labor in both the public
 and private sectors to organize, associate freely, bargain
 collectively, and strike. These rights are well established
 and recognized in practice, although certain groups of public
 sector employees have limited collective bargaining rights and
 only a limited right to strike. In November 1985, the Freedom
 of Association Committee of the International Labor
 Organization was to review complaints that several Provincial
 laws which limit the collective bargaining rights of public
 sector employees violate the principle of freedom of
 association in Canada.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All faiths enjoy freedom of worship and religious expression.
 The Government gives no official or unofficial preference to
 any religion.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Canadian citizens and permanent residents can travel in and
 outside the country, leave, and reenter. The Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms in the new Constitution strengthens the
 right of citizens and permanent residents to establish
 residence in any province and to take up employment there.
 Canada is a principal haven for refugees and has played a
 major role in focusing international attention on the causes
 of refugee problems.  New arrivals enjoy virtually all rights
 and privileges of Canadians and, after a period in permanent
 resident status, may become citizens and thereby obtain the
 right to vote.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by Federal and Provincial Governments that
 are genuinely elected by the Canadian people. Overall
 governing authority at the Federal level is vested in the
 House of Commons, whose members are elected by secret ballot
 through universal suffrage of Canadian citizens 18 years and
 older, and in a Senate appointed by the Governor General,
 Queen Elizabeth II's representative as Head of State. In
 practice, power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the
 Cabinet, who usually are elected members of the Commons.
 Elections for the 282 single-member constituencies in the
 Commons must be held at least every 5 years, and voter
 participation rates are high.
 Three politically diverse parties are represented in the House
 of Commons, and several others function at the provincial
 level. All Provinces and territories have similar freely
 elected legislatures. All Canadians-have complete freedom to
 participate actively in the political process, and incumbent
 governing parties are often defeated in elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada has vigorously supported efforts to increase the
 authority of international bodies to investigate and deal with
 human rights abuses and plays a major role in the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission is charged with
 investigating and resolving complaints of discrimination in
 government and business activities under Federal jurisdiction
 and combatting discrimination through information, education,
 and research. Each Province maintains a similar Human Rights
 Commission.
 In May 1985, Canada hosted the Human Rights Experts Meeting of
 the Conference on Security, and Cooperation in Europe. This
 meeting served to draw international attention to human rights
 problems.
 Amnesty International did not mention Canada in its 1985
 Report. Freedom House rated Canada "free."

 CANADA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Canada's population is approximately 25,399,000 and grows at
 an annual rate of about 1 percent. Per capita income was
 approximately $12,310 in 1983. Canada maintains one of the
 highest standards of living in the world.
 Article 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which took
 effect in April, 1985, guarantees equal benefits and
 protection of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic
 origin, color, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical
 disability. Food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all Canadians. Federal and Provincial
 governments administer extensive social welfare programs,
 including unemployment assistance, welfare aid, and a national
 medical and health insurance program covering all Canadians.
 Education is free through high school. The infant mortality
 rate is 8.5 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy at
 birth is 71.88 years for men and 78.98 for women. The
 federally determined poverty line for a family of three is
 about $11,977 in urban areas and $9,874 in rural areas.
 Additional government and social welfare programs are
 available to those with incomes below the poverty line.
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all
 guarantee a sufficient minimum wage (the lowest is about $2.'60
 per hour) and limit the standard work week to 40 or 48 hours.
 Federal and Provincial legislation ensure that working
 conditions are not hazardous for employees. Child labor
 legislation also differs among the provinces. The Federal
 Government generally prohibits those under 17 years of age
 from working for the Federal Government while school is in
 session. Provinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or
 16 from working without parental consent, working in any
 hazardous employment, or working at night.
 Generally, women participate fully in Canadian society. The
 enactment of Article 15 will supplement the protection of
 women's rights, already overseen by a Federal cabinet minister
 responsible for the status of women and by the Federal and
 Provincial human rights commissions.
 The Federal Parliament passed legislation in 1985 to allow
 native women and their families to regain Indian tribal rights
 lost under old statutes when they married non-Indians. Native
 groups across Canada continue to hold talks with the Federal
 Government to determine how Indian rights can be better
 protected under the revised Constitution.
