 FIJI
 Fiji, a multi-racial society made up of indigenous
 Melanesians (44.4 percent), immigrant Indians (50 percent),
 and small groups of European, Chinese, and other Pacific
 Islanders (5.6 percent), is justly proud of its human
 rights record. Fiji has a multi-party parliamentary
 system inherited from the British colonial period, with
 safeguards to protect the traditional communal social
 systems, including land holding rights, of the indigenous
 Fijians. Citizens' individual rights are protected by law,
 a court system which functions rapidly, a free press,
 strong democratic institutions, and a government which
 supports cultural diversity.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture, which is prohibited by law under chapter II of the
 constitution, is not practiced in Fiji.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment is illegal and
 is neither condoned nor practiced. There are no summary
 executions in Fiji; indeed the death penalty was abolished
 in 1979. Treatment of prisoners is impartial and humane,
 and there are no discriminatory practices by virtue of race.
 In addition to constitutional prohibitions, legal notice no.
 51 setting out the prisons ordinance contains specific
 regulations on treatment, visiting rights, and clothing.
 While prisons are overcrowded, legislation was recently
 passed which permits prisoners to serve their time in
 extramural situations (i.e., work for the government and live
 outside the prison environment) for the last 12 months of a
 sentence or for any sentence of 12 months or less duration.
 Legislation also allows gainful employment in addition to a
 commitment to perform public work while serving an extramural
 sentence. The prisons ordinance is detailed and includes
 restrictions for vegetarians (important to the Indian
 community) and entering prison cells at night. Public
 defenders are available, and the Fiji Red Cross has access
 to detainees.
 c.   Disappearances
 There are no disappearances nor is there any evidence of
 people being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Fiji. Habeas corpus
 exists and is honored in practice, and there is no pre-
 ventive detention. In addition to constitutional safeguards,
 legal notice no. 14 established detailed rules to be followed
 by the police during arrests. A suspect can be held without
 charge following arrest for a maximum of 4 hours.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 and counselors have free access to defendants. Consultations
 between counselors and defendants may be held in private.

 There is no harassment of defense counsel by the government.
 Defendants are made fully aware of the charges brought
 against them, and they and their lawyers can inform them-
 selves of the evidence on which charges are based. Fiji's
 courts are independent of executive or military control.
 There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses, and civilians are not tried by military
 courts. The ombudsman's office investigates complaints
 against the government.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home, and warrants
 issued by a magistrate are required for officials to enter
 a private residence.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed in chapter II, section 11-13,
 of the Fiji constitution and are observed in practice.
 Although there is only one radio station, it is under the
 administration of an independent broadcasting commission
 and provides balanced coverage of the news in three languages.
 The press is free and private, and there is no censorship
 or control of the press by the government. However, Fiji
 inherited from the colonial administration an ordinance
 (dated 1949) which allows the government to order a
 correction in the press if the government believes its
 position has been misrepresented. This ordinance, though
 very seldom used, is resented by the press, as it requires
 giving the government's statement equal space and equal
 placement. There is no interference with academic inquiry.
 All religions are tolerated and allowed to practice their
 rites freely. There are no impediments to assembly or to
 freedom of association, although an ordinance requires
 obtaining a permit one week in advance of any picketing or
 public demonstration. Fiji has an active trade union movement,
 recognized by the government, with rights to organize, strike,
 bargain collectively and lobby. Unions must give a 28-day
 notice of intention before going out on strike in the public
 sector.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 All Fiji citizens, men and women, are free to travel within
 the country and abroad. There are no restrictions on
 repatriation. Passport fees are not excessive. There are
 no refugees in Fiji.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommodate the
 special interests of the ethnic Fijians and of the
 irmigrant Indian community. Election to the house is on
 the basis of communal and national rolls. House elections
 are free and democratic, and a multitude of parties contest
 the seats. During Fiji's most recent national elections
 (September 1977) 81.1 percent of the voting age population
 participated. Members of the Senate are appointed by the
 Fiji Council of Chiefs, the prime minister, and the leader
 of the opposition. Chapter II of the constitution states
 that "every person in Fiji is entitled to the fundamental
 rights and freedoms of the individual whatever his race,
 place of origin, political opinions, color, creed or sex..."
 There is no law that specifically prohibits discrimination
 by sex. Women are, nevertheless, active in all aspects
 
 
 589
 of social, economic, and political life. Professional
 women (doctors, parliamentarians, lawyers) are in the
 minority but are influential. Women in the rural areas play
 a traditional role, and tribal inheritance is usually based
 on a patriarchal system. Women can and do, however, inherit
 chiefly status (Fiji's third highest ranking chief is a
 woman). Among the Indian community, marriages are still often
 arranged, but there is growing awareness among the women,
 both Fijian and Indo-Fijian, of their rights and opportunities
 to participate more actively in social and professional
 endeavors outside the home.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no such allegations against the Fiji Government
 or any requests for investigations.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Fiji's economy is divided between a subsistence agricultural
 and cash-based economy, the former characteristic of the
 outlying islands and the latter typical of the group's
 two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Although the
 per capita GNP of Fiji is relatively high for a developing
 nation at $1,680, the country's wealth is not evenly
 distributed between the urban and rural sectors, a
 situation Fiji's most recent development plan attempts
 to remedy. Fiji seeks to distribute economic opportunities
 through regional planning and economic incentives. Private
 enterprise is encouraged, as is foreign investment, and the
 government has recently created an economic development board
 designed to assist private investors develop their projects.
 a.    Health and Nutrition
 Health care has been expanded to cover as many of the
 outlying islands as possible, with an emphasis on preventive
 medicine. Reflecting this expansion of medical services,
 life expectancy at birth has risen seven years in the past
 two decades to 71.7 years. The infant mortality rate in
 1978-79 was 11 per thousand live births. Population growth
 has declined from 3.1 percent in 1960 to 1.9 percent for
 the period of 1976-79. In the last decade, the percentage
 of the total population with access to safe water rose
 dramatically from 37 to 69 percent, and in rural areas
 the percentage of persons with access to safe water more
 than quadrupled, rising from 15 to 62 percent. Fiji's rich
 soil and tropical climate combine to give its people a
 relatively adequate diet.
 b.   Education
 Fiji is a literate nation. More than three-quarters of its
 population can read and write, and almost every Fijian
 citizen is to some degree bilingual in English and either
 Fijian or Hindustani. The government is seeking to provide
 free primary education and virtually all children of this
 age group are enrolled in school, as are 90 percent of
 secondary school-age children. World Bank statistics on
 education in Fiji reveal no discrimination between sexes
 with regard to access to education.
 
 
 590
 c.   Income and Poverty
 Fiji's per capita GNP has risen 400 percent since 1960. As
 is frequently the case, however, the distribution of the
 nation's wealth is uneven and skewed in favor of urban
 centers. To remedy this, Fiji's most recent development
 plan (DP-8) calls for increased attention to rural develop-
 ment problems and the commitment of resources to improve
 housing, nutrition, health services and education in the
 rural areas. Furthermore, government support for opening
 new areas of agricultural development, especially cane
 farming and pine growing projects, have provided economic
 incentives to the rural population.
