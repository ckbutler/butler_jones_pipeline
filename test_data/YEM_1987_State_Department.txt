 PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN*
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) is a one-party
 state governed by the avowedly Marxist Yemen Socialist Party
 (YSP). President Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas came to power in
 January 1986 following the violent overthrow of President Ali
 Nasir Muhmammad al-Hasani, who is now in exile in the Yemen
 Arab Republic (YAR). PDRY politics continue to be
 characterized by regional and tribal-based factions competing
 for power and influence within the framework of the YSP.
 Occasional clashes between rival factions occur, but thus far
 the regime has maintained a facade of unity.
 The efforts of the YSP to establish a Marxist-Leninist state
 along Soviet administrative lines have overwhelmed many
 traditional social and cultural values. Tribal leaders,
 viewed as rivals by the Government, have been murdered in the
 past, and many human rights, such as the freedoms of speech,
 association, and the press, have been suppressed. As a result
 of the endemic upheavals in the country and the persecution of
 "tradigional" classes, an estimated 25 percent of the
 population has fled the PDRY, most to the YAR, since the
 country gained independence from Great Britain in 1967.
 Approximately 40 percent of the 2.2 million inhabitants work
 as farmets; their crops account for about 12 percent of the
 gross national product. The economy remains hampered by
 shortages of basic foodstuffs and commodities. The
 Government, although recognizing in principle the advantages
 of market-based prices, continues to regulate most sectors of
 the economy and makes it difficult for even PDRY citizens to
 import capital.
 The post-Ali Nasir regime, although beset by internal
 rivalries, is apparently united in purging the Government and
 YSP of Ali Nasir supporters. At the June General Conference
 of the YSP, the first since the coup, Ali Nasir supporters,
 mostly in exile, were formally expelled from their positions
 and the party. Throughout 1987, the Government conducted
 televised show trials of approximately 100 Ali Nasir
 supporters, most of them in absentia. The Government did not
 announce any official political executions in 1987, but there
 were several reports of political killings and disappearances.
 Although reliable information is difficult to obtain, the human
 rights situation appears to have improved since 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 .Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Two former officials of the Baath Party, a pan-Arab Socialist
 party, including one listed by Amnesty International as a
 detainee, were reportedly executed. An unconfirmed report was
 *The United States maintains no diplomatic mission in the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, which severed diplomatic
 relations with the United States in 1969. It is difficult,
 therefore, to comment authoritatively on conditions in that
 country.

 also received that the announced death in August of a leader
 of the National Democratic Front (NDF) was in fact an
 assass inaj ion.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1987 eiile'groups did not publish new lists of persons who
 had disappeared.''However, there were several unconfirmed
 reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman,.or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There continued to be reports of-torture by PDRY security
 servicbs, although the frequency, in the case of detainees,
 was somewhat 'lower than in 1986. Amnesty International
 reportedtbat, dccording to the testimony it'had gathpred from
 victims .and eyewitnesses, torture was used systematically, at
 least during the first months of 1986, in numerous detention
 centers i. the. PDRY.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Incommunicado detention and arbitrary arrests are common.
 More than 36,boq followers of former President-Ali Nasir have
 fled to the YAR, and 2 close mermbers of his family are still
 under the protection of the Ethiopian Embassy in Aden.
 There Are no reports of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Many persons are believed to haye been imprisoned without
 trial. Legal procedures for the protection of the accused are
 routinely.ignoxed.
 The PDRY Government decided-to try in absentia Ali Nasir and
 his top followers for their responsibility for-the January
 1986 coup. There were show trials throughout 1987 at which
 Ali Nasir supporters, who did not escape, were forced to admit
 their "errors." According to press reports, in December the
 Peoplg;s.Court in Aden handed down the following sentences:
 35 persons sentenced to death (16 present in PDRY and 19 in
 absentia, including Ali Nasir Muhammed); 84 persons received
 prison sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years (65 present in
 PDRY, 19 in absentia); and 18 persons were pardoned, acquitted,
 or had charges dismissed (12 present in PDRY, 5 in absentia,
 and 1 deceased from natural causes). In the cases of the 35
 persons sentenced to death, the Supreme People's Council at
 year end ratified 11 of the sentences, and 24 were commuted
 from death to 15 years' imprisonment. The.ll whose death
 sentences were ratified included Ali Nasir Muhammed and 5
 others, all in absentia, and 5 who are in prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 National security is frequently cited as the justification for
 the pervasive invasion of personal privacy. PDRY security
 services routinely inspect mail, tap telephones, and
 arbitrarily search residences and businesses.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press. The state-owned and
 operated media faithfully reflect government views and
 priorities. Copies of the June edition of al-Hikmah, the
 Journal of the Federation of (North and South) Yemeni Writers
 and Intellectuals, were confiscated in Aden after it had
 sharply criticized the failure to implement promises of
 democracy and human rights and the abandonment of logical
 economic policy for the sake of protecting the political
 status quo.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties, other than the YSP, are banned, and no
 public or professional associations, except those sponsored by
 the State or the party, are permitted to operate openly.
 Unauthorized gatherings are forbidden.
 There are no independent trade or labor organizations. The
 General Federation of Trade Unions is under close YSP control
 and collective bargaining is forbidden. The State represents
 the rights of employees. There is no nongovernmental body for
 addressing labor grievances.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that Islam is the state religion and
 provides for the freedom of religious expression in general.
 In practice, however, the Government attempts to minimize the
 influence of religious leaders, and sermons for Friday prayer
 are reportedly provided by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
 Muslim leaders, when traveling abroad in 1987, have carefully
 echoed the Government's line on foreign policy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 More than 30,000 South Yemenis fled the country after the
 January 1986 coup. Although mediation efforts with the'
 Government and senior followers of Ali Nasir to permit the
 exiles' organized return have collapsed, some are believed to
 have drifted home on their own. Yet, other South Yemenis
 continue to make their way to the YAR, often for economic as
 well as political reasons. There are some restricted areas in
 the PDRY, but the presence of checkpoints on major roads and
 near the capital is said to be much less prevalent than in
 1986. Passports are given only to persons authorized to
 travel. Permission to emigrate and travel without leaving
 substantial belongings behind is very difficult to obtain.
 There is a general amnesty in effect for those who fled the
 PDRY, except for those who have been charged with complicity
 in the coup; the amnesty was reportedly extended to December
 1987. Because previous amnesties have not always been honored
 by the Government, many exiles are very reluctant to return
 home. In stark contrast to the practice in effect until the
 summer of 1987, it is now possible for YAR citizens, by
 presenting their national identity card, to cross the YAR-PDRY
 border.

 PEOPLE'S DEM4OCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen has no formal
 democratic institutions. Consequently, most of its citizens
 do not have.a say in the choice of leaders or in changing the
 political system. The YSP dominates politics in the PDRY.
 Other oiganizations, such as the military and the National
 Democratic Front (NDF), also play prominent roles but
 generally, do so within party councils. The NDF consists
 largely.pf northern Yemeni leftists who waged a guerrilla
 insurgency against the YAR until 1982; now it is one of
 several principal factions competing for influence.
 Allegiances are often based on tribal or regional affiliations;
 natives of Aden are now largely unrepresented in the senior
 ranks of the party.
 The Conititution provides for universal suffrage for those
 over the age of 18,'but only candidates approved by the YSP
 may partake in elections. Overall, politics in PDRY have been
 characterized by violence and coercion. Leading members of
 the losing faction can usually expect imprisonment, exile, or
 death.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although Amnesty International and other human rights groups
 attempt, to monitor the situation in PDRY, they are not
 permitted to enter the country to pursue individual cases.
 Some exile groups issued lists in 1986 of alleged detainees.
 A delegation representing Amnesty International attended
 several sessions of the 1987 show trials with a delegation
 from "the Arab Lawyers Federation."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Equality of the sexes is assured by law, and women frequently
 hold government and service jobs, although not at senior
 levels. Polygamy, child marriages, and arranged marriages
 are, in principle, forbidden. However, some of these legally
 proscribed traditional social customs are observed in the more
 rural, tradition-minded areas of the country.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Working conditions in recent years have deteriorated along
 with t,4e economy. Child labor is common but is more prevalent
 in rural areas than in the cities, where children must compete
 with adults for scarce jobs. Child labor in rural areas is
 often in the context of traditional parent-child job training.
 Information is not available on prevailing wages or conditions
 of work.
