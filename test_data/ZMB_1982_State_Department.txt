 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one party state with a strong President, advised
 by a central committee of party leaders and governing through
 a cabinet and parliament, the National Assembly. Human rights
 are constitutionally guaranteed in Zambia, although the
 President possesses sweeping powers--conferred on him by
 emergency legislation in 1964 and by his presidency of the
 party--to suspend them in the "interest of state security."
 In accordance with the Constitution, the National Assembly
 also reserves the right to suspend basic constitutional
 guarantees. It is generally recognized that the gap between
 rights accorded under the Constitution and those actually
 enjoyed by Zambians today remains to be narrowed. Since
 National Assembly members of parliament must all belong to
 Zambia's single party, party views have a decisive effect.
 During the long Rhodesian conflict, which severely strained
 Zambia's political and economic system, extraordinary powers
 generaly were used with restraint. An alleged coup plot in
 1980 and serious labor unrest in 1981, however, led to
 a number of presidential detentions. These cases have been
 processed in accordance with Zambian law. The courts have
 released several of the detainees, while others are still on
 trial. Internal security remains a sensitive issue to the
 Government of Zambia, but no more prominent civic or military
 figures have been detained in over a year.
 Zambian institutions such as the judiciary, press, and labor
 movement have come under increased pressure from central
 authorities in recent years but have so far maintained their
 status and influence. Zambia continues to serve as a
 country of first refuge for refugees in the region (from
 Angola, Namibia, South Africa, and Zaire), even though the
 end of the Rhodesian conflict removed its heavy burden of
 Zimbabwean refugees. Zambia's economy remains greatly
 depressed due to a combination of factors including the
 continuing world economic crisis and internal difficulties,
 severely limiting the resources available to improve
 citizens' standard of living.
 It is unlikely that current trends in Zambian human rights
 will be altered so long as the nation and its leader are
 preoccupied with present economic difficulties.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The ebb and flow of conflict in the region, leading to
 availability of weapons and people to use them, has combined
 with the forces of poverty and unemployment to heighten the
 level of crime, including murder, in Zambia. While civil
 authority appears unable to stem the crime wave, there have
 been no officially sanctioned killings, nor is there evidence
 of any official involvement in the increasing level of murder
 which Zambia has experienced this year. Political murders
 are not known to occur although competition among members of
 the many African "liberation groups" seeking refuge in Zambia
 doubtless is a factor in some violent encounters.
 
 
 361
 b. Disappearance
 Permanent disappearances among Zambians are virtually an
 unknown phenomenon. In instances of alleged disappearances,
 the individual h~s reappeared or been accounted for within a
 few days. Given the proximity of parts of Zambia to zones of
 conflict in Angola, Namibia, and Mozambique, partisan groups
 operate in those border areas with little effective Zambian
 control. There have been reports of politically motivated
 disappearances within Zambia of non-Zambian activists in
 Namibian or South African causes, but these have related to
 SWAPO and ANC internal politics.
 c. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited under the Constitution.
 Nonetheless, military personnel and police officers commonly
 resort to unnecessary brutality when arresting or interrogat-
 ing people, especially in major criminal cases and those held
 to involve national security. Alleged victims of such mistreat-
 ment, however, have not been inhibited from registering their
 complaints through the courts. The courts have consistently
 rejected statements obtained from arrested persons under
 duress. The supreme court, in particular, has criticized
 arresting authorities in this matter. There is no record,
 howiever, that those responsible are identified and punished.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 common. However, charges of maltreatment are occasionally
 made--most recently during the treason trial of the alleged
 1980 coup plotters. Those allegations were made in an open
 court room with full press coverage. The high court has
 awarded damages to one detainee who was able to prove
 degrading treatment at the time of his detention in 1981.
 It is not known if the officials responsible were disciplined.
 Zambian prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, and unsanitary,
 but there is no institutional differentiation in treatment of
 different categories of prisoners, for example, civil versus
 political. Medical facilities are limited- while rehabilitative
 facilities are virtually nonexistent. Prison system officials
 have stated openly that, given their continuing acute shortage
 of funds, it is difficult to meet inmates' basic needs. The
 need for upgrading Zambia's prisons remains an issue of public
 debate.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the state of emergency which has been in effect since
 independence in 1964, the President has wide discretion to
 detain or restrict the movements of individuals, a power which
 probably is exercised less than 50 times each year. A legacy
 of the previous colonial administration, detention procedures
 have been revised to conform with the provisions of the
 Constitution. Those revisions have increased, rather than
 diluted, the President's detention authority.
 The President can prolong the incarceration of a detainee
 indefinitely, and he is not legally bound to accept a court's
 acquittal if he still suspects that the detainee is guilty.
 These powers are not always used. In August 1982, the high
 court acquitted four of the treason trial defendants for
 
 
 362
 insufficient evidence, and the executive branch did nothing
 to hinder their release. By law, presidential detainees are
 entitled to: formal receipt of the reason for their detention;
 publication of their detention in the government gazette;
 access to counsel; frequent visitation by family and col-
 leagues; immediate representation to the detaining authority;
 and the right to seek judicial review of the detention order
 after one year by an independent and impartial tribunal.
 Presidential detainees must have their cases heard by the high
 court and have the right of appeal to the supreme court.
 There are currently no presidential detainees known to be held
 in Zambia.
 Habeas corpus is available to persons detained under presi-
 dential order, but the Government is not obliged to accept the
 recommendation of the review tribunal.   One treason trial
 detainee who successfully obtained a writ of habeas corpus in
 November 1980 was redetained as soon as he left the judge's
 chambers. On the other hand, all four labor leaders who were
 detained in July 1981 were released without delay in October
 and November 1981 after winning writs of habeas corpus from
 the high court.
 Law officers and defense personnel have extraordinary powers
 under emergency legislation. Police officers of assistant
 inspector rank or above may arrest without a warrant and
 detain an individual for up to 28 days if the officer has
 reason to believe grounds exist to justify a presidential
 detention order. However, the police must supply the detainee
 with the reason for his detention within 14 days, or the
 detention is void. This procedure is rigorously adhered to.
 Security officers also have broad powers of search.
 The President's detention powers and other emergency powers
 have in the past been used against political opponents,
 Zimbabwean nationalists, dissident Namibians, Zairean rebels,
 striking university students and professors, violators
 of currency control regulations, foreign correspondents,
 alleged coup plotters, their accomplices, and labor leaders.
 In most cases detainees have been either released or formally
 charged once investigation of their cases has been completed.
 The process is slow (several months at a minimum), but for
 the most part it is reliable in assuring that the detainees'
 procedural rights are observed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian Government guarantees the right to a fair public
 trial. Presidential detainees are not automatically covered
 by this guarantee although the large majority have in fact
 been tried in public. The safeguards of English common law
 are provided in court cases. Zambian courts have resisted
 pressures of executive influence. Independent observation of
 sensitive political cases confirms the independence of the
 Zambian judiciary. However, the arrest of one of Zambia's
 most prominent lawyers in connection with the alleged 1980
 coup plot, the deportation of a foreign lawyer representing
 one of those so detained, the transfer of a senior magistrate
 involved in the treason trial, the transfer of Zambia high
 court judges, and the non-renewal of an expatriate high
 court judge's work permit after granting writs of habeas
 corpus to detained labor leaders, have raised questions
 about the continued independence of the judiciary.
 
 
 363
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected except in
 isolated incidents related to the national emergency and in
 some cases involving the deportation of illegal aliens.
 Security forces must normally have search warrants when
 investigating homes. Such warrants may be issued, however, by
 magistrates or police officers above the rank of sub-inspector,
 leading to interpretations of probable cause at some variance
 with those with which Americans are familiar. Other violations
 of the home generally do not occur.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The press regularly reports criticism of governmental policies
 expressed in the National Assembly and by the general public.
 The two national dailies are owned by the government and party
 respectively, but some criticism of government and party
 performance is permitted. Both papers have been sharply
 critical of government economic policies, and cases of corrup-
 tion have been freely reported.
 Direct criticism of the head of state and the national philoso-
 phy, "Humanism," however, is prohibited. The penal code
 states that any person intending to bring the President into
 "hatred, ridicule or contempt" is liable, on conviction, to
 imprisonment for three years or less. Few journalists have
 transgressed this prohibition; there have been only two or
 three minor convictions since independence.
 Censorship of foreign publications exists but is not stringent.
 News reports from Western wire services are often rewritten
 by management before publication to reflect the newspapers'
 editorial perspectives on specific issues.
 The law association of Zambia is currently preparing a handbook
 of key human rights legislation and pertinent legal cases in
 Zambia. When published, the handbook will serve as a basic
 reference guide for all those interested in human rights,
 including judges, lawyers, government officials, academics,
 and members of the public. Similarly, the law faculty of
 the University of Zambia has published widely on human rights
 issues affecting Zambia,
 Academic freedom is a principle which enjoys considerable re-
 spect in Zambian society. Recent government efforts to require
 the teaching of "scientific socialism" led to wide debate and
 such opposition from educators and clergy that the ideahas
 been shelved. The University of Zambia was closed for a
 significant part of the academic year in 1982 due not to
 debate over academic freedom but to student protests over
 school administration and discipline.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As with freedom of expression, the right of peaceful assembly
 can be circumscribed by the constitutional ban on all political
 activity outside the one-party structure. Nonetheless, sub-
 stantial freedom has been permitted in practice.
 
 
 364
 All of Zambia's 18 labor unions are organized into the Zambia
 Congress of Trade Unions. Member unions are strong defenders
 of worker interests and enjoy the right of collective
 bargaining. Under existing legislation, strikes are permitted
 only for specific reasons and only after all other methods
 of resolving labor-management disputes have been exhausted.
 Virtually all of Zambia's strikes have been illegal, because
 they have been started before the process of mediation has
 run its course. Nevertheless, the Government has traditionally
 relied on persuasion and continued mediation to end strikes
 once begun. Although the the Trade Union Congress nominally
 operates under general supervision from Zambia's single party;
 it operates independently of party control or influence. Union
 spokesmen frequently question and challenge government policy.
 Internally, the Trade Union Congress is a democratic trade union
 and regularly conducts open elections to select its leadership.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and has been
 supported by President Kaunda with the exceptions noted below.
 Christian missionaries have been quite active in recent years,
 although energetic or mass proselytizing (especially where
 open-air meetings are concerned) are cleared in advance
 by the Ministry of Home Affairs, a clearance usually granted.
 The Watchtower sect (Jehovah's Witnesses) are specifically
 prohibited by presidential order from proselytizing, but the
 Zambian supreme court has upheld their right to forswear poli-
 tical customs, such as singing the national anthem and salu-
 ting the flag. When local party militants harassed certain
 Watchtower groups during a countrywide voter registration
 drive in October and November 1982, senior party leaders
 stepped in to reaffirm the sect's freedom not to participate
 in such secular activities. Zambia has no specific state
 religion, and there is considerable harmony among the many
 sects represented in the country. Many of Zambia's large
 south Asian populations are Muslim and Hindu and have their
 own mosques, temples, and lay associations throughout the
 country. President Kaunda has encouraged community action
 on the part of religious groups in Zambia and has welcomed
 specialized religious organizations, such as youth groups,
 independent of party control or influence. Zambia's record
 of protecting freedom of religion came under scrutiny in
 1982, however, when the Ministry of Education and party
 headquarters imposed the teaching of."scientific socialism"
 in Zambian schools--parochial as well as public. In the
 face of vigorous opposition from religious groups, the Govern-
 ment appears to have dropped the issue for the moment, but
 concern remains among church leaders that the program will be
 revived in the future.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President may, under emergency powers, restrict the
 movement of individuals within Zambia. Foreign diplomats may
 not travel outside a 40 kilometer radius of Lusaka without
 written permission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This
 restriction is enforced. The Government also reserves the
 right to refuse or withdraw passports to prevent foreign
 travel by individuals whose activities abroad are considered
 inimical to Zambian interests. The Government denied foreign
 travel to several individuals, including a prominent labor
 leader, in 1981 but allowed some of those same individuals to
 travel in 1982.
 
 
 365
 Recently, an American citizen agricultural adviser affiliated
 with the Mineworkers Union of Zambia was expelled from Zambia
 without specification by the Government of any illegal activity.
 Freedom to emigrate is permitted by the Government, but strict
 currency regulations make even holiday travel difficult.
 Zambian citizenship may be revoked under conditions stipulated
 in sections of the Zambian Constitution governing the acquisi-
 tion, loss, and revocation of citizenship. The Citizenship
 Board is generally charged with application of the laws of
 the Republic of Zambia detailing conditions of citizenship and
 its loss, although the President has authority to grant citizen-
 ship on an extraordinary basis and to revoke citizenship
 granted under presidential powers.
 Located in the center of strife-ridden southern Africa,
 Zambia presently provides a haven for over 50,000 refugees
 (37,000 Angolans; 600. Zairians; 5000 Namibians; 2000 South
 Africans; and 300 from other countries). Approximately
 31,000 refugees are considered "spontaneously resettled"
 as subsistence farmers in Zambia's northwestern and western
 provinces. The balance of the refugees are in refugee camps
 supervised either by the Government of Zambia - (12,000
 refugees), SWAPO - (4,500 refugees), or the African National
 Congress (South Africa) - (2000 refugees).
 In addition, 800 urban refugees report to the Lusaka branch
 office of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
 With the exception of the 800 refugees under UNHCR supervision,
 refugees in Zambia maintain a lifestyle comparable to that
 of Zambians residing in the same locality. The 800 UNHCR-
 supervised refugees, however, are discriminated against in
 that they are denied work permits needed to seek employment.
 Also, educational opportunities for their children are
 restricted.
 In 1982 Zambia's reputation as a safehaven for refugees was
 damaged when, in March, several hundred Angolans, who were
 primarily bona fide refugees, were rounded up in the Mongu
 area of western province and imprisoned. Following several
 weeks of detention the Angolans were given the option of
 returning to Angola or resettlement in a refugee camp.
 Although most elected resettlement in a Zambian refugee
 camp, all were repatriated to Angola. Similar such roundups
 have since taken place and, despite UNHCR's best efforts,
 other genuine refugees have undoubtedly been involuntarily
 repatriated.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Zambia is a-one-party state with a strong President, advised
 by a central committee of party leaders and governing through
 a cabinet and parliament, the National Assembly.
 Under the 1973 Constitution, the United National Independence
 Party became the only legal party in Zambia. About 10 percent
 of the population are party members. Candidates for political
 office at any level must be members of the party. They are
 subject to close examination for suitability by party authori-
 ties.   There is considerable competition, often involving
 multiple candidacy, during the party selection process for
 parliamentary and lower level party positions. Expression
 of divergent political viewpoints generally decreases as
 candidates aspire to higher national posts. Within this
 one-party framework the elections are by universal suffrage,
 
 
 366
 but the numbering of ballots (which can be cross-checked
 against voters' names) undermines secrecy of the ballot. In
 practice the Zambian political system is open to individuals
 of differing opinions provided they are willing to operate
 within the one-party structure and not challenge President
 Kaunda's preeminent position.
 Zambia has recently (October - November 1982) completed a
 massive countrywide voter registration drive in anticipation
 of the 1983 presidential and parliamentary elections. In
 their zeal, many "party militants" harassed citizens who
 had not registered, although the party officially disassoci-
 ated itself from their actions.
 In 1978, the party amended its constitution to limit candidates
 to those with five years continuous party membership. The
 change was appealed by a prominent politician who had planned
 to run against President Kaunda that year, but it was upheld
 by the courts. As expected, President Kaunda was renominated
 by the party (only party members may run) and stood as the sole
 candidate in the December 1978 Presidential elections. He
 is expected to be the sole Presidential candidate in 1983.
 The five-year rule of continuous party membership applies
 as well to 17 labor leaders who were suspended from the party
 during strikes in January 1981. Although the party has
 expressed its willingness to welcome them back into its ranks,
 it insists that they first purchase new membership cards. By
 so doing, they would tacitly admit that their heretofore
 continuous membership had lapsed. The Secretary General of
 the Trade Union Congress, elected to parliament in 1978, was
 denied his seat in the National Assembly in 1981 on this
 technicality.
 Women participate freely in Zambia's social, economic, and
 political life. They hold some senior positions in the
 party and the Government and are represented in the professions
 and at the national university. At the same time, the great
 majority of Zambian women still occupy traditional roles in
 a society where rapid urbanization has served to undermine
 the importance of such roles. Female participation in the
 wage labor force lags far behind that of males. Half of
 all the women engaged in formal sector employment occupy the
 least remunerative jobs.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men. Customary law and practices still compete on a de
 facto basis in some remote rural areas with Zambia's
 Constitution and codified laws. In some areas customary
 practices, in contrast to statutory law, place women in
 subordinate or unequal status to men in matters involving
 marriage and property. The Zambian Government is supporting
 legislation which will offer equal protection and rights to
 women in matters of inheritance. Currently the laws govern-
 ing inheritance give weight to customary (in some cases,
 discriminatory) practices.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 In its 1982 report reviewing events in 1981, Amnesty Inter-
 national expressed its concern about detention without trial
 
 
 367
 and mistreatment of prisoners. The Zambian Government
 generally does not encourage or hinder such investigations.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Zambian Government has stated that it is firmly committed
 to meeting the basic needs of its population. Zambia is among
 the leading African countries in its expenditures on education.
 At present, the country is suffering from a sluggish economy
 marked by high inflation, serious unemployment, and scarce
 financial resources. Application of various economic remedies
 along socialist or centrally managed lines has not lived up
 to expectations as Zambia faces the depressed world situation.
 There has been a significant decline in Gross Domestic Product
 for the past several years. Real per capita income has fallen
 sharply below its level at independence 18 years ago and even
 nominal income has dropped from 1980. The expansion of social
 welfare programs has, therefore, had to be subordinated to
 overall economic needs.
 President Kaunda advocates the need to diversify the national
 economy, with particular emphasis on developing Zambia's
 significant agricultural potential. The average income for
 rural inhabitants is estimated to be substantially less than
 one-third the average earnings of urban dwellers. This
 imbalance has generated heavy rural-to-urban migration (over
 40 percent of the population is urban), exacerbating already
 high unemployment in urban areas. Scarce foreign exchange,
 limited managerial skills, faulty planning, and weak Government
 and party institutions continue to detract from the Government's
 ability to meeb the economic needs of its people. Nationwide,
 unemployment is probably over a third of the potential work
 foFce.
 In addition, the gap between the rural and urban areas in
 terms of income, education, housing, nutrition, and the
 availability of public services is vast and continues to
 increase in favor of the urban dweller. Eighty-six percent of
 the urban population has access to safe water, for instance,
 as opposed to 16 percent of the rural dwellers. Within
 the urban community itself there are also significant inequa-
 lities. The top 10 percent claim over 40 percent of the total
 income, the bottom 60 percent receive a mere 26 percent.
 Women are accorded an increasingly active role in the develop-
 ment process. Recent primary school enrollment figures show
 that 89 females are enrolled for every 106 males. Moreover,
 female students can be admitted to secondary school with lower
 passing marks than male students as part of Zambia's "affirma-
 tive action" program. However, because many women are burdened
 with heavy household duties, their opportunities for advance-
 ment lag behind those of men. Within the context of Zambia's
 traditional society, their primary role is to have children.
 Zambia's birth rate, which stood at 2.8 percent in 1970, is
 now 3.1 percent according to the 1980 census which registered
 a 40 percent increase in population from 1969. The total
 fertility rate in 1979 was 6.1 live births per woman, one of
 the highest in the world. Life expectancy at birth is 46.7
 years for males, 50 years for females. Barring a dramatic
 turnaround in Zambia's economy, its ability to sustain even
 existing social services will be seriously strained in the
 future by its rapidly expanding population.
