 INDONESIA
 Despite a surface adherence to democratic forms, the Indonesian political system
 remains strongly authoritarian. The Government is dominated by an elite compris-
 ingPresident Soeharto (now in his sixth 5-year term), his close associates, and the
 military. The Government requires allegiance to a state ideology known as
 "Pancasila," which stresses consultation and consensus, but is also used to limit dis-
 sent, to enforce social and political cohesion, and to restrict the development of oppo-
 sition elements. The judiciary is effectively subordinated to the executive and the
 military and suffers from corruption.
 The primary mission of the 450,000-member armed forces, which includes 175,000
 police, is maintenance of internal security and stability. Despite a decrease in the
 
 
 771
 number of active or retired military officers in key government positions, the mili-
 tary retained substantial nonmiltary powers under a "dual function" concept that
 accords it a political and social role in "developing the nation." The military and the
 police continued to commit numerous human rights abuses.
 The currency crisis that hit the region in the middle of the year slowed the expan-
 sion of the economy which had been vigorous and rapid in past years. The benefits
 of economic development are widely dispersed and living standards have risen sig-
 nificantly, but a large segment of the population remains poor. Pervasive corruption
 remains a problem. Sporadic unrest led to stronger demands that the Government
 act more effectively to address social and economic inequities. In rural areas, dis-
 content often focused on the grievances of small land owners-especially those
 forced off their land by powerful economic and military interests. In some regions,
 exploitation of natural resources has entailed significant environmental degradation
 with adverse social consequences.
 The Government continued to commit serious human rights abuses. Rising pres-
 sures for change from political activists and opponents met tough government reac-
 tions prior to the May general election. The Government demonstrated that it would
 not tolerate challenges to the fundamental elements of the political system by ar-
 resting and placing on trial some of its critics. The authorities maintiined their
 tight grip on the political process, and in the May parliamentary election, as in the
 previous five held since 1971, denied citizens the ability to change their government
 democratically. The structure of the political system continued to ensure victory for
 the ruling GOLKAR party, which secured its biggest win ever. The Government did
 not permit the ousted Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) leader Megawati
 Sukarnoputri and her supporters to run in the general election or to make common-
 cause with the Muslim-oriented United Development Party (PPP). The election and
 campaign were marred by credible allegations of fraud as well as by sporadic, yet
 significant, violence between parties, including the government-sponsored GOLKAR
 organization. Security forces continued extrajudicial killings, including of unarmed
 civilians, disappearances, torture and mistreatment of detainees, and arbitrary ar-
 rests and detention. In practice legal protections against torture are inadequate.
 Prison conditions remained harsh. The judiciary is pervaded by corruption, and re-
 mains subordinated to the executive branch, which uses the courts to prosecute gov-
 ernment critics and political opponents. Most courts refused to hear the lawsuits
 filed throughout Indonesia by Megawati Sukarnoputri and her su porters protesting
 her ouster as PDI leader, although a few at a preliminary levelaccepted the case
 and ruled in her favor. Security forces regularly violated citizens' right to privacy.
 The Government continued to impose serious limitations on freedom of speech and
 restrict press freedom, although at year's end government critics were speaking out
 more boldly. The Government exercises indirect control over thep ress and uses in-
 timidation to suppress hostile commentary and encourages self-censorship. Mild
 criticism of the Government was tolerated, but critics of the President, senior offi-
 cials, or powerful local interests risked harassment or arrest. Despite these prob-
 lems, the print media provided wide coverage of political issues and reports of
 human rights violations. Fourteen young activists belonging to, or associated with,
 the small, unauthorized, People's Democratic Party (PRD) were convicted of subver-
 sion based mostly on their writings, speeches, and organizational activities. Inde-
 pendent labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan faced subversion charges based mainly on
 expression of his political views but also including his labor activities. Former par-
 liamentarian Sri Bintang Pamungkas was brought to trial in December under the
 Antisubversion Law for the political views and actions of his unrecognized Indo-
 nesian Democratic Union Party (PUDI). Parliamentarian Aberson Marle Sihalolo
 was sentenced to 9 months in prison for allegedly insulting the President and mili-
 tary in remarks made at a 'free spch forum" in July 1996 at the former PDI head-
 quarters. An assistant to the author of a book banned by the Government was
 brought to trial for his role in its publication.
 The Government continued to impose serious limitations on freedom of assembly
 and association. It prevented or broke-up meetings of nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) and labor unions, as well as peaceful demonstrations, sometimes vio-
 lently. It brought to trial a Catholic priest and his brother for protecting political
 activists who in 1996 had been sought by the police. However, there were notable
 examples of well-publicized meetings, seminars, and gatherings on sensitive sub-
 jects, as well as public demonstrations, that were not stopped. Security forces gen-
 erally refrained from using force to stop the prohibited, massive street rallies that
 dominated the election campaign and in most cases did not use lethal force in re-
 spending to major riots. On occasion security forces were criticized for not acting
 in time to protect citizens and property from the large-scale destruction that oc-
 curred. The rioting resulted from a combination of economic, communal, ethnic, reli-
 
 
 gous and political factors. It began in 1996, continued into 1997, abated after the
 ay general election, and erupted again in Ujung Pandang, South Sulawesi in Sep-
 tember. Despite their reduced use of lethal force, security forces often reacted harsh-
 ly to peaceful demonstrations or in disputes with citizens.
 The Government legally provides for religious freedom for five accepted religions;
 unrecognized religions are subject to restrictions. The Government did not fully in-
 vestigate or resolve many cases of attacks on religious facilities and churches during
 riots, although it issued several public appeals for religious tolerance. The Govern-
 ment continued to restrict freedom of movement. Discrimination against women, the
 disabled, and ethnic minorities and violence against women are endemic problems.
 The Government maintained its opposition to alternatives to the Government-
 sponsored labor movement and to the development of a free trade union movement,
 but permitted a very open debate over a new basic labor law. Members of the prin-
 cipal unauthorized labor organization cited continued instances of harassment, and
 security authorities shut down the organization's planned 3-day congress in Septem-
 ber on the first day. The Government urged employers to pay on time the increased
 minimum wage and mandated benefits, and implemented a new audit system for
 worker safety and health. However, enforcement of labor standards remained weak.
 The Government and the International Labor Organization (ILO) signed a new
 memorandum of understanding on child labor to promote the protection of working
 children and to move progressively toward elimination of child labor. However, mil-
 lions of children still work, often under poor conditions, and are thus unable to at-
 tend school. Some children forced to work under conditions of bonded labor report-
 edly suffer abuse.
 There were some potentially positive developments. For example, the Independent
 Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP) carried out limited, yet significant, monitor-
 ing activities during the campaign and the parliamentary election. Although the
 Government refused to recognize the KIPP andrestricted its activities, the organiza-
 tion gathered information about election violations and presented it to the public.
 The Naional Commission on Human Rights, despite limited resources and occa-
 sional government pressure, undertook investigations and publicized its independ-
 ent fidings and recommendations, but lacked enforcement powers. The Govern-
 ment ignored or responded slowly to some Commission findings. The increase in pri-
 vate human rights -monitoring in East Timor was a positive development, and the
 Government took some actions in response to criticism of its human rights perform-
 ance; for example, a human rights and international law training seminar was con-
 ducted for the military by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 In East Timor, following massive December 1996 demonstrations in support, of
 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Bishop Belo, in which security personnel sufferedl inju-
 ries and an out-of-uniform police officer was killed, an early 1997 campsign of har-
 assment and detention by the security forces raised tension to a high level. During
 the May election period and its aftermath, East Tinor6s low-level insurgency inten-
 sified with guerrla attacks that inflicted the highest number of deaths in years on
 security personnel and civilians. These attacks were followed by the capture and
 death of a prominent guerrilla commander and widespread detentions, accompanied
 by reports of killings, disappearances, torture, and excessive use of force on the part
 of the authorities. These developments exacerbated longstanding resentments on the
 part of the indigenous population. In November at least five students were injured
 when a large number of security force personnel entered the University of East
 Timor campus firing their weapons. One political prisoner was released when he be-
 came eligible for parole. No significant progress was made in accounting for persons
 missing following the 1991 Dili incident or others who disappeared in recent years.
 Troop levels remained unjustifiably high. The Government granted limited access to
 the area to foreign journalists but banned travel by all foreign human rights NGO's
 except the ICRC. The Dill branch of the National Commission on Human Rights,
 which opened in 1996, remained ineffective, but increased efforts by the Catholic
 Church and others, along with a better understanding of international humani-
 tarian norms among senior military officers, improved the overall quality of human
 rights monitoring in East Tumor. There were no reports of military personnel who
 committed abuses in East Tumor being punished. Seeking asylum or publicity for
 their cause, young East Timorese mounted further intrusions into various embassies
 in Jakarta.
 In Irian Jays, resentment among indigenous groups against government and pri-
 vate companies' policies that they viewed as heavyhanded and arbitrary remained.
 Real anperceived discrimination against native Irianese persisted. A clash be-
 tween indigenous people and security forces occurred in the Timika-Tembagapura
 area, the location of a foreign mining company, and resulted in several deaths. The
 company began moving forward on its plan to distribute a percentage of its profits
 
 
 to indigenous groups in the area as part of a regional development effort, but sus-
 pended disbursements for new projects under this initiative in August because of
 disputes over how the funds should be allocated. The Government's closure of cer-
 tain areas of the central highlands continued during 1997, due to the military's spe-
 cial operations against an indigenous separatist group that had taken and executed
 hostages in 1996. There were reports that in the restricted areas the military had
 forced villagers to perform uncompensated labor, that huts had been burned in one
 vill.age, and that in late 1996 there were instances of beatings and other abuse. The
 military denied such reports and blamed abuse on the separatist group.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a Political and Other Ext rajudicial Killing.-Historicall, politically related
 extrajudicial killings have occurred most frequently in areas where separatist move-
 ments were active, such as East Timor, Aceh, and Irian Jaya. Security forces contin-
 ued to employ harsh measures against separatist movements in all three areas.
 There were also numerous instances of reported extrajudicial killings by security
 forces in cases involving alleged common criminal activity.
 Credible sources confirmed several deaths in detention in East Timor during the
 year. In June an individual known as "Januario" was detained in Baucau, severely
 beaten, and died while being transported to Dili. Human rights monitors believed
 that a number of other killings by security forces of civilians may have occurred,
 especially in more isolated areas, but these were impossible to confirm. There were
 also credible reports that detainees in East Timor were shot to death while allegedly
 attempting to escape.
 There were credible reprts of deaths in, or related to, detention in other parts
 of the country as well. In March Teguh Sunarto (Atok) died in East Java not long
 after his release from police detention. He and two others were detained on March
 17 by police because they were not in possession of identity cards. Two police offi-
 cers reportedly subjected all three detainees to severe mistreatment, including
 punching, kicking, and cigarette burns. In addition, the police reportedly ordered
 other prisoners to beat Sunarto and the other two detainees. The two police officers
 involved were detained. In April a farmer in central Lampung, Sukirno, died in po-
 lice custody. According to a credible report, 10 police and forestry service officers
 took him from his home on the night of April 14, accusing him of possessing a home-
 made gun and poaching from a protected forest. Two days later Sukh-no's family
 was informed that he committed suicide while in police custody. However, numerous
 wounds and bruises were reportedly found on Sukirno's body.
 Security forces shot and killed two Irianese in Timika on August 22 in an alterca-
 tion in which the Irianese reportedly pelted the security forces with arrows and
 rocks, injuring at least two. The security forces claimed that they used rubber bul-
 lets. Some sources said that the security forces acted in self defense, while others
 said that the security forces fired first. The incident was sparked by the earlier un-
 explained deaths of two Irianese on the property of a foreign mining concession near
 a military checkpoint.
 The police often employed deadly force in apprehending suspects or coping with
 alleged criminals, many of whom were unarmed. In response to protests that the
 methods used were unjustifiably harsh and amounted to execution without trial, po-
 lice generally claimed that the suspects were fleeing, resisting arrest, or threatemn g
 the police.
 Complete statistics about the number of these cases have not been released. How-
 ever, press reports, including statements of police officials, show a pattern of in-
 creased lethal shootings by the police of criminal suspects, many of whom were un-
 armed. At least seven crime suspects were reportedly shot and killed by police in
 Jakarta in January, and the number reportedly climbed to 32 by April. It was re-
 ported that 28 had been similarly shot by the police in Surabaya during the same
 time period. In May a Jakarta police spokesman announced that 63 shootings by
 police had occurred between January and April; approximately 85 percent were
 fatal, The trend of police shootings of suspected criminals continued in the following
 months, with usually reliable press reports noting about 90 such deaths in Jakarta
 during the year.
 In the past, higher authorities rarely punished the military or police for using ex-
 cessive force. There were some indications that this situation was improving, al-
 though the action taken by the authorities usually was not commensurate with the
 gravity of the abuses. A military tribunal on July 23 sentenced the former chief of
 the Bogor detective unit to 9 months in prison. The detective was involved in the
 torture of a suspect, Tjetje Tadjudin, who died in police custody in October 1996.
 
 
 774
 The court heard testimony that Tjetje had been subjected to electric shocks and
 beatings during police interrogation. The polie detective and two assistants were
 charged with mistreating Tjetje and thereby causing his death and misuse of au-
 thoity Th prsectorreqestd a17-ont setene fr tesecrimes, but the de-
 tee           n            d         1    ys              s found guilty only
 of "misuse of authority." Nobody has yet been held responsible for Tjetje's death and
 the onvicted polie detective was not removed from th~e poice force pending appeal.
 Five cases of alleged human rights violations in Irian Jaya involving the death
 of Irianese civilians, cited in a September 1995 report by the National Human
 Rights Commission, have languished, and the Commission has requested followup
 action.
 In September police announced a "temporary postponement" in the investigation
 into the 1993 murder of labor activist Marsinah. Human rights activists interpreted
 this as an effort to close the investigation, and have called for its revival.
 The militar suffered its highest number of fatal casualties in recent years in East
 Timor, most in a wave of guerrilla attacks during the May election period and its
 aftermath. Eighteen security personnel were killed in a single attack near Baucau
 in May. In addition to numerous killings of soldiers and police by the guerrillas,
 they also killed civilian East Timorese suspected of working for military intelligence
 and some other civilians. A school teacher and members of his family were killed
 by guerrillas during the pre-election period. A local government official in East
 Timor, who was also chief of the local paramilitary "gada paksi" group, and four
 other civilians were killed in April when their car was attacked near Viqueque, pre-
 sumably by guerrillas.
 The security situation in Aceh has improved since the early 1990's campaign
 against the Acehnese separatist movement. Although Aceh Merdeka was believed to
 have been largely eliminated as a viable force, Aceh is still officially listed as one
 of Indonesia's three "troubled areas" (along with East Timor and Irian Jaya). Be-
 cause the area had been relatively peaceful for several years, there was discussion
 in January of declaring Aceh secure and removing the classification of troubled area
 as a reflection of confidence in the security situation. The discussion was suspended
 after military operations netted weapons caches, allegedly belonging to Aceh
 Merdeka, in February and March, following a violent bank robbery during which
 three bank employees were shot and killed by the criminals.
 b. Disappearance.-Reliable sources in East Timor reported numerous disappear-
 ances, especially in more isolated areas.
 The Government made little progress in resolving the 1996 "July 27 incident."
 The incident involved the Government-backed violent takeover of Indonesian Demo-
 cratic Party (PDI) headquarters, which triggered serious rioting in Jakarta. The
 Government moved slowly in responding to the Human Rights Commission's Octo-
 ber 1996 report on this incident, which listed 23 missing, 149 injured, and 5 dead,
 one of whom had been shot (see Section 4). In September the authorities reportedly
 acknowledged that the case had not been closed and agreed that a search would be
 conducted for the 16 people that the Commission reported were still missing, but
 little additional progress had been made by year's end.
 There were no significant efforts by the Government to account for the missing
 and dead from the November 12, 1991 military shooting of civilians in Dili. No addi-
 tional cases were resolved during the year. Knowledgeable observers continued to
 believe that most of the missing are ead and that members of the armed forces
 know where their bodies are located.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Criminal Code makes it a crime punishable by up to 4 years in prison for any
 official to use violence or force to elicit a confession. Ini practice, however, legal pro-
 tections are both inadequate and widely ignored, and security forces continued to
 employ torture and other forms of mistreatment, particularly in regions where there
 were active security concerns, such as Irian Jaya and East Timor. Police often resort
 to physical abuse, even in minor incidents.
 In East Timor, military units regularly detain civilians for interrogation; most are
 held in extralegal military detention centers, often with no notification of relatives,
 mistreated for several days, and then released. Family members and human rights
 monitoring organizations encounter serious difficulties in identifying and visiting
 detainees held in these military facilities. Many credible sources agreed that persons
 detained by the police in East Timor were routinely beaten while in the process of
 being detained. All 32 people detained following a demonstration at the Makhota
 Hotel in Dil in March suffered beatings at the hands of the police, according to
 credible sources.
 Four residents of Lavateri village near Baucau, East Timor detained on April 4
 by an intelligence team, were reportedly beaten with rifle butts, with one individual
 
 
 suffering a broken rib and another having a cross carved into the palm of her hand.
 Six East Timorese detained by the Joint Intelligence Unit (SGI) in Liquica on Feb-
 ruary 26 were reportedly tortured with electric shocks and immersion in ice water.
 Five East Timorese civilians detained by security forces near Liquica on April 30
 were reportedly beaten with rifle butts and suffered electric shocks.
 During the military operation and search for the criminals that followed, at least
 two suspects, alleged by the military to be from Ach Merdeka, were shot to death
 by the military during raids. A military source claimed that the victims were armed.
 During a roundup of suspected Aceh Merdeka separatists, an unknown number of
 suspects were arrested during February and March. There are credible reports that
 a small number of Aceh Merdeka members remain in Aceh, and maintain some
 sympathy amon~g the local population, but they are not seen as posing an active se-
 curity threat. There are allegations of criminal and abusive behavior by military
 personnel in regions of Aceh that were formerly areas where Aceh Merdeka separat-
 ists operated.
 There were instances where security forces responded with brutality to peaceful
 demonstrations or disputes with citizens, although they generally refrained from
 using force to stop the prohibited, massive street rallies that dominated the election
 campaign. On April 2, security forces violently broke up a peaceful demonstration
 by approximately 200 supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri in Denpasar, Bali. The
 security forces used rattan canes, and dozens among the group suffered minor inju-
 ries. In Yogyakarta, security forces reportedly beat some student marchers com-
 memorating Human Rights Day and broke up their march. In southeast Sulawesi,
 police reportedly showed restraint in responding to student riots provoked by a po-
 ice assault on students during a raid on a dormitory.
 On April 28, uniformed and plainclothes security forces beat with rattan canes
 and kicked a small group of peaceful demonstrators outside the central Jakarta Dis-
 trict Court following the sentencing of People's Democratic Party (PRD) activists, in-
 juring two demonstrators. On June 23, security forces armed with bayonets and
 clubs entered the Indonesian Christian University (UKD campus in Jakarta and at-
 tacked a group of students. At least five of the students were injured and three were
 hospitalized with serious head wounds. The security forces were retaliating after a
 soldier was injured in an altercation with students. On September 1, according to
 reliable reports, 27 students and local residents in Banda Aceh were injured, some
 seriously, when three truckloads of police officers attacked a group of students after
 a soccer match during which a dispute between a police officer and a student over
 a poster had arisen. Police allegedly beat students and bystanders on the soccer
 field and chased those who ran away into homes and beat them.
 The Government's handling of the wave of major riots that hit Indonesia received
 a mixed response. Security forces did not, in most cases, use lethal force in respond-
 ing to these riots and showed relative restraint. In many cases, there was public
 criticism that security forces did not act in sufficient time or with sufficient force
 to protect citizens and property from the large-scale destruction that occurred. The
 rioting resulted from a combination of economic, communal, ethnic, religious, and
 political factors. It began in 1996, continued into 1997, abated after the May general
 election, and erupted again in Ujung Pandang, South Sulawesi in September.
 On January 30, security forces restored order in Rengasdengklok, West Java with-
 out resort to live ammunition fire or brutal treatment of civilians, though not before
 mobs had attacked shops and religious institutions. The most deadly riot occurred
 in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan on May 23 on the last day of the election cam-
 paign. At least 123 people died in a fire caused by the riot and ensuing looting of
 a department store. The National Commission on Human Rights investigated, and
 concluded that there was no evidence of the use of live ammunition to subdue the
 rioters. The Commission also found that some of the suspected rioters were beaten
 after their arrest, and recommended measures to ensure that future riot control not
 be excessively violent.
 In November following an apparent altercation between youths and intelligence
 personnel near the University of East Timor, large numbers of security force person-
 nel entered the university campus, discharging their weapons and beating students.
 At least five students were injured and university facilities were severely damaged.
 Authorities said that security forces had used only rubber bullets but several of the
 injured students were reportedly shot, and two suffered bayonet wounds, according
 to independent human rights organizations. One injured student was removed from
 an ICRC vehicle, beaten with rifle butts by police, and then taken to a military hos-
 pital. The ICRC was permitted to visit the wounded students. A number of students
 were also reportedly detained following the incident.
 
 
 776
 There were reports that the security forces beat and abused villagers in the
 central highlands of Irian Jaya; the military denied committing such abuses (see
 Section 2.d.).
 The Government continued to maintain an unjustifiably high military presence in
 East Timor, totaling more than 16,000 personnel. The Government, as it does else-
 where, also relied on bands of youths, organized and directed by the military, to in-
 timidate and harass its opponents. Such a civilian paramilitary group, known as the
 gada paksi, was frequently involved in nighttime raids in Dih neighborhoods in the
 early part of the year and was widely blamed for provoking serious disturbances in
 Viqueque in February. Gada paksi activity abated in the latter half of the year.
 One case of alleged rape of East Timorese women by military personnel gained
 public attention as human rights lawyers tried to bring the case to trial. Legal ac-
 tion also is being pursued in the case of an East Timorese woman allegedly the vic-
 tim of repeated rapes by military personnel in November 1996 while in military cus-
 tody. The woman reported the rapes to human rights monitors and wrote a letter
 to the local military command unit, which forwardfed it to the National Commission
 on Human Rights. At year's end, it was not clear whether lawyers would succeed
 in getting the case tried in either military or civil court.
 Human rights organizations report that rape by military personnel is a serious
 problem, andthat soldiers are rarely held accountable for these crimes.
 The four police officers who mistreated religious teachers in Tasikmalaya, West
 Java, in a 1996 event which sparked a major riot there, were found guilty by a mili-
 tary tribunal and given sentences ranging from 22 to 28 months.
 Prson onditions are harsh with violene among prisoners and mistreatment and
 extortion of inmates by guards common. The incidence of mistreatment drops sharp-
 ly once a prisoner has been transferred from police or military intelligence (BIA)
 custody into the civilian prison system or into the custody of the Attorney General.
 Political prisoners were sometimes mixed with the general prison population. In the
 Cipinang and Salemba prisons in Jakarta some political prisoners were segregated.
 The ICRC was denied access to political prisoners until July, except in East Timor
 where visits were generally allowed. Special arrangements for visiting dignitaries to
 visit some prominent political prisoners were sometimes made. Some nonpolitical
 prisoners als have been visited by human rights monitors, although this appears
 to be on a case-to-case basis.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Procedures Code contains
 provisions against arbitrary arrest and detention, but it lacks adequate enforcement
 mechanisms and authorities routinely violate it. The Code specifies that prisoners
 have the right to notify their families and that warrants must be produced during
 an arrest except under specified conditions, such as when a suspect is caught in the
 act of committing a crime. The law also requires that families of detainees be noti-
 fied promptly. The law authorizes investigators to issue warrants to assist in their
 investigations or if sufficient evidence exists that a crime has been committed. How-
 ever, authorities sometimes made arrests without warrants.
 The law presumes defendants innocent and permits bail. They or their families
 may also challenge the legality of their arrest and detention in a pretrial hearing
 and may sue for compensation if wrongfully detained. However, it is virtually impos-
 sible for detainees to invoke this procedure, or to receive compensation, after being
 released without charge. In both military and civilian courts, appeals based on
 claims of improper arrest and detention are rarely, if ever, accepted. The Criminal
 Procedures Code also ontains specific limits on periods of pretrial detention and
 specifies when the courts must approve extensions, usually after 60 days. In addi-
 tio n, suspects charged under the 1963 Antisubversion Law are subject to special
 procedures outside the Code. These give the Attorney General the authority to hold
 a suspect for up to 1 year before trial. He may renew this 1-year period without
 limit.
 The authorities routinely approve extensions of periods of detention. In areas
 where active guerrilla movements exist, such as East Timor and Irian Jaya, there
 are many instances of people being detained without warrants, charges, or court
 proceedings. This is also true in Aceh. Bail is rarely granted, especially in political
 cases. Over 100 people were detained following the discovery of weapons caches in
 various regions of Aceh, be nning in February. They allegedly were held incommu-
 nicado at military camps. The authorities frequently prevent access to defense coun-
 sel while suspects are being investigated and make it difficult or impossible for de-
 tainees to get legal assistance from voluntary legal defense organizations. Special
 laws on corruption, economic crimes, and narcotics do not come under the Criminal
 Code's protections.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National Secu-
 rity (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the legal code and has wide discretion to de-
 
 
 777
 tain and interrogate persons thought to threaten national security. Despite the ex-
 istence of this agency, the military began discussing publicly in 1996 the need for
 a new internal security act to give the Government greater power to suppress dis-
 sent. Although there was further public discussion of this proposal during 1997, it
 had not been sent to Parliament.
 Security forces broke up demonstrations and meetings and detained participants
 (see Sections 1.c. and 2.b.).
 There are no reliable data on the number of arbitrary arrests or detentions with-
 out trial, particularly in East Timor, Irian Jaya, and Aceh. In East Timor, partially
 as a result of increased demonstrations in late 1996 and in 1997, as well as in-
 creased guerrilla activity, the number of detentions during 1997 was higher than
 in previous years.
 Arbitrary detentions in East Timor were a particular problem following increased
 guerrilla attacks in Baucau and Los Palos. According to credible sources, numerous
 people not involved in the separatist movement were detained and mistreated as se-
 curity forces swept through local neighborhoods in search of the perpetrators of var-
 ious attacks. In the early part of the year the civilian paramilitary gada paksi group
 also frequently detained and beat civilians.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution stipulates the independence of
 the judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is subordinated to the executive and the
 military. Court challenges in various jurisdictions to the Government's transparent
 manipulation of the PD leadership structure in 1996, with a few exceptions, contin-
 ued to be dismissed in 1997. Judges are civil servants employed by the executive
 branch, which controls their assignments, pay, and promotion. Low salaries encour-
 age widespread corruption. Judges are subject to considerable pressure from govern-
 mental authorities that often determines the outcome of a case.
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and administrative courts
 exists below the Supreme Court. The right of appeal from district court to high court
 to Supreme Court exists in all four systems. The Supreme Court does not consider
 factual aspects of a case, only the lower courts' application of law. The Supreme
 Court theoretically stands coequal with the executive and legislative branches, but
 it does not have the right of judicial review over laws passed by Parliament. The
 Supreme Court has not yet exercised its authority (held since 1985) to review min-
 isterial decrees and regulations. In 1993 Chief Justice Purwoto Gandasubrata laid
 out procedures for limited judicial review.
 A panel of judges conducts trials at the district court level, poses questions, hears
 evidence, decides guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Initial judgments are
 rarely reversed in the appeals process, although sentences can be increased or re-
 duced. Both the defense and the prosecution may appeal.
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and to produce witnesses in their
 defense. An exception is allowed in cases in which distance or expense is deemed
 excessive for transporting witnesses to court. In such cases, sworn affidavits may
 be introduced. However, the Criminal Procedures Code does not provide for wit-
 nesses' immunity or for defense power of subpoena. As a result, witnesses are gen-
 erally unwilling to testify against the authorities. The courts commonly allow forced
 confessions and limit the presentation of defense evidence. In a trial in March a wit-
 ness stated in open court that he had been tortured with electric shock in the course
 of interrogation in 1996 by military intelligence (BIA). No investigation of his
 charge, given under oath, was launched. Defendants do not have the right to remain
 silent and can be compelled to testify against themselves. The Criminal Procedures
 Code gives defendants the right to an attorney from the moment of their arrest, but
 not during the prearrest investigation period, which may involve prolonged deten-
 tion. Persons summoned to appear as witnesses in investigations do not have the
 right to be assisted by lawyers even though information developed in the course of
 rendering testimony can subsequently become the basis of an investigation of the
 witness. The law requires that a lawyer be appointed in capital cases and those in-
 volving a prison sentence of 15 years or more. In cases involving potential sentences
 of 5 years or more, a lawyer must be appointed if the defendant desires an attorney
 and is indigent. In theory, destitute defendants may obtain private legal help, such
 as that provided by the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation. In practice, however, de-
 fendants are often persuaded not to hire an attorney, or access to an attorney of
 their choice is impeded.
 In many cases procedural protections, including those against coerced confessions,
 particularly those coerced by the police and military intelligence (BIA), are inad-
 equate to ensure a fair trial. Corruption is a common feature of the legal system
 and the payment of bribes can influence prosecution, conviction, and sentencing in
 civil and criminal cases.

 There were few signs of judicial independence. The court continued to be used to
 take action aginst political activists and government critics. The Government vigor-
 ously pursued the numerous subversion cases started at the end of 1996, and initi-
 atedor threatened new cases. Many independent observers interpreted this as an
 effort to chill dissent in advance of the May general election. The Government pros-
 ecuted and the court convicted 14 young activists belonging to or associated with
 the People's Democratic Party (PRD) under the Antisubversion Law in April and
 June, handing down the harshest sentences for peaceful political dissent in recent
 years (see Section 2.a.). The Government also tried indepndent labor leader
 Muchtar Pakpahan, and former parliamentarian Sri Bintang Pamungkas under this
 law. Four youths charged with inciting the rioting that took place in Tasikmaaya,
 West Java in December 1996 were brought to trial in 1997 on charges of subversion.
 The trials concluded in November and Deember, resulting in seentces of 22
 months, 24 months, 8 years, and 10 years in prison. Megawati Sukarnoputri fed
 suit in courts throug out the country to challenge te legaity of the June 1996 gov-
 ernment-supprted Medan congress that ousted her from the PDI leadership. Most
 courts refused to hear the case. However, several courts accepted the case and ruled
 in her favor.
 The Antisubversion Law, which carries a maximum penalty of death (which has
 not been invoked in recent years), makes it a crime to engage in acts that could
 distort, undermine, or deviate from the state ideology or broad outlines of state pol-
 icy, or which could disseminate feelings of hostility or arouse hostility, disturbances,
 or anxiety among the population. The excessively vague language of this law makes
 it possible to prosecute people merely for peaceful expression of views contrary to
 those of the Government.
 Manyprisoners are serving sentences for subversion, including members of the
 banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PK(I), Muslim militants, and those convicted
 of subversion in Irian Jaya, Aceh, and East Timor. More are serving sentences
 under the Hate-Sowing or Sedition laws. Some of these persons advocated or em-
 ployed violence, but others are political prisoners who were convicted for attempting
 to exercise such universally recognized human rights as freedom of speech or asso-
 ciation, or who were convicted in unfair trials. Juvencio de Jesus Martins, an East
 Timorese prisoner, was released under normal remission procedures on Indonesian
 Independence Day, August 17.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.--Judicial
 warrants for searches are required except for cases involving suspected subversion,
 economic crimes, and corruption. However, security agencies regularly made forced
 or surreptitious entries. Security forces also engaged in surveillance of persons and
 residences and selective monitoring of local and international telephone calls with-
 out legal restraint.
 Government security officials monitor the movements and activities of former
 members of the Pa and its front organizations, especially persons the Government
 believes were involved in the abortive 1965 oup. These persons and their relatives
 sometimes are subjected to surveillance, required check-ins, periodic indoctrination,
 and restrictions on travel outside their city of residence. One of the methods the
 Government has used to monitor the activities of these people has been to require
 that the initials "E.T." ("Ex-Tapor' or political prisoner) be stamped in their identi-
 fication cards. This allows the Government and prospective employers to identify
 former Pw members, and subjects them to official and unofficial discrimination. Al-
 though the requirement that E.T. be stamped in identification cards has been offi-
 cially ended, in practice it is still used in many cases.
 After several years during which the Government significantly reduced its
 transmigration program, the program was revived during the year with private cor-
 orate suort The program moves large numbers of people from overpopulated is-
 andsto more isolated and less developed ones. It is also used to resettle local popu-
 lations within East Timor and Irian Jaya. Human rights monitors say that the pro-
 gram violates the rights of indigenous people and dupes some transnigrants into
 leaving their home ilages without any means of return. Conditions at some sites
 are life threatening, with inadequate measures to protect the transmigrant popu-
 lation against diseases endemic to the transmigration sites. Transmigrants and mi-
 grants outside the Government transmigration program received indirect govern-
 ment support in the form of developmental assistance programs and contracts with
 the armed forces (ABRI) or local government officials. This practice, particularly in
 East Timor, Irian Jaya and Kalimantan, led to resentment among indigenous popu-
 lations, which believed that their rights were infringed upon (see Section 5).
 There were reports that security forces occupied villages in the central highlands
 of Irian Jaya and destroyed homes and crops. The military denied committing
 abuses (see Section 2.d.).
 
 
 The Government prohibits the import of Chinese-language publications (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the 1945 Constitution and the 1982
 Press Law provide for freedom of the press, the Government continued to restrict
 press freedom in practice. The Government uses the issuance of publishing licenses
 under a 1984 ministerial decree to control the press. Other means of control include
 regulation of the amount of advertising permitted and of the number of pages al-
 lowed in newspapers. In sensitive areas, the authorities continued to provide guid-
 ance to local journalists and editors on what they should print, although there were
 many cases in which such guidance was ignored. Self-censorship by the press con-
 tinued, especially on subjects known to be sensitive to the Government. At year's
 end, criticism of the Government grew stronger and the press carried it more open-
 ly.
 Coverage of a number of sensitive topics, such as corruption, the role of the first
 family in business, and lack of government fiscal accountability, did occur, particu-
 larly in the English-language press. Major Indonesian-lanuage newspapers were
 more cautious. The broadcast media, which reaches a far larger proportion of the
 population than does the print media, rarely if ever deals with sensitive topics.
 Media coverage of the January-February ethnic fighting between Christian Dayak
 and Muslim Madurese in West Kalimantan was at times extremely restricted. The
 military held a closed meeting with senior editors early in February in the midst
 of the ethnic strife. Few local newspaper reports about the situation in West
 Kalimantan appeared until the fighting was well underway. Other instances of so-
 cial unrest, such as in Rengasdengklok, West Java on January 30, and instances
 related to the election campaign, received more media coverage.
 Throughout most of the year, limited debate on political and social issues was per-
 mitted in the press and other public forums, but the Government continued to im-
 pose restrictions on free speech, especially in cases involving direct opposition to the
 existing system. At year's end, public criticism of the Government grew stronger and
 the press carried it more openly. In the aftermath of the July 27, 1996 incident, and
 in-the period prior to the May general election, the Government demonstrated that
 it would not tolerate challenges to the fundamental underpinnings of the political
 system, in particular by arresting, placing on trial, and harshly sentencing some of
 its critics.
 Fourteen activists belonging to, or associated with, the small, opposition People's
 Democratic Party (PRD) were convicted under the controversial 1963 Antisubversion
 Law. On April 28, the day after the general election campaign began, courts in Ja-
 karta convicted nine of the activists. Although the young activists originally were
 arrested in August 1996 amidst government accusations of masterminding the "July
 27" incident, the convictions rested instead on writings, speeches, and organiza-
 tional activities, which were deemed subversive (see Section i.e.).
 The PRD's leader, Budiman Sudjatmiko, received a 13-year sentence, which was
 increased to 15 years on appeal. This was one of the most severe sentences imposed
 in a subversion case in recent years. His associates received sentences ranging from
 12 years to 18 months. Two more PRD activists were convicted in Jakarta on June
 16, and given 4- and 5-year sentences. Other PRD-related cases included the convic-
 tions in Surabaya of Dita Indah Sari and two others for subversion on April 22 and
 April 23 based on their political views and organizational activities, which included
 calling for an end to the military doctrine of dual function and organizing labor
 strikes.
 Independent labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan's subversion trial, which began on
 December 12, 1996, continued in the early part of the year, and was interrupted
 due to his serious health problems. It resumed in September. As with the young
 PRD activists, the subversion charges rested on his criticism of the Government,
 rather than his purported role in the July 27, 1996 violence, as had originally been
 publicly claimed by the Government (see Section 6.a.).
 The subversion trial of Sri Bintang Pamungkas, the former United Development
 Party (PPP) legislator, began on December 22. According to the prosecution, he was
 charged under the 1963 Antisubversion Law because he formed the Indonesian
 Democratic Union Party (PUDI), issued a PUDI manifesto, named himself a can-
 didate for president, and snt out holiday (Idul Fitri) cards in January carrying the
 PUDrs agenda. The PUDIs program included rejection of the 1997 election, reje-
 tion of another Soeharto presidential candidacy, and a call to prepare for the post-
 Soeharto era. Bintang was detained on March 6, along with the PUDI's deputy
 chairman Julius Usman and secretary general Saleh Abdullah, by the Attorney
 
 
 780
 General's Office in accordance with the Antisubversion Law. His colleagues were re-
 leased from detention on April 3.
 Aberson Marie Sihaloho, a parliamentarian from the Indonesian Democratic Party
 (PDI) and a supporter of ousted PDI leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, was convicted
 on July 21 for allegedly insulting the President, armed forces, and other public insti-
 tutions. He received a 9-month prison sentence. The basis of his conviction was a
 speech he made in July 1996 at the "free speech forum" in front of the PDI head-
 quarters, which had been videotaped by the Government. He became the first par-
 liamentarian in recent years to face trial and be convicted.
 The Government took similar harsh action against some individuals who pub-
 lished magazines or books that challenged the system. Andi Syaputra was sentenced
 on Aprnil 7 to 30 months in prison for printing and distributing printed material al-
 legedy defaming President Soeharto. On March 4, the Government banned a 22-
 page pamphlet written by Soebadio Sastrsatomo, one of the leaders of the long-out-
 lawedIndonesian Socialist Party (PSI). The Government then brought Soebadio's
 private secretary to trial August 5 on charges of having "insulted" the President.
 lbs alleged crime was that he assisted in the production of the book. He was re-
 leased from detention in September while his trial was still in progress.
 An activist from the NGO Center for information and Action Network for Demo-
 cratic Reform, Tri Agus Siswomihardjo, was released from prison March 10 after
 serving 24 months for disseminating materials allegedly defaming the President.
 Eko Mariyad and Achmad Tafik, of the unrecogmzed Independent Journalists' As-
 sociation (AJI), were released from prison on July18. They had served 2 years and
 4 months of their 3-year sentences for allegedly slandering the President and
 s p reading hatred against the Government. They were convited based on articles
 they wrote for the underground journal Independen, and for publishing Independen
 wthout a government license.
 The killing of a journalist who published critical reports in 1996, and at least one
 other similar case in 1997, attracted domestic and international attention. A trial
 was carried out in the 1996 killing in Yogyakarta of a journalist, Fuad Muhammad
 Syafrudin (Udin), who worked for the Yogyakarta daily newspaper Bernas. He had
 been attacked in his home, possibly in connection with articles he had written that
 were critical of the local government's actions in land cases. There was considerable
 controversy as to whether authorities had arrested the right suspect, as the victim's
 wife, an eyewitness to the crime, testified in court on September 2 that the defend-
 ant was not the one who killed her husband. The accused claimed that his confes-
 sion was coerced by the authorities. Prosecutors finally dropped the case, and the
 defendant was released on November 27.
 On July 26, a journalist for the Jakarta weekly magazine Sinar Pagi, Naimullah,
 was found dead in his car outside Pontianak, West Kalimantan. He reportedly had
 injuries to his neck, head, temples, chest, and wrists and four individuals were seen
 near his car. He had published reports on timber smuggling and theft that allegedly
 involved local officials. The Indonesian Journalists' Association called for an impar-
 tial police investigation. The police in West Kalimantan announced in August that
 the case was still being investigated. By year's end, it had not been resolved.
 The electronic media remained more cautious in their coverage of the Government
 than the print media. The Government operates a nationwide television network
 with 12 regional stations. Private commercial television companies, most with own-
 ership by, or management ties to, the President's family, continued to expand. All
 are required to broadcast government-produced news, but many also produce public
 affairs style programming with news content.
 Over 600 private radio broadcasting companies exist in addition to the Govern-
 ment's national radio network. They all were required to belong to the government-
 sponsored Association of Private Radio Stations (PRSSNI) to receive a broadcasting
 license. The government radio station produces the program "National News," which
 is the only news permitted by law to be broadcast in Indonesia. It is relayed
 throughout the country by private stations and 53 regional affiliates of the govern-
 ment station. By law, the private radio stations may produce only "light" news, such
 as human interest stories, and may not discuss politics. In practice, however, many
 broadcast interviews and foreign news as well. Moreover, "alk radio" call-in pro-
 grams increasingly touch on political and socio-economic issues.
 Foreign television and radio broadcasts were readily accessible. Satellite dishes
 have proliferated throughout the country, and there was access to the Internet. The
 Government made no effort to restrict access to this programming, and has pro-
 claimed an "open skies" poliy. Foreign periodicals are widely available. Distribution
 is sometimes delayed by a day or more by authorities, although this is rare. The
 Government restricts the import of Chinese-language publications (see Section 5).
 
 
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia, particularly to certain
 areas of the country, by visiting and resident foreign correspondents. It occasionally
 reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions. Special
 permission is necessary for foreign journalists to travel to East Timor, Aceh, and
 Irian Jaya. With a few exceptions, press access to East Timor was restricted. A
 number of journalists repeatedly requested permission to go to East Timor without
 success. The local press in Aceh is tightly controlled.
 In November a foreign NGO worker was detained in Dili for participating in and
 photographing a peaceful, candlelight vigil. Authorities accused her of acting as a
 journalist wit out the proper visa. She was expelled to Bali, following 10 hours of
 questioning by authorities.
 The Government requires a permit for the importation of foreign publications and
 videotapes, which must be reviewed by governm    ensors. Importers sometimes
 avoided foreign materials critical of the Government or dealing with topics consid-
 ered sensitive, such as human rights. There is a significant amount of materials by-
 passing customs and censorship procedures.
 Publishers sometimes refused to accept manuscripts dealing with controversial is-
 sues. Most books by the prominent novelist and former political prisoner,
 Pramoedya Ananta Toer, are banned, though some were in circulation. The Govern-
 ment in March banned a pamphlet whichi was written by a former leader of the
 long-banned Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI), Soebadio Sastrosatmo.
 In December, police banned the performance of a play in Bandung, West Java
 based on the life of labor activist Marsinah, who was murdered in 1993, the play
 had been closed down earlier in Surabaya East Java on November 26, and was
 stpped in other cities as well. It was performed in Jakarta and some other venues.
 While the law provides for academic freedom, constraints exist on the activities
 of scholars. Political activity and discussions at universities, while no longer for-
 mally banned, remained constrained. Some scholars displayed caution in producing
 or including in lectures and class discussions materials that might provoke govern-
 ment displeasure.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, the Government places significant controls on the ex-
 ercise of this right. The Government promulgfated regulations in December 1995
 that eliminated the permit requirements for some types of public meetings. A re-
 quirement to notify the police remained for most others, andin practice numerous
 public meetings continued to be prevented or broken up.
 In an effort to control NGO's, unrecognized political groups, and some student or-
 ganizations in the aftermath of the July 27, 1996 incident and in the period prior
 to the May general election and afterwards, the Government prevented or broke up
 numerous meetings, seminars, and other peaceful demonstrations, and public gath-
 erings, although it allowed others to occur. In November 1996, high-level govern-
 ment officials made public threats to take legal action against selected NGO's
 deemed to be "trouble-making." Several of those groups, specifically the People's
 Democratic Party (PRD) and is affiliates were banned by the Government on Sep-
 tember 29, and the authorities used close monitoring to intimidate other NGO's,
 which nonetheless continued to operate.
 On March 13, the police in Jakarta broke up a seminar focused on the upcoming
 general election jointly sponsored by a student group, several NGO's, and the Inde-
 pendent Election Monitoring Committee. The groups said publicly that they had no-
 tified the police in accordance with relevant regulations, but the authorities still re-
 fused to allow the event to proceed.
 On April 11, security forces in Medan, North Sumatra stopped an NGO seminar
 on advocacy traimn   r aaranaffairs during its second day. The seminar had
 been scheduled to ron for 5 days. In June a meeting bringing together NGO's in
 Banda Aceh was canceled by the authorities on the day it was to begin.
 An evening discussion sponsored by student groups held the day before the anni-
 versary of the 1996 "July 27 incident" was broken up and five students were interro-
 gated.
 On July 29, police in the Lampung province of Sumatra broke up a training ses-
 sion hd labor federation, the Indonesian Prosperity Trade
 Unio (SSI) Thesesionwasin its third day of a 10-day schedule when the police
 shut it down. Twenty-six SBSI members were arrested, and there were credible re-
 ports that some of them were beaten while in detention.
 Although the Government refused to grant official recognition to the Independent
 Election Monitoring Committee, it allowed the KIPP to carry out limited, yet signifi-
 cant, monitoring activities during the campaign and election. The Government also
 permitted the  uP to hold press conferences in Jakarta evaluating the election and
 to issue a public report wih iths findings, which outlined many flaws in the election.
 
 
 782
 
 However, there were also instances where the KIPP was subjected to serious re-
 strictions. For example, on April 7, the police in South Sulawesi canceled a program
 organized by the local KIPP chapter designed to train volunteer election monitors
 even though the program organizers had notified the police. The KIPP was unable
 to function in Aceh, due to pressures against it. An April discussion there sponsored
 by the KIPP was canceled by the authorities.
 Security forces detained 24 student demonstrators at Gadjah Mada University in
 Yogyakarta on April 1. The police accused the students of calling for an election boy-
 cott. On April 2, eight students were violently arrested during a second demonstra-
 tion in which they called for the release of the first group. All 32 were released on
 April 3. On March 11, three student activists were reportedly arrested in Jakarta
 because they were allegedly attempting to call for an election boycott by putting up
 posters and writing graffiti.
 Security forces violently dispersed a peaceful gathering of supporters of Megawati
 Sukarnoputri in Bali in April, assaulted a group of demonstrators following the sen-
 tencing of PRD activists in April, and attacked a group of students at the Indo-
 nesian Christian University campus in Jakarta in June (see Section 1.c.). On Sep-
 tember 19, security forces stopped a congress held by the SBSI in Jakarta. It was
 the first day of a planned 3-day schedule. Eight members of the congress's organiza-
 tional committee, two Australian trade unionists, and two Dutch journalists were
 detained overnight. Security forces broke up a year-end celebration gathering at the
 SBSI headquarters on December 27. The security forces claimed that the S BSI had
 not obtained the necessary permit, and 27 people were detained. Musical instru-
 ments, recordings of labor songs, SBSI archives, banners, photos, and participants
 belongings were confiscated.
 Security forces in Jakarta mobilized on July 27 to prevent supporters of Megawati
 Sukarnoputri from carring out what was supposed to be a commemoration of the
 1996 "July 27 incident at the PDI's former headquarters. Several smaller groups
 were able to approach the headquarters where they peaceably conducted group
 prayers surrounded by security forces. Several thousand supporters of Megawati
 were permitted to rally on the street in front of the national Parliament on April
 15. Several hundred police officers on the scene prevented access to parliament
 grounds, but took no action to stop the gathering.
 An NGO-sponsred seminar on East Timor was held in Jakarta on September 12
 without government interference. A public dialogue between the military and gov-
 ernment and NGO's was held on September 8.
 Father Romo Inatius Sandyawan Sumard and his brother were brought to trial
 in Bekasi, West Java in October. He was accused of harboring three political dis-
 sidents including People's Democratic Party (PRD) leader Budiman Sudjatmiko and
 two of his lieutenants during the manhunt for them that took place in August 1996.
 The authorities stated that they blocked Father Sandyawan from seeking needed
 medical treatment abroad because of the investigation launched in August 1996.
 On December 10, there were a number of student demonstrations planned to
 mark Human Rights Day. The military blocked some but permitted others.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 places significant controls on the exercise of this right. The 1985 Social Organiza-
 tions Law (ORMAS) requires the adherence of all organizations, including recog-
 nized religions and associations, to the official ideology of Pancasila. This provision,
 which limits political activity, is widely understood as designed to inhibit activities
 of groups seeking to engage in democratic political competition, make Indonesia an
 Islamic state, revive communism, or return the country to a situation of partisan
 ideological division. It empowers the Government to disband any organization it be-
 lieves to be acting against Pancasila and requires prior government approval for any
 organization's acceptance of funds from foreign donors. Nevertheless, numerous or-
 ganizations, including the independent labor organization, the SBSI, and the KIPP,
 were active without official recognition under this law.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom for mem-
 bers of five accepted religions and belief in one Supreme God. The Government rec-
 ognizes Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and permits
 the practice of the mystical, traditional beliefs of "Aliran Kepercayaan." Although
 the population is over 85 percent Muslim, the practice and teachings of the other
 recognized religions are generally respected, and the Government actively promotes
 mutual tolerance and harmony among them. However, some restrictions on certain
 typ~es of religious activity, including unrecognized religions, exist.
 Blecause the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in one Supreme God, atheism is for-
 bidden. Although individuals are not compelled to practice any particular faith, all
 citizens must choose one of the five officially recognized religions. As this choice
 must be noted on official documents, such as the identification card, failure to iden-
 
 
 783
 tify a reli *on can make it impossible to obtain such documents. The legal require-
 ment to adhere to Pancasila extends to all religious and secular organizations. The
 Government strongly opposes Muslim groups that advocate establishing an Islamic
 state or acknowledging only Islamic law. The Government banned some religions,
 including Jehovah's Witnesses, Baha'i, Confucianism and in some provinces the
 messianic Islamic sect Darul Arqam. The Government closely monitors Islamic sects
 considered in danger of deviating from orthodox tenets, and in the past has on occa-
 sion dissolved such groups.
 High-level officials continued to make public statements and emphasize by exam-
 pie the importance of respect for religious diversity. Lower level officials, however,
 were frequently alleged to be reluctant to facilitate and protect the rights of reli-
 gious minorities.
 A 1969 regulation dictates that before a house of worship can be built, agreement
 must be obtained from local residents living near the site and a license must be ob-
 tained from the regional office of the Minstry of Religion. Some Christians claim
 that this regulation is being used to discriminate against them and to prevent them
 from building churches. Despite the problems, the building of churches continues.
 The law allows conversion between faiths, and such conversions occur. Independ-
 ent observers note that interfaith marriage between Muslims and non-Muslims have
 become increasingly difficult. People from religions outside the five accepted reli-
 gions have difficulty having their marriage officially recognized. There was one
 prominent case of a Confucian couple that was prohibited from getting married.
 The Government views proselytizing by recognized religions in areas heavily
 dominated by another recognized religion as potentially disruptive and discourages
 it. Foreign missionary activities are relatively unimpeded, although in East Timor,
 Irian Jaya, and occasionally elsewhere missionaries have experienced difficulties
 and delays in renewing residence permits, and visas allowing the entrance of new
 foreign clergy are diffcult to obtain. Laws and decrees from the 1970's limit the
 number of years that foreign missionaries can spend in Indonesia, with some exten-
 sions granted in remote areas like Irian Jaya. Foreign missionary work is subject
 to the funding stipulations of the ORMAS law. Citizens practicing the recognized
 religions maintain active links with coreligionists inside and outside the country and
 travel abroad for religious gatherings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although in 1993 the Government drastically reduced the number of
 people barred either from entering or departing Indonesia from a publicly an-
 nounced figure of 8,897 "blacklisted" people to a few hundred, such restrictions still
 exist. The Government also restricts movement by citizens and foreigners to and
 within parts of the country. In addition, it requires permits to seek work in a new
 location in certain areas, primarily to control further population movement to
 crowded cities. Special permits are required to visit certain parts of Irian Jaya. The
 authorities require former political detainees, including those associated with the
 abortive 1965 coup, to give notice of their movements and to have official permission
 to change their place of residence (see Section 1.f.).
 Authorities carried out operations to investigate citizens' identification cards
 (KTP), including stopping motorists and raiding entertainment sites. On July 15, in
 west Jakarta police reportedly checked the documents of 3,000 people and fined
 many for not having proper permission to be in Jakarta. Teguh Sunarto was de-
 tained during a similar operation in Surabaya for not having his identification card.
 He was mistreated and died after his release from detention (see Section L.a.).
 The Government blocked the overseas travel of some political activists, some of
 whom were seeking medical treatment. Immigration authorities at the airport in Ja-
 karta on April 10 stopped human rights activist Father Romo Sandyawan Soemardi
 from leaving Indonesia to undergo eye surgery in Perth, Australia. He had been
 questioned in August 1996 in connection with the cases against the PRD. The Ja-
 karta administrative court on January 28 upheld the Attorney General's decision to
 impose a 1-year travel ban on Sri Bintang Pamungkas on April 18, 1996. It was
 the second 1-year ban. The Government initially refused detained, independent
 labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan's request to receive overseas medical evaluation and
 treatment. In December the Government permitted a team of Canadian doctors to
 examine Pakpahan. Already serving a prison sentence stemming from a 1994 con-
 viction, he was being tried for subversion. The trial had been interrupted due to
 Pakpahan's need for medical treatment, and it was at that point while he was still
 in the hospital that he had sought permission to obtain treatment overseas.
 The Government's 1996 closure of certain areas of Irian Jaya's central highlands
 to nonresidents continued into 1997. The areas had been closed due to the military's
 special operations against the separatist Free Papua Organization (OPM), the group
 tat carried out killings and kidnapings in 1996. Exceptions were made during the
 
 
 closure of these areas, including for some religious personnel. Information was dif-
 ficult to obtain due to the restrictions. However, credible sources asserted that secu-
 rity forces were occupying villages in the highlands, exercising tight control over vil-
 lagers' movements, and fbrcing them to perform uncompensated labor during the re-
 striction period. There were credible reports that in late 1996 security forces had
 mistreated local residents in the operational area, including beatings and harsh in-
 terrogation, destruction of homes and crops, and sexual abuse, and that in January
 security forces burned huts in one village. According to reliable reports, the military
 carried out forced movements and harassment of villagers in late 1997, which exac-
 erbated food shortages in some instances. The military denied that it was restricting
 villagers' movements or committing abuses, and asserted that the OPM was intimi-
 dating villagers.
 In past years, the Government offered first asylum to over 125,000 Indochinese
 boat people. Indonesia's Galang Island camp was closed in 1996 as the last remain-
 ing asylum seekers were repatriated. There remain, however, some 14 persons
 awaiting a resettlement opportunity in another country. The Government has not
 formulated a policy regaring asylum seekers of other nationalities, but it has in
 practice respected the principle of not returning asylum seekers to the country from
 which they had fled. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a coun-
 try where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government through democratic
 means. There has never been an electoral challenge to President Soeharto. The
 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is constitutionally the highest
 authority of the State. It meets every 5 years to elect the President and Vice Presi-
 dent and to set the broad outlines of state policy. The MPR is effectively controlled
 by President Soeharto and his Government. Five hundred members of the MPR
 come from the National Parliament (DPR), 425 of whose members were elected in
 the May general election (up from 400 elected members in 1992). The remaining 75
 members are military appointees. In 1993 the MPR elected Soeharto to his sixth
 uncontested 5-year term as President. Legally the President is constitutionally sub-
 ordinate to the MPR, but actually he and a small group of associates exercise gov-
 ernmental authority.
 Under a doctrine known as dual function, the military assumes a significant socio-
 political as well as a security role. Members of the military are allotted 75 unelected
 seats in the DPR, in partial compensation for not being permitted to vote. The mili-
 tary holds an unelected 20 percent of the seats in provincial and district par-
 liaments, and occupies numerous key positions in the administration. The other 85
 percent of national and 80 percent of local parliamentary seats are filled through
 elections held every 5 years. All adult citizens, except active duty members of the
 armed forces, convicted criminals servingprison sentences, and some 36,000 former
 members of the PKI, are eligible to vote. Voters choose by secret ballot between the
 three government-approved political organizations, which field candidate lists in
 each electoral district. Those lists must be screened by BAKORSTANAS, which de-
 termines whether candidates were involved in the abortive 1965 coup or pose other
 broadly defined security risks. Critics charge that these screenings are unconstitu-
 tional, since there is no way to appeal the results, and note that they can be used
 to eliminate critics of the Government from Parliament. Strict rules establish the
 length of political campaigns, access to electronic media, schedules for public ap-
 pearances, and the political symbols that can be used.
 The Government formally permits only three political organizations to exist and
 contest elections. The largest and most important of these is GOLKAR, a govern-
 ment-controlled organization of diverse functional groups. The President strongly in-
 fluences the selection of the leaders of GOLKAR, of which he is the senior leader.
 GOLKAR maintains close institutional links with the armed forces and KORPRI,
 the association to which all civil servants automatically belong. Civil servants may
 join any of the political parties with official permission, but they are in practice com-
 pelled to support GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and some other banned
 parties may not run for office or be active politically.
 The other two small, legal, political organizations, the United Development Party
 (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), are not considered opposition
 parties, and, along with GOLKAR, are required by law to embrace the state ideology
 of Pancasila. These smaller parties are not permitted to maintain party offices below
 the district level, placing them at a disadvantage to the government-supported
 GOLKAR, which has offices at the district and lower administrative levels. Govern-
 ment authorities closely scrutinize and often guide the activities of the three politi-
 
 
 cal organizations. For example, many serving parliamentarians as well as potential
 new candidates from the PDI were not permitted to run in the May parliamentary
 election after the Government in June 1996 engineered the ouster of the popular
 leader of the PDI, Megawati Sukarnoputri. She had become the subject of public
 speculation as a possible candidate for president in 1998. Members of the DPR and
 thejprovincial assemblies may be recalled from office by party leaders. An outspken
 DPJmember from the AERI faction, Major General The Syafei, was removed from
 the house prior to the May parliamentary election. Although members of the ABRI
 faction in the DPR can be replaced at any time at the behest of the commander in
 chief of the armed forces, and are thus not technically subject to recall, the timing
 of Syafei's dismissal was considered unusual. It occurred soon after he had publicly
 emphasized that voters had the right to void their ballots by marking the symbols
 for all three political parties.
 The May parliamentary election, in line with the previous five elections held since
 1971, denied citizens the right to change their own government democratically. The
 ruling GOLKAR party secured its largest electoral victory ever with more than 74
 percent of the vote; the PPP received approximately 22 percent of the vote, and the
 PDI just over 3 percent. Government-ousted PDI leader Megawati Sukarnoputri and
 her supporters were not permitted to take part in the election, a factor that many
 independent observers publicly concluded led to the drop in the PDI's vote share
 from the 17 percent level it obtained in the previous election.
 Sporadic, yet significant, violence occurred during the 27-day campaign period
 that preceded the vote, including clashes between and among political contestants,
 between political contestants and security forces, and general rioting. Most of the
 hundreds of deaths during the campaign period happened as a result of accidents
 during the massive street rallies. According to government figures, 123 persons died
 in Banj'armasin, South Kalimantan on May 23, the last day of the campaign, during
 a fire that broke out in a department store amidst major rioting and looting. In ad
 dition, numerous injuries resulted from clashes before, and, in some places, after the
 election. Many observers concluded that it was the most violent campaign ever. The
 Government succeeded in restricting the content and structure of the campaign and
 election, perhaps even more so than in past years. However, despite new rules de-
 signed to stop the street rallies that had been prevalent in previous campaigns, and
 numerous high level public warnings to abide by these rules, large rallies were re-
 peatedly camed out by GOLKAR, the PPP, and, to a far lesser extent, by the PDI.
 In the midst of the campaign, the Government banned all materials supporting
 an embryonic alliance between supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri and the Unit-
 ed Development Party (PPP). In the period prior to the election, the President and
 other senior government officials through a series of blunt pronouncements strongly
 urged citizens to ignore the few, mostly indirect, calls that were made to boycott the
 election. The Government repeatedly made it known that such calls were illegal,
 through public statements and the arrests of those who advocated a boycott, includ-
 ing public figure such as Sri Bintang and students who were allegedly distributing
 leaflets calling for a boycott. A few student and church groups that also indirectly
 called for an election boycott were not affected.
 The election and campaign were marred by numerous, credible charges of fraud
 and other violations, mostly committed by the Government and GOLKAR, although
 there were also some campaign violations by the PPP and the PDI. The reports of
 fraud and other violations included double voting by members of GOLKAR, govern-
 ment intimidation of PPP and PDI poll witnesses, and improper supervision of the
 vote counting. In a few districts in East Java, the complaints of large-scale vote
 fraud resulted in destructive rioting, forcing the authorities to carry out a re-vote
 because, according to officials, ballot boxes were destroyed. After the election was
 over, the Government claimed to have discovered that 64,000 votes had been mis-
 counted, giving one more parliamentary seat to PDI.
 The National Commission on Human Rights called on the Government, Par-
 liament, election contestants, and public leaders to conduct an overall evaluation of
 the election. The Government's public discussion focused mostly on improving the
 techniques of campaigning rather than on the underlying factors that led to prob-
 lems during the election. The Government said that it would investigate the reports
 of campaign violations forwarded by all three election contestants, but promised no
 results until 1998.
 The Parliament (DPR) considers bills presented to it by government departments
 and agencies but does not draft laws on its own, although it has the constitutional
 authority to do so. During a 5-year term ending in October, the DPR considered and
 passd over 70 pieces of legislation, including one bill two times. In an unprece-
 end and possibly unconstitutional move, the President returned a broadcasting
 bill already approved by the Parliament for reconsideration and revision. The DPR
 
 
 786
 does make technical, and occasionally substantive alterations to bills it reviews.
 There were also indications that the DPR was to a limited extent able to make sub-
 stantive changes to bills that reflected the interests expressed by outside groups.
 This was particularly apparent with regard to the manpower bill (see Section 6).
 However, there was public criticism after reports that the Minister of Manpower
 used $1.3 million from the government-mandated Workers Social Insurance Fund
 (JAMSOSTEK) to facilitate passage in Parliament of the manpower bill.
 While the DPR remains clearly subordinate to the executive branch, it has become
 more active in scrutinizing government policy, and in exercising oversight of govern-
 ment budgetary expenditures and program implementation through hearings at
 which members of the Cabinet, military commanders, and other high officials are
 asked to testify. The DPR also has become increasingly a focal point of appeals and
 petitions from students, workers, displaced farmers, and others charging human
 rights abuses and airing other grievances. It rarely is the source of any relief to pe-
 titioners other than providing a channel through which their complaints can be
 aired.
 While there are no legal restrictions on the role of women in politics, they are
 underrepresented in government. The May parliamentary election represented a
 step backwards for women in terms of representation in Parliament, with their per-
 centage falling from 12 percent to 9 percent of seats. In the Cabinet, 2 of 41 min-
 isters are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Government pressure on domestic human rights organizations and other NGO's
 that began after the July 27 1996 violence continued in the period prior to the May
 general election (see Section 2.a.).
 NGO's faced government harassment, including police raids on their offices sur-
 veillance by police or military intelligence, interrogation at police stations, or can-
 cellation of private meetings. Government officials, as in 1996, publicly threatened
 to take legal action against some NGO's.
 The Government reiterated its rejection of a proposal by the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission to open an office in Jakarta that would have the capac-
 ity to monitor human rights developments. The Government had indicated a willing-
 ness to permit an office to open in Jakarta if its mission were restricted to technical
 operations, such as conducting seminars without any monitoring function.
 The Government considers outside investigations or foreign-based criticism of al-
 leged human rights violations to be interference in its internal affairs. It emphasizes
 its belief that linking foreign assistance or other sanctions related to its human
 rights observance constitute interference in its internal affairs and is therefore un-
 acceptable. Although the Government did not articulate a clear public policy on
 whether it would invite or allow foreigners to monitor the May general election, two
 international groups did observe the election on a limited basis.
 The ICRC continued to operate in East Timor. It also visited prisoners convicted
 of participation in the abortive 1965 coup, convicted Muslim extremists, and East
 Timorese and other political prisoners outside of East Timor. However, throughout
 the year it faced obstacles and unwillingness to allow visits, including continuing
 serious delays in visiting some recent or new detainees or prisoners charged with
 subversion and detained in Jakarta and elsewhere after the 1996 "July 27 incident."
 After an initial visit in August 1996, the ICRC was not permitted further visits to
 the PRD prisoners in Jakarta until the following July.
 While receiving support for its work from the Government in principle, the ICRC
 periodically faced difficulty in implementing its humanitarian program in East
 Timor. Cooperation with local commanders improved following an ICRC seminar for
 military officers held in Jakarta. Participants in the seminar showed improved un-
 derstanding and openness for the ICRC mission and frequently eased access to de-
 tainees in East Timor. While the ICRC was able to visit the vast majority of those
 known to have been detained in East Timor, problems continued in visiting detain-
 ees held by the military in Aceh and North Sumatra. The ICRC has not been able
 to obtain access to Aceh since March, when military operations took place.
 Travel to East Timor by foreign human rights NGO's other than the ICRC has
 not been approved. Domestic human rights organizations are able to visit, however.
 One foreign NGO worker was detained in East Timor in November, during which
 time she stated that she was not allowed to contact her embassy, when she partici-
 pated in and photographed a candlelight vigil commemorating the 1991 Dili mas-
 sacre. She was expelledto Bali following 10 hours of questioning.
 The Government-appointed National -uman Rights Commission, in its 4th year
 of operation, continued to be active in examining reported human rights violations
 
 
 787
 and continued to show independence. Lacking enforcement powers, the commission
 attempts to work within the system, sending teams where necessary to inquire into
 possible human rights problems and employing persuasion, publicity, and moral au-
 thority to highlight abuses, make recommendations for legal and regulatory
 changes, and encourage corrective action.
 The Government has tended to ignore some Commission findings or, in some in-
 stances, has moved lethargically in reaction to them. It was reported publicly that
 the Commission asked the authorities to be more responsive. In September 1995,
 the Commission identified six cases of ABRI abuse of indigenous people in Irian
 Jaya, involving a number of deaths; only one was ever brought to trial, and the
 Commission requested followup action in 1997. The Government made little
 progress in resolving the 1996 "July 27 incident." The Government moved slowly in
 response to the Human Rights Commission's October 1996 report on the incident
 which listed 23 persons missing, 149 injured, and 5 dead, 1 of whom had been shot.
 Two government ministers publicly declared the case closed in August and said that
 there should be no more public discussion of the incident. Supporters of ousted PDI
 leader Megawati Sukarnoputri had announced in June that 6 of the 23 missing per-
 sons had been found, and the Commission said on September 4 that the number
 of missing persons was down to 16. The Commission met with senior government
 officials in September who reportedly agreed that the case had not been solved and
 agreed to continue to search for the remaining 16 persons. No action was promised
 on the Commission's original recommendation that legal action be taken against
 those who took over PDI headquarters.
 The Commission opened an East Timor office in June 1996, which was widely re-
 garded as a positive step in the effort to address and resolve human rights abuses
 there. However, many olservers also had doubts about the potential effectiveness
 of the office because of its location next to the local military headquarters, its reli-
 ance on government-provided staffing, and the fact that it could only receive com-
 plaints and send them back to Jakarta, but could not take action itself. The initial
 ow of citizens to the facility tended to comprise people who did not make com-
 plaints regarding the Government, the military, or local authorities, conveying the
 impression that the local population was reluctant to approach the facility. The of-
 fice limited itself to dealing only with nonpolitical cases and therefore had made lit-
 tle impact with regard to the more serious human rights problems in East Timor.
 The Commission has been trying to address these problems, but by year's end the
 office remained ineffective.
 The Government appointed the Commission's original chairman, who then ap-
 pointed the other 24 commission members. The Commission fills vacancies in its
 ranks independently by internal election. A new chairman and four new members,
 replacing those who had died while in office, were elected in the fall of 1996. The
 Commission moved into its own permanent facilities in 1996, and has hired several
 professional staff to support its 25 members with their investigative and other sub-
 stantive work.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution does not explicitly forbid discrimination based on gender, race,
 disability, language, or social status. However, it stipulates equal rights and obliga-
 tions for all citizens, both native and naturalized. The 1993 Guidelines of State Pol-
 icy (legal statutes adopted by the People's Consultative Assembly) explicitly states
 that women have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men. However,
 these guidelines from 1978, 1983, 1988, and 1993, also state that women's participa-
 tion in the development process must not conflict with their role in improving family
 welfare and the education of the younger generation. Marriage law dictates that the
 man is the head of the family. The Constitution grants citizens the right to practice
 their individual religion and beliefs; however, the Government only recognizes five
 religions and imposes some restrictions on other religious activity.
 Women.-Violence against women remains poorly documented. However, the Gov-
 ernment has acknowledged the problem of domestic violence in society, which has
 been aggravated by social changes brought about by rapid urbanization. Rape by a
 husband of a wife is not considered a crime under the law. Although women's
 groups are trying to change the law, they have not made significant progress.
 Cultural norms dictate that problems between husband and wife are private mat-
 ters, and violence against women in the home is rarely reported. While police could
 bring assault charges against a husband for beating his wife, due to social attitudes,
 they are unlikely to do so. Nonetheless, according to reliable sources, the police have
 become somewhat more responsive to domestic violence complaints.
 
 
 788
 Rape is a punishable offense. Men have been arrested and sentenced for rape and
 attempted rape although reliable statistics are unavailable. The maximum prison
 sentence for rape is 12 years, but observers say that sentences are usually much
 shorter. Mob violence against accused rapists is frequently reported. Women s rights
 activists believe that rape is seriously underreported due to the social stigma at-
 tached to the victim. Some legal experts report that if a woman does not go imme-
 diately to the hospital for a physical examination that produces physical evidence
 of rape, she can not bring charges. A witness is also required in order to bring
 charges, and only in rare cases is there a witness, according to legal experts. Some
 women reportedly fail to report rape to police because the police do not take their
 allegations seriously.
 The Government provides some counseling for abused women, and several private
 organizations exist to assist women. Many of these organizations focus on reuniting
 the family rather than on providing protection to the women involved. Many women
 rely on the extended family system for assistance in cases of domestic violence.
 There are only a few women s crisis centers in Indonesia, including a drop-in center
 founded in Jakarta by the Government-spnsred National Women's Organization
 (KOWANI) in 1996 and a crisis center for women in Yogyakarta run by an NGO.
 A new crisis center for women, "Women's Partner," which opened in Jakarta in
 April, runs a 24-hour hot line and a temporary shelter for abused women. Training
 of counselors for another Jakarta crisis center, called "Speak," is underway.
 Sexual harassment is not a crime under the law, only indecent behavior. Sexual
 harassment charges, however, can damage a civil service career. The current law
 reportedly covers physical abuse only, and requires two witnesses. Female job appli-
 cants and workers have complained of being sexually victimized by foremen and fac-
 tory owners.
 There are credible reports of trafficking in women and of temporary "contract
 marriages" with foreigners in certain areas, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra,
 though the extent of this practice is unclear. These marriages are not considered
 legal, and the children born from them are considered born out of wedlock. Prostitu-
 tion is widespread. Official statistics from 1994 report that there were 70,684 pros-
 titutes in Indonesia, 9,000 of whom were in Jakarta.
 According to the Constitution, women are equal to and have the same rights, obli-
 gations,-and opportunities as men. However, in practice women face some legal dis-
 crimination. Mrage law dictates that the man is the head of the family. Marriage
 law for Muslims, based on Islamic law, allows men to have up to four wives if the
 first wife is unable to fulil her tasks as a wife." Permission of the first wife is
 required, but reportedly most women cannot refuse. Civil servants and members of
 the armed forces who wish to marry a second woman must also have permission
 from their supervisors. To set an example, the President has forbidden cabinet offi-
 cials and senior military officers to have second wives. In divorce cases women often
 bear a heavier evidentiary burden than men, especially in the Islamic-based family
 court system. Alimony is rarely received by divorced women, and there is no enforce-
 ment of alimony payment.
 The 1958 Citizenship Law states that children's citizenship is based only on the
 citizenship of the father. Children of citizen mothers and foreign fathers are consid-
 ered foreigners, and need visas to remain in Indonesia until the age of 18, when
 they can apply for citizenship. They are prohibited from attending Indonesian
 schools, and have to attend international schools, which are expensive. The case of
 one child, the 5-year-old son of a female citizen and a Japanese man, attracted
 media attention in 1996, after the child was ordered to leave the country following
 the divorce of his parents and the expiration of his residency visa. In 1997 the child
 returned with another visa, but because his mother could not afford to keep him
 in an international school, he eventually was sent to Japan to live with his father.
 Foreign women married to citizens also face difficulties. Their children are citi-
 zens and thus are not allowed to attend international schools in Indonesia. These
 women are usually taxed as the foreign head of household but they do not have
 property, business, or inheritance rights. There has been much discussion about
 problems with the Citizenship Law, and NGO's and the Government appear to
 agree that the law needs to be revised.
 Although some women enjoy a high degree of economic and social freedom and
 occupy important positions in both the public and private sectors, the majority do
 not enjoy such social and economic freedoms and are disproportionately represented
 at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale. The 1995 national profile of women's
 positions and roles showed that 37.4 percent of civil servants were women, but only
 5.6 percent were in positions of authority.
 Income disparity between men and women diminishes significantly with greater
 educational achievement. Female workers in manufacturing generally receive lower
 
 
 789
 wages than men. Many female factory workers are hired as day laborers instead of
 as full-time permanent employees, and companies are not required to provide bene-
 fits, such as maternity leave, to day laborers. Womens' rights activists report that
 there is a growing trend in manufacturing to hire women to do work in their homes
 for less than the minimum wage. Unemployment rates for women are approximately
 50 percent higher than for men. Women are often not given the extra benefits and
 salary that are their due when they are the head of household, and in some cases
 do not receive employment benefits for their husband and children, such as medical
 insurance and income tax deductions.
 Despite laws that provide women with a 3-month maternity leave, the Govern-
 ment =    acknowledged that pregnant women are often dismissed or are replaced
 while on leave. Some companies require that women sign statements that they will
 not become pregnant. The Employment Law mandates 2 days of menstrual leave
 per month for women, although this leave is not always allowed. Many groups com-
 plained that the draft manpower bill was vague and did not specify the length of
 maternity and menstrual leave time to which women are entitled. It also did not
 mandate that employers give breast-feeding women time during work hours to feed
 their babies. The new law passed by Parliament on September 12 was revised to
 once again include these rights. Many groups have criticized the law for not ad-
 dressing sexual harassment and violence against women in the workplace, and for
 providing inadequate protection in areas of employment where women have regu-
 larly suffered abuse, such as overseas employment and household service. The law
 is expected to take effect in October 1998.
 Women disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and inadequate nu-
 trition. The P resident called for expanded efforts to reduce the high maternal mor-
 tality rate, which is 425 per 100,000 live births, according to official figures, and
 up to 650 according to estimates from other sources. The Government launched the
 "mother fiendly movement" in December 1996 to address maternal mortality, and
 is currently expanding its scope to cover more districts. According to current U.N.
 data, two-thirds of Indonesian women are anemic, and 24 percent of women of re-
 productive age suffer from chronic energy deficiency. Women's educational indica-
 tors have improved in the last decade. The number of girls graduating from high
 school tripled from 1980 to 1990.
 A growingnumber of NGO's are working to advance women's legal, economic, so-
 cial, and political rights. They have had some success in gaining official cognizance
 of women s concerns. There was an increase in the number of conferences, seminars,
 and workshops connected with women's issues. Most were sponsored by NGO's, al-
 though some were organized by academic institutions and by the Government. Most
 sessions sought to raise awareness or promote advocacy for women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare, but is
 hampered by a lack of resources that prevents it from translating this commitment
 into practice. The Government allocates only 2.2 percent of gross national product
 to education. A 1979 law on children's welfare defines the responsibility of the State
 and parents to nurture and protect children. However, the law's provisions on pro-
 tection of children have yet to go into effect because implementing regulations are
 still being negotiated. The Government has made particular efforts to improve pri-
 mary education and maternity services.
 Low cost medical care is available, although access and availability is sometimes
 sporadic, especially in rural areas. Moreover, the Government commits only 0.7 per-
 cent of GNP to the health sector. According to U.N. data, 36 percent of children
 under 5 years of age suffer from protein-energy malnutrition, and 35 percent suffer
 from iron deficiency.
 Although primary education is in principle universal, the United Nations Chil-
 dren's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that more than 1 million children drop out of pri-
 mary school every year due mainly to the costs associated with education and the
 need for the children to supplement family income. A 1994 law raised compulsory
 education from 6 to 9 years, but the law has not been fully implemented due to in-
 adequate school facilities and the lack of family financial resources to support chil-
 dren staying in school. Official and unofficial fees for public education, including
 payments for registration, books, meals, transport, and uniforms have risen to pro-
 hibitively high levels for many families.
 According to government statistics, 8 percent of all children between the ages of
 10 and 14 work. Half go to school and also work, and half work exclusively. Unoffi-
 cial estimates of working children are higher. According to the Ministry of Social
 Affairs, 20,000 street children live in Jakarta. Thousands more live in other cities.
 They sell newspapers, shine shoes, help to park or watch cars, and otherwise at-
 tempt to earn money. Many children work under hazardous conditions as scav-
 engers and garbage pickers, and on fishing platforms and fishing boats. According
 
 
 790
 to credible sources, there are several thousand children working in hazardous condi-
 tions on fishing platforms off the east coast of North Sumatra (see Section 6.c.).
 Many thousands work in factories and fields (see Section 6.d.).
 Street children and child laborers in some cities have become organized and inter-
 ested in protecting their rights. At least 30 NGO's work with street children. NGO's
 have criticized the Government for making insufficient and inadequate efforts to
 help street children and working children. The Government is working in coopera-
 tion with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), UNICEF, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO), and with NGO's to create programs for street
 children and child laborers. One project incorporates many ideas generated by the
 NGO community, including establishing "open houses" in targeted areas that pro-
 vide vocational training and basic education to street children. Efforts have been ini-
 tiated to start open houses for street children in seven provinces.
 Another approach to the street children problem utilizes the National Program for
 Discipline and Clean Cities Decree. The street children are physically removed from
 cities by bus. Usually, they are taken outside the city and left there. Sometimes
 they are taken to "holding houses" where they are first interrogated and later re-
 leased. Unlike past years, there were no reports that NGO's working for the rights
 of children experienced harassment by the authorities.
 Child prostitution and other sexual abuses occur, but firm data are lacking. While
 there are laws designed to protect children from indecent activities, prostitution,
 and incest, the Government has made no special enforcement efforts in these areas.
 A separate criminal justice system for juveniles does not exist. Police officials
 admit that juveniles are often imprisoned with adult offenders. Juvenile crime is
 currently handled by ordinary courts. A juvenile justice law was passed by Par-
 liament in December 1996, and was signed by the President in January. However,
 it does not come into effect until January 1998. It defines juveniles as children be-
 tween the ages of 8 and 18, and establishes a special court system and Criminal
 Code for them.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 in some parts of Indonesia. The method varies depending on ethnic, cultural and
 religious tradition. However, the most prevalent practice is a ceremonial one that
 involves the pricking, scraping, or touching of the clitoris of a baby or young girl,
 often with the purpose of drawing several drops of blood. Sometimes, a plant root
 is used symbolically and the girl is not touched. A more serious form of FGM in-
 volves the removal of the tip of the clitoris. This practice appears to be declining,
 and there is disagreement about how widely practiced it is. It reportedly still is
 practiced in Madura, South Sulawesi, and other areas. Since FGM is not regulated,
 and no formal position has been taken by religious leaders, the method used is often
 left up to the individual local traditional practitioner. FGM usually takes place with-
 in the first year after birth, often on the 40th day, though it is done in some areas
 up to age 10. It is performed either at a hospital or, especially in rural areas, by
 the local traditional practitioner. There are no statistics available on FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-According to U.N. estimates, there are 10 million dis-
 abled persons in the country, while the Ministry of Social Affairs estimates that 3
 percent of the population, or 6 million persons are disabled. However, there are no
 precise statistics. Families often hide their disabled family members to avoid social
 stigma or embarrassment. The disabled face considerable discrimination in employ-
 ment, although some factories have made special efforts to hire disabled workers.
 Several provinces have established "rehabilitation centers" for the disabled. Dis-
 abled persons are reportedly taken off the streets by the authorities and brought
 to these centers for job training.
 NGO's are the primary providers of education for the disabled. There are cur-
 rently 1,084 schools for the disabled; 680 are private, and 404 are government
 schools. Of the government schools 165 are "integrated," serving both regular and
 special education students. In Jakarta there are 98 schools for the disabled, 2 of
 which are government-run, and 96 of which are private. The Government also runs
 three national schools for the visually, hearing, and mentally disabled. These
 schools accept children from throughout the country.
 A Disability Law was passed in January. Implementing regulations have not been
 issued, so the impact of the law remains unclear. The law strives to provide access
 to education, employment, and assistance for the disabled. It requires companies
 employing over 100 people to give 1 percent of the jobs to the disabled. The law
 mandates accessibility for the disabled to public facilities. Virtually no buildings or
 public transportation have been designed with such accessibility in mind.
 The Constitution requires that the Government provide care for orphans and the
 disabled, but does not specify how the term "care" should be defined, and the provi-
 
 
 791
 sion of education to all mentally and physically disabled children has never been
 inferred. Regulations spcify that the Government establish and regulate a national
 curriculum for special education by stipulating that the "community" provide special
 education services to its children.
 Indigenous People.-The Government considers the term "indigenous peple" to be
 a misnomer, because it considers all Indonesians to be indigenous. Nonetheless, it
 publicly recognizes the existence of several "isolated communities," and that they
 have a right to participate fully in political and social life. The Government esti-
 mates that the number of people in isolated communities is 1.5 million. This in-
 cludes, but is not limited to, groups such as the Dayak population in Kalimantan
 who live in remote forest areas, indigenous communities throughout Irian Jaya, and
 economically disadvantaged families living as sea nomads on boats near Riau in
 East Sumatra and near Ujung Pandang in southern Sulawesi. Critics maintain that
 the Government's approach is basically paternalistic and designed more to integrate
 indigenous people into society than to protect their traditional way of life. Human
 rights monitors criticize the Government's transmigration program for violating the
 rights of indigenous people.
 Sixty percent of the population of 200 million live in Java, which represents only
 7 percent of the country's territory. The government-sponsored transmigration pro-
 gram seeks to resettle people from densely populated areas to sparsely populated
 areas outside Java. The majority of migrants are spontaneous migrants who are not
 part of the official program. The current 5-year development plan calls for 600,000
 families to be resettled, with 80,000 planned for the 1997-98 fiscal year.
 Critics of transmigration claim that it often threatens indigenous cultures and
 sparks social envy. Some critics claim that it has been used as a political tool to
 inject nonindigenous people into certain areas to "Indonesianize" these areas, in
 part to preclude secessionist movements. In some areas, such as in certain parts of
 Kalimantan, East Timor and Irian Jaya, relations between transmigrants and indig-
 enous people are hostile. Complaints about transmigration come from indigenous
 groups receiving less government support and funding than transmigrants, and
 from transmigrants, who are in some cases moved to areas with inadequate infra-
 structure to support them and less than desirable land.
 There were protracted outbreaks of serious rioting between ethnic groups in West
 Kalimantan in late December 1996, and in January and February when thousands
 of largely Christian Dayak tribesmen attacked immigrant Muslim Madurese. Hun-
 dreds, possibly over 1,000 persons, primarily Madurese, died in the fighting, and an
 estimated 15,000 Madurese fled the violence. The explosion of violence, the sixth
 Dayak-Madurese confrontation in the past 30 years, grew partly out of Dayak per-
 ception that they were being marginalized in their native lands. The Madurese com-
 munity in West Kalimantan grew around an earlier core of transmigrants, although
 the majority of Madurese are spontaneous immigrants.
 The Government's emphasis on relatively rapid growth and development strate-
 gies, burgeoning urbanization, and aggressive government-backed commercial ex-
 ploitation of natural resources results in continued tension over land tenure issues.
 That tension is often expressed along racial/ethnic lines as developers are frequently
 ethnic Chinese Indonesians. Land disputes represent the largest category of com-
 plaints submitted to the National Human Rights Commission and a significant por-
 tion of the cases brought to legal aid foundations and other legal assistance organi-
 zations.
 According to a law derived from Dutch practices, all subsurface mineral resources
 belong to the Government. The Basic Agrarian Law states that land rights cannot
 be "in conflict with national and state interests," which provides the Government
 with a brad legal basis for land seizures. When disputes cannot be settled the Gov-
 ernment has the authority to define fair compensation for land.
 There are numerous instances of the use of intimidation, sometimes by the mili-
 tary, and often by hired "thugs," to acquire land for development projects, particu-
 larly in areas claimed by indigenous people. Such intimidation has been used in Ja-
 karta, other p arts of Java, North Sumatra, Aceh, and other areas. Compensation
 paid for the land is often minimal or even nonexistent. In one case, according to.
 credible sources, residents living in an area needed for a new cement factory in Aceh
 were paid less than the equivalent of 20 centsper square meter of land, which they
 felt was inadequate compensation. In July residents of Magelang, Central Java com-
 plained   t he regional parliament about the military taking over their land for mili-
 tary use. The complaint alleges that local residents were coerced, visited at night
 by military and local authorities, and told to accept $2.00 per square meter for their
 land, which they saw as insufficient compensation.
 NGO's assert that violations of the rights of indigenous people are frequent in
 mining and logging areas, and state that violations stem from the State's denial of
 
 
 ownership by indigenous people of ancestral land, denial of social structure, and
 forced takeover of land. These problems are most prevalent in Irian Jaya and
 Kalimantan.
 NGO's report that local people have suffered as a result of a project in Central
 Kalimantan to turn one million hectares of peat land into agricultural land for rice
 cultivation. The site is designated as a major transmigration area. According to
 credible sources, 100,000 indigenous people are affected by the project. Forced to
 cease their traditional farming and forest-based livelihoods, many indigenous people
 living in the area have become poorly paid laborers on the project.
 Local residents in the isolated Tanimbar islands in southeast Maluku staged fu-
 tile protests against the destruction of forests, fauna, and local tribal cultures pri-
 marily due to logging.
 Where indigenous people clash with development projects, the developers almost
 always win. Decisions regarding development projects, resource-use concessions, and
 other economic activities are generally carried out without the participation or in-
 formed consent of the affected communities. Unlike in past years, there were no re-
 ports that environmental NGO's that sought to aid these communities were sub-
 .jeted to verbal attacks, raids, and other forms of intimidation by government secu-
 rity forces.
 Tensions with indigenous people in Iran Jaya, including in the vicinity of a for-
 eign mining concession area near Timika, continued. Indigenous Irian Jaya resi-
 dents complain of racism, religious bias, paternalism, and condescension as constant
 impediments to better relations with non-Irianese people, including members of the
 Government, the military and the non-Irianese business community. They also com-
 plain of abusive behavior by the security forces. A large percentage of the population
 of h-ian Jaya is now made up of migrants, who are economically and politically dom-
 inant. Most civil servants in local governments in Irian Jaya and other isolated
 areas continue to come primarily from other parts of Indonesia, rather than from
 the local indigenous population.
 The anticipated distribution of funds from a foreign mining company created ten-
 sions that helped lead to a clash between tribal groups and security forces in August
 in the Timika-Tembagapura area, which led to the shooing deaths of two Irianese
 and injuries to security forces (see Section l.a.). At about the same time, two groups
 supporting rival leaders of the Moni tribal group held demonstrations over their
 claims to part of the funds from the foreign mining company, and then later massed
 together near the office of the local district leader to press their demands. Credible
 NGO sources report that bystanders to this event were assaulted by security forces.
 Due to local protests over how the funds would be allocated, the company suspended
 disbursements for new projects under this initiative.
 Religious Minorit ies.-There were a number of incidents of attacks against
 churches, temples, and other religious facilities, many of which occurred in the
 midst of larger riots. There were also instances of preaching and publications
 against Christians, which led to concerns that the societal support for religious tol-
 erance was under pressure. Underlying socioeconomic and political tensions, in
 many instances between poor Muslims and well-to-do ethnic Chinese Christians,
 were key factors in such incidents. The Government has not fully resolved many
 cases of attacks on religious facilities and churches that occurred during riots, and
 in other cases has not investigated at all.
 During February, the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, many churches around
 the country reportedly received threatening phone calls or faxes from unknown
 gro ups warning of future destruction on specific dates. While there were incidents
 of church burnings an         during this period, the widespread attacks that were
 threatened did not materialize. Nevertheless, the threats caused fear in many
 Christian communities. Sources in Medan, North Sumatra reported that local resi-
 dents, in one case with the help of the armed forces, guarded churches during these
 periods. A Catholic church in Bandung, a Mormon church in Semarang, and church-
 es in Jakarta, among others, received threats. Reliable sources reported that Catho-
 lic communities were treatened with violence in a town in Central Java, but a local
 interreligious meeting served to defuse tensions. There were credible reports of
 threats against Christians and ethnic Chinese in the central Javanese towns of
 Purwokerto and Purworedjo during this time as well. Reliable sources reported that
 many churches that were threatened were guarded by church groups and local alli-
 ances of Christian and Muslim youth.
 A Catholic school in Ambon was burned in February, but local residents described
 it as an unusual occurrence in Ambtn, where relations between religious and ethnic
 groups are said to be generally good. A church in Garut, West Java was burned on
 February 22, and another was destroyed there on March 6.
 
 
 793
 There were several instances of mob violence that included attacks on churches,
 other religious facilities, and Chinese-owned businesses. Rioting and church burn-
 ings occurred in Rengesdengklok West Java in January, in which five churches
 were destroyed by mob violence. The incident was sparked after a confrontation be-
 tween a Chinese woman and local Muslim youths. The rioting that followed caused
 widespread damage to churches. Two Buddhist temples were also damaged or
 burned.
 There were credible reports of church burning and damage to churches and Chris-
 tian schools during the year. For example, there were two incidents in Garut, West
 Java, during which one church was burned in February and another was wrecked
 in March. There were stone throwing incidents at two churches in Wonosobo, Cental
 Java and four churches in Surabaya, Central Java in March and April. A church
 in Ngawi, Central Java was wrecked in March; a Pentecostal church in Tuban, East
 Java was burned in May; a Pentecostal church in Manado, North Sulawesi was
 wrecked in May; and a church in Bogor was destroyed in May.
 There were also credible reports of church burning andchurch destruction in
 many cities on May 23, the last day of the election campaign, including: 13 churches
 burned or wrecked in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan; 5 churches wrecked in
 Pasuruan, East Java; 1 church wrecked in Kudus, Central Java; 7 churches wrecked
 in the area surrounding Jakarta; and 1 church wrecked in Madura, East Java. A
 Protestant church in Jakarta, which was stoned twice during the last week of the
 campaign, was burned on May 23.
 After the election campaign, tensions eased but there were more churches at-
 tacked: 1 church was burned in Madura in June; 1 church was burned in Bogor,
 West Java in July; 1 church was burned in Kediri, East Java in July; 1 church in
 South Kalimantan was burned in August; 1 church was wrecked in Gorontalo,
 North Sulawesi in September; a number of churches and Catholic schools were at-
 tacked during rioting in Ujung Pandang, South Sulawesi in September, 1 church in
 Jember, East Java was attacked in October; 1 church was attacked in Blitar, East
 Java in October and 2 others were burned in November; in Yogyakarta, 1 church
 was burned and another was wrecked in November.
 Many of the churches that were burned or damaged during the October 1996
 Situbondo riot were successfully rebuilt with cooperation between Christian and
 Muslim communities.
 An interreligious alliance of national student and youth groups called the Nation-
 ality Forum for Indonesian Youth, was formed in February, in part as a response
 to increased tensions following the Situbondo riot and church buraings in October
 1996, to provide a forum for cooperation between religious groups and for commu-
 nication to the grass roots to prevent further unrest. This group includes organiza-
 tions representing Muslim (Nahdlatul Ulama), Protestant, Catholic, and Hindu
 youth.
 National IRacal/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government officially promotes racial
 and ethnic tolerance. Ethnic Chinese, at approximately 3 percent of the population
 by far the largest nonindigenous minority group, have historically played a major
 role in the economy. They are the target of discrimination. Anti-Chinese sentiment
 has led to attacks on Chinese-owned businesses during periods of social unrest, as
 was seen during the Rengesdenklok riot in January and the Ujung Pandang riots
 in September. widespread anti-Chinese rioting in Ujung Pandang, South Sulawesi
 was sparked by the act of a mentally ill Indonesian of Chinese descent who killed
 a 9-year-old on a city street. The incident sparked several days of rioting in which
 6 people reportedly died, and over 1,000 shops were reportedly damaged, as were
 a number of Chinese-owned banks and a hotel. Most of the destroyed property was
 targeted because of Chinese connections. Chinese temples were attacked, and the
 most historic local temple was destroyed.
 Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to run busi-
 nesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations prohibit the operation of Chinese schools, for-
 mation of exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and public dis-
 play of Chinese characters, although Chinese characters are seen on some products.
 The Government permits the publication of one government-owned Chinese-lan-
 guage daily newspaper, otherwise legislation bans the import, sale or distribution
 of Chinese-language material. However, Chinese-language materials have begun to
 ap pear in Chinese neighborhoods in Jakarta and possibly elsewhere. Since 1994 the
 Government has allowed Chinese-language instruction for employees in the tourism
 industry, and has allowed distribution of locally printed Chinese-language tourist
 brochures, programs, and similar material to Chinese speaking tourists.
 Private instruction in Chinese is generally prohibited but takes place to a limited
 extent. The University of Indonesia offers Chinese-language courses. State univer-
 sities have informal quotas that limit the number of ethnic Chinese students. The
 
 
 794
 law forbids the celebration of the Chinese New Year in temples or public places, but
 enforcement is limited. Chinese New Year decorations were prominently displayed
 and sold in public shopping areas in at least a few cities. In June a senior official
 in charge of ethnic integration was quoted in the press as saying that the ban on
 Chinese-language publications should not be hastily relaxed, due to racial concerns.
 East Timorese and various human rights groups charge that the East Timorese
 are underrepresented in the civil service in East Timor. The Government has made
 some efforts to recruit more civil servants in both East Timor and Irian Jaya, and
 there has been some increase in the number of civil servant trainees for these two
 provinces, despite a "no growth" policy for the civil service as a whole. East Timor-
 ese have expressed concerns that the transmigration program (see Section 1.f.) could
 lead to fewer emploment opportunities and might eventually destroy East Timor's
 cultural identity. The Government said that the transmigration program in East
 Timor focused mostly on resettlement of Timorese, with a much smaller portion of
 predominantly Christian and Hindu non-Timorese coming in from outside. In the
 last several years, informal, predominantly Muslim migration to the province has
 sparked socioeconomic tension in urban areas, provoking even greater concern than
 the formally sponsored transmigration program.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Private sector workers are by law free to form work-
 er organizations without prior authorization. However, government policies and nu-
 merical requirements for union recognition constitute a significant barrier to free-
 dom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining. The Department
 of Manpower uses a regulation that requires that a union be set up "by and for
 workers" to deny recognition to groups that include people it considers nonworkers,
 such as lawyers or human rights activists, who are involved as labor organizers.
 Under a new Law on Manpower Affairs that the Parliament passed in September,
 workers may form unions on the basis of "democratic consultation" with other work-
 ers in the same company, and may join with other unions to form sectoral and inter-
 sectoral federations. The new law does not take effect until October 1, 1998, and
 requires implementing regulations.
 There is a de facto single union system, the All-Indonesian Trade Union (SPSI)
 and its 13 federated sectoral unions. The SPSI completed in 1995 a transformation
 from a unitary (centralized) to a federative (decentralized) structure. Its 13 indus-
 trial sectors are registered as separate national unions; the SPSI is the only trade
 union federation recognized by the Department of Manpower. The Minister of Man-
 power has stated that any unions that are formed should affiliate with the SPSI
 federation, and that the Government would not recognize any unions outside the
 federation. The Government's stated policy is to improve effectiveness of the recog-
 nized SPSI unions rather than to allow the formation of alternative organizations.
 The Government may dissolve a union if it believes that the union is acting
 against Pancasila, although it has never actually done so, and there are no laws or
 regulations specifying procedures for union dissolution.
 Until 1994 only the SPSI could legally bargain on behalf of employees or rep-
 resent workers in the Department of Manpbwer's labor courts. A 1994 regulation
 provides that workers in a single company with more than 25 employees can join
 together as a "plant-level union" and negotiate a legally binding agreement with
 their employer outside the SPSI framework, although the Government encourages
 these plant-level unions to join the SPSI. By year's end, 1,234 plant-level unions had
 been established, reflecting a small increase during the year. NGO's have charged,
 however, that many of these unions are "yellow unions' formed by company man-
 agement with little or no worker participation. There were also credible reports that
 local Department of Manpower officials have accepted payments from employers to
 set up plant-level unions in their factories because they are considered even weaker
 than the SPSI.
 Two labor groups other than the SPSI are active but not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment: the Indonesian Prosperity Trade Union (SBSI) and the Alliance of Inde-
 pendent Journalists (AJI). The SBSI, created in 1992, claims that it has formed the
 necessary number of factory-level units to meet the legal requirements for registra-
 tion as a labor union, but its most recent request (in November 1994) for registra-
 tion as a trade union was denied. The Department of Manpower has also blocked
 SBSI attempts to register with the Department of Home Affairs as a social organiza-
 tion under the ORMAS Law. The Government considers the SBSI to be illegal. Al-
 though the Government has not disbanded it, it continues to harass the SBSI by
 disbanding its meetings and training seminars and pressuring companies to fire its
 members. Specific government actions against the SBSI during the year included
 the detention and interrogation of two members in Binjai, North Sumatra in May
 
 
 and the breaking up of an SBSI training session in Lampung, southern Sumatra
 in July, during which 26 SBSI members were detained for 2 days. In September po-
 lice broke up the SBSrs second national congress as union members were conclud-
 ing the first day of a scheduled 3-day meeting.
 The trial of SBSI leader Muchtar Pakpahan on charges of subversion and sowing
 hatred against the Government, which began in December 1996, resumed in Sep-
 tember aer a 5-month suspension due to Pakpahan's ill health. While the trial was
 suspended, Pakpahan made two requests for medical examination and treatment of
 a lung tumor outside the country. After government-appointed panels of physicians
 examined him in each instance, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General ruled
 that his condition could be treated in Indonesia. In December the Government per-
 mitted a team of Canadian doctors to examine him. In January Pakpahan requested
 that the Supreme Court review its October 1996 decision requiring him to serve out
 a 4-year sentence for fomenting labor unrest a decision that the Court had pre-
 viously overturned. In August Pakpahan presented new arguments to a lower court
 that he was innocent of the charges; the case was still pending at year's end (see
 Section 2.a.).
 The Association of Indonesian Journalists (PWI) is the only government-sanc-
 tioned organization representing journalists. Although press laws stipulate that all
 journalists must belong to the PWI, a few journalists have chosen not to join. In
 the wake of the 1994 banning of three publications, approximately 80 journalists
 formed the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) as an alternative to the gov-
 ernment union. A government crackdown in March 1995 resulted in the imprison-
 ment of three AJI members charged with "sowing hate." They were released during
 the year (see Section 2.a.). Despite occasional pressure on publications employing
 AJI members, the Government allows AJI a continued unofficial existence.
 Because of past Department of Manpower regulations, many SPSI factory units
 are led by persons who have little credibility with their units' members because they
 were selected by employers. A 1995 regulation states that employees must only no-
 tify their employer that they wish to form a union and that they may proceed if
 they do not receive a response from their employer within 2 weeks. Despite this pro-
 vision, strikes continue to occur when employers attempt to prevent the formation
 of union branches. Tfse strikes are generally successful, and the formation of an
 SPSI unit follows shortly thereafter. However, workers who are active in the forma-
 tion of the union are frequently dismissed and have no practical protection by either
 law or government practice.
 Civil servants are not permitted to join unions and must belong to KORPRI a
 nonunion association whose Central Development Council is chaired by the Minister
 of Home Affairs. State enterprise employees, defined to include those working in en-
 terprises in which the State has a 5-percent holding or greater, usually are required
 to join KORPRI, but a small number of state enterprises have SPSI units. Teachers
 must belong to the Teachers' Association (PGRI). While technically classed as a
 union, the PGRI continues to function more as a welfare organization and does not
 appear to have engaged in trade union activities such as collective bargaining. Man-
 datory KORPRI and PGRI contributions are deducted automatically from teachers'
 salaries.
 Unions may draw up their own constitutions and rules and elect their representa-
 tives. However, the Government has a great deal of influence over the SPSI and its
 federated unions. The head of the SPSI and many members of the Executive Council
 are also members of GOLKAR and its constituent functional groups. These persons
 have been given positions in the federated industrial sector unions. The Minister of
 Manpower iS a member of the sPSrs Consultative Council.
 The Government announced late in 1995 its intention to relax a regulation requir-
 ing police approval for all meetings of five or more people of all organizations out-
 side offices or normal work sites (see Section 2.b.). However, in practice this regula-
 tion continues to apply to union meetings. Permission was routinely given to the
 SPSI, but not to rival organizations such as the SBSI.
 In 1994 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions lodged a formal
 omlaint against Indonesia with the ILO, accusing the Government of denying
 workera, the right to set up unions of their own choosing, harassing independent
 workers' organizations, and of taking other actions contrary to ILO standards on
 freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In November the Com-
 mittee acknowledged receipt of information from the Indonesian Government in re-
 sponse to earlier requests, but reported that it remained "deeply concerned" by "seri-
 ous and worsening infringements of basic human and trade union rights." The Com-
 mittee urged the Indonesian Government to eliminate impediments to the registra-
 tion of unions, including the SBSI, to institute an independent judicial inquiry into
 
 
 796
 the homicide of Marsinah, to drop criminal charges against Pakpahan and to have
 him released, and to provide information on. .. other cases."
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management differences to be settled by
 consensus, all organized workers except civil servants have the legal right to strike.
 State enterprise employees and teachers rarely exercise this right, but private sector
 strikes are frequent. Before a strike can occur legally in the private sector, the law
 requires intensive mediation by the Department of Manpower and prior notice of the
 intent to strike. However, no approval is required. The manpower law passed in
 September, which is not yet in effect, allows strikes only if an industrial 'dispute
 cannot be resolved by the concerned parties or through the industrial dispute resolu-
 tion process. The law requires that striking workers be paid if they are striking to
 obtain benefits determined by law, regulation, a collective bargaining agreement, or
 company regulations.
 In practice, dispute settlement procedures are rarely followed, and formal notice
 of the intent to strike is rarely 'ven because Department of Manpower procedures
 are slow and have little credibility with workers. Therefore, sudden strikes tend to
 result from longstanding grievances or recognition that legally mandated benefits or
 rights are not being received. According to the Department of Manpower Statistics,
 there were 226 strikes involving 141,968 workers during the fir-st 11 months of the
 year, a significant decrease from 1996. However, in 1997 the Government only
 counted work stoppages in which at least a full day's production was lost as strikes.
 Shorter work stoppages ("unjuk rasa") are much more frequent, but the Government
 kept no official count of them in 1997. In information provided to the ILO Commit-
 tee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the Government re-
 ported that there were 890 strikes involving 500,000 workers in 1996. NGO's believe
 that the number of strikes and workers involved was higher than this. The largest
 concentration of strikes occurred following the implementation of the new minimum
 wage in April, and involved tens of thousands of workers. The largest single strike
 took place in November and involved 40,000 workers at a cigarette factory in East
 Java. Four strikes during the year are known to have resulted in damage to fac-
 tories.
 The SPSI maintains international contacts but its only international trade union
 affiliation as a federation is the Association of Seutheast Asian Nations Trade Union
 Council. Several of the SPSIs federated sectoral unions are members of inter-
 national trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for by law, and the Department of Manpower promotes it within the context
 of the national ideology, Pancasila. Until 1994 only recognized trade unions-the
 SPSI and its components-could legally engage in collective bargaining. Since early
 1994, government regulations also permit unaffiliated plant-level workers' associa-
 tions to conclude legally binding agreements with employers, and some 732 had
 done so by the end of 1996, according to government figures. Agreements concluded
 by any other groups are not considered legally binding and are not registered by
 the Department of Manpower. Once notified that 25 employees have joined a reg-
 istered SPSI or independent plant-level union, an employer is obligated to bargain
 with it.
 In companies without unions, the Government discourages workers from utilizing
 nongovernment outside assistance, e.g., during consultations with employers over
 company regulations. Instead, the Department of Manpower prefers that workers
 seek its assistance and believes that its role is to protect workers. There are credible
 reports that for many companies, consultations are perfunctory at best and usually
 with management-selected workers; there are also credible reports to the contrary
 from foreign companies. According to government statistics, approximately 80 per-
 cent of the factory-level SPSI units have collective bargaining agreements. The de-
 gree to which these agreements are freely negotiated between unions and manage-
 ment without government interference varies. By regulation, negotiations must be
 concluded within 30 days or be submitted to the Department of Manpower for medi-
 ation and conciliation or arbitration. Most negotiations are concluded within the 30-
 day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can be extended for 1 year. The new
 Manpower Law, which is expected to take effect late in 1998, specifies no time limit
 on negotiations, but requires that the union negotiating the contract be supported
 by a majority of workers in the concerned company.
 According to NGO's involved in labor issues, in current practice the provisions of
 collective bargaining agreements rarely go beyond the legal minimum standards es-
 tablished by the Government, and the agreements are often merely presented to
 worker representatives for signing rather than being negotiated. The SPSI stated
 in September that of 23,525 collective bargaining agreements signed between em-
 ployers and workers, 10,776 of these agreements were only "imitation" agreements
 
 
 797
 because they were concluded in companies where workers were not represented by
 a union. Although government regulations prohibit employers from discriminating
 against or harassing employees because of union membership, there are credible re-
 ports from union officials of employer retribution against union organizers, including
 firing, which is not effectively prevented or remedied in practice. Some employers
 reportedly have warned their employees against contact with union organizers from
 the unrecognized SBSI organization. Charges of antiunion discrimination are adju-
 dicated by regional and national labor dispute resolution committees, and their deci-
 sions can be appealed to the State Administrative Court. In September the State
 Administrative Court reversed a National Labor Dispute Resolution Board ruling
 that ordered the Hong Kong Bank to reinstate 166 union members who went on
 strike, despite government regulations making it illegal to fire workers solely for
 striking or other union activity. Decisions such as this lead many union members
 to believe that the dispute resolution committees generally side with employers. As
 a result, workers frequently present their grievances directly to the National
 Human Rights Commission, Parliament, and nongovernmental organizations. Ad-
 ministrative decisions in favor of dismissed workers tend to be monetary awards;
 workers are rarely reinstated. The law requires that employers obtain the approval
 of the labor dispute resolution committee before firing workers, but the law is often
 ignored in practice. The new manpower law, which takes effect in late 1998, re-
 quires only that employers consult with concerned workers and their unions about
 their intention to terminate the workers' employment.
 Commenting on antiunion discrimination and restrictions on the right to organize
 and bargain collectively, the June report of the ILO's Committee on the Application
 of Conventions and Recommendations "observed with deep concern that the discrep-
 ancies between the Convention on the one hand, and legislation and national prac-
 tice on the other, have continued for many years." The Committee also observed
 that "the Government had not given sufficient proof of a willingness to comply" with
 the provisions of ILO Convention 98, "as it has not requested technical assistance
 in this respect." The Committee expressed its deep concern over this situation and
 asked the Government urgently to amend the legislation and report on the meas-
 ures taken or envisaged in this respect. The Committee urged the Government to
 ensure full respect of the civil liberties essential for the full implementation of the
 Convention.
 On June 1, 1996, the Minister of Manpower issued a new regulation permitting
 unions affiliated with the SPSI to collect union dues directly through the checkoff
 system, rather than having the Department of Manpower collect dues and transfer
 them to the SPSI. Implementation of this system during the year was uneven. Some
 workplace units of the SPSI reported that they were receiving dues collected
 through the checkoff system from their employers. Other workplace units reported
 that their companies refused to release dues to the union and continued to deposit
 dues into Department of Manpower accounts. Department of Manpower officials
 state that the Department instructed its regional offices to close accounts previously
 used for union dues, but according to reports from various regions, not all offices
 had carried out this instruction. Union officials at SFSI headquarters stated that
 not all local branches of the unions are sending a portion of dues collected to re-
 gional and central headquarters as provided in the SPSrs by-laws.
 The police, as well as the military, continue to involve themselves in labor issues,
 despite the Minister of Manpower's revocation in 1994 of a 1986 regulation allowing
 the military to intervene in strikes and other labor actions. A 1990 decree giving
 the Agency for Coordination of National Stability (BAKORSTANAS) authority to in-
 tervene in strikes in the interest of political and social stability remains in effect.
 Union and NGO observers note a shift over the pest 2 to 3 years from open inter-
 vention and demonstrations of force by uniformed troops to less visible measures.
 Union activists complain that both police and local military representatives harass
 and occasionally detain union leaders and seize materials from union offices without
 warrants. In addition, police frequently block or break up meetings between union
 organizers or NGO representatives and workers, especially meetings organized by
 the SBSI. However, the most common form of military involvement in labor matters,
 according to union and NGO representatives, is a longstanding pattern of collusion
 between police and military representatives and employers, which usually takes the
 form of intimidation of workers by security personnel in civilian dress. Employer
 and union representatives have also complained about the "invisible costs" of cor-
 ruption, which they and others estimate constitute up to 30 percent of a company's
 expenses.
 Labor law and practice are the same in export processing zones as in the rest of
 the country.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor, and
 the Government generally enforces it. The Government prohibits forced and bonded
 labor by children but does not always enforce this effectively. There are credible re-
 ports that several thousand children are forced to work on fishing platforms off the
 east coast of North Sumatra in conditions of bonded labor. Most are recruited from
 farming communities, and once they arrive at the work site miles offshore, they are
 held as virtual prisoners and are not permitted to leave for at least 3 months and
 until a replacement worker can be found. Children receive average monthly wages
 of $17 to $32, well below the regional minimum wage. They live in isolation on the
 sea, work 12 to 20 hours per day in often dangerous conditions, and sleep in the
 workspace with no access to sanitary facilities. There are reports of physical, verbal,
 and sexual abuse of the children.
 There were reports that the military forced villagers to perform uncompensated
 labor in Irian Jaya; the military denied such reports (see Section 2.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor exists in both urban and rural areas, and in both the formal an informal sec-
 tors. According to a 1995 report of the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, 4
 percent of children between the ages of 10 and 14 work full-time, and another 4 per-
 cent work part-time in addition to going to school. The 1994 government labor force
 survey reported that there were 2.08 million children age 10 to 14 in the labor force,
 but many observers believe that number to be significantly understated, because
 documents verifying age are easily falsified, and because children under 10 were not
 included.
 Indonesia was one of the first countries to be selected for participation in the
 ILO's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC), and it
 signed a memorandum of understanding with the ILO in 1992 to guide collaboration
 under this program. The Government and the ILO signed another memorandum of
 understanding on child labor in March committing to promote conditions to enable
 the Government to protect working children and progressively prohibit, restrict and
 regulate child labor with a view to its ultimate elimination." Although the ILO has
 sponsored training of labor inspectors on child labor matters under the IPEC pro-
 gram, enforcement remains lax.
 The Government acknowledges that there is a class of children who must work
 for socioeconomic reasons, ant in 1987 the Minister of Manpower issued a regula-
 tion, "Protection of Children Forced to Work." This regulation legalizes the employ-
 ment of children under the age of 14 who must work to contribute to the income
 of their families. It requires parental consent, prohibits dangerous or difficult work,
 limits work to 4 hours daily, and requires employers to report the number of chil-
 dren working under its provisions. It does not set a minimum age for children in
 this category, effectively superseding the colonial-era government ordinance of De-
 cember 17, 1925, on "Measures Limiting Child Labor and Nightwork of Women,"
 which is still the current law governing child labor and sets a minimum age of 12
 for employment. The 1987 regulation is not enforced. No employers have been taken
 to court for violating its restrictions on the nature of employment for children, and
 no reports are collected from establishments employing children.
 Act No. 1 of 1951 was intended to bring into force certain labor measures, includ-
 ing provisions on child labor that would replace those of the 1925 legislation. How-
 ever, implementing regulations for the child labor provisions have never been is-
 sued. Thus the child labor provisions in the 1951 act have no validity. The Govern-
 ment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this prohi-
 bition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 The new manpower law, which takes effect on October 1, 1998, prohibits employ-
 ers from hiring children under the age of 15, except that employers may hire chil-
 dren who are forced for economic reasons to work. The new law places restrictions
 similar to those in the 1987 regulation on employers hiring children. It also states
 that adolescents (ages 15 to 17) cannot work during certain hours of the night,
 below ground, in mines, or in jobs that would have an adverse effect on morality,
 such as in entertainment facilities.
 According to government labor force data, most working children work in the agri-
 cultural sector, although the number of working children in urban areas has risen
 significantly with urbanization. More child laborers work in the informal sector than
 the formal sector. Where children work in the formal sector, such work tends to
 occur on the border line between the informal and formal economies, such as along-
 side their parents in home enterprises and on plantations, and in family-owned
 shops and small factories, particularly those that are "satellites" of large industries.
 There are children working in large factories, although the number is unknown, es-
 pecially since documents verifying age are easily falsified. In the informal sector,
 they sell newspapers, shine shoes, help to park or watch cars, and otherwise earn
 
 
 money. Many children work in hazardous conditions as scavengers and garbage
 pickers, and on fishing platforms and fishing boats. Many domestic workers are fe-
 male children under age 15. Although accurate figures are unavailable, estimates
 put the number of child domestic workers at up to 1.5 million. A survey done in
 1995 revealed that these children work long hours, receive low pay, are generally
 unaware of their rights, and are often far from their families.
 A 1994 law raised compulsory education from 6 to 9 years, but the law has not
 been fuliy implemented due to inadequate school facilities and due to lack of family
 financial resources to support children staying in school.
 Some employers hire children because they are easier than adults to manage, and
 tend not to organize or make demands on employers. Children working in factories
 usually work the same number of hours as adults. Children work in the rattan and
 wood furniture industries, the garment industry, the footwear industry, food proc-
 essing, and to making, among others.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Rather,
 area wage councils working under the supervision of the National Wage Council es-
 tablish minimum wages for regions and basic needs figures for each province-a
 monetary amount considered sufficient to enable a single worker to meet the basic
 needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The Government has increased the average
 minimum wage 70 percent (when adjusted for inflation) over the past 5 years. After
 the latest increase in April, which averaged 10 percent nationwide, the average min-
 imum wage was equal to 95 percent of the government-determined "minimum living
 need." In Jakarta the minimum wage, which was about $70 (rp 172,500) per month
 at the time it went into effect, has, because of the fall in the value of the rupiah,
 become about $30 at year's end. An additional increase is expected in early 1998.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of employers paying at least the
 minimum wage. Independent observers' estimates range between 30 and 60 percent.
 Enforcement of minimum wage and other labor regulations remains inadequate, and
 sanctions too light, although the new manpower law, which is to take effect on Octo-
 ber 1, 1998, increases penalties for not paying the minimum wage from rupiah
 100,000 (about $30 at the time of enactment $18 at the end of the year) to rupiah
 200,000,000 ($60,000 at the time of enactment, $36,000 at year's end). During the
 year, according to government figures, 464 companies applied for relief from the
 minimum wage increases on the ground that they would otherwise close, and 276
 received permission for exceptions or postponements of the new wage rate.
 Labor law and ministerial regulations provide workers with a variety of other
 benefits, such as social security, and workers in more modern facilities often receive
 health benefits, free meals, and transportation. The law establishes 7- or 8-hour
 workdays and a 40-hour workweek, with one 30-minute rest period for each 4 hours
 of work. The law also requires 1 day of rest weekly. The daily overtime rate is 1 Y2
 times the normal hourly rate for the first hour, and 2 times the hourly rate for addi-
 tional overtime. Regulations allow employers to deviate from the normal work hours
 upon request to the Minister of Manpower and with the agreement of the employee.
 Workers in industries that produce retail goods for export frequently work overtime
 to fulfill contract quotas. Observance of laws regulating benefits and labor standards
 varies from sector to sector and by region. Employer violations of legal requirements
 are fairly common and often result in strikes and employee protests. The Ministry
 of Manpower continues publicly to urge employers to comply with the law. During
 the year, the Government investigated 31 companies for labor law violations, of
 which 13 were taken to court, 6 of these cases resulted in prison sentences for com-
 pany management and 6 in fines. However, in general, government enforcement and
 supervision of labor standards are weak.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health and
 safety. In January the Government announced a new occupational safety and health
 management system under which companies with more than 100 employees could
 obtain public recognition of their compliance with safety and health standards by
 submitting to a safety audit procedure. In the largely Western-operated oil sector,
 safety and health programs function reasonably well. However, in the country's
 100,000 larger registered companies outside the oil sector, the quality of occupa-
 tional health and safety programs varies greatly. The enforcement of health and
 safety standards is severely hampered by the limited number of qualified Depart-
 ment of Manpower inspectors as well as by the low level of employee appreciation
 for sound health and safety practices. Allegations of corruption on the part of in-
 spectors are common. Workers are obligated to report hazardous working conditions.
 Employers are forbidden by law from retaliating against those who do, but the law
 is not effectively enforced.
