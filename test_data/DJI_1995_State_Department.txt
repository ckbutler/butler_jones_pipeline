 DJIBOUTI
 Despite 1992 constitutional changes that permitted the creation of four political
 parties, President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for Progress
 RPP), in power since independence in 1977, continued to rule the country.
 Djibouti's two main ethnic grups are the politically predominant Issa (the tribe of
 the President, which is of Somali origin) and the Afar (who are also numerous in
 Ethiopia and Eritrea). The Afar comprise the largest single tribe in Djibouti but are
 outnumbered by the Issa and other Somali clans (Issak and Gadabursi) taken to-
 gether.
 In December 1994, the Government and the Mar-led Front for the Restoration of
 Unity and Democracy (FRUD) signed a peace accord, ending 3 years of civil war.
 As part of the accord, the Government agreed to recognize the FRD as a legitimate
 pohltical party, but the FRUD did not seek formal recognition. However, in une the
 Government named two FRUD leaders to key cabinet posts. The other two officially
 recognized opposition parties, The Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) and the Na-
 tional Democratic Party (PND), do not hold parliamentary seats, in large part be-
 cause the PND boycotted the December 1992 legislative elections. As a result, the
 RPP won all 65 parliamentary seats and, with the reelection of President Gouled
 in May 1993, now holds all significant government psts as well.

 In January the national security force and the police merged to form the 8,000-
 member National Police Force (FNP). The FNP has primary responsibility for inter-
 nal security and border control and is overseen by the Ministry of the Interior. The
 Ministry of Defense controls the army and the gendarmerie, and a small intelligence
 bureau reports directly to the President. Civilian authorities generall maintain ef-
 fective control of the security forces, but there were instances in which the security
 forces acted independently of government authority (see Sections l.a. and 1.c.), and
 some members committed a number of human rights abuses.
 Djibouti has little industry; services and commerce provide most of the national
 income, which is largely generated by the large foreign expatriate community of
 12,000, including 3,300 French soldiers, and the state-controlled maritime and com-
 mercial activities of the port of Djibouti, the airport, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti
 railroad. Only a few mineral deposits exist in the country, and the arid soil is un-
 productive-only 10 percent is pasture and 1 percent is forested. People are free to
 pursue private business interests and to hold personal and real property. That part
 of the gross national product which benefits only Djiboutians (and thus excludes the
 expatriates) is estimated at about $250 per capita.
 The Government's human rights record didnot improve despite the introduction
 of a new Constitution in 1992 and a limited multiparty political system. Citizens
 have not yet been fully allowed to change their government. The judiciary is not
 independent of the executive. The Government permitted increased freedom of the
 press but cracked down heavily on union leaders during a protracted strike trig-
 gered by the Government's austerity plan. The Government continued arbitrarily to
 arrest and detain persons beyond the 48 hours permitted by law. There were credi-
 ble reports that security forces beat criminal detainees. Discrimination against
 women persists, and the practice of female genital mutilation continued to be a
 problem, especially in rural areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were political undertones, pos-
 siblyv involving government forces, in the June assassination of Randa's religious
 er, Ali Houmed Souleh, and an associate, Said Aramis. The official newspaper
 indicated that the clerics may have been murdered because they had threatened to
 press charges against some soldiers for alleged rape. While Tadjourah's District
 Commiioner denied such a connection, others including Mohamed Houmed Souleh,
 the President of the Association for the Defense of -uman Rights and Liberties
 (ADHRL), and also the brother of the religious leader, blamed government forces
 and speculated that the killers wanted to undermine the government-sponsored
 peace process. At year's end, the Government continued to hold 11 soldiers pending
 the outcome of an official investigation.
 Also with pessible political implications, there was serious fighting in June be-
 tween former FRlD fighters, resulting in several deaths. Some former FRUD fight-
 ers reportedly had become disenchanted with the relatively slow process of their in-
 tegration into the armed forces and cof ronted another faction of ormer FRUD com-
 batants.
 b. Disappearance.-rThere were no known reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances. However, in August a group of armed men abducted five persons in
 the north. They released one of the men when he identified himself as a FRUD
 member. Government officials claimed to know the whereabouts of the other men
 but had not secured their release or provided details by yea's end. Also, in Novem-
 ber unknown persons kidnaped a traditional Afar Chief at Alalli Dada. At year's
 end, the Chiefs whereabouts remained unknown.
 c. Torture and  Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other inhu-
 man, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments. Torture is punishable by 15
 years in prison. However, there were credible reports that police and prison officials
 sometimes .beat and otherwise physically abused prisoners and detainees. In Sep-
 tember the newspaper of the opposition National Democratic Party reported that po-
 lice held PND meniber    , re ula g i for 6 days without charge. While in dte-
 tention, the police reportedly kicked, punched, and struck him with pickaxe handles.
 Before fainting, he remembered the authorities warning him, "not to contradict the
 President's will." During the government crackdown on striking teachers in Septem-
 ber, the police raided the office of the primary school teachers' union and beat union
 president Mohamed Nasser Abbas.
 The human rights group ADHRL alleges continued involvement of government
 forces in the rape of Afar women and girls.
 
 
 Prison conditions are harsh and characterized by severe overcrowding. A prison
 built for 300 persons has more than twice that many inmates, including 30 women.
 Reportedly, prisoners must pay authorities to obtain food. Reports also indicate that
 illegal aliens jailed for crimes sometimes have young children with them. In a prison
 visit, one diplomatic official saw a child under the age of 10. There were, however,
 no reports of abuses leading to the deaths of prisoners or rape of female prisoners.
 International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) staff no longer reside in Djibouti.
 When present, they normally had access to all prisoners. An ICRC representative
 from Nairbi visited the main prison in Djibouti in 1995.                   _
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1994 Penal Code stipulates that the
 State may not detain a person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's
 formal charge. Detainees may be held another 48 hours with the prior approval of
 Djibouti's public prosecutor. Persons charged with political or national security of-
 fenses may be detained as long as an investigation is underway. Nevertheless, the
 police often disregarded these procedures, normally arresting persons without war-
 rants and sometimes detaining persons for lengthy periods.
 In September work stoppages and protests related to the Government's new aus-
 terity measures prompted the police to arrest several labor leaders and an estimated
 two dozen secondary school teachers and parents of school children. Credible reports
 indicated that the authorities made at least 100 arbitrary arrests and detained some
 parents for at least 5 days.
 Among those arrested were Kamil Diraneh Hared, Secretary General of the Gen-
 eral Union of Djiboutian Workers (UGTD), Ahmed Djama Egueh, President of the
 Djiboutian Labor Union (UDT). The official newspaper reported that the two labor
 leaders were arrested for inciting mob violence and organizing illegal demonstra-
 tions (see Section 2.b.). Although the unions are formally independent, the Govern-
 ment forced the dismissal of both men from their positions. The  lice also arrested
 several members of a parents' organization, including Houssein .bleh, the group's
 president, and detained them at a police camp near the capital city.
 In October the Government arrested opposition PND leader, Aden Robleh Awaleh,
 and party spokesman Farah Ali Waber, for violating a civil order not to stage a
 demonstration. Both men subsequently received suspended 1-month sentences.
 There were no developments in the cases of alleged terrorists Awalle Guelle
 Assone and Mohamed Hassan Farah, who were arrested in 1994 for the 1990 bomb-
 ing of a cafe. The Government's investigation into their role in the attack was ongo-
 ing at year's end.
 The agreement signed with the FRUD in December 1994 granted amnesty to all
 FRUD militants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and magistrates are appointed for life terms. However, in practice the judici-
 ary is not independent although the constitutional provisions for a fair trial are gen-
 erally respected in nonpolitical cases.
 In June the Government took steps to strengthen the rule of law by disbanding
 the special State Security Court which in the past handled cases of espionage, trea-
 son, and acts threatening the public order or "the interest of the Republic" outside
 normal judicial channels. Another special court, the Superior Court of Justice, rules
 on cases of embezzlement of public funds and is theoretically empowered to try the
 President and government ministers. The Supreme Court is the only judicial body
 which can overrule decisions from the lower courts. A Constitutiona Council rules
 on the constitutionality of laws, including those related to the protection of human
 rights and civil liberties.
 The legal system is composed of legislation and executive decrees, French codified
 law adopted at independence, Shari'a (Islamic) law, and traditions of the native no-
 madic peoples. Crimes committed in urban centers are dealt with in accordance with
 French-inspired law and judicial practice in the regular courts. Civil actions may be
 brought in these courts or in the traditional courts. Shari'a law is restricted to civil
 and family matters.
 The Constitution states that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, has the
 right to legal counsel, and the right to be examined by a doctor if imprisoned. Legal
 counsel is available to the indigent in criminal and civil matters. Court cases are
 heard in public before a presiding judge and two accompanying judges. The latter
 receive assistance from two persons-assessors--who are not members of the bench,
 but who possess enough sophistication to comprehend legal proceedings. The Gov-
 ernment selects the assessors from the public at large, and credible reports indicate
 that political and ethnic affiliations may play a role in the appointment process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, correspondence, and
 
 
 75
 communications. The law also requires that the authorities obtain a warrant before
 conducting searches on private property. However, in practice the Government does
 not always obtain warrants before conducting such searches, and it monitors the
 communications of some regime opponents (see Section 1.d.).
 In October several persons were slightly injured when national police and army
 troops forcibly drove out several hundred squatters from an area in Balbala.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 The Government owns the electronic media, the most important medium for
 reaching the public, as well as the principal weekly newspaper, La Nation. The offi-
 cial media generally do not criticize the President or the Government. There are
 several opposition-run weekly and monthly publications which circulate freely and
 openly criticize the Government.
 The Government does not interfere with foreign broadcasts or prevent the dis-
 tribution of foreign publications.
 There are no specific laws or other criminal sanctions that threaten academic free-
 dom. In general, teachers may speak and conduct research without restriction as
 long as they do not violate the laws on sedition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to free assembly is
 provided for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected this right.
 However, the Ministry of Interior requires permits for peaceful assembl and mon-
 itors opposition activities. In September the authorities arrested labor leaders and
 others, in part for alleged illegal demonstrations (see Sections 1.d. and 6.a.). Some
 opposition leaders effectively practiced self-censorship and, rather than provoke a
 government crackdown, refrained from organizing popular demonstrations.
 The Constitution provides for four political parties. Nonpolitical associations must
 register with the Ministry of the Interior in accordance with a preindependence law.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim. The Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ig-
 nore Islamic teachings.
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant, Greek Or-
 thodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may per-
 form charitable works but proselytizing, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution allows freedom of movement. This right may be only
 limited by law.
 Although the insurgency is over, travel north of Tadjourah and west of Dikhil is
 prohibited without government authorization. In general, Djiboutians may travel or
 emigrate to foreign countries without restriction or interference. However, some
 Afar leaders have had their passports revoked or have been denied passports, and
 Muslim women planning to travel to certain Gulf countries may be prohibited from
 doing so unless accompanied by a spouse or an adult male.
 Djibouti hosts almost 75,000 refugees and illegal immigrants, according to govern-
 ment sources. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ac-
 knowledges only the presence of some 23,000 refugees, largely from Somalia and
 Ethiopia, resident in three main refugee camps. Since late 1994, the Government
 in cooperation with the UNHCR has been moving illegal residents to refugee camps
 for repatriation to Ethiopia. A similar repatriation of Somalis to northwest Somalia
 has been delayed because of sporadic fighting in Somaliland. An estimated 10,000
 to 18,000 Afars displaced by the civil war continue to live in Ethiopia, though not
 in refugee camps. The Government states that the Afars are welcome to return, but
 it suspects that FRUD agitators are persuading the refugees not to return home.
 Afar refugees also perceive the northern region as being unsafe.
 In March the Government expelled several hundred Ethiopians, some of whom
 had been long-term illegal residents in Djibouti.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1992 Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their
 government, in practice citizens have not yet been fully allowed to exercise this
 right. The RPP has carefully controlled the implementation of the new four-party
 system, and, with the opposition largely refusing to participate, easily ensured total
 RPP control of the legislature in 1992 and President Gouled's reelection to a fourth
 term in 1993. Many Afars, particularly supporters of the FRUD, claim that the Con-
 stitution was crafted to ensure the President's domination of virtually all aspects
 of the Government, including the legislature and judiciary.
 
 
 76
 The Government signed a peace agreement with the FRUD in December 1994
 which set the stage for the inclusion of FRUD members in senior government posts.
 In June the Government named two FRUD faction leaders who signed the peace ac-
 cord to a newly reshuffled Cabinet. Although the agreement provided for the rec-
 ognition of the FRUD as a political party, by year's end the FRUD had yet to begin
 the registration process.
 Although legally entitled to participate in the political process, women are largely
 excluded from senior positions in government and in the political parties. There are
 no women in the Cabinet or in Parliament. The highest ranking woman in the coun-
 try is Mrs. Khadija Abebe, President of the Court of Appeals. At least three other
 women serve as judges, and one is a director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has been hostile to the formation of local human rights groups.
 In the case of the Association for the Defense of Human Rights and Liberties
 (ADHRL), in 1993 the Government imprisoned its leader, Mohamed Houmed
 Souleh, after he criticized military abuses in the civil conflict, and in 1995 continued
 to deny the ADHRL recognition. Nevertheless, the ADDHL continued to function
 during the year with Souleh as its head. No other known human rights groups exist,
 and, except for the ICRC, no international human rights group visited the country
 in 1995 (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of language, race, sex, or
 religion, but discrimination against women and ethnic minorities is widespread. In
 particular, enforcement of laws to protect women and children is weak.
 Women.-Violence against women exists but does not appear to be a major prob-
 lem. The Government has been concerned abeut the problem of rape and included
 in the new 1994 Penal Code stiff sentences for rape ranging up to 20 years in pris-
 on. However, there have been no cases tried under the new Code. Zen violence
 against women does occur, it normally is dealt with within the family or clan struc-
 ture rather than in the courts. The police rarely interfere in domestic violence cases,
 and the media cover only the most extreme cases, such as murder.
 Women legally possess full civil rights, but in practice, due to traditional societal
 discrimination in education and custom, play a secondary role in public life and do
 not have the same employment opportunities as men. With only a few women in
 the professions, women are largely confined to wage employment in small trade as
 well as in the clerical and secretarial fields. Customary law discriminates against
 women in such areas as inheritance, divorce, property ownership, and travel. As the
 French-inspired Legal Code does not sanction such discrimination, educated women
 increasingly seek to defend their interests through the regular courts.
 Children.-The Government devotes virtually no public resources to the advance-
 ment of children's rights and welfare. A few charitable organizations work with chil-
 dren.
 According to an independent expert, as many as 98 percent of Djiboutian females
 7 years or older have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is widely
 condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health. In Djibouti FGM is generally performed on girls between the ages
 of 7 and 10. In 1988 the Djiboutian National Women's Union began an educational
 campaign against FGM, particularly infibulation, the most extensive and dangerous
 form o sexual mutilation. The campaign has had only marginal impact on this cus-
 tom, which is pervasive in rural areas. Judicial reforms enacted in 1991 stipulate
 that anyone found guilty of genital mutilation of young girls may face a heavy fine
 and 5 years in prison. However, the Government has not convicted anyone under
 this statute or under the provisions of the new Penal Code which entered into force
 in April and specifically prohibits FGM.
 The Government has not specifically addressed other forms of child abuse, which
 are often lightly punished. For example, when a child is raped or otherwise abused,
 the perpetrator is usually fined an amount sufficient to cover medical care given to
 the injured child. The Government has not as yet used provisions of the new Penal
 Code to deal more stiffly with other domestic violence and child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. Although disabled per-
 sons have access to education and public health facilities, there is no specific legisla-
 tion that addresses their needs, and there are no laws or regulations which prevent
 job discrimination against disabled people. The disabled find it difficult to find em-
 
 
 ployment in an economy where approximately 60 percent of the able-bodied male
 adult population is underemployed or jobless.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The Government continued to discriminate
 aainst citizens on the basis of ethnicity in terms of employment and advancement.
 e Issa (the dominant Somali clan in Djibouti) control the ruling party, the civil
 and security services, and the military. The President's subclan, the Mamassan, is
 particularly strong and wields disproportionate power in the affairs of state.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers are free to join
 unions and to strike provided they comply with legally prescribed requirements. In
 the small wage economy, about 70 percent of workers are union members, con-
 centrated in individual private or state-owned enterprises. Previously, the Govern-
 ment exerted control over individual unions by making membership mandatory in
 the state-organized labor confederation, the Goneral Union of Djibutian Workers
 (UGTD). Since 1992 unions are free to join or form other confederations. While the
 UGTD is now nominally independent of the Government, it still has close ties to
 the RPP. However, the Democratic Labor Union (UDT) has gained increasing union
 s    rt despite government harassment.
 e prescribed legal requirement for initiating a strike calls for the representa-
 tives of employees who plan to do so to contact the Interior Ministry 48 hours in
 advance. All strikes in 1995 were legal. In February secondary school teachers
 struck unsuccessfully over nonpayment of salaries and for better benefits. In Sep-
 tember civil servants and school teachers struck to protest the Government's auster-
 ity measures, including the elimination of free housing for government employees.
 Although the Labor Law prohibits employer retribution aganst strikers, the unions
 claimed that the Government arbitrarily arrested several hundred striking workers,
 including labor leaders, then ssended or fired them from their jobs. The Govern-
 ment saud that the unions, for political ends, exaggerated the number of arrests but
 insisted that tough measures were necessary to discourage further work stoppages
 (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government has not replied to the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 concerning a complaint lodgd by the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU) in 1994. The ICFTU alleges that on October 4, 1994, the police
 searched UDT headquarters without a warrant, arrested and detained two union
 leaders, and assaulted a trade unionist. UDT headquarters have remained sealed
 since the government action. In June the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association
 deplored the arrests of union leaders and urged the Government to investigate the
 assault on the trade unionist, punish those responsible, and allow UDT members
 free access to their headquarters.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations
 abroad. The UDT has been a member of the ICFTU since 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Relations
 between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wages are generally
 established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor guidelines.
 When disputes about wages or-health and safety issues arise, the Ministry of Labor
 encourages direct, ad hoc resolution by labor representatives and employers. Work-
 ers or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Ministry of
 Labor's inspection service. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination against em-
 ployees, and employers guilty of such discrimination are leg ally required to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. The Ministry generally enforces the law.
 An export processing zone (EPZ) was established inDecember 1994. Firms in the
 EPZ are exempt from the Government's social security and medical insurance pro-
 grams. Instead, they must provide either government or private accident insurance.
 The minimum wage in the EPZ, which is stated on a weekly basis, comes to 0.43
 cents per hour. Elsewhere, it is calculated on a monthly basis and comes to 0.44
 cents per hour. The regular workweek is 40 hours, while in the EPZ it is 45 hours.
 An employee having worked for the same firm in the EPZ for at least 1 year has
 the right to 15 days annual leave compared to 30 days in the rest of the country
 (see aIso Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and while this is generally observed, security forces sometimes compel
 illegal immigrants to work for them in lieu of deportation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for the employ-
 ment of children is 14 years, and the law is generally respected. However, the short-
 age of labor inspectors reduces the likelihood of investigations ever being carried
 out, according to union sources. Children are generally not employed under hazard-
 
 
 78
 ous conditions. Children may and do work in family owned businesses, such as res-
 taurants and small shops, at all hours. Many street beggars are young children
 whose parents have forced them to beg to help support the famil.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only a small minority of the population is en-
 gaged in wage employment. The Government administratively sets minimum wage
 rates according to occupational categories, and the Ministry of Labor is charged with
 enforcement. Last raised in 1982, the minimum monthly wage rate is a pproximately
 $200 (35,900 Djiboutian francs) for a 12-hour day of unskilled labor. Many workers
 also receive housing and transportation allowances. Even with these fringe benefits,
 however, the minimum wage does not provide adequate compensation for a worker
 and family to maintain a decent standard of living.
 By law, the workweek is 40 hours, often spread over 6 days. Workers are guaran-
 teeddaily and weekly rest periods and paid annual leave. The Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for enforcing occupational health and safety standards, wages, and
 work hours. Because enforcement is ineffective, workers sometimes face hazardous
 working conditions, particularly at the port. Workers rarely protest as they fear re-
 placement by others willing to accept the risks. There are no laws or regulations
 permitting workers to refuse to carry out dangerous work assignments without jeop-
 ardy to continued employment.
