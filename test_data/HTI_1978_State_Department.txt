 HAITI
 Haiti has a long history of authoritarian rule
 with many periods of political instability and
 the most serious types of human rights abuses.
 The country is the poorest by far in the Western
 Hemisphere. It faces severe economic and social
 problems, including: overpopulation; inadequate
 arable land sub-divided into small plots and plagued
 by erosion; a lack of mineral wealth; a hiqh level
 of illiteracy (over eighty percent); an impoverished
 rural majority that does not speak French, the
 country's official languaae; a stiff but not in-
 flexible class structure; and a traditional schism
 between the urban and rural sectors.
 While human rights safeguards are included in the
 Constitution and laws, human rights have been
 ignored and violated in practice. For example, the
 Constitution guarantees the right of Haitians to form
 political parties. However, power is concentrated in
 the executive. Organized political opposition is not
 permitted in practice and even the Duvalierist party has
 disappeared as a formally constituted political party,
 although all members of the unicameral legislature
 are loyal to the Duvalierist movement.
 Violations of human rights were particularly wide-
 spread during the regime of the late Dr. Francois
 Duvalier, President of Haiti from 1957 to 1971.
 The climate has improved under the present
 Government led by his son, "President-for-Life"
 Jean Claude Duvalier, who has pledged himself to a
 program of increased observance of individual rights,
 political liberalization and economic reform.
 Although there have been improvements in the area
 of rights of the individual, particularly within
 the last twelve months, the system of authoritarian
 rule continues.
 The Government released what is believed to be all re-
 maining political prisoners in 1977.
 
 
 271
 The Government adhered to the American Convention on Human
 Rights in 1977 and received a visit in August, 1978 by the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission, which is expected to
 issue a report in early 1979.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 While there have been occasional incidents of severe
 brutal treatment in Haitian prisons in the recent vast
 (see below), torture is not officially condoned and
 there is no evidence that torture has been practiced
 in 1978.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings have been used to punish minor criminal
 infractions, to extract confessions, and to impose
 discipline in prison. Prisoners released in 1977 and
 1978 reported fewer incidents of brutality, at least as
 their prison terms ended, and conduct of guards appears
 to be more closely controlled.
 Sanitary conditions in prison remain inadequate,
 but are being improved. Physical facilities, medical
 care, and diet at major prisons reportedly were
 improved during the summer of 1978, prior to the
 visit of the Inter-Anerican Human Rights Commission.
 The notorious high security prison, Fort Dimanche,
 has not been used since the release of political
 prisoners in mid-1977. Further criminal prisoner
 releases in 1978 significantly relieved overcrowded
 facilities in the other major prisons.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 During the 1960s, arbitrary arrest and imprison-
 ment were practiced extensively. Since the early
 1970s, President Jean-Claude Duvalier has pursued
 
 
 272
 
 a proclaimed policy of "national reconciliation"
 between the Government and its opponents. Arrests
 for security or political reasons appear to have
 been substantially reduced. Amnesty International
 received reports of arrests carried out without legal
 safeguards, but these have not been confirmed. With
 the release of a total of 186 persons in February
 and September, 1977 there are no known political
 prisoners left in jail.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil cases are handled publicly under formal court
 procedures. The case backlog is large. Criminal
 assizes open to the public resumed in 1975 after
 a lapse of many years and have since been held
 reqularly. In criminal court cases public hearings
 are mandatory and defendants are entitled to counsel.
 In felony cases before the criminal court, legal
 counsel is provided by the state. This is not the
 case in lesser offenses brought before justices
 of the peace, and defendants often cannot afford
 a lawyer. News media cover trials freely. The State
 Security Tribunal, which was established in 1977
 with the stated purpose of ensuring trials for all
 security offenders, has never convened.
 Article 17 of the Haitian Constitution stipulates
 that arrests must be made with a proper warrant
 and that the accused must be brought before a
 judge within 48 hours after arrest. Rarely observed
 in the past, these guarantees have now been publicly
 endorsed by the Government although their implementa-
 tion has been slow and erratic. Two trials held in
 1978 indicate the changing climate. In one, two
 members of the Volunteers for National Security
 were fined and jailed briefly for beatinq a Baptist
 pastor who published an outspoken newspaper. In the
 other, an army lieutenant was sentenced to six years
 in prison for killing a civilian. While the sentences
 were relatively light, security agents or military offi-
 cers would almost certainly not have been convicted
 for such offenses during the 1960s.
 
 
 273
 
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Violation of privacy was a common practice during
 the 1960s, but there is no evidence of recent violations.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Since 1971, the Haitian Government has increased
 efforts to improve the conditions of life, focusing on
 agriculture and job creation through encouragement of
 light industry. Goals for improvements in these
 areas were set out in multi-year development plans
 with separate development budgets. These budgets,
 largely financed by foreign grants and loans, increased
 over three hundred percent between 1974 and 1978.
 Agricultural projects have emphasized increased
 production by and income for small farmers. Health
 projects have emphasized child nutrition, family
 planning and development of a comprehensive rural
 system of preventive medicine and basic health
 care. To strengthen infrastructure, the Government
 has concentrated on construction of rural highways
 and secondary roads. In education, rural school con-
 struction and curriculum reform have been undertaken.
 Implementation of programs and policies has been
 difficult and progress slow. There is no tradition of
 Government service to citizens. Attitudes must be changed,
 staff trained, institutions created, and funding increased.
 Moreover, the difference in the living standards of rural
 Haitians and those in Port-au-Prince wildened in recent
 years as the rural economy stagnated or declined and
 resources in the capital city increased. The disparity
 between the relatively few who are wealthy and the poor
 majority in urban areas is marked.
 In July 1978, the Government announced to the inter-
 national development assistance community its intention
 to undertake major fiscal reforms so that, progressively,
 
 
 274
 
 all revenues will be accounted for in the national
 budget. The realization of this goal would accelerate
 Haiti's development and reduce corruption, which
 has been criticized as impeding development. The
 International Monetary Fund has recognized the
 Government's progress in the area of fiscal reform.
 Nevertheless, some domestic revenues probably
 continue to be diverted away from development.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Members of Haiti's non-French-speaking majority are
 increasingly able to express themselves through inter-
 views in Creole by roving Haitian radio reporters.
 Haitian radio stations, including the Government station,
 have shown a growing willingness to broadcast comments,
 even criticisms of local officials, by the previously
 voiceless majority. An extensive security intelligence
 apparatus monitors criticism of the existing political
 system.
 Roman Catholicism is the established religion, but
 practitioners of almost all the major Protestant denomi-
 nations abound. In November 1978, the Government issued
 a decree giving the Department of Foreign Affairs and
 Worship authority to exercise control over the many
 hundreds of evangelical missionary groups that have
 proliferated in Haiti. Tne decree has not yet been imple-
 mented. Before doing so, that Department is consulting
 widely with religious leaders in Haiti to obtain their
 views.
 Freedom of expression nas been growing slowly, but there
 are still extensive Government restrictions on the press.
 In the past two years, the Haitian news media have begun
 to demand better performance from Governftent agencies.
 This trend was interrupted in late 1977 when members of
 the paramilitary militia assaulted the publisher of an
 independent weekly which had accused the militia of abuses.
 The paper suspended publication and another small weekly
 
 
 275
 was refused permission to publish. Media criticism
 nevertheless persisted and by the suimner of 1978 press
 freedom was in evidence as illustrated by intensive
 coverage of the Dominican elections and of the visit
 of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. In 1978
 the Inter-American Press Association acknowledged im-
 provements, but criticized censorship, both direct and
 self-imposed, in Haiti.
 Haitians may join non-political associations, but with
 restrictions. For eiample, membership in the Haitian
 Human Rights League is limited to 20 persons. The samte
 is true of all organizations not officially recognized
 by the Government. Opposition political parties and
 political organizations are forbidden in practice,
 although allowed by the Constitution.
 The few labor unions that exist in Haiti have tradi-
 tionally been permitted little freedom of action.
 Union-sanctioned strikes, but not wildcat strikes,
 are permitted under the Labor Code. The Code gives
 a great deal of authority to the Ministry of Social
 Affairs in mediating disputes. In late 1977, however,
 and again in the summer of 1978, there were several
 strikes and greater labor organizing activity. In
 most cases, the workers won at least some of the
 demands for which they were striking. To date, labor
 activity has been directed primarily against large
 foreign corporations.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement in Haiti is not restricted
 except for security reasons near border areas.
 Haitians must have exit and re-entry visas for
 foreign travel. In practice, only a small number
 of persons are denied these visas. The Government
 has exiled political opponents-individuals it
 considers serious threats to its security--including
 at least one in 1978. Many Haitians depart illegally
 for other countries, including the United States,
 primarily for economic reasons. Some of these
 have applied for political asylum, based usually
 
 
 276
 on the assertion that they would be prosecuted for
 having left Haiti illegally and would suffer political
 persecution if repatriated. It does not appear that
 those who have been repatriated from the United States
 have suffered political persecution or reprisals for their
 illegal departure. However, Amnesty International asserted
 in August 1978 and again in December that "a significant
 number of arrests, imprisonment, and/or harassment of
 returnees or of those attempting to leave Haiti" has been
 reported. No names of these alleged victims have been
 provided.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is severely
 restricted. Haiti is a one-party authoritarian state,
 and the President is chosen for life. Elections to the
 unicameral legislative chamber are held every six years
 and are scheduled for 1979. This process will be a critical
 test of the Government's proclaimed policy of liberali-
 zation. Since the late 1950s, all members of the Chamber
 have belonged to the Duvalier political movement.
 In general, women enjoy equal wages, and have access to
 most jobs, including Government appointments, although
 there is a dearth of women in high government posts.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 National and Non-governmental Investigation of
 -  Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The Haitian Government has been sensitive to criticism
 of its human rights performance. Haiti has supported
 human rights causes in the Organization of American
 States and other international fora, and adhered to
 the American Convention on Human Rights in September,
 1977. The Government invited the Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission for an inspection visit in August,
 1978 and cooperated fully with the Commission during
 the visit.
 
 
 other actions by the lieutenant and he was subsequently
 cashiered by the army (which exercises authority
 over the oolice).
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Instances of mistreatment by local oolice are often
 reoorted widely in the oress. These generally credible
 reoorts usually confine the alleged mistreatment
 to rough handling, although the use of excessive,
 unnecessary force and brutality is sometimes claimed.
 The number of such reports has decreased substantially.
 The mistreatment which occurs can generally be
 attributed to the low level of oolice training and
 individual excesses. In July 1978 immiqration officials
 who had mistreated a deoortee were dismissed. With
 few exceptions jail conditions are ooor, reflectinq
 the poverty of the country.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imorisonment
 Honduran law provides for arraiqnment shortly after
 arrest. This aooears to be the rule in most cases
 althouqh hearinqs may be delayed due to administrative
 inefficiency. When there is reasonable indication of
 an offense, Honduran le4al orocedures permit the judge
 to detain a oerson uo to six days for questioning before
 determining if charges are to be brought.
 In September 1978 nine oeasant leaders of the Isletas
 Peasant Association, held on charqes of embezzlement
 since January 1977, were released after being found innoceni
 by a lower court, an aoeals court, and the Suoreme
 Court. Some groups contend that the nine were accused
 and detained because they were Communists. The case
 is significant since their release came about through
 the normal process of the legal system. As last year's
 Reoort indicated, the oeasant leaders were originally
 held incommunicado for five months. They then began
 their progress through the courts and, aside from
 that five month oeriod, reoorted they had suffered
 no mistreatment.
 A oervasive problem involves the frequest detention
 of peasants on such charges as arson, cattle rustlinq,
 fence destruction, wood cuttinq, and theft. The oress
 and camoesino federations estimate as many as 300-400
 detainees at any given time, as some recover freedom
