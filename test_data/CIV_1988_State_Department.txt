 COTE DIVOIRE
 Cote d'Ivoire, a former French colony which gained
 independence through a peacefy1 transfer of power in 1960, is
 a one-party state with a civilian government. Power is
 concentrated in the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI)
 and its long-time leader, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
 now 83 years old. Although the freedom to form other parties
 is provided for in the Constitution, in practice no other
 party has been allowed to participate in the political
 process. More open discussion of government policies has been
 permitted since the country's first competitive elections in
 1980 for PDCI, municipal, and legislative positions.
 Membership in the party -rgans, the number of municipalities
 which have elected leadership, and representation in the
 National Assembly have all steadily expanded in the last 28
 years to reflect the growth and diversity of the Ivorian
 population. Basic policies are set within the PDCI, and the
 unicameral National Assembly has never publicly challenged a
 policy put forth by the party.
 The Ministry of Internal Security includes the Surete National
 and the gendarmerie, the national police service structured
 along French lines. The Surete has an arm tasked with
 intelligence gathering and counterespionage responsibilities.
 The gendarmerie is responsible for territorial security,
 especially in the rural areas.
 Cote d'Ivoire has enjoyed considerable economic development
 since independence, and the country now has an annual per
 capita income of approximately $700. The Ivorian economy is
 market-oriented and open to foreign investment. During the
 1980's Cote d'Ivoire has been squeezed by a heavy debt burden
 and falling prices for its exports, principally coffee, cocoa,
 and tropical woods, on world markets. In 1987 the country
 experienced a decline in its gross domestic product (GDP) for
 the first time since independence. Prices for coffee and
 cocoa decreased even further, and the Government was forced in
 May 1987 to suspend payments on its foreign debt. It did not
 resume payments in 1988.
 The human rights situation in Cote d'Ivoire remained
 unchanged. The President continued to advocate "dialog" (in
 practice sometimes combined with punishment) in settling
 disputes, eventually seeking to involve dissenters in the
 operation of the one-party structure rather than to isolate
 them. In 1988 the Government reinstated two university
 professors, including one in voluntary exile in France since
 1983, as part of an effort to bring former "dissident"
 secondary teachers and university professors back into the
 fold. This effort also involved the use of imprisonment and
 forced conscription as a means of disciplining other teachers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction
 or disappearance.

 COTE D'IVOIRE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The penal code prohibits official violence without "legitimate
 justification." The code does not, however, specifically
 mention or prohibit torture, nor does it define what
 constitutes "legitimate justification" or the level of
 violence officials may use if "justified." There were no
 reports of torture during 1988, nor any evidence of systematic
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of persons, including
 prison inmates. Foreign Africans are treated more roughly by
 police on arrest than are Ivorians. This rough treatment is
 reported sometimes to include beatings. Prisoners are
 generally allowed visits from attorneys of their choice and
 from family members, who must provide food to supplement the
 sparse prison diet. Prison conditions are poor. Sanitation
 and medical facilities are minimal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. The Government has, however,
 occasionally detained persons considered a threat to internal
 security. It also takes firm measures against acts it
 considers threats to internal security. The Government has
 also used the threat of forced conscription to discourage
 student involvement in antigovernment activities, and during
 the past year 20 former officials or members of the Secondary
 School Teachers' Union were detained and conscripted into
 varying lengths of military service (see Section 6.a.).
 Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor can
 order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 bringing charges. The Code dictates that further detention
 must be ordered by a magistrate who can authorize periods of
 up to 4 months, but who must also provide the Minister of
 Justice, on a monthly basis, with a written justification for
 continued detention. There have been reports that local
 police have held persons for.more than 48 hours in a few
 cases, but that higher officials have disciplined police for
 these violations.
 Some prominent critics of the Government have chosen to live
 and write elsewhere (see Section 2.a.). Political exiles from
 a number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable
 safehaven.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and
 includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. There is
 general agreement that the judiciary is independent of the
 executive in practice as well as under the Constitution's
 separation of powers provisions, except in cases concerning
 perceived national security issues, when the judiciary follows
 the lead of the executive.
 Defendants accused of felonies or capital crimes have the
 right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for
 court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In
 practice, however, such attorneys are not readily available.
 
 
 90
 COTE Dï¿½IVOIRE
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial.
 This provision is generally respected in urban areas. In
 rural areas, justice is often administered at the village
 level through traditional institutions which largely handle
 local matters such as domestic disputes, minor land questions,
 and family law. Dispute resolution is by extended debate,
 with no known instances of resort to physical or similar
 punishment. These traditional courts are increasingly
 superseded by the formal judicial system.
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. There are no
 appellate courts within the military justice system. Persons
 convicted by a military tribunal occasionally request the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a
 retrial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All Ivorian citizens are considered to be members of the
 PDCI. Party regulations call for active participation in
 party activities and payment of dues which are collected in
 most cases through deductions from pay checks. Most party
 regulations, however, are not strictly enforced. Ivorians who
 choose not to participate do not suffer retaliation. It is
 not known what percentage of the population actively
 participates in the party.
 The Code of Penal Procedures specifies that a police official
 or investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes
 without a warrant if there is reason'to believe there is
 evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official
 must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects
 seized in the search. He is required to have witnesses to the
 search, which may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are
 generally respected in urban areas but are sometimes ignored
 in the countryside.
 In 1988 there were some reports that armed members of the
 gendarmerie were directly involved in robberies of civilians,
 particularly on the highways. In the past there have been
 scattered reports of forced entry or other violations of the
 home, specifically involving foreign Africans. There is no
 evidence that correspondence and telephone conversations are
 monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free expression in Cote d'Ivoire is limited. Critics of the
 Government feel free to, and do, express themselves in
 informal situations without fear of reprisal. Public
 criticism of basic government policies, the party, or the
 President, however, rarely occurs.
 A university professor, Pascal Kokora, was fired from his job
 in January after having his linguistics class compare Ivorian
 and foreign news reports of the trial of the former Secondary
 School Teachers' Union officials. After several months, as no
 alternative work was available for him, he left the country.
 In September, however, he was reinstated in his university
 position, along with Laurent Gbagbo, who-had been in voluntary
 exile in France since 1983 and had been generally considered
 
 
 91
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 the leading Ivorian dissident.
 The Government owns majority shares in the two daily
 newspapers, and their editorial opinion follows the policies
 of the PDCI. The one weekly newsmagazine is controlled by the
 party. Several periodic pamphlets are published privately.
 The Ministry of Information, Culture, Youth, and Sports
 operates radio, television, and a wire service.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development. It allows criticism
 of failures to execute policy but not criticism of the
 policies themselves. Investigative journalism is permitted
 except with respect to the Government and its policies. The
 Government has occasionally banned critical publications, most
 recently the magazine Jeune Afrique in 1987 after one of its
 articles suggested that the Government of Cote d'Ivoire was
 involved in the October 1987 coup in Burkina Faso.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is restricted when the Government
 perceives a significant and immediate danger to public order
 (which can include the expression of unwelcome political
 views). Gatherings occasionally are cancelled to prevent the
 expression of controversial views in public forums. AI's 1988
 report notes that in 1987 the leader of an unrecognized
 opposition party and some 30 members of the party were
 arrested and held for several weeks because they had applied
 for permission to hold a party congress. All were released
 after a few weeks. As a result of student disorders in 1982,
 only apolitical gatherings are now permitted on campus, but
 students speak freely about politics in informal situations.
 Association for political purposes is only permitted within
 the framework of the PDCI, e.g., women's and youth groups.
 Association for nonpolitical purposes, such as in professional
 groupings, is permitted, but the Government may attempt to
 bring some such groups under its wing or that of the party.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion,.and no-particular faith is favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel,
 but internal roadblocks for identity and customs checks are
 common. Persons stopped at such roadblocks are sometimes
 harassed by the police. Although Professor Kokora initially
 had some problems ii  obtaining a passport, Ivorians normally
 can travel abroad freely and can emigrate without
 discrimination. Ivorians have the right of voluntary
 repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of
 citizenship.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safehaven to Angolans,
 Burkinabe, Ethiopians, Ghanaians, Guineans, Liberians, and
 
 
 92
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Vietnamese. While in Cote d'Ivoire, refugees receive 1-year
 renewable resident visas for their first 5 years in the
 country, after which they may apply for permanent residence.
 Cote d'Ivoire does not take any significant responsibility for
 the economic and social welfare of refugees, who become the
 concern of private and international organizations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political participation is limited to the PDCI, which is
 headed by President Houphouet-Boigny. No opposition groups
 exist openly, and the Government does not allow their
 formation. Therefore, in practice the citizens of Cote
 d'IvoirQ are unable to change the one-party system of
 government.
 Within the party, the President wields power through a
 13-member executive committee, a 57-member political bureau,
 and a 208-member steering committee. Political power is
 concentrated in the President's hands, and most important
 decisions are made by the President himself. The 175-seat
 National Assembly confirms and ratifies legislative
 initiatives received from the President. During the 1986-1987
 legislative year, the National Assembly initiated its first
 legislation in history to promote job creation in the rural
 and small business sectors.
 Within this strict one-party system, the Government continues
 to encourage more open participation in the political process
 by expanding the size of party institutions and by permitting
 more party members to run in legislative, municipal, and local
 party elections. For example, in the case of the most recent
 legislative elections in 1985, approximately 577 individuals
 ran for the 175-seat National Assembly. Many incumbents were
 defeated in all three elections.
 The role of women has been given somewhat greater political
 prominence since July 1986 when the President filled the
 ,position of Minister for Women's Affairs, a cabinet-level post
 that had been vacant for almost 2 years. Ten women are
 deputies in the National Assembly, and 28 women are members of
 the steering committee of the PDCI.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights practices. It is not known what impact, if any,
 AI's appeals on behalf of the secondary teachers may have had
 on the Government's subsequent positive action. Cote d'Ivoire
 has a local chapter of AI.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no overt, official discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. The most lucrative
 government and private sector jobs seem to be concentrated
 among the minority Muslim (30 percent) and Christian (15
 percent) populations, a phenomenon attributable primarily to
 urbanization and access to education. All religions, however,
 are represented at top levels of government and throughout
 society. Although French is the official language and the
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 language of instruction in the schools, radio and television
 broadcasts are provided in major local languages. Social and
 economic mobility are not limited by policy or custom.
 Although males clearly play the preponderant role overall,
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. Nonetheless, in rural areas
 tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are performed mostly
 by women. Female circumcision continues to be practiced among
 elements of the Ivorian population, although it is rare in
 urban populations. PDCI policy is to encourage full
 participation by women in social, economic, and political life.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to form unions, but almost all unions
 are organized within a single government-sponsored labor
 confederation, the General Union of Cote d'Ivoire Workers
 (UGTCI). Secondary, university, and primary school teachers'
 unions had been exceptions until 1987. In July 1987, a schism
 developed in the Congress of the Secondary School Teachers'
 Union (SSTU), and a second group elected a new leadership
 which won government endorsement and control of the union.
 Shortly after the replacement of the Secondary School
 Teachers' Union leadership, the Primary School Teachers' Union
 asked to join the UGTCI, leaving only the university teachers'
 union independent of the confederation.
 The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in the
 party hierarchy. Union membership is encouraged but not
 mandatory. The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordination
 mechanism rather than an active force for workers' rights.
 The right to strike is protected by statute, but in practice
 strikes are rarely authorized by the UGTCI. Although there
 were no official strikes in 1988, there were several "work
 stoppages." For example, workers in a factory near the
 capital stopped work to protest a management plan to reorder
 production. In this case, as usually happens, the Government
 stepped in to mediate.
 In 1983 a secondary teachers' strike was broken by a
 presidential decree ordering teachers back to the classrooms
 and threatening them with fines and prison sentences for
 noncompliance. In July 1987 at the Congress of the Secondary
 School Teachers' Union, some teachers publicly protested the
 Government's action and subsequently, in September and
 October, 16 secondary teachers, including the former secretary
 general of the union, were detained. A total of 24 teachers,
 20 male and 4 female, were suspended from their teaching
 positions. In a civil trial in December 1987, three former
 SSTU officials were found guilty of embezzlement of union
 funds, fined, and sentenced to several months each in prison.
 Upon their release, the three were conscripted into the
 military service and detained at a military camp in the north
 of the country. Eventually 20 male teachers, some of whom
 were former -union officials, were detained in the camp.
 During the spring several international organizations,
 including Al, protested .the detention of these former
 teachers. In early July, all 20 were released, though they
 were still, technically, under military jurisdiction. On
 September 14, all 24 teachers met with President Houphouet, at
 which time the President "pardoned" them. The'next day all 24
 
 
 94
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 received full back pay and were given teaching positions in
 Abidjan for the 1988-1989 school year.
 Generally, the Government negotiates with strikers and
 resolves at least some of their economic grievances. Aside
 from the dispute with secondary school teachers and the arrest
 and detention of 20 of their members, there have been no other
 reports that professional groups have experienced persecution
 or harassment.
 Unions, trade associations, and professional bodies are
 permitted to maintain relations with recognized international
 professional bodies in their fields. The UGTCI is a member of
 the continent-wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 Cote d'Jvoire is a member-state of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), and the UGTCI participates in Ivorian
 delegations to ILO conferences and events.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining within each company takes place under
 UGTCI leadership. The UGTCI has representatives in every
 major business enterprise, and the UGTCI secretariat often
 plays a mediation or conciliation role in relations between
 labor and management in individual businesses. There are no
 export processing zones in Cote d'Ivoire, and labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There have been no reports of forced labor in Cote d'Ivoire.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children
 In most instances, the legal minimum working age is 16.
 However, children often work on family farms, and in Abidjan
 some children routinely act as vendors of consumer goods in
 the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government enforces a comprehensive labor code, the Code
 du Travail, governing the terms and conditions of service for
 wage earners and salaried workers and providing for
 occupational safety and health standards. Extensive
 safeguards protect those employed in the modern sector against
 unjust compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge
 from employment. Minimum wages vary according to occupation,
 e.g., a skilled worker would earn the equivalent of 77 cents
 per hour, an unskilled worker could earn as little as $110 per
 month. At lower levels, these wages do not provide a decent
 standard of living. Wage levels increase for workers with
 more experience and skills. Month-long paid vacations and a
 substantial severance pay are guaranteed. Government medical
 insurance and retirement programs provide an element of income
 security for salaried employees in the modern sector. There
 is, however, a large informal sector of the economy, involving
 both urban and especially rural workers, in which many of
 these occupational regulations are enforced erratically at
 best.
