 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is a former Spanish colony in central West
 Africa composed of a continental province (Rio Muni) and the
 island provinces of Bioko and Annobon. It has an estimated
 population of 340,000. The capital, Malabo, is on Bioko. The
 current regime, under President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,
 took power as a military government in the 1979 coup which
 overthrew President Macias and ended his 11-year, state-
 sanctioned policy of terror. A national Constitution was
 adopted in 1982, national and local assemblies chosen, and the
 military Government declared itself a civilian government.
 In December 1986, a single political party, the Democratic
 Party of Equatorial Guinea (DPEG), was established by
 government decree, with the President as its head. Only
 members of the DPEG may hold public office. All adult
 citizens, even those who are not party members, are required
 to pay party dues.
 The Guinean police and military, with substantial assistance
 from Spain, have been reorganized totally since 1979. A
 300-man guard force provided by Morocco assists in protecting
 the President. In the first instance, internal security is
 the responsibility of the Minister of Territorial
 Administration through the national police force, the Guardia
 Civil.
 Most of the population lives by subsistence agriculture,
 fishing, and hunting, with per capita annual income
 approximately $260. The small wage economy, based on cocoa,
 lumber, and coffee, was devastated by the Macias years and the
 death or exodus of thousands of trained and educated citizens.
 The economy remains extremely fragile, despite substantial
 foreign aid and attempts at reform, which include entrance
 into the West African Franc Zone, debt rescheduling, and
 efforts to attract much needed foreign investment, especially
 from France and the European Economic Community. A major
 barrier to economic development is the lack of a clear rule of
 law to protect and encourage foreign investors and indigenous
 entrepreneurs. Numerous plantations, abandoned by their
 Spanish and Nigerian owners during the Macias regime, were
 arbitrarily expropriated in 1984 and sold under very favorable
 terms to influential members of the current Government. In
 September and October, the Government began to reevaluate,
 thus far ineffectively, the questions of ownership and
 indemnity relating to these properties.
 The human rights situation in 1987 changed little from
 previous years, with continued reports of arbitrary arrests,
 citizen harassment by poorly paid police and military,
 discrimination against minority groups and migrant workers,
 and the use of forced labor. Freedom of speech and assembly
 are not respected. In addition, the Jehovah's Witnesses,
 declared an illegal sect in late 1985, faced increasing
 persecution in 1987 with disruptions of church services and
 arrests of members who were accused of "anarchic" and "immoral"
 practices. As part of a general amnesty decreed in October,
 five persons tried and sentenced under military law for
 involvement in the July 1986 coup attempt were released from
 prison.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported incidents of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c, Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police methods are harsh and often include beatings of
 prisoners either to extract information or to punish offenders
 for alleged insolence or disrespect. The Government appears
 little inclined to curb such abuses. Arbitrary police
 beatings of politically powerless people, such as expatriate
 Nigerian and Cameroonian workers and members of Bubi and
 certain other indigenous tribes, continued in 1987.
 Mistreatment of prisoners is condemned officially but in fact
 is tolerated. Prisoners are dependent on their families for
 food. Prison conditions are unhealthy, and medical care is
 almost nonexistent. Prisoners often are forced to sleep and
 sit on the floor, occasionally denied exercise, or required to
 work on private plantations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Despite constitutional provisions, there is no enforcement of
 the right of a person in detention to be charged or released
 within a certain period of time, to have access to a lawyer,
 or to be freed on bail. Arbitrary arrests by security forces
 or police are commonplace, usually on trumped-up charges to
 extort money.
 There were no known instances of any citizen being exiled
 abroad in 1987. The Government continued to round up
 so-called vagrant illegal aliens and ordinary citizens and put
 them to work. These roundups are a means of obtaining free
 labor and often are linked to preparation for important
 national days, the arrival of visiting dignitaries, and
 seasonal needs on the plantations of important government
 officials.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Ministry of Justice has made little progress in
 establishing a fully functional legal system, and the executive
 branch has been able to act without fear of judicial review.
 The justices on the highest Court, the Supreme Court, serve at
 the pleasure of the President, who replaced all but one justice
 early in 1986. Of 12 Supreme Court positions, only 4 have
 ever been filled at the same time. The tribunal provided for
 in the Constitution to decide constitutional issues has never
 been established.
 The exact number of political prisoners is unknown but is
 believed to be small. The Government does not admit to holding
 any political prisoners. There is still no information
 available on the fate of 26 persons tried in July 1983 on
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 charges stemming from a coup attempt in May 1983. According
 to Amnesty International, the 26 defendants did not receive
 fair trials. The Government reported only that the majority
 of the accused received sentences varying from 5 to 10 years.
 Military tribunals hear all capital offenses, civil and
 criminal, in Equatorial Guinea. The most important recent
 court case took place in 1986 with the public 2-day trial of
 15 persons, including the Deputy Prime Minister and senior
 government and military officials, accused of plotting to
 overthrow the Government in July 1986. The defendants were
 represented by government-employed counsel, and the proceedings
 were broadcast on state radio and television. The military
 tribunal sentenced one defendant to death (a member of the
 military), four to long prison terms (18 to 20 years), and six
 to terms of 2 years, while four were stripped of government
 positions and set free. The single death sentence was carried
 out on the day of the verdict. Five of those sentenced to
 2-year terms were released from prison 1 year early, in
 October 1987, under a general amnesty decree signed by the
 President.
 The actual charges against the defendants ranged from
 violating three sections of the Constitution to violating a
 particular section of the military penal code. The
 constitutional provisions speak generally of citizens'
 obligations and are not criminal statutes. In addition, it
 was not clear how the military penal code applied to the
 civilian defendants. -The speed of the judicial process, the
 questionable legal bases of the charges brought, the doubtful
 jurisdiction of the military tribunal, the lack of independent
 defense counsel, and the absence of appeal procedures raised
 serious questions whether the defendants received due process.
 The current court system, which often uses local customary
 law, is a combination of traditional, civil, and military
 justice, and operates in an ad hoc manner for lack of
 established procedures and experienced judicial personnel. It
 is not known how frequently people are denied trials since
 many detainees deal directly with the arresting authorities
 and resort to bribes to gain their freedom. Most trials are
 brief. In cases of petty theft or civil disputes, all parties
 are brought before a judge for trial. In civil and criminal
 cases, the judge often levies a fine in lieu of imprisonment.
 In cases involving senior officials, exclusion from public
 office and confinement to traditional villages are common
 means of punishment.
 Equatorial Guinea's estimated 15 lawyers work for the
 Government and consequently are unable to challenge government
 actions effectively. Laws are enacted by decree and are not
 published or otherwise effectively promulgated. As there are
 no libraries or independent resource facilities, a citizen is
 seldom able to determine what the laws are or whether he or
 she has been charged with a bona fide offense.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were reports of arbitrary interference with privacy but
 not with correspondence. There is a general suspicion that
 telephone conversations are routinely monitored. Search
 warrants are not usually used, even though they are required
 
 
 93
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 by the Constitution. There is no forced resettlement of
 population, and no interference with the right to marry or
 have children.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Open criticism of the Government is not permitted. The media
 that exist in Equatorial Guinea are government owned and
 operated. The single newspaper (published sporadically) is in
 fact a government bulletin. The radio and television stations
 transmit official government notices and imported
 entertainment, sports, and religious programs. There are no
 prohibitions on receiving foreign publications or periodicals,
 but for economic reasons there are no such publications for
 sale anywfiere in the country.
 It is doubtful that the Government would permit the sale or
 distribution of publications openly critical of its conduct.
 School libraries require government permission to accept even
 donated books.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Citizens are not free to associate publicly with others to
 discuss political or economic matters, notwithstanding
 constitutional guarantees to the contrary. The Government
 does not permit opposition organizations and would not
 tolerate unsanctioned political rallies and assemblies.
 Private nonpolitical groups, such as professional
 organizations, churches and sports groups, generally require
 government approval and licensing.
 There are no labor unions, and there have been no attempts to
 organize workers. It is widely recognized that the Government
 would not permit a union to organize, especially in the cocoa,
 lumber, and coffee sectors which constitute the main economic
 resources. There is no significant industry in Equatorial
 Guinea.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Until late in 1985, there had been complete freedom of
 religion in predominantly Roman Catholic Equatorial Guinea.
 In December 1985, the Jehovah's Witnesses and several small
 Pentecostal groups were banned, and their churches and meeting
 houses closed without explanation. In 1986 and 1987,
 Witnesses were placed under house arrest, harassed, and
 reportedly forced to do manual labor despite having been
 neither convicted nor charged with any crime. After several
 unsuccessful appeals, 10 noncitizen Witness missionaries were
 expelled from the country in September and October 1987, and
 80 local Witnesses were forbidden to practice their religion.
 Missionaries of several other faiths are still active and have
 government permission for their activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no explicit restrictions on travel within the
 country, but anyone found without' a job in any part of the
 country except his own town or village is subject to a period.
 of forced labor and obligatory return to his place of origin.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 There were no reports of any additional Guinean refugees
 fleeing the country in 1987, but a large number of refugees
 from the former regime continue to reside in Spain, France,
 Cameroon, and Gabon. Many of them voice fear of repression
 from the current Government if they return and allege that
 their passports are restricted to prevent travel back to
 Equatorial Guinea. However, the poor state of the economy is
 probably the main reason many remain abroad. The Government
 has proclaimed repeatedly that returnees need not fear
 persecution but can engage in political activities only within
 the sanctioned system.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have only a hypothetical right to change their
 government by democratic means. President Obiang took power
 in 1979 in a military coup that toppled the Macias regime and
 used the 1982 plebiscite, which involved only approval or
 disapproval of the Constitution, to declare himself President.
 He will face reelection in 1989 under the present 7-year term
 established by the Constitution. Under the Constitution, a
 partially elected, partially appointed National Assembly was
 chosen. While the Assembly includes members of minority
 groups and is theoretically the legislative branch of
 government, it is powerless to take any action not sanctioned
 by the President or his Council of Ministers. According to
 the Constitution, the President also has the power to suspend
 virtually all rights provided for in the Constitution when a
 threat to national security or a national emergency exists,
 and the President himself decides when such a threat exists.
 He has not done so yet.
 Only members of the PDEG may hold public office, with the
 selection of all candidates being controlled by the party. In
 July 1987, another decree mandated that all adult citizens of
 Equatorial Guinea should pay dues to the party, whether or not
 they are members. Deductions are made from wages and salaries
 for deposit into the party's coffers. In October the
 mandatory payments to the DPEG were fixed at 3 percent of
 every adult's salary or wage.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has denounced and reversed the savagery of the
 previous regime. It is willing to discuss human rights issues
 with international organizations. A United Nations human
 rights team visited Equatorial Guinea in January 1986, but its
 report had still not been released at the end of 1987. There
 are no human rights groups in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law states that both sexes and all tribal groups are equal
 and entitled to the same rights and privileges. Members of
 the Fang clans, principally the Esangui, comprise more than 70
 percent of the population and dominate life in Equatorial
 Guinea, including the allocation of top government positions.
 The Bubi tribe comprises approximately 15 percent of the
 population and has historically been the majority on the
 island of Bioko, where the capital -is located. Despite
 National Assembly elections in 1983 which returned a
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 proportionate number of Bubi delegates, they have little
 effective political voice in government. Other tribal groups
 such as Playeros, Fernandinos, and even less favored Fang
 clans are similarly discriminated against in opportunities for
 economic and social advancement.
 For a variety of historical, cultural, and economic reasons,
 women are accorded a lower social status than men and have a
 correspondingly lower status and influence in society and
 government. Social tradition, and the fact that women produce
 most of the basic staple food items, keep most women engaged
 in agricultural or dcmestic work. Many more males than
 females enter and graduate from secondary school. Women play
 only a minor role in politics. The highest positions held by
 women are: the Vice Ministers of Labor and Health, mayors of
 two small towns, 1 member (out of 60) of the largely
 ceremonial House of Representatives, and the Presidential
 Adviser for Public Health and Social Action. (The wife of the
 President fills-the latter position.)
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Even when paid, salaries are insufficient for ensuring a
 decent living, and many must take second jobs. Equatorial
 Guinea has a statutory minimum wage of roughly $34 monthly and
 an average wage of $68 monthly. Government working conditions
 include a maximum 48-hour workweek with a full day of rest
 each week,and regularly scheduled holidays. There is no
 effective monitoring of work hours and labor conditions
 outside of the Government. The minimum age for employment is
 16, but thdre is no enforcement of this law outside the
 cities, and children of various ages work, as necessary, to
 help support their families.
