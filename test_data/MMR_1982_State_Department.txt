 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is a one-party,
 socialist state with its leadership drawn from a narrow elite
 within the military. The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party
 dominates the government structure, which it parallels, but is
 in turn subordinate to the highly personalized leadership of
 its chairman, U Ne Win (who was General Ne Win, commander of
 the army at the time of the 1962 coup).
 Burma is ranked among the least-developed nations of the world.
 The Government has sought to build a centrally-planned,
 socialist economic system under a program known as the 'Burmese
 Way to Socialism,' an eclectic mixture of Burmese nationalism
 and Buddhist and socialist ideals. For many years, the Govern-
 ment pursued a rigid policy of economic self-sufficiency;
 a historical tradition of isolationism has contributed to
 political and cultural insularity as well. After approaching
 economic collapse in the early 1970's, the Government has over
 the past decade tempered its doctrinaire socialism with
 pragmatic economic measures, including greater recognition of
 the private sector and an infusion of foreign grant and loan
 capital.
 Widespread insurgency and ethnic separatism are major problems.
 Dozens of different insurgent groups struggle with Government
 forces in remote and sparsely-populated areas; their access to
 modern arms and equipment and financing from foreign sources
 and through narcotics trafficking have prevented the central
 Government from decisively overcoming them.
 Burma's army overthrew the elected civilian Government of Prime
 Minister U Nu in 1962, claiming that parliamentary democracy
 had failed to promote economic development and safeguard
 national unity. Opponents of the revolutionary Government
 and regional separatists were jailed, generally without trial.
 Most of the jailed persons were released in the 1960's and
 early 1970's, but it was not until 1978 that a gradual relaxa-
 tion of Government restrictions led to a significant reduction
 in reports of human rights abuses. An amnesty order in 1980
 resulted in the return to Burma of about 2,200 of the Govern-
 ment's opponents, including former Prime Minister U Nu.
 Another 15,000 people, including political prisoners, were
 released from Burmese prisons under the amnesty. Opposition
 political groups remain banned, and criticism of the Government
 is not tolerated.
 The 1974 Constitution established the framework of Burma's one-
 party, socialist Government. By inference, all political
 activity outside the single party structure is banned.
 The Constitution defines the fundamental rights and duties of
 citizens and recognizes commonly accepted freedoms (thought,
 religion, press, speech, association, movement, due process)
 and a number of social rights, as well (health, education,
 worker rights, and sexual equality). These rights are
 conditioned, however, on the Government's assessment of their
 compatibility with state security, socialist objectives,
 national unity, and public peace and tranquility.
 A 1975 anti-subversion law codified the wide discretionary
 powers of government security agencies. Several government
 organizations, sometimes competing, are charged with state
 security, including: the Inter-Ministerial National
 Intelligence Bureau; the Directorate of Defense Services
 Intelligence and its Military Intelligence Service detachments;
 the Bureau of Special Investigations, which reports to the Home
 Minister; and the People's Police Force with its various
 sub-groups also reporting to the Home Minister. Additionally,
 each local people's council has an independent security
 
 
 667
 committee with block and neighborhood wardens in cities and
 towns. There is a wide divergence between the handling of
 common criminal cases and cases involving national security
 or political opposition. Normal judicial procedures and
 constitutional guarantees are not always observed in
 political/security cases.
 Burma inherited from the colonial period a large, mostly non-
 indigenous population from the Indian subcontinent and China.
 Although thousands of non-Burmese residents left voluntarily or
 involuntarily in the first year after the coup, several hundred
 thousand descendents of these immigrants remain in Burma, some
 with Burmese citizenship, some with legal resident alien
 status, and many without documentation of any kind.
 In this connection, the most significant development during the
 year was the passage of a new Burmese citizenship law by the
 National Assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw) on October 15, 1982, which
 could affect the status of long-time residents of Burma of
 mixed ancestry. The new law sets up a three-tier system of
 citizenship: full citizens (ethnic Burmese as defined by
 the law); associate citizens (non-Burmese ethnics who have
 previously applied for citizenship); and naturalized citizens.
 There is some concern in the non-Burmese community that the
 different categories of citizenship could be used to circum-
 scribe some of their existing rights and privileges.
 Apart from the new citizenship law, there was neither signifi-
 cant improvement nor deterioration in the overall level of
 reported human rights abuses during 1982. Political opposition
 remained banned and members of outlawed political parties,
 particularly communists, were subject to arrest. The practice
 continued of barring individuals of non-Burmese ancestry
 (primarily Indian and Chinese) from high office in the Govern-
 ment and the Party. In contested areas there were recurrent
 reports of human rights abuses by all participants in the
 fighting. In September, one insurgent group launched a
 terrorist attack in Rangoon, killing and wounding several
 police and civilians. As a consequence, several hundred
 suspects were detained, but most were released after
 questioning. Burmese Government policy continues to be
 directed at preventing the entry, asylum, transit, or
 resettlement of non-nationals. It does not recognize the
 existence of 'refugees,' and any such claimants are subject
 to arrest and deportation as illegal immigrants. The Govern-
 ment also continues to enforce the decisions of Buddhist
 ecclesiastical courts against unorthodox monks and sects.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 There have been no reports or allegations In recent years that
 Government security forces have been involved in killing for
 political or any other motives constituting human rights
 violations. Summary executions are not allowed under the
 Burmese judicial system. In contested areas, there are
 frequent and credible reports of noncombatant deaths.
 Occasionally, insurgent groups have purposely camped in
 the midst of villages in order to use noncombatant civilians
 as a shield against attack. There were also reports that
 certain of the various insurgent groups have carried out
 summary executions of prisoners, opponents, and suspected
 informers. Other insurgent groups have resorted to terrorist
 attacks, such as bombings, train derailments, and assassina-
 tions. On September 28, 1982, a small group of Karen National
 Union insurgents atttacked the Rangoon headquarters of the
 Burma Broadcasting System and a neighboring police station.
 A number of policemen and civilians were killed and wounded,
 
 
 668
 including women and children. It is not possible to estimate
 the number or frequency of such noncombatant killings country-
 wide.
 b.   Disappearance
 The Government exercises broad powers of detention under a 1975
 anti-subversion law, but there were no reports or allegations
 over the past year of people being abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention by police or other security
 forces or by elements whose activities were condoned by the
 Government. There is no attempt to hide common criminal or
 political/security arrests from family members, friends, or
 employers, although details about the charges may not be
 revealed. In contested areas along Burma's borders, some
 insurgent groups have resorted to abduction and execution
 as a political weapon or to coerce local inhabitants into
 cooperation.
 c.   Torture
 Persistent reports suggest that the police and other security
 forces of the Government have used and continue to use physical
 and psychological coercion, including torture, during investi-
 gations in order to obtain confessions or other information.
 These reports involve both common criminal and political/
 security cases. There have been no allegations of similar
 mistreatment in regular prison facilities. There are credible
 reports that some insurgent groups employ death threats,
 beatings, and other forms of mental and physical coercion
 against opponents or villagers who resist them in areas where
 they operate.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The 1974 Constitution provides that punishment shall not be in
 violation of human dignity. Except for the reported mistreat-
 ment during interrogation mentioned above, there is no evidence
 of any intentional pattern of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Corporal punishment is not an element
 of the Burmese judicial system. Prison conditions are poor as
 a consequence of the generally low standard of living, over-
 crowding, low government expenditures, and limited staff.
 In addition to regular prisons, the Government operates a
 system of work camps to which convicts are assigned for manual
 labor, including road building and quarry work. Convicts with
 good records are allowed temporary paroles to make short visits
 home from these camps. A large rehabilitation camp for hard-
 core drug addicts was opened in August 1982.
 There is no indication of differential treatment by social
 class, race, sex, or religion in Burmese prisons and work
 camps. Women have separate facilities. Gifts and bribes to
 prison personnel reportedly can buy preferential treatment.
 Political/security prisoners are incarcerated in regular
 prisons but usually enjoy better facilities and diet than
 ordinary criminals.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 No habeas corpus protection exists in Burma, and the 1975
 anti-subversion law permits indefinite detention. Practice
 varies according to type of offense. In common criminal cases,
 police may detain suspects up to 24 hours, after which a court
 order must be sought from competent judicial authorities at the
 local, state, or national level. These court orders, which are
 renewable, authorize continued detention for 14-day periods
 until charges are formally brought before a court. This system
 does not apply to political/security cases for which the period
 of detention has no legal limit.
 
 
 669
 The Government neither acknowledges holding political prisoners
 nor considers itself compelled to justify detention or imprison-
 ment of anyone. The exact number of political prisoners is
 unknown, but it is believed to be very low as the result of the
 1980 amnesty. In the wake of the September 28 terrorist attack
 in Rangoon, security forces detained se"eral hundred suspects,
 but most were released after questioning. In contested areas
 insurgent groups are not bound to any generally accepted
 principles regarding arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 Refugee status is not recognized by the Burmese Government, and
 refugees and other stateless persons are regarded as illegal.
 immigrants subject to arrest. If they cannot be repatriated
 after serving sentences for illegal entry, they may be detained
 in prison indefinitely. The Burmese Government is thought to
 have under detention several hundred 'illegal immigrants" from
 a number of Asian countries. Some of these persons reportedly
 entered Burma without papers in hope of transit resettlement.
 Among the more than 500 detainees of Chinese origin, the
 largest group under detention, some fled China during the
 Cultural Revolution and have been held for more than a decade.
 Others are ethnic Chinese who fled from Vietnam during the
 period of persecution of 0hinese in the late 1970's.
 A handful of these detainees have been repatriated voluntarily.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Justice is administered by a system of "people's courts" called
 Judges' Committees. Members of these committees are elected by
 popular vote from a single slate of candidates chosen by the
 Party. Most of the judges are lay persons, untrained in law,
 who are advised by professional legal officers. Almost all
 judges are Party members, and a large number are military
 officers, either retired or on active duty. There have been
 credible allegations that the Government has Influenced the
 judgement and sentences in certain court cases.
 The 1974 Constitution provides for public trials in most cases,
 and this practice is followed when common criminal offenses are
 involved. In political/security cases, special judiciary
 committees may be named by the Council of State. The membership
 of these special judiciary committees is often the same as that
 of the equivalent state-level Judges' Committee, but trials are
 closed to the public and often held in camera. Crimes involving
 military personnel may be assigned to regular or to military
 courts. Civilians, even those charged with security offenses,
 are not tried by court martial.
 In both common criminal and political/security cases, the
 burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the accused has the
 right to counsel. Legal counsel is provided for indigent
 defendants if they are faced with a possible sentence of seven
 years or more. In normal practice, defendants may consult
 freely and privately with their lawyers. Defendants and
 defense lawyers.are aware of the charges and evidence against
 them and are permitted to submit their own evidence. Court
 decisions are not determined solely by the codified law, but
 are also affected by Burmese concepts of community harmony and
 fair play, as well as by Burmese socialist concepts.
 The verdicts of civil, security, and military courts may be
 appealed to the next higher court up to the Council of State,
 Burma's highest executive organ.
 Insufficent information prevents an assessment of judicial
 practices among insurgent groups in contested areas, but some
 drug-trafficking insurgent groups reportedly practice summary
 executions on a wide scale.
 
 
 670
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 The privacy and security of the home are guaranteed in the 1974
 Constitution. In common criminal cases, police officials must
 have a valid search warrant or be accompanied by a member of
 the local 'people's council' at the time of search. Search
 warrants are issued by local or state Judges' Committees,
 depending on the nature of the offense. In political/security
 cases, security forces are not subject to these judicial
 procedures and usually enter homes without obtaining warrants.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are sometimes
 attached to telephones. In contested areas, forced entry and
 warrantless searches are carried out by government security
 forces and insurgent groups alike.
 2. Respect of Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech, expression, and publication are
 guaranteed by the 1974 Constitution, the Constitution also
 stipulates that the exercise of such freedoms should not be
 'contrary to the Interests of the working people and socialism.'
 In practice, opposition viewpoints and criticism of the Govern-
 ment are not tolerated. The Party's structure pgovides a
 limited opportunity for ordinary citizens to express themselves,
 particularly about economic problems or bureaucratic failures,
 but overly-outspoken party members may be disciplined or
 expelled. Anyone criticizing the Government's leadership in
 public or private is subject to arrest. A well-developed
 system of neighborhood informers reports to local .people's
 councils,' and it is generally believed that security personnel
 do not respect the privacy of correspondence.
 All mass media in Burma are Government-owned-and-operated,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 Newspaper editors are appointed by the Ministry of Information
 and are responsible for the content of daily editions;
 editorials must be approved in advance of publication.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what may be
 broadcast or published, especially regarding political matters.
 Criticism of government officials (regardless of rank) is not
 permitted, although cartoons and opinion editorials will some-
 times criticize local administration indirectly. All forms of
 communications -- domestic and imported books and periodicals,
 stage plays, motion pictures, and musical recordings -- are
 subject to government control. The Government strengthened its
 control over literature published in Burma with the founding of
 a nationwide literary workers' organization in 1980.
 Government interference in academic inquiry in the social
 sciences is widespread. All research proposals by foreign
 scholars must be approved. The extreme difficulty of obtaining
 scholarly publications from abroad or of communicating with
 foreign scholars seriously impedes academic research in all
 areas.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the right of assembly and
 association, but only in those organizations permitted by law.
 As a result, these rights are recognized only within the
 framework of the Burma Socialist Program Party. Popular
 participation is a major theme of Burmese socialism; party
 units and mass organizations for workers, peasants, and youth
 have been established at every administrative level. While
 these organizations offer a certain opportunity for political
 expression, they serve primarily as vehicles for communicating
 national policies and implementing government programs.
 Outside the Party framework, opposition political groups are
 
 
 671
 banned and their members are subject to arrest; several arrests
 of Burma Communist Party members were reported during the
 year.  Certain nonpolitical secular organizations, such as
 professional associations of doctors and lawyers, are not under
 direct government or party control.
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, negotiate, or
 strike. The labor force is organized into government-and-
 party-controlled workers' and peasants' mass organizations.
 Membership in the workers' organizations comprises about 30
 percent of the non-agricultural labor force; over 87 percent of.
 the agricultural work force has joined peasants' organizations.
 These organizations are active in seeing that those rights and
 privileges granted to workers under Burmese law are respected.
 Since the mid-seventies, local Units have enjoyed some freedom
 in electing their own leaders. Usually, however, the leaders
 are Party officials. The national leadership is made up
 entirely of ranking party and government officials.
 For example, the workers' organization national chairman is'
 also the Minister for Social Welfare and Labor and the chairman
 of the peasants' organization is the Minister for Agriculture
 and Forests; both are members of the Party's Central Committee.
 There were no attempts over the past year to establish indepen-
 dent free labor unions. At the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) General Conference in June 1982, Burma was one of several
 countries criticized for failure to apply the ILO convention
 concerning freedom of association.
 C.   Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state. Freedom of religion, guaranteed in
 the 1974 Constitution, is widely observed in Burma, a largely
 Buddhist country with sizeable Christian, Muslim, and animist
 minorities. There are no legal impediments to religious
 conversion. Beginning in 1980, the Government has sought to
 strengthen its links with and control over the Buddhist monk-
 hood. The Government appointed a National Buddhist Council
 empowered to regulate the monkhood; it instituted regulations
 requiring certification of monks by religious superiors and the
 Governmdnt; and it also issued identification and residence
 cards to monks, all of which permit the Government to enforce
 residence and movement controls similar to those imposed on the
 rest of the population.
 In 1981, the National Buddhist Council, with government
 encouragement, began to carry out a "purification" of the
 Buddhist clergy. Under this program several hundred monks have
 been excommunicated on charges of personal misconduct in
 violation of Buddhist religious canons. Buddhist ecclesiastical
 courts have also banned the activities and doctrines of Buddhist
 sects judged to be heretical; the Government's Ministry of Home
 and Religious Affairs is empowered by a 1980 law to enforce
 these bans. Excommunication continued during the last year,
 and another Buddhist sect was banned in February 1982.
 Religious minorities are free to practice their religions in
 Burma, but the Government discourages close ties between
 Burmese congregations and international religious bodies.
 There are virtually no foreign missionaries in the country, and
 visiting religious leaders may not address local congregations
 in public assembly.
 d.   Freedom of Movement, Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the right of Burmese citizens
 to live anywhere within Burma; exceptions apply to areas of
 insurgent or military activity. Residence by non-citizens is
 restricted. Both citizens and non-citizens are subject to
 
 
 .672
 travel restrictions and controls and must obtain permission to
 travel or to stay outside the township of their residence.
 In practice, however, Burmese citizens with valid identity cards
 can travel throughout the country without specific permission,
 except in contested or border areas.
 Foreign travel is difficult, except for official purposes.
 Over the last several years, lengthy bureaucratic and legal
 requir-!:t.nts fdr permis sion to travel abroad have been slightly
 streamlined, but remain extremely cumbersome. Less than half
 the passport applications for foreign travel are said to be
 approved by the Passport Board of thB Ministry of Home and
 Religious Affairs. The Passport Board does not consider itself
 obliged to explain its decisions, but there are several well-
 known cases of passport refusal based on political grounds.
 Private citizens must often reimburse the Government for their
 university and professional education and pay income taxes in
 advance before traveling abroad; these fees are refundable when
 the citizens return to Burma, but only after great delays.
 Some people of non-Burmese ancestry (for example, Indians or
 Chinese), although born and living in Burma, are considered
 foreign nationals and must acquire foreign travel documents to
 travel abroad.  Undocumented resident aliens who cannot obtain
 official documentation from another country are not able to
 travel abroad or to emigrate, as Burma does not normally
 recognize stateless documentation for exit purposes.
 While the policy is not formally enunciated, emigration is
 restricted in practice because of the Burmese Government's
 concerns about security and an economic "brain drain."
 Bureaucratic procedures and legal requirements are lengthy,
 and the right to emigrate may be denied. In addition to
 reimbursing the Government for their education, prospective
 emigrants w6o have completed certain government-financed
 advanced professional studies must put in a number of years of
 government service. As a consequence of the Government's'
 restrictive'emigration policies, a number of Burmese nationals
 over the years have chosen to leave Burma Illegally and without
 travel documentation. There are no reports of government
 revocation of citizenship. The Burmese Government does not
 recognize dual nationality, citizens who adopt another
 nationality in effect lose Burmese citizenship.
 For many years, government policies virtually prohibited the
 return of Burma-born emigres. The 1980 amnesty permitted
 exiles living abroad to return to Burma and a number of
 prominent former politicians and some former insurgents took
 advantage of the offer. Today, Burma-born emigres who left
 the country legally are usually allowed to return to visit
 relatives, although there may be long delays in obtaining entry
 visas. Emigres wishing to return permanently are required to
 apply again for Burmese citizenship. In general, except under
 an amnesty as in 19.80, emigres who leave the country Illegally
 cannot return under any circumstances.
 Burma has not permitted foreign refugees to resettle or seek
 safehaven within Burma. The Government treats persons claiming
 to be refugees as illegal immigrants subject to arrest,
 deportation, or both. In the late 1970's, the Burmese Govern-
 ment moved forcefully against what it regarded as illegal
 immigrants, mostly Bangladeshis, who had settled in the Arakan
 state. More than 150,000 South Asian Muslims crossed the
 border from Burma into Bangladesh. Negotiations between the
 Burmese and Bangladeshi Governments resolved the dispute and
 about one-third of the group was repatriated to Burma and
 resettled under UN High Commissioner for Refugees auspices.
 Today there appears to be no significant outflow of refugees
 from Burma. Some Burmese Muslims of Malay ancestry have
 settled in northern Malaysia, but their primary motive for
 leaving Burma appears to be the search for a better economic
 life.
 
 
 673
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of Burma is an authoritarian, one-party system
 whose leadership is drawn from a small elite within the military
 officer corps. All government institutions and other organi-
 zations in Burma are subordinate to the guidance of the ruling
 Burma Socialist Program Party. The party's Central Committee
 outranks all government bodies and gives direction on new
 legislation. The party in turn conforms to the highly
 personalized leadership of Party Chairman U Ne Win, who has
 ruled and guided the formulation and execution of national
 policy for the last two decades. Political opposition is not.
 tolerated.
 Opposition political parties are illegal and the single Party
 functions to mobilize popular support behind party decisions
 rather than as a vehicle to express individual or group
 opinions. Membership in the Party is open to all adult citizens
 who meet candidacy requirements; about seven percent of the
 adult population are full Party members. Party membership is
 virtually a prerequisite for many government jobs. Party and
 government elections are held every four years. The Party
 chooses the single slate of candidates for government offices
 and seldom nominates candidates who are not Party members.
 Within this framework, elections are by universal suffrage in
 which secrecy of the ballot is protected, and the Party's
 candidates are occasionally rejected. In Burma's Party and
 Government decision-making assemblies, divided votes are rare.
 The Party seeks to expand the participation of Burmese ethnic
 minorities in the Party and in the Government. Women are under-
 represented in politics and 'at senior levels of government,
 reflecting in part the military background of most of Burma's
 present leaders.
 Persons with a significant proportion of non-Burmese ancestry
 (in practice, Chinese or Indian) are barred from higher Party
 and Government offices and are asked to resign if their mixed
 ancestry is discovered. In 1982, as many as four members of
 the national assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw) were forced to resign
 because of their reportedly mixed parentage. Ranking Party
 members, including an executive committee member and the
 secretary of a permanent committee, also resigned for similar
 reasons during the year. The national bodies of workers' and
 peasants' organizations adopted by-laws in late 1981 that
 effectively deny leadership positions to members of mixed
 ancestry.
 The hundreds of thousands of non-citizen residents of Burma are
 primarily of Chinese or Indian origin. Even if registered as
 legal alien residents, they are not eligible to attend graduate
 and professional schools, to join consumer cooperatives, or to
 take certain categories of employment. As described above, the
 freedom of movement, travel, and emigration of these alien
 residents are also restricted. If undocumented, they are also
 liable to arbitrary arrest.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Burma does not actively participate in international and
 regional human rights bodies. In the past, the Burmese Govern-
 ment has not responded directly to the rare foreign commentary
 on alleged human rights violations. In 1981, Burmese officials
 avoided meeting with a representative of a non-governmental
 human rights organization who sought to discuss ethnic Chinese
 detainees. A UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 representative visited Burma during 1982 in connection with
 UNHCR assistance to refugees repatriated from Bangladesh.
 
 
 674
 No Burmese organization, governmental or private, monitors
 the human rights situation in Burma. Amnesty International's
 report covering 1981 refers to reports of arrests and ill-
 treatment of members of the ethnic minorities. Freedom House,
 in its report for 1982, classified Burma as "Not Free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Burma remains one of the poorest nations in the world in terms
 of per capita income, which last year reached $180. Burma is
 rich in natural resources, however, and has attained near self-
 sufficiency in food and energy. Relative to its resource base
 and potential, Burma's population of 34,883,000 (1981) is low
 compared with other countries in the region. Population growth
 estimates range from 2.2 to 2.5 percent.
 Economic progress has been hindered by the extensive destruction
 of basic facilities during World War II, widespread insurgency,,
 rigid bureaucratic structures, and government economic policies,
 particularly after 1962, which discouraged capital formation.
 During the first decade of U Ne Win's socialist Government,
 Burma's economy almost collapsed, reaching its nadir in the
 early 1970's when the increase in gross domestic product (GDP)
 fell to less than two percent and could not keep pace with
 population growth. Since 1972, limited changes in government
 economic policy, successful implementation of high-yield
 variety programs in the agricultural sector, and a major
 infusion of foreign grant and loan capital have contributed to
 better economic performance. Over the last four years, Burma's
 GDP rose 6.8 percent a year and reached 7.7 percent last year.
 Paddy production, which is the source of 40 percent of Burma's
 foreign exchange earnings, climbed at an annual rate of nine,
 percent during the same period.
 The Burmese Government's egalitarian approach to development
 has assured access by a majority of the population to basic
 economic requirements. For the last several years, when the
 GDP has been growing by 6.8 percent annually, inflation has
 been held to an average of less than three percent.
 These years have also seen a marked increase in the income
 level of most urban and rural households.
 Many shortcomings remain. Minority peoples in remote and often
 contested hill areas continue to live at the subsistance
 level. Only 17 percent of the population has access to safe
 drinking water. Inflation rates, while low, do not reflect the
 acute shortage of many products, nor the unofficial blackmarket
 prices which are often double official prices. Rising food
 prices have probably caused the real incomes of the poorest
 urban families to hold steady, or even to decline. Although
 not officially acknowledged, Burma was estimated to have
 586,000 unemployed in 1981, and underemployment is also high.
 Construction in urban areas has not kept pace with population
 growth, and there is a shortage of housing in the major
 population centers.
 According to the latest statistics available (1977), Burma
 produced or imported 106 percent of its caloric nutritional
 requirements. While food is generally available, it is
 expensive, averaging as much as 70 percent of the income of
 urban and rural families, according to some reports. Protein
 calorie malnutrition is a serious problem among young children
 and expectant mothers, largely as the result of poor dietary
 habits.
 The Government has made a major effort to expand medical
 facilities and treatment. Basic health care facilities are
 available throughout the country, and graduates of medical
 institutes enter the government health service directly for
 assignment in both rural and urban areas. In 1981, Burma had
 
 
 675
 one doctor for every 4,656 persons, compared with one for every
 15,560 persons in 1960. The health sector has received a
 relatively low place in government fiscal priorities, however,
 and hospitals are crowded, unsanitary, and lacking in equipment
 and drugs. As a consequence, there is active blackmarket
 trading in pharmaceuticals. In 1980, life expectancy at birth
 was 53.7 years; the infant mortality rate was 100.7 per 1,000
 live births.
 The Burmese Government has improved access to education at all
 levels, and equality of educational opportunity exists
 throughout the country, except in those areas the Government
 does not control. Education in.Burma is free through the
 university level, but access to higher education beyond the
 tenth standard (grade) is controlled by a system of exami-
 nations. In 1977, primary school enrollment stood at 84
 percent of school-age children -- up 58 percent from 1963.
 According to official sources, Burma had a literacy rate of
 67 percent in 1975. Literacy figures varied among states and
 divisions and between men (79 percent) and women (57 percent).
 Except for the limitations on the rights of resident aliens
 mentioned earlier, the Government does not sanction discrimi-
 -nation based on race, religion, or sex. By law and tradition,
 Burmese women may own land, obtain higher educations, enter the
 professions, and engage in business on the same basis as men.
 The 1974 Constitution specifically grants women equal political,
 economic, social, and cultural rights. Burmese women retain
 their own names after marriage and control their dowries
 throughout their marriages or in the event of divorce.
 The right to own private property alone or in association with
 others is recognized by the Constitution and respected in
 practice; the state retains residual rights to the disposition
 of land. The Government has allocated some of the prime agri-
 cultural land to state-supported cooperatives for collective
 production and marketing. Burma's land reform program in the
 countryside has made progress since 1965 toward eliminating
 rural tenancy, but, according to one report, up to one-quarter
 of the rural population may still be landless.
