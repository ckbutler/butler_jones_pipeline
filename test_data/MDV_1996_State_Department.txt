 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives cornprises 1,190 islands scattered across an area 500
 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian Ocean. The population is about 245,000
 persons. The Maldives has a parliamentary form of government with a very strong
 executive. The President a ppoints the Cabinet, members of the judiciary, and one-
 sixth of the Parliament. The President derives additional influence from his con-
 stitutional role as the protector of Islam. Political parties are officially discouraged,
 and candidates for the unicameral legislature, the Citizens' Majlis, run as individ-
 uals. The Majlis selects a single presidential nominee who is approved or rejected
 in a national referendum. The Majlis must approve all legislation and can enact leg-
 islation without presidential approval. Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, but
 civil law is generally applied in criminal and civil cases. The judiciary is subject to
 executive influence.
 The National Security Service (NSS) performs its duties under effective civilian
 control. The NSS includes the armed forces and police, and its members serve in
 both police and military capacities during their careers. The police division inves-
 tigates crimes, collects intelligence, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 Fishing, small-scale agriculture, and tourism provide employment for over one-
 half the work force. Tourism accounts for over one-quarter of government revenues
 and roughly 40 per cent of foreign exchange receipts. Manufacturing accounts for
 6 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
 The Government restricts human rights in several areas. Although the political
 rocess is incresingly open, the Government still holds political prisoners. The
 ajlis assumed a more active political role and its members routinely differed with
 government policy on many issues. However, the President's power to appoint a sig-
 nificant portion of the Parliament still constrains citizens' ability to change their
 meat. An easing of government restrictions and the Press Council's balanced
 handling of issues related to journalistic standards allowed a greater diversity of
 views in the media. Nevertheless, a journalist was convicted for comments in an ar-
 ticle about the 1994 general elections. The Government limits freedom of assembly
 and association. There are significant restrictions on the freedom of religion, and
 women face a variety of legal and social disadvantages. Some of these restrictions
 are linked to the Government's observance of Shari'a (Islamic law) and other Islamic
 customs. The Government restricts worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Ther were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Pumshment.-
 There were no reports of beatings or other mistreatment of persons in police cus-
 tdy. Convicted criminals may be flogged under judicial supervision when this pun-
 ishment is prescribed by Islamic law. However, there were no reported floggings.
 Punishments are usually confined to fines, compensatory payent, house arrest, im-
 prisonment, or banishment to a remote atoll. The Government generally permits
 those who are banished to receive visits by family members.
 Prison conditions, including food and prisoner housing, are adequate. Prisoners
 are allowed to work in prison and given the opportunity for regalar exercise and
 recreation. Spouses are allowed privacy during visits with incarcerated partners.
 The Government has permitted prison visits by foreign diplomats.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution states that no person
 shall be apprehended, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or civil law. Police
 initiate investigations based on suspicion of criminal activity or in response to writ-
 ten complaints from citizens, police officers, or government officials. They are not
 required to obtain warrants for arrests. Based on the results of police investigations,
 the Attorney Goneral refers cases to the appropriate court. The authorities generally
 keep the details of a case confidential until they are confident that the charges will
 be upheld.
 Depending on the charges, a suspect may remain free, detained in prison, or
 under house arrest for 15 day during investigations. The President may extend pre-
 trial detention for an additional 30 days, but in most cases the suspect is released
 if not brought to trial within 15 days. Those who are released pending trial may
 not leave a specific atoll. The law, however, permits indefinite detention without
 charge for suspects accused of drug abuse, terrorism, or attempted overthrow of the
 
 
 1452
 
 Government. There is no right to legal counsel during police interrogation. There
 is no provision for bail.
 The Government may prohibit access to a telephone and nonfamily visits to those
 under house arrest. While there have been no reported cases of incommunicado de-
 tention in recent years, the law does not provide safeguards against this abuse.
 The Government detained three individuals in April 1995 who remained under
 house arrest without charge until October 1995, when their detention was lifted. No
 charges were brought against them. The Government has offered no reasons for
 their detention. It is widely believed, however, that their detention was the result
 of political differences with the Government rather than due to any threat that the
 men-all of whom are elderly and well known figures--pose to national security.
 There were no reports of external exile. However, the Government sometimes ban-
 ishes citizens to remote atolls.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution does not provide for an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The judiciary is subject to executive influence. In addition to his
 authority to review High Court decisions, the President influences the judiciary
 through his power to appoint and dismiss judges, all of whom serve at this pleasure
 and are not subject to confirmation by the Majlis. The President has nevertheless
 removed only two judges since 1987. Both dismissals followed the recommendation
 of the Justice Ministry which found the judges' professional qualifications to be
 below standard. The President may also grant pardons and amnesties.
 There are four summary courts, falling under the Ministry of Justice, on the cap-
 ital island, Male'. These summary courts adjudicate specialized cases, such as debt,
 theft, or property claims. There is also a High Court on Male', which is independent
 of the Justice Ministry and which handles a wide range of cases, including politi-
 cally sensitive ones, and acts as a court of appeal. Under a 1995 presidential decree,
 High Court rulings can be reviewed by a 5-member advisory council appointed by
 the President. The President also has authority to affirm judgments of the High
 Court, order a second hearing, or overturn the Court's decision. In addition to the
 Male' courts, there are 204 general courts on the islands.
 There are no jury trials. Most trials are public and are conducted by judges and
 magistrates trained in Islamic, civil, and criminal law. Cases on outer islands are
 usually adjudicated by magistrates, but when more complex legal questions are in-
 volved, the Justice Ministry will send more experienced judges to handle the case.
 During a trial, the accused may defend himself, call witnesses, and be assisted
 by a lawyer. Courts do not provide lawyers to indigent defendants. Judges question
 the concerned parties and attempt to establish the facts of a case.
 Civil law is subordinate to Islamic law, or Shari'a. Shari'a is applied in situations
 not covered by civil law as well as in certain acts such as divorce and adultery.
 Courts adjudicating matrimonial and criminal cases generally do not allow legal
 counsel in court because, according to a local interpretation of Shari'a, all answers
 and submissions should come directly from the parties involved. However, the High
 Court allows legal counsel in all cases, including those in which the right to counsel
 was denied in the lower court. Under Islamic practice, the testimony of two women
 is required to equal that of one man in matters involving finance and inheritance.
 In other cases, the testimony of men and women are equal.
 Ilyas Ibrahim, the President's chief rival for the 1993 presidential nomination,
 had been tried in his absence in 1994 and sentenced to 15 years' banishment on
 the charge of illegally attempting to become President and to 6 months banishment
 for violating his oath as minister. ilyas returned from his self-imposed foreign exile
 in April and has been under house arrest since that time.
 There was one known political prisoner, Ibrahim Shareef (see Section 2.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits security officials from opening or reading letters, telegrams,
 and wireless messages or monitoring telephone conversations, "except in accordance
 with the specific provisions of the law." The NSS may open the mail of private citi-
 zens and monitor telephone conversations if authorized in the course of a criminal
 investigation.
 Although the Constitution requires the authorities to respect private premises and
 dwellings, there is no legal requirement for search or arrest warrants. The Attorney
 General or a commanding officer of the police must approve the search of private
 residences.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Law No. 4/68 of 1968 prohibits public state-
 ments that are contrary to Islam, threaten the public order, or are libelous. In April
 a journalist was sentenced under this law to 2 years' imprisonment for comments
 
 
 1453
 
 made about the 1994 general elections in an article published in the Philippines.
 On appeal the High Court reduced his sentence to 6 months.
 The Penal Code prohibits inciting the people against the Government. However,
 a 1990 amendment to the Penal Code decriminalized "any true account of any act
 of commission or omission past or present by the Government in a lawfully reg-
 istered newspaper or magazine, so as to reveal dissatisfaction or to effect its re-
 form."
 The Press Council established by the Government in 1994 is composed of govern-
 ment official and private media representatives, lawyers, and government officials.
 The Council met regularly and private journalists were satisfied with its objectivity
 and performance. Regulations that made publishers responsible for the content of
 the material they published remained in effect, but did not result in any legal ac-
 tions against publishers. The Government agreed that private journalists, rather
 than the Government, should take responsibility for preparation of a journalistic
 code of ethics. Individual newspapers and journals established their own ethical
 guidelines in many cases. The Government has not amended regulations that make
 publishers responsible for the content of the material they publish, despite reports
 in 1994 that the regulations were under review and a change was likely.
 There were no reports of government censorship of either the print or electronic
 media, nor were there closures of any publications or reports of intimidation of jour-
 nalists. The only journalist, Ibrahim Shareef, convicted under Law 4/68 of 1968 had
 been originally arrested in 1994. No journalists were arrested in 1996. The Govern-
 ment discontinued its practice of providing reporting guidelines to the media in
 1994.
 Television news and public affairs programming routinely discussed topics of cur-
 .rent concern and freely criticized government performance. Regular press con-
 ferences instituted with government ministers in 1995, continued. Journalist are
 more self-confident than in the past and self-censorship seems to have abated.
 The Government owns and operates the only television and radio station. It does
 not interfere with foreign broadcasts or the sale of satellite receivers. Reports drawn
 from foreign newscasts are aired on the government television station. Cable News
 Network is shown, uncensored, daily on local television. In October a private com-
 pany began providing Internet services. The Government enacted no regulations
 governing Internet access but does seek to block distribution of pornographic mate-
 rial via Internet.
 Ninety-two newspapers and periodicals are registered with the Government.
 Aafathis, a morning daily, is published by the brother of the President's principal
 political rival, Ilyas Ibrahim, and is often critical of government policy. A new daily,
 Miadhu, began publishing in October and Haveeru is the evening daily. Both
 Miadhu's and Haveeru's publishers are progovernment.
 There are no legal prohibitions on the import of foreign publications except those
 containing pornography or material otherwise deemed objectionable to Islamic val-
 ues. No seizures of foreign publications were reported during the year. There are
 no reported restrictions on academic freedom, nor any governmental censorship or
 control over classroom materials. Some teachers are reportedly vocal in their criti-
 cism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assembly, as long as the law or the Islarmic code of behavior are upheld.
 The Home Ministry permits public political meetings during electoral campaigns but
 limits them to small gatherings on private premises.
 The Government registers clubs and other private associations if they do not con-
 travene Islamic or civil law. While not forbidden by law, political parties are offi-
 cially discouraged by the President on the grounds that they are inappropriate to
 the homogeneous nature of society. However, many Majlis members were active and
 outspoken critics of the Government and have stimulated closer parliamentary ex-
 amination of government policy.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The Con-
 stitution designates Islam as the official religion and requires all citizens to be Mus-
 lims. The practice of any religion other than Islam is prohibited by law. However,
 foreign residents are allowed to practice their religion if they do so privately.
 There are no places of worship for adherents of other religions. The Government
 prohibits the importation of icons and religious statues. It also prohibits non-Muslim
 clergy and missionaries from proselytizing and conducting public worship services.
 Conversion of a Muslim to another faith is a violation of Shari'a and may result in
 a loss of the convert's citizenship, although law enforcement authorities say this pro-
 vision has never been applied.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel at home and abroad, emigrate, and return.
 
 
 1454
 
 Because of overcrowding, the Government discourages migration into the capital is-
 land of Male' or its surrounding atoll. The issue of the provision of first asylum did
 not arise in 1996. The Government has not formulated a policy regarding first asy-
 lum. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens" ability to change their government is constrained, as a strong executive
 exerts significant influence over both the legislature and the judiciary. TIhe Majlis
 chooses a single presidential nominee who must be a Sunni Muslim male. The can-
 didate is not permitted to campaign for the nomination and is confirmed or rejected
 by secret ballot in a nationwide referendum. In 1993 President Gayoom was re-
 elected to a fourth 5.year term.
 The elected members of the Majls serve 5-year terms. All citizens over 21 years
 of age may vote. Of the body's 48 members, 40 are elected-2 from each of the 19
 inhbited atolls and 2 from Male'--and the President appoints 8 members. Individ-
 uals or groups are free to approach members of the Malis with grevances o  pn
 gxivace or opin-
  proposed legislation, and any member may introdue legislation.
 The Office of the President is the most powerful political institution. The Con-
 stitution gives Islamic law preeminence over civil law and designates the President
 as the protector of Islam. The President's authority to appoint one-sixth of the
 Majlis members, which is one-third of the total needed for nominating the Presi-
 dent, provides the President with a power base and strong political leverage.
 Relations between the Government and Majlis have been constructive. The Gov-
 ernment may introduce legislation, but may not enact a bill into law without the �
 Majlis' approval. However, the Malis may enact legislation into law without presi-
 dential assent if the President fails to act on the proposal within 30 days or if a
 bill is repassed with a two-thirds majority. In recent years, the Majlis has become
 increasingly independent, challenging government policies and rejecting government
 proposed legislation.
 In 1993 the Majlis introduced a question time in which members may question
 government ministers about public  licy. Debate on the floor has since beome in-
 creasingly sharp and more open. The last Majlis election was held in December
 1995. According to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation observers, the
 elections were generally free and fair. Irregularities were observed and replling re-
 quired in one of 29 constituencies. Over 200 candidates campaigned freely for 40
 seats.
 Women are not eligible to become president but may hold other government posts.
 For reasons of tradition and culture, few women seek or are selected for public of-
 fice. Two women served in the Majlis and one in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Huan Rights
 There are no active local human rights groups. The Government has been respon-
 sive to at least one foreign government's interest in examining human rights issues.
 The Government also facilitated the visit of a team of South Asian Association for
 Regional Cooperation. election observers in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares all Maldivians equal before the law, but there is no spe-
 cific provisions to prohibit discriminiation based on these factors. Women have tra-
 ditionally been disadvantaged in Maldivian society, particularly in terms of edu-
 cation and the application of Islamic law to matters such as divorce, inheritance,
 and testimony in legal proceedings.
 Women.-There are no firm data on the extent of violence against women because
 of the value attached to privacy in this conservative society. Police officials report
 that they receive few complaints of assaults against women. Maldivian women's
 rights advocates agree that wife beating and other forms of violence are not wide-
 spread. Rape and other violent crimes against women are rare.
 Women traditionally have played a subordinate role in society, although they now
 participate in public life in growing numbers and gradually are participating at
 higher levels. Well-educated women maintain that cultural norms, not the law, in-
 hibit womens education and career choices. In many instances, education for girls
 is curtailed after the seventh grade, largely because parents do not allow girls to
 leave their home island for one having a secondary school. Due largely to orthodox
 Islamic training, there is a strong strain of conservative sentiment--especially
 
 
 1455
 among small businessmen and residents of the outer islands-which opposes an ac-
 tive role for women outside the home.
 Under Islamic practice, husbands may divorce their wives more easily than vice
 versa, absent any mutual agreement to divorce. Islamic law also governs inherit-
 ance, granting male heirs twice the share of female heirs. A woman's testimony is
 equal to only one-half of that of a man in matters involving finance and inheritance
 (see Section i.e.). Women who work for wages receive pay equal to that of men in
 the ssme positions. About 10 per cent of uniformed NSS personnel are women.
 Children.-The Government does not have a pro gam of compulsory education.
 The Government is committed to protection of children's rights and welfare. Govern-
 ment policy provides for equal access to educational and health progpums for both
 male and female children. Laws protecting children's ights apply with equal force
 to children of either sex.
 Children's rights are incorporated into law, which secifically protects children
 from both physical and psychological abuse, including Muse at the hands of teach-
 ers or parents. The Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to enforce this law,
 takes its responsibility seriously, and has received strong popular support for its ef-
 forts. There is no reported societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no law that specifically addresses the rights
 of the physically or mentally disabled. However, the Government has established
 programs and provided services for the disabled. There is no legislated or mandated
 accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-While the Government does not expressly prohibit
 unions, it recogaizes neither the right to form them nor the right to strike. There
 were no reports of efforts to form unions during the year. The only strike involved
 a short-lived protest by some foreign workers upset over the deportation of one of
 their countrymen.
 The work force consists of approximately 60,000 persons, about 20 percent of
 whom are employed in fishing. About 20,000 foreigners work in Maldives, many in
 tourist hotels, factories, or on construction projects. The great majority of workers
 are employed outside the wage sector. The Government estimates that the manufac-
 turing sector employs about 15 percent of the labor force and tourism another 10
 percent.
 In 1995 the U.S. Government suspended Maldives' eligibility for tariff preferences
 under the US. Generalized System of Preferences because the Government failed
 to take steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to Maldivian work-
 ers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law neither prohibits nor
 protects workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. Wages in the private
 sector are set by contract between employers and employees and are usually based
 on the rates for similar work in the public sector. There are no laws specifically pro-
 hibiting antiunion discrimination by employers against union members or organiz-
 ers. The Government has exerted pressure in the past to discourage seamen from
 joining foreign seamen's unions as a means to secure higher wages. There have been
 no reported complaints alleging such discrimination or claiming government inter-
 ference with workers' attempts to join unions in the past 3 years.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 prohibited by law. However, there were no reports that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no compulsory education
 law. A 1992 law bars childrn under 14 years of age from "places of waged works
 and from work that is not suitable for that child's age, health, or physical ability
 or that might obstruct the education or adversely affect the mentality or behavior
 of the child" An earlier law prohibits government employment of children under the
 age of 16. There are no reports of children being employed in the small industrial
 sector, although children work in family fishing, agricultural, and commercial activi-
 ties. The hours of work of young workers are not specifically limited by statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1994 the Government promulgated its first
 set of regulations for employer-employee relations. The regulations specify the terms
 that must be incorporated into employment contracts and address such issues as
 training, work hours, safety, remuneration, leave, fines, termination, etc. There is
 no national minimum wage for the private sector, although the Government has es-
 tablished wage floors for certain kinds of work. Given the severe shortage of labor,
 employers must offer competitive pay and conditions to attract skilled workers.
 There are no statutory provisions for hours of work, but the regulations require
 that a work contact specify the normal work and overtime hours on a weekly or
 
 
 1456
 monthly basis. In the public sector, a 7-hour day and a 5-day workweek have been
 established through administrative circulars from the President's office. Overtime
 pay in the public sector was instituted in 1990. Employees are authorized 20 days
 of annual leave, 30 days of medical leave, maternity leave of 45 days, and special
 annual leave of 10 days for extraordinary circumstances. There are no laws govern-
 ing health and safety conditions; however, there are regulatory requirements that
 employers provide a safe working environment and ensure the observance of safety
 measures. It is unclear, however, whether workers can remove themselves from un-
 safe working conditions without risking the loss of their jobs.
