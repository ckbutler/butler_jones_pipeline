 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 emirates established in 1971. Each emirate retains extensive
 control over such importaht matters as economic policy
 (including oil), internal security, and some aspects of
 defense. There are no popular elections, either local or
 federal. Emirate rulers govern by virtue of longstanding
 tribal tradition. In accordance with the 1971 Constitution,
 the seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council
 which ia the UAE's highest legislative and executive body, but
 which seldom meets. In practice, the legislative and
 executive work is delegated to the various emirates and the
 more active federal ministries. The Supreme Council selects a
 President and Vice President from its membership; each serves
 a 5-year term. The President in turn appoints a prime
 minister and a cabinet.
 Some of the individual emirates maintain independent internal
 security organizations which are active in antinarcotics and
 antiterrorist activity. These organizations are under
 government control.
 The economy is based on oil and gas production, which has made
 the UAE's per capita income one of the world's highest. It
 has a largely free market economy, but the oil enterprises of
 Abu Dhabi and Dubai, which account for most of the UAE's
 revenue, are state-owned enterprises of these two emirates. A
 small citizen population controls the country's economic life
 but depends heavily on a much larger contingent of foreigners
 to provide manual labor and technical skills. The UAE's four
 emirates with small or no petroleum resources are dependent on
 federal government subsidies for such essential services as
 health, electricity, and water.
 There were no major changes in the UAE human rights picture in
 1989. Principal human rights concerns continued to be abuse
 of prisoners and restrictions on freedom of speech and press,
 assembly and association, the right of citizens to change
 their government, and women's and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No political killings or other extrajudicial killings were
 reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment of
 any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an accused
 person. No instances of torture were reported in 1989.
 However, Amnesty International (AI), in its 1989 Report
 covering 1988, noted that several criminal suspects were
 reported to have been tortured, including being caned. It
 also reported that it had received new information about the
 alleged torture of criminal prisoners in previous years,
 
 
 1603
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 including a Pakistani national beaten by police in Abu Dhabi
 in 1986.
 In 1989 there was one instance of amputation of a hand as
 punishment for theft in conformance with clerical (Shari'a)
 law, which is still an integral part of the judicial system.
 There were also several criminal cases in which flogging was
 the prescribed punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arrest, search, detention, or
 imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws
 of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable
 cause. By law, the police must report any arrest to a judge
 within 48 hours for his determination whether to charge,
 release, or, with sufficient police justification, allow
 limited further detention pending in investigation. Prolonged
 detention without charge is rare, although there have been
 instances where foreign businessmen have been detained pending
 settlement of a business dispute with UAE nationals. Once
 charged, suspects come to trial reasonably quickly. The
 reabsorption of the Ministry of Justice by the Ministry of
 Islamic Affairs in March 1989 reportedly has made the judicial
 system slower and less organized. There is no system of
 bail. In 1989 theke were no reported instances of preventive
 detention. Consular access to imprisoned foreign nationals is
 permitted, although it is sometimes delayed. There were no
 known instances of incommunicado detention.
 The Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens. Noncitizens
 convicted of crimes are subject to deportation.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of clerical (Shari'a) and lay
 courts, each of which deals with both criminal and civil cases.
 The clerical courts are administered by each emirate, but the
 lay courts are usually part of the federal system and are
 answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi.
 However, Dubai's and two other smaller emirates' civil court
 systems are independent of the federal system. Each court
 system has a multilevel appeals process. Either the plaintiff
 or the nature of the case determines which court system hears
 a particular case. Due process rights are uniformly exercised
 under both clerical and civil court procedure. There is a
 presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.
 Legal- counsel is readily available and permitted to represent
 a defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint
 legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no
 system of state payment of public defenders exists. However,
 the losing party may be required to pay the winner's legal
 fees. The judge looks after the interests of a person not
 represented by counsel.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to upset public
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. There has
 been no evidence in at least the past several years of rulers
 interfering in the judicial process, In 1989 the UAE
 President did, however, decide by decree that the Ministry of
 
 
 1604
 
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Islamic Affairs should reabsorb the Ministry of Justice.
 Commercial law is still in a rudimentary stage of development
 in the UAE, and this results in some confusion and accusations
 of bias. The criminal court system, however, is generally
 regardeU as fair and its judgments well considered. There is
 no separate national -security court system. The military has
 its own .court system based on Western military judicial
 practice. Military tribunals try only military personnel.
 There are no known political prisoners in the UAE.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the
 ownerld permission, except in accordance with the law.
 Although the police can enter homes without a warrant and
 without demonstrating probable cause in advance, an officer is
 answerable if he abuses his authority in doing so.- Anyone
 other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a
 private home. Local custom and practice place a high value on
 .privacy, and violabions af it are rare. IThere is no
 surveillance of private-correspondence. Except for:raxe
 instances involving nationel security, no.cases of arbitrary
 interference with-privacy have been reported in recent years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of 'Speech and Press
 UAE citizens are constitutionally assured freedom of speech.
 In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially foreign
 nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive
 political topics or in criticizing the Government. All
 television and radio stations ,are government owned and conform
 to reporting guidelines. :Although many of the local English-
 and Arabic-language newspapers are privately owned, all but
 one receive .government subsidies. Thekpress operates under
 the same self-censorship arrangement as broadcast media.
 Self-censorship by journalists make official censorship rare.
 Local newspapers are normally, cautious in reporting on
 government policy, the Tuling families, national security,
 religious matters, and relations with neighboring states.
 Several years ago, .a newspaper was closed temporarily for
 reporting to-which the Government took exception.
 The ceflsorship department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture reviews all imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos, and bansiitems considered pornographic,
 vi'olent, derogatory to. Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly
 critical of friendly countries, or critical of the Government
 or the ruling families. Authorities confiscate material
 written in the Hebrew language and prohibit sale of Iranian
 newspapers and ,magazines. The small publishing industry is
 subject to gbvernment censorship in accordance with the above
 criteria. The unwritten but widely accepted ban on criticism
 of the Government also restricts academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Organized public gatherings require a government permit. In
 practice, public gatherings are rare. Political organizations
 are prohibited. The citizen population normally confines its
 political discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies"
 (majlises), held in private homes, which are a local
 
 
 1605
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 tradition. There are no restrictions on the formation of
 private associations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion. Non-Muslims are free to
 practice their religion, but may not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. By tradition and social
 custom, non-Muslims may worship in their own way, and several
 churches exist in major cities. A group of Christian churches
 in the capital, Abu Dhabi, were built on land which was a gift
 from President Zayed. Foreign clergymen are allowed to
 minister to expatriate congregations. No religions other than
 Islam may conduct religious training. All religions engage in
 private charitable activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are'permitted to citizens, except those involved in
 financial disputes under adjudication. Exit visas are not
 required. All citizens have the right of return. There are
 no known instances of revocation of citizenship for political
 reasons.
 The UAE and its members individually have long accepted groups
 of displaced persons, such as Palestinians and Lebanese, and
 those attracted by economic opportunity, such as Iranians.
 Although lacking a formalized procedure for accepting
 refugees, the UAE has occasionally granted Iranians refugee
 status if they demonstrate that they would face persecution in
 Iran. Iranians, if intercepted attempting to enter the
 country illegally, generally are denied entry.
 There were no instances of forced resettlement in the UAE in
 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The UAE has no formal democratic institutions, and citizens do
 not have the right to change their government. The bulk of
 executive and legislative power is in the hands of the seven
 emirate rulers, their families, and those individuals and
 families to whom they are allied by historical ties, marriage,
 or common interest. These emirate political leaders
 constitute the dominant political force at the national level,
 especially through their use of power in the Supreme Council
 of emirate rulers. Political parties are prohibited.
 Although the rulers and ruling families by tradition are
 presumed to have the right to rule, their incumbency
 ultimately depends on the quality of their leadership and
 responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Some emirate rulers
 are accessible, in varying degree, to citizens who have a
 problem or request. The choice of a new ruler falls to the
 ruling family, which is supposed to choose its most capable
 and respected eligible member. In practice, to avoid violent
 
 
 1606
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 succession disputes, which were common in the past,
 primogeniture has become the rule.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life.
 A complex system of distribution of wealth, including through
 the federal and emirate governments, ensures generous
 subsidies and a high standard of living for UAE citizens.
 This in turn has helped to earn a high level of acceptability
 for the Goverhment.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The UAE has been responsive in some xses to international
 criticism of its human rights situation.-For example, it
 improved its labor laws following criticism that low-paid
 foreign workers were being mistreated.
 In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI noted that it had
 expressed concern to the UAE authorities about reports of
 detention without trial qnd possible torture or ill-treatment
 of detainees, of threats of forcible repatriation of Iranian
 nationals, and of executions, but that no responses were
 received from the Government.
 The UAE does not permit any internal groups which would
 monitor human rights, and no outside human rights group
 visited the UAE in 1989.
 Section 5 'Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most'UAE'womqn still play a traditional family-centered role
 in UAE society. Traditional attitudes about women's roles and
 the frequency of early marriage still limit women's
 educational and employment opportunities. However, women's
 education'is advancing rapidly (females routinely outscore
 males in many subjects at all levels), and females now
 outnumber males at the UAE National University. The new
 medical school has more women than men. Opportunities for
 women are growing in government service and the media, in
 addition to the more traditional fields of-education and
 health.
 There are no restrictions on the right of UAE women to own
 property or to engage in marriage contracts as equal
 partners. A woman's property is not commingled with that of
 her husIband.
 Although'violence against women, such as wife beating and the
 abuse of domestic servants, is known to occur in the UAE,
 little is known about its extent. The Koran is considered to
 allow a husband to discipline his wife, a principle which some
 might interpret to permit discipline with force. Abuse
 occurring within the family is seldom mentioned because of the
 value attached to personal privacy in this traditional
 society. The Government does not acknowledge the existence of
 a problem. Excessive violence against women would be grounds
 for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on these
 charges in the UAE are believed to be rare.
 
 
 1607
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Legislation which would limit the marriage of UAE citizens to
 foreigners is under consideration, and, even at present, only
 marriage to a UAE male confers citizenship on the spouse.
 Although many foreigners have lived in the UAE for years and
 have held highly responsible positions, few have been granted
 citizenship. The President can grant UAE citizenship for
 loyal and valuable service to the State.
 There is no noticeable discrimination because of race or
 language. UAE citizens are almost all Arabs and speakers of
 Arabic.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize unions and to strike is
 neither explicitly legal or illegal under UAE law. There are
 no unions and no strikes. Foreign workers who might attempt
 to organize a union risk deportation.
 The UAE has been a member of the International Labor
 Organization since 1972, but it has ratified neither its
 Convention 87 regarding Freedom of Association nor Convention
 98 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to engage
 in collective bargaining. For the resolution of work-related
 disputes, workers must rely on conciliation committees,
 organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and to
 special labor courts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths below age 18.
 Since the children of UAE nationals have little incentive to
 work and only adult foreign workers are allowed in the
 country, there is virtually no child labor. There is
 compulsory education of children to age 12.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated minimum wage in the UAE. Work hours
 are restricted to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week, but this
 is not strictly enforced. The UAE sets health and safety
 standards, which are enforced by the Ministry of Health, the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities, and the
 Civil Defense. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs,
 which oversees such matters as worker compensation, is
 understaffed and underbudgeted. The Ministry of Health, on
 the other hand, is active and effective, and has developed a
 good health care system.
 Foreign nationals from Pakistan, India, the Philippines,
 Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in
 large numbers because wages are far higher than in their own
 countries or because work is unavailable there. Foreign
 workers' salaries often are inadequate to meet the cost of
 housing and other amenities at prevailing UAE standards.
 
 
 1608
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 However,' most foreign workers receive some form of.housing
 from their employer.- Employers are required to pay a small
 -sum <less than $100) for National Health Service cards for
 foreign workers. The latter then have-access to free medical
 care. The UAE Government has made.giftsof numerous social
 centers for various foreign national groups. Most foreign
 workers remit as much of their salaries'aspossible to their
 ,families in their home countries. Foreign workers.earning
 more than the U.S. equivalent of 41,000 per month may bring
 their families. The vast majority of foreign-workers do not
 qualify to bring their families. The.pool of foreign workers,
 most ofthem actively recruited from abroad, meets the demand
 in the UAE for domestic and service workers and manual
 laborers.
 There are many com laints that recruiters use unscrupulous
 tactics andenticeforeign manual laborers and domestics to
 the UAE on the basis of false salary and-benefits promises.
 Such cases can be appealed-to the Labor Ministry and, if this
 does not resolve the issue, to the-courts. -However, many
 laborers are reluctant to pxotest or to engage in such a
 lengthy process because of- fear of reprisals by their
 employers. A foreign worker must get permission from the
 previous employer to move to a new job with a different
 employer. UAE law provides for a minimum of-24.days per year
 of annual leave plus 10 national and religious holi-days.
 Though not a legal "requirement, many employers provide as a
 fringe benefit an annual round-trip airplane ticket for �he
 employee to return home. Employers are required to -pay
 airfate both. to the UAE when-the employee arrives and to his
 own country when he returns.
