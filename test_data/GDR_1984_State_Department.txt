 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was created in
 1949 out of the former Soviet occupation zone of Germany.
 There are still nearly 400,000 Soviet troops stationed in the
 country. East Germany's Government closely resembles the
 Soviet model, and internationally recognized human rights are
 routinely suppressed. The country is ruled by the East German
 Communist Party, known as the Socialist Unity Party. It has a
 centrally planned, industrialized economy with a relatively
 high standard of living.
 Profound historical, cultural, and family ties remain between
 the people of the German Democratic Republic and those of the
 Federal Republic of Germany. These links are enhanced by West
 German radio and television broadcasts, which can be received
 in most of East Germany, and by approximately 8 million visits
 annually. The concern that these ties and the constant
 exposure to Western values could undermine support for the
 Government is a central factor in East Germany's tight control
 of its population.
 East Germany's ruling party sees it as its duty to suppress
 all forms of opposition in its attempt to achieve the
 Communist transformation of society. Hence, while the
 freedoms of speech, press, religion, and assembly are
 theoretically guaranteed in the Constitution, the Government
 does not tolerate their exercise in ways which could contest
 party policy or doctrines. All important national decisions
 are made by the party, which through its Control Commission
 monitors strictly the activities of its members. Four
 additional parties are allowed a token existence, but have
 little independence and no power. Elections are not
 democratic: voters are presented every 5 years with a single
 list of candidates for the Volkskammer (Parliament) and local
 assemblies. Voting is not secret, and East Germans who refuse
 to vote or who reject the entire ballot may suffer reprisals.
 East Germany has an efficient security apparatus administered
 by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of State
 Security. Together, they employ approximately 300,000
 persons. The activities of the secret police are pervasive.
 They do not hesitate to install listening devices, to open
 private mail, to place groups and individuals under
 surveillance, or to subject people to intimidation and
 interrogation. The secret police maintain an extensive system
 of voluntary or coerced informers.
 Minefields, guard dogs, and electrified fences make East
 Germany's Western border nearly impermeable. In November, the
 Government of the Federal Republic of Germany announced that
 the East German Government had removed all SM-70 automatic
 shooting devices from its border with West Germany. However,
 even before the removal of these devices began in 1983, the
 German Democratic Republic began modifying the border barrier
 system in a way that would make it more difficult for illegal
 refugees to escape. Any who attempt unauthorized crossing
 still risk death.
 Western human rights groups estimate that there were 6,000 to
 9,500 political prisoners in the German Democratic Republic in
 1984. This is an increase from the estimated 5,000 political
 prisoners in 1983. It is thought that more than half of these
 prisoners were jailed because they submitted an application to
 leave the country or tried to flee East Germany without
 
 
 979
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 permission. Over 400 East Germans were arrested in 1984 after
 visiting Western diplomatic missions in East Berlin.
 In 1984, the Government permitted nearly 40,000 East Germans
 to emigrate, an increase from the previous year. However, the
 vast majority of emigration visas were granted between January
 and may. Since July, only about 600-1,000 exit visas have
 been issued each month, a figure consistent with the average
 monthly rate of past years. It is estimated that 300,000 to
 500,000 East Germans have expressed a desire to emigrate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 A 1982 law codified orders to border guards that they should
 shoot, if necessary, to prevent a person from attempting to
 leave East Germany without authorization. It is not known how
 many people have been shot while trying to flee across the
 border separating East and West Germany, but guards have shot
 to death at least 55 people who attempted flight across the
 wall separating Berlin (West) from the German Democratic
 Republic and Berlin (East). The last such shooting death
 occurred on December 1, 1984. An additional 18 people are
 known to have died due to other causes while trying to cross
 to Berlin (West).
 According to the Federal Republic of Germany, by the end of
 November 1984 the German Democratic Republic had removed from
 along the inner-German border all automatic shooting devices,
 which fired ballbearings and shrapnel over a 25-meter area
 when triggered by a trip wire. It is not known how many
 people had been killed by these devices.
 During 1984, there were reports that, on at least one
 occasion, private citizens were killed in violent clashes with
 suspected members of the secret police.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of permanent disappearance in East
 Germany during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of systematic torture in 1984. Specific
 laws state that life, health, and ability to work of arrestees
 and prisoners must not be jeopardized during confinement.
 However, former detainees and prisoners have reported
 deliberate psychological strain in East German prisons.
 Arrestees have reported long, uninterrupted interrogations
 without sleep, food, or drink, followed by threats and demands
 to sign statements or blank pieces of paper which would later
 have statements entered on them.
 Fragmentary information, derived mainly from former inmates
 who have emigrated, indicates that there are also instances of
 beatings and other forms of physical mistreatment by
 individual guards. According to these reports, cells are
 overcrowded, and illnesses caused by vitamin deficiencies and
 
 
 980
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 inadequate sanitary facilities are prevalent. Prisoners are
 supposed to have access to medical facilities, but service is
 often slow and relatively poor in quality. There are
 allegations of a scarcity of medication, and of treatment by
 personnel with little or no medical training.
 Former inmates have stated there are many work-related
 injuries caused by inadequate safety measures and the demand
 that high work quotas be fulfilled using obsolete machines.
 There are also reports that prisoners are forced to work in
 particularly dangerous industries, such as chemical plants,
 where it is difficult to recruit free citizens.
 Prisoners, except for those being punished for violations of
 prison regulations, are generally allowed to have two visitors
 per month.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In practice, the police have blanket authority to detain and
 interrogate East Germans on suspicion alone. Arrest may
 result when people merely express dissenting views. East
 Germans who become particularly active in ways the Government
 disapproves of are sometimes subject to recurrent harassment,
 such as police interrogations on a regular basis--sometimes as
 often as once a week for long periods of time--without charges
 being filed against them.
 There is a high degree of subjectivity in the application of
 the Penal Code. The charges filed in clearly political cases
 are often based on laws which are written in vague and general
 language. Section 99 of the Code, for instance, states that
 the transmission of information "detrimental to the interests
 of the German Democratic Republic' (even if it is not secret)
 can be considered treason. There are laws against 'anti-state
 agitation" and *asocial behavior" (parasitism). These are
 often applied selectively against East Germans who become
 politically active. For example, Baerbel Bohley and Ulrike
 Poppe, two leading figures of an East Berlin peace group, were
 arrested and charged under Article 99 with transmitting
 detrimental information to Westerners. Faced with mounting
 publicity in the West, the German Democratic Republic released
 the women in January 1984 after they had spent more than a
 month in jail.
 East Germans can be arrested with or without warrants. When
 held in detention, a person does not have the right to a
 judicial determination of his continued detention. All
 attorneys are employees of the state and are supervised by the
 Ministry of Justice. Every East German citizen has the right
 to legal counsel of his own choosing, but there are only a
 handful of lawyers who are willing to take on political and
 emigration cases. In practice, few East Germans make use of
 this right, and most act as their own defense.
 German Democratic Republic law requires prompt notification to
 an arrested person's family or employer. However, the
 Criminal Procedure Code allows the public prosecutor to
 postpone such notification if it would 'endanger the objective
 of the investigation.'  In political cases, it may take many
 weeks before interested parties are notified. Visiting rights
 by relatives are restricted and are held under tight security
 provisions. It is ironic that, while sharply limiting the
 emigration and travel of workers below retirement age, East
 
 
 981
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 German authorities have threatened some political activists
 with arrest and imprisonment if they did not emigrate.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 East German law provides for a fair public trial for
 defendants in civil and criminal cases. In cases'involving
 security and political issues, however, judges can authorize
 closed trials. Virtually all political trials are closed. On
 the same grounds, judges can bar individuals or groups from
 .open" trials. There is no hearing prior to such decisions
 and no appeal from them. Police checks outside courtrooms are
 sometimes designed to intimidate individuals into not
 attending trials.
 Although defendants are guaranteed the right to a lawyer of
 their choice, there are many hindrances to effective counsel.
 Defendants are often not allowed to choose their lawyers until
 a few days before the trial or to discuss the specifics of the
 case with lawyers until the investigation is completed and
 formal charges are brought, a process which may take months.
 Defense attorneys must also request permission to meet clients
 in private, and there is no guarantee that the request will be
 granted. Attorneys are not allowed to make photocopies or
 tape recordings of their clients' court file. The file can
 only be viewed in the court, and notes must be taken in
 longhand.
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. Constitutionally,
 the courts are under the control of the Council of State; in
 reality they are controlled by the party, which appoints the
 judges. Military courts try civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 East Germany does not admit to having political prisoners, nor
 does it publish statistics which would enable one to know the
 exact number of political prisoners held. However, the West
 German-based International Society for Human Rights estimates
 there are 6,000 political prisoners in the German Democratic
 Republic. The August 13 Working Group, a human rights
 organization in Berlin (West), puts this figure at 9,500 (40
 percent of whom were arrested after filing an application to
 emigrate). As of mid-September 1984, 1,500 political
 prisoners had been released to the West. Amnesty
 International has noted that many political prisoners are
 released only after the payment of a fee by the West German
 Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 By law, the police need authorization to enter and search a
 house, but the police can authorize entry themselves and the
 courts will retroactively give approval. The authorities
 reportedly do not investigate complaints of abuse. The police
 do not have to give a receipt if they confiscate materials in
 a home.
 It is routine and legal for the state security organs, solely
 on their own authority, to tap telephones and to open mail.
 Evidence collected in this manner may be used in court. East
 Germans often claim to be subjected to hidden tape recording,
 opening of their mail, and physical surveillance if they have
 unauthorized contacts with Westerners or in any way arouse the
 
 
 982
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 curiosity of the State Security Services. The most reliable
 Western sources estimate the Ministry for State Security alone
 has between 60,000 and 80,000 undercover agents and
 informers. The Government's purpose is to instill a
 widespread belief that state security informants are
 ubiquitous and that opposition to the Government is therefore
 almost certain to be discovered and punished.
 All printed materials require an official permit. Only
 magazines and newspapers bearing a-postal license may be
 legally distributed. These regulations effectively block the
 legal receipt by individuals of materials not approved by the
 Government.
 West German television can be viewed by 80 percent of East
 Germans. Western radio can be heard throughout the country.
 The Government no longer attempts to jam or otherwise hinder
 the reception of Western broadcasts.
 Young people are not forced to join the party's youth
 movement, the Free German Youth (Freie Deutsche Jugend).
 However, school and government authorities make it clear that
 failure to join this group will limit educational and job
 opportunities.
 East Germans must obtain permission from the Government to
 marry foreigners. Generally, the marriage must take place in
 East Germany. Those granted permission are expected to
 emigrate without delay after the wedding. Since the passage
 of a law in October 1983, there has been a higher approval
 rate and a more expeditious handling of applications for
 marriages.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All media are government-controlled and censored. All
 publications must be licensed before distribution. Western
 newspapers and magazines, other than politically acceptable
 publications such as those of Western Communist parties, are
 unavailable to the general public. Some libraries, university
 departments, and official institutes receive Western
 publications, but circulation is restricted. Border officials
 frequently refuse entry to travelers to East Germany carrying
 prohibited Western publications or confiscate them before
 allowing the traveler entry. East German citizens and Western
 travelers can be arrested and interrogated simply for
 possessing such documents. In July, the German Democratic
 Republic agreed that it would be more flexible in allowing
 travelers from the Federal Republic of Germany to bring in
 literature and other printed matter as well as in permitting
 the receipt in East Germany of phonograph records mailed from
 West Germany.
 Written and unwritten rules severely limit East German contact
 with Western journalists. By law, the ordinary citizen may
 not maintain contact with foreign journalists.
 East Germans face drastic reprisals for publicly expressing
 views contrary to government policy. Tim Petersdorf, 21 years
 old, was sentenced to 19 months in prison after he produced
 handbills advocating peace. In Gera, four members of a church
 group received 8- to 12-month prison terms after they placed
 
 
 983
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 handbills in private mailboxes questioning the official
 Government policy that peace can be obtained by military
 means. In February, four members of the *Monday Circle,* a
 church discussion and action group in Weimar, were given 5- to
 8-month sentences after they allegedly painted a sign
 criticizing the stationing of Soviet missiles in East
 Germany. An East German court sentenced four other members of
 the same group to 24- to 34-month prison terms in mid-July.
 The charges were that they distributed handbills which
 criticized the Government's peace and environmental policies
 and called for a boycott of the May 6 local elections. Silvia
 Goethe, a member of an independent peace group, received a
 20-month prison term for "passing information detrimental to
 the German Democratic Republic.'
 The ruling Communist Party considers art and literature to be
 an integral part of its revolutionary struggle, not a forum
 for expressing individual perceptions or opinions. Unions for
 artists and writers are headed by party officials and
 controlled by the state. Almost all literary figures who are
 critical of the regime are expelled from these associations,
 thereby losing certain privileges. Publishing houses engage
 in self-censorship and works must also be cleared by official
 organs before publication. Some works are banned completely;
 others may be published outside the country only under
 contracts negotiated by the state-run literary agency. The
 noted East German author Stefan Heym, whose latest book
 'Schwarzenberg" was a best seller in the Federal Republic, has
 been unable to publish in the German Democratic Republic for a
 decade. Lyricist Elke Erb was refused permission to publish
 in the West an anthology listing 30 'New Generation' East
 German authors. Artists and writers who try to circumvent
 government restrictions are prosecuted.
 Singer-song writer Karlheinz Bomberg received a 30-month
 suspended jail sentence after he sought to pass homemade tape
 recordings of his songs to friends in the West. A freelance
 writer, Detlef Opitz, was warned he would be imprisoned if he
 did not accept a job offered him by the state and cease his
 writings.
 Popular music groups must generally have their lyrics approved
 by the state. Western groups must also submit to censorship
 to perform. The Free German Youth canceled a contract for a
 1984 tour of the German Democratic Republic by West German
 rock star Udo Lindenberg after Lindenberg spoke against Soviet
 as well as NATO missile deployment at a concert in 1983. The
 West German rock group BAP was prohibited from playing at a
 concert in East Germany after they refused to pledge that they
 would not perform one of their songs which stated that the
 East German army heightened fear.
 Individual academic freedom is not permitted. The state views
 education as an instrument for 'building socialism,' and all
 areas of academic inquiry are strictly controlled. A magazine
 for Communist Party functionaries, Neuer Weg, reported a party
 Central Committee resolution which stated that teachers and
 educators must act as propagandists of Marxism-Leninism and of
 official party policy. The resolution also urged local party
 leaders to devote greater attention to the Marxist-Leninist
 qualifications of educators. Teachers who allow open
 discussions in the classroom or deviate from the party line
 are disciplined. Many books are prohibited totally; others
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 63
 
 
 984
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 are permitted only in university libraries to which only
 carefully screened and authorized personnel are allowed access.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution states that there is freedom of
 assembly, only government-organized demonstrations are
 allowed. Government permission is required for public
 events. The Government uses this requirement to block
 unwanted public meetings, smaller discussion groups, and, on
 some occasions, gatherings in private homes. Article 219 of
 the Penal Code subjects to a 5-year prison term any person
 'who takes up contact with organizations whose actions are
 directed against the public order.' In 1984, a court
 sentenced Uwe Fehre, a 24-year-old father of 3, to 3 years 9
 months in prison because he helped organize a peace workshop
 in 1983. In April, prison terms ranging from 8 to 18 months
 were given three members of a Leipzig group who demonstated
 for peace in 1983. Fifteen bus drivers were arrested in Jena
 after they demonstrated for emigration visas.
 Independent unions are prohibited, as are strikes. Unions are
 viewed as political appendages of the party and as
 institutions to carry out official policy. Union assemblies
 are rigidly controlled by loyal party members, as are all
 other public meetings except for church-sponsored religious
 events. The major East German labor organization, the Free
 German Trade Union Federation, does not play a real role in
 domestic policy formulation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 East Germany is officially atheistic, but the Constitution in
 theory guarantees freedom of religious belief and worship. In
 practice, the state tolerates most religious activity but does
 not encourage it; Overt adherence to religious beliefs often
 results in effective disqualification for preferred job and
 educational opportunities. About 47 percent of the population
 belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, while 45 percent
 claim no affiliation.
 The Government controls religious activity carefully,
 monitoring statements and writings by church figures and
 regulating the printing and distribution of religious
 materials. In September, the Mecklenburgische Kirchenzeitung,
 an Evangelical Church newspaper, was not allowed to be
 distributed until it removed a report on discussions at a
 recent church synod of environmental issues, the deployment of
 new nuclear weapons in both Eastern and Western Europe, and
 the German Democratic Republic's conscription policy. Earlier
 in 1984, an issue of Der Sonntag, a Saxon church bulletin, was
 withdrawn from circulation when authorities objected to a poem
 in it. The East Berlin church bulletin, Die Kirche, was
 forced to withdraw and reprint an issue which discussed the
 Government's ban on wearing the 'swords into ploughshares"
 emblem of the independent peace movement.
 The greater government tolerance shown toward church
 activities in 1983, when non-conformist singers and writers
 were allowed to hold performances in church facilities and
 some previously forbidden subjects could be carefully
 discussed so long as they did not become 'political,' did not
 carry forward into 1984. The Government pressured the
 Evangelical Church to watch its words as well as its deeds,
 
 
 985
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 and the Church became more cautious. The secret police
 continue to monitor Church-sponsored events closely.
 Nevertheless, the Church remains the only institutional forum
 in East Germany where divergent opinions can be expressed with
 relative freedom.
 Christian Scientists have been prohibited from practicing
 their faith in the German Democratic Republic since 1951.
 However, in December the authorities informed East German
 Christian Scientists that some restrictions might be relaxed.
 Later in the same month, a government official met for the
 first time with an American representative of the Christian
 Science Church.
 East Germany does not tolerate non-traditional or
 *charismatic' religious sects. Traditional religious groups
 may establish places of worship, and the Mormons were recently
 given permission to build their first temple. Jehovah's
 Witnesses are not allowed to practice their religion in the
 German Democratic Republic because of their refusal to perform
 military service. During 1984, several American Jewish groups
 visited East Berlin to see how they might help the small East
 German Jewish community. The Government reacted positively to
 their desire to supply the Jewish community with religious
 books and to provide for visits by an American rabbi.
 Clergy and lay members of Western churches have been permitted
 to attend church synods and conferences in the German
 Democratic Republic. Some East German religious leaders have
 been allowed to attend similar meetings in the West.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Most East Germans can travel freely within the country, except
 near borders or military installations. However, they are not
 allowed to change their residence without government
 permission. All citizens must carry identification cards
 which the police have the right to- check at will. Because of
 their criminal or political activities, including filing exit
 visa applications or trying to leave the German Democratic
 Republic illegally, about 60,000 East Germans have a special
 identity card called a PM 12. Some, but not all, holders of
 this card are restricted in domestic as well as foreign
 travel. Foreign travel is strictly controlled, including
 travel to other Communist countries. The exception is
 Czechoslovakia, which East Germans can visit using only an
 identity card.  With few exceptions, such as official
 business, East Germans are not allowed to travel to
 non-Communist countries until they reach retirement age (60
 for women, 65 for men). Restrictions on visits by West
 Germans to East German relatives and friends were slightly
 eased in 1984.
 The sector line dividing East and West Berlin and the border
 between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal
 Republic of Germany are fortified by an array of lethal
 devices designed to stop East Germans from fleeing to the
 West. The German Democratic Republic's borders with Poland
 and Czechoslovakia are also heavily guarded. Beyond the
 mortal danger involved, any attempt to cross these boundaries
 without permission constitutes a crime punishable by up to 8
 years in prison.
 
 
 986
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 In 1984, about 40,000 East Germans were allowed to emigrate,
 most of them during the first 4 months of 1984. This figure
 is higher than in previous years. Since July, however, about
 600 to 1,000 emigration applications have been issued monthly,
 a figure more consistent with the average monthly rate of past
 years.
 The results of a law effective October 15, 1983, which defined
 for the first time the circumstances under which East Germans
 could emigrate legally, began to be felt in 1984. The law
 dealt with cases of emigration for the purpose of joining
 first degree relatives (parents or children) or binational
 marriage. It prescribed that the Government would respond to
 qualified applicants for binational marriage within 6 months
 after the documentary requirements were met. The new law has
 brought about a higher approval rate and more expeditious
 handling of applications for binational marriage. However, by
 narrowly defining who can emigrate, it has also created
 difficulties for the large majority of would-be emigrants who
 want to emigrate for reasons other than to join a first-degree
 relative or spouse. Many successful applicants must wait from
 1 to 5 years before receiving permission to leave. Emigration
 applicants may lose their jobs or suffer imprisonment.
 Despite the hardships to which applicants are subject, an
 estimated 300,000-500,000 emigration applications may still be
 pending.
 Almost all East Germans who emigrate legally are forced to
 give up their citizenship, and must wait at least 5 years
 before returning to visit the German Democratic Republic.
 Some are not permitted to return at all. Those who left the
 country illegally before January 1, 1981, are eligible to
 apply for permission to visit, but many are reluctant to do
 so. Reportedly, only about half of those who have applied
 have obtained visas. Those who fled after 1980 are liable to
 criminal prosecution if they return to East Germany.
 Section 3   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 East Germany does not recognize the right of citizens to
 change their form of government. Elections capable of doing
 this are not permitted. Voters are permitted only to vote
 either 'yes' or "no" on a National Front ballot approved by
 the Communist Party. Since ballots are not secret, a "no'
 vote or a refusal to vote exposes the voter to reprisals. The
 Government is completely dominated by the Socialist Unity
 (Communist) Party. Though there are nominally four other
 parties, they are not permitted to challenge Communist
 doctrine. All decisions are made by the party's Central
 Committee leadership; lower-level representatives are expected
 only to approve those decisions. All candidates for both
 party and legislative positions are nominated by the
 leadership. The Volkskammer (Parliament) never rejects
 government proposals. The party also determines who will fill
 executive positions in the Government. Though some government
 positions are reserved for members of the other four parties,
 the Communist Party ensures that it fills a majority of the
 positions and that the other party members do not and cannot
 contest its policy.
 
 
 987
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The German Democratic Republic has taken the position that
 inquiries into its human rights policies constitute
 interference in its internal affairs. Requests by Amnesty
 International and other private human rights groups in the
 West for information about human rights conditions go
 unanswered, and the Government does not permit visits by these
 groups. No unofficial human rights groups are known to exist
 in East Germany. The government-sponsored Committee for the
 Protection of Human Rights is not designed to safeguard the
 human rights of East German citizens, but to attack human
 rights conditions in Western countries while claiming there
 are no human rights concerns inside East Germany.
 In July, Professor Erich Buchholz of the East German Justice
 Ministry appeared in Geneva before a United Nations Committee
 holding hearings on human rights in East Germany. The central
 theme of the committee's discussions was the fortified East
 German border, which Buchholz defended as a sovereign East
 German right. Buchholz also denied that the German Democratic
 Republic had any political prisoners. Twenty members of the
 European Parliament have requested it to investigate the
 status of political prisoners in East Germany. It is expected
 that the European Parliament will study this issue in 1985.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report (covering 1983) continued
 to be concerned about the imprisonment of people for the
 non-violent exercise of human rights, in particular the right
 to freedom of expression and the right to leave one's
 country. Amnesty worked on behalf of more than 200 prisoners
 of conscience, but believed the total number was much higher.
 Freedom House rates East Germany 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of 16,718,000, East Germany has a highly
 industrialized, centrally planned economy. It is generally an
 importer of raw materials and an exporter of manufactured
 goods. All large industrial, retail, and agricultural
 operations are state-owned, but small private businesses of
 fewer than 10 employees are allowed. Over 90 percent of the
 farmland is collectivized or state-owned; there are about
 6,000 private farmers. Approximately 2 percent of the labor
 force is privately employed.
 East Germany has a relatively high standard of living,
 probably the highest in the Warsaw Pact, with an estimated per
 capita gross national product in 1981 of $9,750.
 Prices of basic goods and services have remained stable
 throughout the last decade, but prices of consumer goods have
 risen and shortages of consumer goods occur periodically.
 Housing remains the most serious shortage. Single residents
 of Berlin usually wait more than 18 months for housing, and
 married couples often wait more than one year. The Government
 is committed to a major housing construction program lasting
 until 1999. The German Democratic Republic also encourages
 private initiative in building low-cost homes and in repairing
 present accommodations, though repair and building materials
 are often in short supply. Income discrepancies are not great
 
 
 988
 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 for the majority of the population, although a small number of
 East Germans live in relative opulence. High party and
 military officials, important scientists, artists, and
 athletes enjoy special access to housing, education, travel,
 and consumer goods. These special benefits, which are much
 more important than wages in determining status and living
 standards, tend to create a small, highly privileged class.
 There is an extensive social welfare system for both rural and
 urban dwellers. Free medical care is provided. According to
 the World Bank, in 1984 life expectancy at birth was 73.1
 years, and the infant mortality rate was 11 per 1,000 births.
 Free and universal education is provided through the 12th
 year. Almost all school-age children attend school. Literacy
 is almost universal. The number of students in institutions
 of higher learning is a function of projected needs.
 Competition is keen for these spaces, and allocation usually
 depends on the student's political acceptability as well as
 his academic promise. In 1981, there were about 78 college or
 university students for every 10,000 people.
 The Sorbs, an indigenous Slavic minority numbering about
 45,000, constitute the only ethnic minority in East Germany.
 There is no officially tolerated discrimination against this
 group. Schools in areas with a Sorb population have specially
 designed curriculums that emphasize aspects of Sorb culture,
 and instruction is offered in the Sorb language. There is a
 Sorbian theater where the Government subsidizes productions of
 Sorbian plays. Sorbs are generally fluent in German as well
 as Sorbian, and they are well integrated in the general
 population.
 Women and men are treated equally in most respects. Women are
 allowed to retire at age 60, men at 65. As one of many
 incentives to increase the birth rate, women are given
 extensive maternity leave with pay after the birth of any
 children. The social welfare system also includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents. About 87
 percent of women of working age are employed, compared to 88
 percent of men. Women are exempt from military service except
 in times of war or national emergency. Women can be found up
 to the middle level in all professions except the military.
 The head of the party's Central Committee Department for
 Women's Affairs has said that one-third of all managerial
 positions are held by women and that women comprise 28 percent
 of the mayors, 32 percent of the school principals, 54 percent
 of the judges, and 50 percent of labor union officials in East
 Germany. There are few women in high positions in the party,
 Government, economy, and most professions.
