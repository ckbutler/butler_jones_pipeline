 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic with a strong presidency. Its multiparty
 political structure is dominated in practice by a single
 party. Following the assassination in 1981 of President Sadat,
 President Mubarak was elected as his successor through a
 constitutional process. The ruling National Democratic Party,
 which President Mubarak heads, derives its historical
 legitimacy ultimately from the national revolution of 1952 and
 has ruled continuously since then. Egypt is both an Islamic
 and Arab state.
 President Sadat ordered the arrest in September 1981 of almost
 1,600 religious and secular activists on charges of endangering
 public order and fomenting religious sectarian strife.
 Following the assassination of President Sadat in October 1981
 by a group of Muslim religious fanatics, a state of emergency
 was declared, suspending certain constitutional and legal
 safeguards normally associated with the protection of civil and
 political liberties. The state of emergency provisions have
 been relatively narrowly applied and directed against groups
 suspected of planning violent action against the Government.
 The law under which the emergency was declared was amended in
 1982 to accord detained persons greater rights of counsel and
 appeal. At the Government's request, the People's Assembly
 renewed the state of emergency for one year on October 4, 1982.
 In making this request, the authorities emphasized that the
 emergency provisions would be applied sparingly -- i.e., only
 in cases affecting national security.
 In February 1982 the administrative court of the Council of
 State invalidated a number of presidential decrees issued by
 President Sadat relating to the detention of religious
 extremists and political opponents, transfer of journalists and
 professors, and cancellation of publishing licenses. Since
 November 1981, over 3,600 persons have been released from
 detention including all political figures from the recognized
 opposition and the majority of other persons detained shortly
 before or after President Sadat's assassination. However,
 about 1,600 detainees remain in jail in connection with the
 post-September/October 1981 investigations. In December 1982,
 302 alleged members of Al-Jihad (Holy War), a militant Islamic
 society, were indicted for involvement in Sadat's assassination
 and participation in plots against the Government. The
 Government has also allowed secular opposition newspapers,
 including two which were banned by President Sadat's
 Government, to resume publication and the opposition press has
 gradually renewed its often strident criticism of the
 Government. President Mubarak began and maintains periodically
 a public dialogue with opposition party leaders.
 Islamic fundamentalists and extremists seeking to transform
 Egypt into an Islamic Republic are viewed by the Government as
 a major, violent threat to the existing social and political
 order. Radical secret societies have been held responsible for
 active plotting to bring down the Government and disrupt the
 normal life of the country. Islamic fundamentalists, including
 Muslim Brotherhood members, have been accused of violent
 attacks upon and persecution of Egypt's Coptic community.
 The Egyptian Government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment
 to food price subsidies which assure virtually universal access
 to essential foods, despite resulting economic disequilibria.
 President Mubarak has also indicated that economic development
 aimed at improving the living standards of the masses will be
 
 
 1114
 
 the key priority of his administration.
 The Government considers that it has struck a balance between
 the need to insure internal security and the protection of
 individual human rights. However, though acting with greater
 circumspection in 1982, the authorities have shown a readiness
 to arrest and imprison Islamic extremists whom they regard as
 an immediate, Iranian-style threat to Egyptian society and
 government. Despite this, it appears that there is no pattern
 of Government-sanctioned abuses or systematic disregard for
 human liberties and that mechanisms exist to rectify abuses
 when they occur. Political opposition and dissent are active
 and vocal, but their scope remains relatively limited.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of politically-motivated
 killings in Egypt in 1982. Allegations in early 1982 that
 left-wing activist Jabir Barakah died as a result of torture
 while in detention do not appear credible, and unofficial
 sources have supported government claims that he died of a
 heart attack. . A number of Islamic extremists of the Al-Jihad
 organization indicted in December were charged with plotting
 political assassinations.  (Five members of that same
 organization were tried, convicted, and executed in 1982 for
 their involvement in the assassination of President Sadat.)
 b. Disappearance
 No known cases of disappearance for political or security
 reasons occurred in Egypt during 1982. Names of persons
 detained by authorities under the state of emergency have been
 made public, and the relevant legislation has been amended to
 accord detainees the right to inform whomever they wish of
 their detention.
 c. Torture
 The Egyptian Constitution proscribes torture and the law
 reinforces this prohibition. Citizens who allege that they
 have been tortured have the right to redress in the courts.
 Information gained through torture is not admissible as
 evidence against the individual. Appeals concerning torture
 have also been made to the courts or the public prosecutor
 directly. These appeals usually result in investigations by
 appropriate legal and medical authorities. Based on these
 investigations, denials may be issued by the Government, but at
 times, for example when allegations of torture were made by
 three defendants in the trial of President Sadat's assassins,
 no results have been announced.
 Allegations are made periodically, usually in the opposition
 press, that security officials use torture. Such allegations
 were also made at the beginning of the trial in December 1982
 of 280 Al-Jihad extremists accused of involvement in the plot
 to assassinate President Sadat and overthrow the Egyptian
 Government. Several defense attorneys and defendants have
 complained during this trial about prison conditions and asked
 for an investigation into the abuse charges. At its December
 25 sitting, the court formally responded to these requests. It
 asked the prosecution to present medical reports on the
 defendants to substantiate or disprove their allegations. In
 addition, it asked the prosecution to respond to defense
 
 
 1115
 requests to conduct medical examinations of their clients,
 improve treatment within the prisons, and appoint a counselor
 from the court to ascertain how the defendants are being
 treated in jail. In its report covering 1981, Amnesty
 International included torture among its human rights concerns
 in Egypt.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Egyptian Constitution and laws pronibit these forms of
 punishment. Reports occasionally appear in the opposition
 press of strikes by prisoners to protest prison
 conditions,including solitary confinement. Amnesty
 International also has expressed concern about ill-treatment of
 'detainees. The Government has usually, if not always, denied
 allegations of mistreatment in its prisons or not responded to
 these complaints. On occasion it has been reported that higher
 levels in the security system have acted to rectify abuses
 committed against persons detained for investigation.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are forbidden by law. Under
 normal circumstances, arrests are made after lengthy
 investigations, and arrested persons are charged with
 violations of specific, existing laws. Preventive detention is
 not normally practiced. Arrested persons normally enjoy the
 right of habeas corpus.
 However, under the terms of the state of emergency, the Prime
 Minister and Interior Minister have the authority to order the
 arrest or detention of persons suspected of being dangerous to
 state_ security without regard for normal legal procedures. In
 June 1982, the-People's-Assembly.amended_the relevant
 legislation to stipulate that anyonearrested-or detanedmus.
 be immediately notified in writing about the'reason for his
 arrest or detention and that it is his right to inform whomever
 he wishes of the event and seek the aid of a lawyer. The
 amendment also provides for an appeals process to the State
 Security Court which requires that authorities provide a
 justification for continued detention within a limited time
 period.
 Some 1,536 persons were arrested during the September 1981
 crackdown on the regime's secular and religious opponents and
 over 3,000 more were arrested following the assassination of
 President Sadat in October 1981. Arrests in the wake of
 Sadat's assassination have been targeted at Islamic
 fundamentalist and extremist groups, particularly those
 associated directly or indirectly with plots to overthrow the
 Government, such as the Al-Jihad extremist organization.
 Further arrests (and some re-arrests) occurred during 1982
 under the provisions of the state of emergency, but on a
 reduced scale. Some of those arrested, such as the
 approximately 28 members of the so-called Hashemite League
 detained in July, were quickly released due to insufficient
 evidence.
 Since November 1981, the Government has announced the release
 of 3,688 persons and more releases were expected in the closing
 weeks of 1982. While it is difficult to know how many
 prisoners remain detained in the aftermath of the
 September/October 1981 dragnet, there are probably around 50
 people being held without court order under terms of the state
 of emergency. The remaining estimated 1,600 prisoners have
 either been indicted on specific charges or are being
 
 
 1116
 investigated in connection with suspected criminal violations.
 The great majority of these detainees are associated with
 extremist Islamic groups.
 A large number of communists and alleged communists were
 arrested between 1977 and 1980 for their purported role in the
 January 1977 civil disturbances and/or their membership in
 proscribed organizations. Almost all of these individuals have
 been released pending trial and the cases themselves have been
 repeatedly continued by the courts.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law guarantees the right to a public trial and equal
 treatment before the law, and the regular court system-is
 independent. In general, criminal and civil cases are tried in
 open proceedings. The only trials routinely closed to the
 public are those involving state security. Persons accused of
 espionage or crimes against state security are tried before
 special state security courts. A higher military court, for
 example, tried the 24 persons accused of direct involvement in
 the assassination of President Sadat. The first two sessions
 of the trial were open, but subsequent sessions were closed.
 All of the defendants (except those receiving medical
 treatment) were present and represented by a large battery of
 lawyers who were allowed to prepare a defense. The case was
 controversial, however, and at one point the defense team
 .resigned en masse, stating that a fair trial was being
 frustrated and that they were being denied the opportunity to
 call the witnesses they sought (including key political and
 religious figures). The court found all but two guilty,
 sentencing most to heavy prison sentences. Five received the
 death sentence and were subsequently executed.
 Insomenn tanes-. th e-ESftii-u~hor~i-te s limit--pub l- access
 to trials-inie-n-s-Rive cases involving corruption or related
 matters handled by the Court of Ethics. More commonly, such
 cases are not formally closed to the public, but details about
 timing and venue are not divulged beforehand.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 the Egyptian Constitution. Under normal circumstances, police
 must obtain a warrant for arrest, search, or seizure from the
 Attorney General before taking such actions. The warrant,
 however, need not specify the material being sought during a
 search. The police may seize material during a search and
 present it as evidence at trial. The courts have at times
 dismissed cases when they considered that warrants were issued
 without sufficient cause. Government officials who violate
 this law may be subjected to criminal penalties.
 The state of emergency empowers the Prime Minister and Interior
 Minister to authorize searches of individuals or premises
 without regard for existing legal procedures. There were
 reports of such instances during the post-assassination
 crackdown, but the practice does not appear to have been
 particularly widespread or arbitrary and almost all reported
 instances involved raids on suspected hideouts of Islamic
 terrorists. Such searches were apparently widespread during
 the wave of arrests following the assassination of President
 Sadat. Searches under the state of emergency decrees
 reportedly still occur, but much less frequently.
 
 
 1117
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 Although the Government does not exercise direct administrative
 control over the print media (as it does radio and television)
 it does have a major influence on the press. It appoints and
 can dismiss all editors of government-owned publications, which
 include all major daily newspapers. Under the law, the Shura
 (Consultative) Council of the People's Assembly has
 responsibility for supervision of the press through its
 ownership of 51 percent of all non-party newspapers and
 magazines. Constraints on editorial freedom are generally
 self-imposed by journalists wary of Government sensitivities
 rather than through censorship. All journals, whether partisan
 or publicly-owned, are encouraged to reflect the *national
 interest" or "national consensus" in choosing what to publish.
 Various publications shut down by the Sadat Government have
 been allowed to resume operations. One opposition weekly
 banned in September 1981, "Al-Shaab," has been allowed to
 resume publication, while a second opposition publicaton,
 "Al-Ahali," has been allowed to return to the newstands after
 being banned in 1978. As the year progressed, these and other
 opposition publications included articles increasingly critical
 of government policies and officials up to and including the
 Prime Minister. In contrast with past regimes, President
 Mubarak has not imposed sanctions as a result of such
 criticism, but rather has "criticized the critics" for failing
 to offer constructive alternatives or for neglecting Egypt's
 "national interests."
 Three Islamic and two Coptic periodicals had their licenses
 withdrawn in September 1981 and remain unable to publish,
 though there are continuing reports that the Government will
 permit resumption of at least some of these publications. In
 the interim, one Islamic monthly and two weekly-Islamic papers
 (one of which is published by an opposition party) have been
 issued licenses to publish.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under powers granted to them during the current state of
 emergency, the authorities can place limitations on the right
 of assembly. Permission is required from the Interior Ministry
 to hold a public meeting. Such limitations appear primarily
 aimed at controlling gatherings of government opponents.
 Opposition parties have occasionally been allowed to hold small
 demonstrations, e.g., to greet ships carrying Palestine
 Liberation Organization fighters transiting the Suez Canal in
 August 1982. At other times, marches and public gatherings
 have been banned and even actively frustrated.
 About 20-25 percent of Egypt's work force is unionized. Every
 fifty Egyptian workers in a given activity have the right to
 form a local committee which in effect operates as a local
 union. The local unions, in turn, are affiliated with a
 national union. Workers at companies employing less than 50
 persons can join the national union directly. At present,
 there are some 21 national unions.
 In addition to providing numerous social and educational
 services to their members, the principal obligation of Egyptian
 trade unions is to defend the rights of their membership in
 
 
 1118
 dealing with management on issues such as wages and working
 conditions. The labor movement can freely define its interests
 and pursue them with few restrictions. It is entirely
 self-financed and spends its funds as it wishes. Unions are
 represented on the boards of public sector companies and
 actively work to improve wages and working conditions. Unions
 are also guaranteed representation in the People's Assembly.
 Strikes are illegal but the local unions have the right to
 engage in negotiations. If these negotiations fail, they can
 appeal to the national union for help, including mediation. If
 these efforts are also unsuccessful, the local union may take
 its case to court for settlement, except in the occasional
 cases in which the national union interposes an objection.
 Egyptian Government influence over the trade union movement
 varies from marginal to significant. Some unions are
 controlled by trade unionists who strongly oppose aspects of
 Government policy, while others are controlled by men and women
 who, though members of the ruling National Democratic Party,
 are very independent and do not always agree with the
 leadership of the Egyptian General Trade Union Federation.
 Still others are heavily influenced by the Government. Since
 1977, the head of the Egyptian General Trade Union Federation
 has also been Minister of Manpower and Training. This
 circumstance, which is not dictated by legislation and h&s not
 always been the case, has increased government control, but may
 also have institutionalized dialogue between unions and the
 Government.
 Most union-leaders are popularly elected. While the ruling
 National Democratic Party exercises considerable influence in
 identifying candidates for leadership positions and tends to
 dominate elections, discordant voices are given a hearing and
 the leadership tends to be representative of the membership.
 There is no official harassment of trade unions.
 Since the late 1950s, the General Trade Union Federation has
 been the only legal national labor federation in Egypt. The 21
 member unions enjoy considerable autonomy and do not always
 follow the strictures imposed on them by the Federation. For
 example, the Federation has ruled that member unions should not
 have affiliations with international labor bodies. Several of
 the larger unions, however, have quietly ignored this
 injunction and are affiliates in international labor
 organizations. As a national body, the Federation adheres to
 principles of neutrality and non-membership in international
 workers' organizations except for the Arab Labor Organization
 and the Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Similarly,
 formal ties are discouraged between Egyptian professional
 associations and international associations. Nevertheless, the
 Federation and professional associations are interested in
 cooperation with the foreign and international organizations.
 In 1981 the Federation and the AFL-CIO signed a five-year
 cooperation agreement.
 Professional associations have experienced government
 intimidation in the past, although President Mubarak has
 attempted to improve the situation. A new lawyers' association
 law has been proposed by the Government in an attempt to
 rectify the status of the Bar Association, disbanded in 1981
 and re-established with board members named by legislation.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 guarantees freedom of religious expression and equality before
 the law regardless of religion. The open practice of a wide
 
 
 1119
 variety of religions is permitted and minority faiths are
 allowed to run houses of worship and private schools.
 Christian Copta are the only major indigenous religious
 minority, comprising approximately eight percent of the
 population. Egypt's tiny Jewish community is not harassed.
 Egyptian Governments have consistently insisted that government
 and politics be kept separate from religion and have barred
 from overt political activity avowedly religious societies and
 organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood. The Government
 has taken great pains to ensure equal treatment of both the
 Muslim and Coptic communities, demonstrating the authorities'
 sensitivity to the possibility of sectarian strife.
 Copts participate widely in the life of the country and are
 represented in all parts of government including the Cabinet
 and People's Assembly. There is no evidence of officially
 inspired or sanctioned acts of discrimination against Copts or
 other religious minorities. Copts work in all professions,
 though many face prejudice against them from individuals. They
 have full right to legal redress for offenses against them and
 their churches. The Government has taken steps to protect
 Coptic churches from violence at the hands of Islamic
 militants, and Egyptian police protect most Coptic churches in
 Cairo and elsewhere. Some of the 280 persons on trial in
 December 1982 were indicted for four specific and separate
 crimes directed against Copts, including three cases of murder
 and/or robbery and the bombing of a Coptic church.
 Individual acts of discrimination against Copts by Egypt's
 Muslim majority do occur and reports of persecution and
 occasionally physical attacks on Copts by Islamic extremists
 are not uncommon. Violence between fundamentalists and Copts
 reached particularly high levels during the Al-Zawiya Al-Hamra,
 sectarian disturbances in June 1981 and were cited by the Sadat
 Government as a major reason for the crackdown instituted the
 following September when about 100 Copts and over 1,400 Muslims
 were detained. As passions have cooled, virtually-all Copts,
 have been released, including all the Coptic clergymen who were
 detained. It is reliably reported that neither the Coptic
 priests nor the Islamic prayer leaders detained in September
 1981 have been allowed to resume their former positions,
 although most have been allowed to engage in other religious
 activities. The Government has indicated that it will treat
 both Muslim and Coptic clergymen released from detention
 equally.
 The most prominent Copt affected by the crackdown was Pope
 Shenouda III, whose official recognition as Coptic patriarch
 was withdrawn by the Government in September 1981. Pope
 Shenouda remains under enforced seclusion in a remote
 monastery. It is uncertain when his official status will be
 restored or when he will be released, but the Egyptian
 Government has made clear that the Pope will be allowed to
 return to public life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Egypt is guaranteed except for
 travel to well-defined military districts and, for foreigners,
 to certain other areas. Except for limitations affecting male
 Egyptians who have not completed compulsory military service,
 freedom of travel and emigration are guaranteed. Egypt has a
 liberal policy on political asylum, and the extradition of
 political refugees is prohibited by law. Under the current
 
 
 1120
 state of emergency, the Prime Minister has authority to
 restrict foreign or domestic travel. There are no known
 instances of such action during the past year. On the
 contrary, a number of individuals who previously resided abroad
 for professional and/or political reasons have returned to
 Egypt since President Mubarak assumed office.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the 1952 revolution, Egypt has been ruled by a succession
 of strong presidents operating within a parliamentary structure
 who have largely relied upon a limited group of-military and
 civilian advisors and have dominated the political system
 through a single political party. President Sadat liberalized
 this system by allowing opposition political parties to operate
 more freely,.though still within limits. President Mubarak
 presides over this system. Opposition groups are allowed to
 organize parties, publish their views, and be represented in
 the People's Assembly. Legislation under which political
 parties and organizations are licensed prohibits formation of
 parties on religious or class lines, thereby making it illegal
 for communist or Islamic societies to organize themselves as
 political parties. President Mubarak has released all of-the
 43 political figures (from the recognized opposition) arrested
 in the September 1981 crackdown. He also initiated and has
 tried to maintain a dialogue with opposition party leaders
 which has-tended to legitimize their status despite sometimes
 sharp mutual criticism. Freedom House's 1982 report classified
 Egypt as "partly free.'
 The People's Assembly has 392 members of whom 382 are elected.
 Thirty of the elected seats are, reserved for women. The
 National Democratic Party controls the People's Assembly with
 over 300 seats. There are three legally-constituted opposition
 parties:-the Socialist Labor Party, the Liberal Party, and the
 National Progressive Unionist Grouping. The Socialist Labor
 Party and the Liberal-Party currently hold ten and two seats
 respectively in the assembly; in the 1979 elections, the
 National Progressive Unionist Grouping entered candidates but
 failed to win any seats. The second house of the legislature,
 the Shura (Consultative) Council, has 210 members, 140 of whom
 are elected under a system in which the party winning an
 electoral majority takes all elected seats. Its functions are
 largely advisory in nature.
 It would be inaccurate to picture Egypt as a pure parliamentary
 democracy. In view of the National Democratic Party's
 overwhelming majority, a Government defeat on any issue of
 importance to it is, at the present time, unthinkable.
 Nevertheless, it would also be inaccurate to view the People's
 Assembly as a mere rubber-stamp. Individual members can and do
 sharply criticize the regime and call for investigations and/or
 official Government'responses to specific points. For example,
 the Ministry of Defense was asked to explain its role in the
 shipment of US military supplies as the result of one such
 inquiry, and the Ministry did so in early November. National
 Democratic Party members frequently vote against the Government
 on controversial issues, although to date not in significant
 numbers. One recent example was in early October when the
 state of emergency legislation came up for renewal. When the
 time came for the Legislation Committee to vote on whether or
 not to present the bill for debate in the Assembly, one of
 those voting "nay" was the chairman of the committee, a
 National Democratic Party stalwart. Similarly, the Assembly
 not infrequently carefully considers challenges
 
 
 112i
 against Government legislation prior to taking final action. A
 recent US-Egyptian bilateral investment treaty is said to be
 facing such an examination.
 The National Democratic Party tends to dominate elections. It
 wins because it fields popular candidates who can draw on
 greater campaign funds and considerable local patronage. The
 opposition has frequently cited instances where improper
 electoral methods were allegedly used.* The National Democratic
 Party does not always win by lopsided majorities, however. In
 two of three by-elections this summer, the opposition made a
 very good showing against the National Democratic Party. For
 example, the opposition captured over 40 percent of the vote in
 the July 7 Mansura by-election.
 Although there are some variations among the four political
 parties, they all tend to select candidates in a manner similar
 to that used in Great Britain. Local party organizations may
 propose a favorite son or daughter who is then endorsed by a
 national executive. Frequently, the national party
 organizations nominate candidates directly, following local
 consultations. Independents also run in the elections and
 sometimes win with a surprisingly large percentage of the
 poll. Two of the most influential members of parliament are
 independents; one represents a Cairo district, while the second
 represents a district in upper Egypt.
 In theory, elections are managed in a way to insure that voting
 is conducted fairly and legally. An electoral commission drawn
 from the judiciary supervises every parliamentary election and
 is present in each district on voting day. Individual
 supervisors frequently check polling stations for
 irregularities. In addition, each political party running in
 the election is entitled to have observers present at the
 polling places. Police are present to keep order. An election
 supervisor has the right to invalidate the voting at a given
 polling place if he believes ballot-stuffing or other
 irregularities have taken place. This system is not perfect
 and does not always work. In a late August by-election in
 Alexandria, there was apparently overwhelming evidence of
 electoral fraud, and the election supervisor invalidated the
 election. His decision was overturned the next day by the
 Minister of Interior, who determined that the supervisor had
 exceeded his authority by invalidating the entire election and
 not just the balloting at a specific polling place. The
 incident provoked an outcry among opposition figures, which was
 widely reported in the press. The opposition parties have
 declared that they will not participate in the People's
 Assembly elections scheduled for 1984 unless guarantees are
 provided that these will be conducted in a fair manner.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Egypt signed the Organization of African Unity's African Human
 Rights Charter in 1982. The Government has also publicly
 reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to the UN Human Rights
 Declaration and its respect for related international
 conventions. An official policy exists of responsiveness to
 queries from international groups about human rights concerns
 in Egypt, including requests for visits in that regard.
 Official and non-official delegations participate in
 international meetings on human rights. Egyptian human rights
 groups exist in Cairo and in other large urban areas. Their
 activities are essentially non-pqlitical, being related
 
 
 1122
 primarily to the welfare of prisoners and to women's rights,
 although at least one organization is trying to mobilize public
 support on certain political issues. Thus far, the Government
 apparently has not interfered with their operations. Amnesty
 International's report covering 1981 stated its particular
 concern about the arrests following President Sadat's
 assassination.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 President Mubarak has emphasized the importance of economic
 issues. The Egyptian Government has continued a policy of
 insulating the majority of consumers from the pressures of
 world inflation. The primary vehicle for this policy has been
 a subsidy system costing about $2.4 billion per year or 14
 percent of the Government's annual budgetary expenditures.
 Most of this amount goes to subsidize bread, rice, tea, edible
 oil, butane gas, meat, and corn. As a result of this policy,
 caloric intake for the average Egyptian exceeds minimal
 nutritional requirements. Although the subsidy system has
 accomplished its objectives of assuring ample supplies at fixed
 and affordable prices for Egyptian consumers, especially lower
 income groups, the system has produced significant and
 increasing strain on the budget and brought other economic
 imbalances.
 While stressing continuity in government economic policy, the
 President has placed new emphasis on productive investments to
 benefit the masses of Egyptians. The Egyptian Government has
 reaffirmed its commitment to the "Open Door" policy of economic
 liberalization begun by President Sadat in 1974, which
 encourages free enterprise, foreign investment, and economic
 liberalization. Though the public sector has consistently
 played the predominant role in industry, transport, and
 communications, the private sector is becoming an increasingly
 important and dynamic force for economic growth, and President
 Mubarak has specifically reaffirmed a role for the private
 sector.
 Lack of housing is one of the most acute problems facing Egypt
 and is compounded by a 2.8 percent annual rate of growth in the
 population, currently estimated at more than 44,000,000. The
 Government has made housing construction a priority industry
 and this is the fastest growing sector of the economy.
 Education and health services are free and available to the
 majority of Egyptians. The World Bank estimated infant
 mortality at about 103 per 1,000 live births and life
 expectancy at nearly 57 years in 1980. About 44 percent of
 adults are literate; 87 percent of male youth attend primary
 school, but only 56 percent of female students are enrolled.
 Public sector and government employment policies virtually
 guarantee jobs for everyone. Egypt enforces strict laws
 limiting the size of landholdings to attempt to guarantee that
 both income and production opportunities are equitable in rural
 areas. However, an expanding population on a limited natural
 resource base has helped to keep per capita income at an
 estimated $560 per year in 1982.
 Women enjoy significant opportunities in Egyptian society.
 They vote, serve in the armed forces in non-combat positions,
 and work both inside and outside the home. Women are well
 represented in medicine, law, and education and serve in the
 People's Assembly and the Cabinet. Although the Government has
 encouraged improvements in the status of women, prevailing
 
 
 1123
 cultural values in rural areas and within more traditional
 communities make it difficult for women to pursue freely
 personal ambitions.
