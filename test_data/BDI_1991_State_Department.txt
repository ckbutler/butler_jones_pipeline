 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Pierre Buyoya, an army major who came to power in a bloodless
 coup in September 1987. President Buyoya is also head of the
 National Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA) and exercises
 considerable executive, legislative, and regulatory powers.
 The 23-member, predominantly civilian Cabinet manages the
 day-to-day business of government. In spite of an increasingly
 open political atmosphere, UPRONA is still the only legal
 political entity in Burundi.
 Throughout its history, Burundi has been plagued by ethnic
 conflict, characterized by the traditional dominance of the
 minority (14 percent) Tutsi ethnic group over the majority (85
 percent) Hutu ethnic group. Although progress towards reform
 suffered a setback following ethnic violence in 1988, in which
 5,000 to 10,000 people were killed, there has since been slow
 but definite movement in the direction of democratization.
 In a nationwide referendum on February 5, the National Unity
 Charter was approved by nearly 90 percent of the voters. This
 document is intended to provide a guarantee of equal rights for
 all Burundis regardless of ethnic origin and thus to bring
 about national reconciliation. A 35-member constitutional
 commission, largely composed of civilians, was officially
 formed on March 21 to formulate a new constitution to replace
 the one suspended by President Buyoya when he came to power in
 1987. The commission recommended in September the creation of
 a multiparty political system, with fundamental rights
 including free speech and press, the separation of powers, and
 the protection of minorities. Government officials and
 commission members carried out an energetic campaign to inform
 the population, both at home and abroad, of the commission's
 recommendation and to solicit their views. President Buyoya
 has called for a referendum on the constitution early in 1992
 to be followed by general elections in early 1993. However,
 major opposition groups rejected both the commission's report
 and the President's program for transition as the unilateral
 products of a government that came to power by force.
 Internal state security is still the responsibility of the
 security police. A much larger regular police force, or
 gendarmerie, is responsible for maintaining law and order. The
 state security police have the same powers of arrest as the
 regular police and are subject to the same process of judicial
 review. Both are part of Burundi's 18,000-member military
 force. An ethnically balanced National Security Council was
 created in 1990 to oversee the activities of the various
 security forces, which continue to be almost entirely composed
 of members of the Tutsi ethnic group. During times of unrest,
 the army is permitted to take persons into custody on behalf of
 the gendarmerie. Elements of the military committed
 significant human rights abuses in 1991 in responding to
 alleged threats and attacks from members of the Party for the
 Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU).
 Landlocked Burundi is extremely poor and densely populated.
 Over four-fifths of the working population is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture, working small, privately owned plots.
 The small monetary economy is based largely on the export of
 coffee, with few other cash crops. The country has embarked on
 a structural adjustment program supported by the donor
 community which includes the privatization of a range of
 industries. The increasingly grave social and economic problem
 
 
 33
 BURUNDI
 of the acquired immumodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) complicates a
 preexisting health-care crisis.
 In 1991 civil liberties continued to be significantly
 restricted,-including the rights of assembly and association
 and of political expression. Brutality, and sometimes torture,
 of detainees remained a problem, as did the Government's
 failure to'investigate effectively and punish those
 responsible. In the aftermath of attacks on military and
 police installations in November,-security forces overreacted,
 resulting in. the death of between 500 and l-,000' pople. A
 commission of inquiry was established to investigate these
 incidents, and some military person were arrested. The
 Government also abolished a special security court. Citizens
 still did not have the right to change their government, but
 there was progress towards a democratic political system.
 RESPECT iOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section L Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:-
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In late -November and December. 500" to 1,000- people were killed
 as the result of security forces' response to attacks on
 military and police installations.  Reliable reports indicate
 that many of these deaths were the result of the use of
 excessive force.- The Government- established a commission of
 inquiry, headed by the Attorney General, to investigate the
 causes of the violence as well as excesses on the part of the
 authorities. At year's enl, several Tutsi military officers
 had been detained for prosecution where culpability had been-
 determined.- There were petsistent reports that Burundi
 military forces killed an unspecified number of Hutu peasants
 in the north of the country. The Government denied the reports-.
 Questions concerning the IS90 death of Remy Gahutu, a prominent
 exiled Burundi political dissident who died while in the
 custody of Tanzanian authorities, remained unresolved in L991.
 Clinical information indicated the death may have been the
 result of poisoning, and members of Gahutu's organization have
 alleged that Burundi authorities, were ultimately responsible.
 b. Disappearance
 Therewere numerous reports of people disappearing-during the-
 November disturbances, and the Government promised to- provide
 lists of those arrested. At year's end-, it was still not
 possible to account for all missing persons. Some may be
 presumed to be among the approximately-40-,000 Burundians who
 fled to Zaire or Rwanda as a result of recent or threatened
 violence and who remained outsidb of the country,
 c. .Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law, but cruel treatment of suspects or
 detainees continues to occur in the form of beatings during
 arrest or interrogation. There is no evidence of vigorous
 prosecution for such torture or brutality, and the council
 established 2 years ago to investigate official misconduct and
 brutality apparently has seldom met and reportedly has taken
 action only once. Members of the legal and human rights
 
 
 34
 BURUNDI
 communities report that judges rarely press the police about
 the nature of their conduct in questionable cases.
 Prison conditions remain severe in Burundi, due to lack of
 adequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water.
 Food must be grown by the prisoners and when possible
 supplemented by their families. The Government has begun a
 program of gradually improving conditions; to date, efforts
 have been focused on increasing the supply of food and
 clothing. Visits by family members are difficult, particularly
 when prisoners are moved to locations distant from their homes
 due to overcrowding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects without an
 arrest warrant but must submit a written report to the public
 prosecutor's office within 24 hours. The public prosecutor may
 either order the detainee's release or issue an arrest warrant
 valid for 5 days. The public prosecutor must then state the
 charges before a magistrate in the presence of the detainee.
 The magistrate may confirm the detention, initially for 15 days
 and subsequently for 30-day periods as necessary to prepare the
 case for trial. The law allows unlimited pretrial detention.
 Bail is set only in cases of embezzlement or similar crimes
 involving financial wrongdoing.
 In general, the prescribed procedures for arrest and
 imprisonment are followed in criminal cases, although
 proceedings may be affected by the lack of a well-trained
 judiciary. In political security cases, however, procedural
 requirements are sometimes ignored. In all cases, time limits
 for issuance of arrest warrants and appearance before a
 magistrate are often exceeded, usually due to a shortage of
 magistrates and prosecutors.
 The constitutional commission remarked that arbitrary arrests
 and prolonged preventive detentions still exist. Three
 American law professors, who did extensive judicial consulting
 in July and August, confirmed that persons are detained before
 trial without prosecutorial or judicial review. The Ministry
 of Justice has expressed concern about this problem and is
 reportedly considering remedies to correct the situation.
 In 1991 the Government cracked down on members of opposition
 groups (see Section 3), both legal and illegal, when they were
 suspected of supporting antigovernment activities. One member
 of the opposition party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi
 (FRODEBU) spent 3 months in prison--from May to July--for
 possession of antigovernment literature. In August the
 Government began detaining supporters of the illegal opposition
 group PALIPEHUTU for agitation and possession of antigovernment
 literature. The detainees included the vice president of the
 group. The Government acknowledged that, prior to the outbreak
 of violence in November, it had arrested 60 persons for
 activities against the Government. These persons have not yet
 been charged, and the cases have not yet gone to trial. There
 are divergent estimates of the number of additional arrests
 made during the violence in November, but the number could
 presumably be in the hundreds. Once again, charges have not
 been filed, and the cases have not been brought to trial.
 However, the Government has stated that all those arrested will
 be tried under existing criminal laws.
 
 
 85
 BURUNDI
 During the course of 1991, some members of .the Jehovah's
 Witnesses were arrested by local authorities for refusing to
 comply (on religious grounds) with local government
 directives. No charges were filed, and all were released
 within 48 hours.
 The Government does not exile its nationals as a means of
 political cofitrol. However, since 1987 ex-president Bagaza and
 his wife have been-denied permission to return to Burundi,
 although'the Buyoya Government has stated that it is willing to
 negotiate the conditions of their return.   In 1991 Mrs. Bagaza
 attempted to return secretly, using a false name and passport,
 but was not allowed to land in Burundi. The Government
 reiterated its willingness to negotiate her return. Three
 Bagaza daughters, all minors, remain in Burundi with relatives;
 they are free to. leave,, however.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is not independent; it is expected to adhere to
 the guidance and recommendatioos of UPRONA,-the Government, and
 the President. In practice, there is a high degree of autonomy
 in thd court's daily administration of justice. The President
 has the pow&r to pardon or reduce sentences. In cases of major
 political interest, the Government occasionally intervenes in
 the judicial process.
 Military and civil/criminal cases are dealt with in separate
 court systems. Military tribunals- have jurisdiction only over
 military personnel and persons suspected of committing crimes
 against the military. A separate state security court which
 had jurisdiction over both civilian and military personnel in
 cases involving state security was abolished in 1991, and its
 cases -ill now be handled by the appropriate criminal or
 military court.
 The judicial system consists of the Supreme Court, the courts
 of appeals, the administrative courts, the Labor Court, and the
 Court of Accounts. The latter. Court investigates and
 prosecutes cases of official corruption; to date most of its
 cases have involved actions that occurred under the previous
 regime. Pretrial proceedings, which are not public, are
 conducted by the Government and may involve lengthy
 investigations. Most cases do not involve an effective
 independent defense due to a shortage of lawyers and resources
 on the part of the accused.
 The-courts are hampered by a shortage of legal personnel and a
 heavy case road. Currently, systemic problems with
 dissemination of information, new presidential decrees- and
 Supreme Court decisions mean that the law is not equally
 applied in all cases. Upcountry magistrates, in particular,
 often have access to only a single volume of 19-70 laws.
 f. .Arbitrary Interference With Privacy-, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home and of private correspondence
 were provided for in the suspended constitution and are st-ill
 respected in practice. A judicial warrant is required for a
 law enforcement official to enter and search a private
 residence. The state security office monitors political
 dissidence through the state security police and by employing
 informers who report on discontent and dissent as well as on
 
 
 BURUNDI
 criminal activity. Membership in the UPRONA party is not
 required by law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are significant restrictions on speech and press
 freedoms. The Buyoya regime has permitted public debate on
 formerly taboo subjects, such as ethnic relations and official
 corruption; however, debate is largely confined to UPRONA party
 meetings, the forum for dialog officially encouraged by the
 Government. Criticism outside party forums is restricted.
 Possession of opposition political tracts is a punishable
 offense, e.g., seven members of the FRODEBU opposition party
 were arrested and imprisoned in 1991 for possession of such
 tracts (see Section l.d.).
 The Government regulates domestic print and broadcast media. A
 French-language daily and a Kirundi-language weekly newspaper
 are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 official media supports the fundamental policies of the party
 and the Government. While some criticism of the Government is
 permitted, journalists are state employees and subject to
 disciplinary action if their criticism goes beyond what is
 considered tolerable. The Government has interfered on
 occasion with the distribution of foreign news publications and
 censored sexually explicit foreign film material or
 publications.
 In 1988 a liberalized ordinance authorized private print media
 in Burundi, provided they have prior authorization from the
 Ministry of Information. Private broadcast media are not yet
 authorized. Two news publications emerged, one a Catholic
 biweekly in Kirundi and the other a monthly magazine published
 in French by an association of Burundian intellectuals.
 Although these publications debate multiparty versus single
 party political systems and have been critical of UPRONA, they
 appear to refrain from taking genuinely controversial positions
 on critical issues.
 Academic freedom is limited; primary and secondary
 schoolteachers are expected to support government policies.
 Professors at the University of Burundi come from a wide
 assortment of national backgrounds. They are generally
 permitted to lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct
 research, and draw independent conclusions, but they do not
 concern themselves with domestic politics.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These rights are restricted. No political meetings or
 associations other than those tied to UPRONA are currently
 permitted, although some are tolerated within limits. A number
 of Burundian intellectuals are openly supportive of the FRODEBU
 opposition party, without, apparently, suffering for it.
 Informal gatherings and some criticism is permitted; however
 the PALIPEHUTU party, considered by the Government to promote
 ethnic division, is illegal, and its activities are not
 tolerated. In August, eight PALIPEHUTU supporters were
 arrested and imprisoned for agitation, as a result of holding
 an illegal meeting.
 
 
 37
 BURUNDI
 c. Freedom of Religion
 For the most part, the Buyoya Government has reversed the
 repression of religious expression under the previous regime of
 Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. Buyoya has freed religious
 prisoners, reopened closed churches, returned confiscated
 church properties, including houses and schools, authorized
 workday religious services, reinstituted the activities of the
 catechists, and authorized church schools (including seminaries
 and literary and catechism classes), publications, and
 broadcasts. Those missionaries who were expelled have been
 allowed to return, and there are no restrictions on new
 missionaries for authorized churches. Since more than 60
 percent of the population is Catholic, the Catholic Church
 plays'an important role in the development of the country and
 in the lives of both rural and urban Burundians.
 Religious organizations, subject to the same rules and
 restrictions that apply to secular organizations, must obtain
 approval from the Government to operate in Burundi, and a
 Burundi citizen must be designated as legal representative of
 each organization. The approval process, which includes an
 investigation of the association's activities in its home
 country, can be lengthy. The Govetrnment has legally recognized
 the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and has restored its
 confiscated properties.
 However, the pattern of arrests and harassment of Jehovah's
 Witnesses continued in 1991, despite the June 199a visit of an
 international delegation of Witnesses. The Government still
 has not granted the group legal status, allegedly because of
 Witnesses' refusal to acknowledge secular authority.
 Religious groups may not engage in-political activity critical
 of the Government. There are no barriers to the maintenance of
 links with coreligionists in other countries. Participation in
 religious life does'not exclude membership in the UPRONA party
 or eligibility for social benefits.'
 d- Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has not instituted nationwide restrictions on
 internal travel since the aftermath of the August 1988 ethnic
 violence. Since that time, local travel has occasionally been
 restricted in areas experiencing unrest. The Government's
 policy is to discourage urban migration through, rural
 development programs and a public education campaign-. A
 voluntary resettlement program exists to promote migration from
 densely populated areas to parts of the country where more land
 is available.
 Foreign travel and emigration are relatively free. In 1990 the
 Government abolished the requirement that Burundi citizens who
 travel abroad must surrender their passports to the immigration
 office on their return to Burundi. Citizens are not required
 to have passports for journeys to neighboring areas of Rwanda
 and Zaire. Foreigners residing in Burundi must have exit visas
 to leave the country.
 All but approximately 800 of the more than 50,000 Burundi
 citizens who fled to southern Rwanda following the August 1988
 ethnic violence have returned voluntarily to their homes. The
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is
 continuing to work with those who wish to return home. In a
 
 
 BURUNDI
 special repatriation effort, the Burundian Government and the
 UNHCR are working to make possible the voluntary repatriation
 of Burundians who fled to other countries following the 1972
 outbreak of ethnic violence. More than 150,000 Burundians left
 the country at that time. Approximately 17.000 returned during
 1991, but an additional estimated 40,000 fled to Zaire or
 Rwanda as a result of the November violence.
 The current official estimate of Burundi's refugee population
 is 269,000, most of whom are Rwandan Tutsis who have resided in
 Burundi since the 1960's. These refugees, for the most part,
 have been integrated into Burundi society and no longer require
 assistance from the UNHCR. No refugees were forcefully
 repatriated in 1991; however, some refugees reportedly joined
 the Rwandan Patriotic Front in the armed conflict in Rwanda.
 Several refugees, with assistance from the UNHCR, were
 resettled from Burundi to other countries. In 1991, 18
 Rwandans and 1 Zairian were resettled in Canada, and 32
 Somalians who had arrived in Burundi in 1989 were resettled in
 the United States. Some 20 Somalians remain in Burundi under
 UNHCR auspices.
 The Government occasionally repatriates Rwandans and Zairians
 who lack residence permits, or who have been arrested on
 suspicion of criminal activities. At present, Burundi
 citizenship may only be acquired through birth from Burundi
 parents or by marriage, but the Government is considering the
 question of naturalization.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the legal right to change their
 government. In August the constitutional commission,
 presenting its report, called for wide public participation in
 the creation of the new constitution. It also called for
 public debate its recommendation that Burundi adopt a
 multiparty system. Since the release of the report, government
 officials and members of the commission have conducted public
 meetings in localities throughout the country and met with
 interest groups to solicit comments. Opposition groups have
 criticized this process and called for a national conference to
 assure more open and free debate.
 Political participation currently takes place only within the
 one-party structure of UPRONA, and voters can express
 dissatisfaction only by voting against incumbents for party
 positions. The party is open to all Burundi citizens
 supporting its principles and, with its youth, women's, and
 labor affiliates, claims a membership of over three-quarters of
 the adult population. However, many registered party members
 are inactive.
 While the report of the constitutional commission calls for the
 development of a multiparty system in Burundi, its
 recommendations also make it clear that, now and in the future,
 parties will be allowed to operate only as long as they do not
 violate prohibitions against activities or literature calling
 for ethnic identification. The Government took the position
 that any action or literature which challenged the concept of
 national unity or called for ethnically based political
 movements represented an illegitimate challenge to the
 Government. At the end of 1991, UPRONA remained the only legal
 political party in Burundi. However, during the year the
 Government tolerated some activities on the part of parties
 
 
 39
 BURUNDI
 which apparently were not considered a serious threat to the
 Government or the principle of national unity. These parties
 include FRODEBU, the Movement for Peace and Democracy, the
 Party of the People, and the Royalist Party.
 In contrast to its relatively tolerant attitude toward these
 parties, the Government took aggressive action against the
 PALIPEHUTU Party during 1991. The Government accused the party
 of openly fostering ethnically based divisive politics as well
 as supporting violence against the Government. Numerous party
 members were arrested.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1991,two local human rights groups were officially
 recognized by the Government. While these organizations are
 apparently free to conduct investigations and publish findings,
 their activities and effectiveness have thus far been limited
 by a lack of experience and resources and by the Government's
 lack of procedures for handling requests for information and
 permission to carry out monitoring activities.
 The Government allows international and nongovernmental
 organizations to investigate human rights conditions in
 Burundi. After initially rejecting calls for an international
 investigation into the August 1988 ethnic violence, it allowed
 an extensive survey of conditions in- the affected areas by U.N.
 representatives. An Amnesty International delegation visited
 Burundi in June 1989, primarily to investigate the status of
 the detainees arrested in the aftermath of the-violence-
 Section 5 Discrimination rased on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Historically, the minority Tutsi (14 percent) have dominated
 the majority Hutu people. Serious civil strife resulting in
 thousands of deaths has erupted between the two groups several
 times in the modern era, most recently in April 1972 and August
 1988. In both instances, a large majority of the victims were
 Hutus. Following the 1988 ethnic violence, the Government,
 with the support of the international community, moved rapidly
 to try to restore ethnic confidence, including the appointment
 of a national unity commission to recommend fundamental ethnic
 reforms-
 However, de facto discrimination by Tutsis against Hutus
 remains in many areas of society, although it is not condoned
 by law. There are very few Hutus in the army, and they are
 seriously undercepresented in the civil service and university
 positions. The Tutsis have traditionally had better access to
 educational opportunities. As a result of recent reform'
 efforts, Hutus have made inroads into the civil service. The
 number of Hutus now exceeds the number of Tutsis entering
 secondary'school  which represents progress compared with past
 years but still remains greatly disproportional. The pace of
 integration in the military remains slow. Tutsis dominate the
 modern economic sector, while in rural areas economic
 opportunities are roughly equivalent for both groups.
 Women hold a secondary position in Burundi society, based on
 traditional patterns. The suspended constitution provided for
 legal equality, and this continues to be respected in
 practice. The current legal code prohibits polygamy and a
 
 
 40
 BURUNDI
 dowry requirement, allows women some control over family
 matters, and provides for land inheritance by women. However,
 legal restrictions persist, including the provision that a
 married woman may not start a business without her husband's
 permission. Fewer women than men obtain formal education;
 according to U.N. data, females get one-third of the schooling
 of males. Once a woman obtains a degree, she can generally
 find suitable employment. The Government has not discriminated
 against women in hiring, and the civil service pay scale makes
 no distinction between men and women. However, women are not
 significantly represented in business, the professions, or at
 higher levels of government, though the situation has improved
 in recent years.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is known to
 take place, but the extent of the violence has not been
 documented. While police do not normally intervene in domestic
 disputes, severe cases are dealt with by the legal system. The
 Government officially discourages violence against women and
 addresses the problem largely through the Burundi Women's
 Union, which provides counseling and, when deemed necessary,
 referral to legal authorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Up to the end of 1991, workers did not have the right to freely
 form and join labor unions. The UPRONA party controlled the
 National Trade Union Confederation (UTB) and supported it
 through direct and in-kind subsidies. Its leadership was
 appointed by the President. No other unions were allowed by
 law. On December 30, as part of its move to a multiparty
 system, the Government dissolved the UTB, defining its 18
 subgroups as politically and financially independent unions,
 organized by trade. The Confederation of Free Unions of
 Burundi (CSB), with an elected chair, was created as an
 administrative umbrella organization. While not all issues
 concerning the new unions' structure and rights have been
 resolved, they and the CSB face the immediate challenge of
 supporting their activities based solely on worker
 contributions. Labor policy has been and will continue to be
 formulated by the National Labor Council, on which employers,
 organized labor, and the Ministry of Labor are represented.
 The Council debates labor issues and makes policy
 recommendations to the Government.
 Strikes are permitted only if authorized by the Ministry of
 Labor after negotiations have failed, and advocacy of an
 unauthorized strike or lockout is a criminal offense. There
 have been no authorized strikes in recent years. Public sector
 employees have not been allowed to strike. The UTB was
 affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers did not have the right to organize outside the UTB
 until the end of the year. Prior to December 30, collective
 bargaining was supervised by the Government. There were no
 limits on the issues which could be bargained between the UTB
 and the employers, but the two sides were bound by the
 guidelines on wage and working conditions guidelines
 established by the National Labor Council and approved by the
 Government. To resolve labor disputes outside of collective
 bargaining situations, a three-step process was available:
 
 
 41
 BURUNDI
 direct employer-employee negotiations under the auspices of the
 UTB; an administrative hearing before a government labor
 inspector; and a legal proceeding before the Labor Court (or an
 administrative court, in the case of public employees), in
 which the UTB represented the employee (whether a union member
 or not). The UTB was often successful in forcing employers to
 change their practices through this process. The UTB estimated
 that it-had between 80,000 and 100,000 members, or
 approximately 50 percent of the country's wage-earning
 employees. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law and
 is not a problem in practice because of the protections
 provided to employees under the Labor Code..
 There are no export processing zones in Burundi.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden by law- and is not
 practiced. The International Labor Organization's (ILO)-
 Committee of Experts (COE) has regularly noted that various
 legislative provisions that call for imprisonment and an
 obligation to-work as punishment for expressions of political
 views contrary to those of the party are not in compliance with
 ILO Convention 105. The COE has also noted that provisions
 concerning agricultural ordinances are in violation of ILO
 Convention 29. The UTB stated that, while many prisoners do
 agricultural or artisanal work to help feed themselves, there
 is no compulsory convict labor ixtBurundi. '
 d. Minimun Age for Employment of Children
 In the modern, urban sector of the economy, children under the
 age of 16 may not be employed in any capacity. Enforcement of
 this minimum age by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is
 limited. As a practical matter in this poor, largely rural
 country, many children are obliged by custom and circumstance
 to help their families in subsistence agriculture. Many urban
 children engage in small-scale street trading and other
 activities to supplement the family income
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Over 90 percent of the population of Burundi is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. Minimum labor standards are
 established by the National Labor Council and promulgated by-
 the Government in the Labor Code, but these standards have
 relevance primarily for workers in the small wage-sector of the
 economy. The established minimum wage rate is inadequate to
 provide a decent living for urban families, who frequently
 supplement their income- through family gardening or petty
 commerce.
 The maximum workweek-is fixed by law at 45 hours. In the
 modern economic sector, minimum health and safety standards are
 incorporated in the Labor Code and are monitored by the
 Ministry of Labor. The number of safety inspectors is
 insufficient to enforce these standards effectively.
