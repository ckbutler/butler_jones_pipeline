 ETHIOPIA
 The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) is a
 one-party state with a Soviet-style Constitution. President
 Mengistu Haile-Mariam's dominant position remains
 unchallenged: he is Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the
 armed forces, and General Secretary of the Workers' Party of
 Ethiopia (WPE). The Marxist-Leninist WPE, established in
 1984, is the sole political party and the most powerful
 institution in the PDRE. The two meetings of the newly
 elected Shengo (Parliament) confirmed that .its role was
 largely confined to rubber stamping provisions adopted months
 earlier by the 23-member Council of State.
 Ethiopia deploys the largest standing army in Africa south of
 the Sahara, numbering 250,000-300,000 members. It uses this
 force primarily to pursue military solutions to the armed
 insurgencies of varying intensities directed against the
 Government. Although recent military setbacks have encouraged
 Ethiopia to seek diplomatic rapprochement with Sudan and
 Somalia, Ethiopia continues to offer some support to rebel
 movements fighting against its neighbors. Domestically, the
 Government has an extensive internal security apparatus which
 uses a comprehensive system of surveillance and informers to
 maintain its control over the population.
 The PDRE remains committed to a centralized, planned economy
 based on Socialist principles. Under pressure from the donor
 community, the Government agreed to certain minimal changes in
 agricultural policy in 1988. The effect of the changes,
 especially greater incentives for farmers, on production has
 yet to be seen. The economy of the world's poorest country
 (according to the World Bank) currently suffers not only from
 drought and famine, but also from continuing ideological
 constraints, such as priority of funding for state farms in a
 nation of small independent farmers. Success by rebel groups
 in the north and declaration of a national emergency have led
 to economic disruption as development and other resources (and
 an obligatory "donation" of 1 month's salary) are diverted to
 the war effort.
 Ethiopia's human rights record remained deplorable in 1988.
 The Constitution, which provides a legal basis for respect for
 human rights, was hardly adopted before the Government
 declared a national state of emergency inr-i-rea and Tigre
 and voided constitutional protection there. Following rebel
 military successes in early 1988, the Government expelled
 expatriate relief workers from Eritrea and Tigre and denied
 relief distributions to more than a million Ethiopians thought
 to be at risk of starvation in areas of the country contested
 by the rebels. Both the Government and insurgent groups
 exchanged charges of atrocities committed against civilians.
 The resettlement program, which resumed in a "voluntary"
 fashion in late 1987, attracted renewed criticism in 1988--and
 was again put on hold--after an incident at Korem in which
 peasants resisting resettlement were shot. Regional
 instabilities led to dramatic increases in refugee influxes
 from Sudan and Somalia. The PDRE's intransigence on granting
 regular unrestricted access to the refugees hindered
 international humanitarian assistance to them. On the
 positive side, the Government released 7 members of the former
 royal family, released some 25 persons imprisoned for
 assisting the emigration of Ethiopian Jews, and exchanged
 prisoners of war from the 1977-78 war with Somalia.

 ETHIOPIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1988 the northern military situation was the major
 influence on the human rights situation in Ethiopia. The
 intensification of fighting between the Government and
 opposition groups in Tigre and Eritrea has led to increased
 claims on both sides of human rights abuses. There have been
 charges, some substantiated, of indiscriminate bombing by
 Ethiopian government forces of civilian targets. There have
 also been reports, on both sides, of executions of young males
 who have tried to avoid military service. Furthermore, up to
 100 civilians may have been massacred by the Eritrean People's
 Liberation Front (EPLF) for attempting to prevent the military
 recruitment of young Afar tribesmen. The Government has
 charged the rebels with selected acts of terrorism against
 government facilities and officials in various northern
 cities. Because of the lack of access to the north by the
 international community, most other charges of abuse cannot be
 confirmed. Rebels accuse the Government of employing napalm
 and charge that massacres of hundreds of civilians occurred at
 El Sheib in May and at Hauzien in June.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no confirmed reports of disappearances since
 the installation of the PDRE in September 1987. Rebel groups
 claim that disappearances attributable to the Ethiopian
 military are common in the northern conflict areas, but these
 claims cannot be confirmed.
 The well-publicized disappearance in May 1986 of the Ethiopian
 Permanent Representative to the United Nations and Ambassador
 to Canada, Berhanu Dinka, remained unresolved despite pressure
 by many Western governments for information concerning his
 whereabouts. No charges were known to have been filed
 against him, but there were unconfirmed reports that he was
 transferred in July 1987 from the "third police station" (an
 Addis Ababa torture and interrogation center) to the so-called
 Gebi Prison in the basement of the Menelik Palace.
 Guerrilla groups in the north have kidnaped relief workers
 operating in conflict areas. Two Italian contractors working
 at a village settlement scheme, kidnaped by the Ethiopian
 Peoples Revolutionary Party (EPRP) in November 1987, were
 released in May 1988; another Italian technician was kidnaped
 in June and was released in December. In February Tigre
 People's Liberation Front (TPLF) guerrillas kidnaped 6
 expatriate relief workers and held them several days before
 releasing them. In April the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF)
 captured 2 Irish aid workers in a resettlement area and held
 them several days. It appeared that some of the kidnapings
 were in protest of Western donor involvement in resettlement
 schemes. The OLF, particularly, has protested the
 displacement of the Oromo people, to whose traditional land
 the settlers have been moved.
 
 
 110
 ETHIOPIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The new Constitution notably omits a passage from the 1955
 Constitution prohibiting cruel and inhuman punishment.
 Torture has been used against members of most opposition
 groups, both those opposed for ideological reasons and those
 opposed for a combination of ideological and ethnic/regional
 separatist reasons, such as the EPLF in Eritrea, the TPLF in
 Tigre, and the OLF among the Oromo.
 Political prisoners are initially taken to central
 investigation centers operated by the Ministry of Interior,
 such as the "third police station" in Addis Ababa or the
 Mariam Gimki Center in Asmara. Interrogation is often
 combined with physical abuse, especially for those suspected
 of affiliation with an opposition or insurgency group. Common
 methods of torture included prolonged beating on the soles of
 the feet, prolonged suspension from a rope in a contorted
 position, death threats, mock executions, sleep deprivation,
 and submergence to the point of unconsciousness in tanks of
 dirty water. Amnesty International's (AI) 1988 report, which
 covers events in 1987, notes that the organization continued
 to receive persistent reports of the torture of suspected
 government opponents after their arrest.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite the PDRE's new Constitution providing for arraignment
 in court within 48 hours, arrest warrants, a fair trial,
 protection against self-incrimination and the right to
 counsel, Ethiopians suspected of antigovernment actions or
 sentiments continue to be subject to arrest or detention by
 the police without charge or judicial review. In politically
 sensitive arrests, the Government generally prefers to operate
 in secret, taking the suspect from home at night. In most
 cases, political detainees are held incommunicado, without
 charge and without legal representation, at least initially
 and sometimes for the length of their term of incarceration.
 The term of confinement for a suspect held without legal
 charge is subject to the whim of the detaining official or
 agent. Most of the 2,000-3,000 political detainees and
 prisoners (as estimated by outside human rights groups) still
 have not been formally charged or sentenced. In fact, some
 detainees continued to be held without charge 14 years after
 their detention. Because of limited information available, no
 estimate of the number of persons detained in 1988 can be
 made. However, unlike in previous years, there were no
 reported instances of prominent Ethiopians being taken into
 custody.
 Constitutional guarantees have also been curtailed by the
 deteriorating security situation in the north, the imposition
 of a state of emergency in 2 of the country's 14 provinces (as
 allowed in the Constitution), and the PDRE's obsession with
 internal security very broadly defined. The state of
 emergency suspends many rights by granting broad powers to an
 Administrator General appointed by the President, by
 establishing military courts, and by empowering the security
 forces to stop, detain, and hold indefinitely (at any time,
 without court or prosecutor's warrant) any person who has
 violated or who is suspected of having violated the special
 decree or who in any manner disturbs law and order within the
 emergency areas.
 
 
 111
 ETHIOPIA
 Since imposition of the state of emergency in Tigre and
 Eritrea, there have been numerous reports alleging the
 arbitrary arrest of Eritreans suspected of being rebel
 sympathizers, and, often, their incarceration without being
 charged. Although lack of access to the north limits
 monitoring of these abuses in the emergency areas, there were
 confirmed reports of the arbitrary arrest of several Eritreans
 in Addis Ababa who remain incarcerated without charge.
 There were several credible reports in 1988 of young males
 being forcibly conscripted on both the Government and the
 rebel side. On the Government side, armed soldiers, kebele
 officers, or local militias reportedly rounded up young males
 from the streets, from school rooms, and from door-to-door
 searches of homes and immediately impressed them into
 service. Those who tried to evade conscription allegedly were
 shot (see Section l.a.). (Kebeles, urban neighborhood
 associations, are the primary units of urban administration.)
 On the rebel side, there have been reports that the EPLF
 forcibly recruited Afar tribesmen for military service and
 killed civilians who attempted to protect the young Afars from
 conscription.
 The number and treatment of prisoners held by government
 forces and rebel groups are unknown. Some reports indicate
 that the treatment of PDRE prisoners by some guerilla forces
 generally has been good. The Government apparently does not
 recognize rebels captured in battle as prisoners of war, but
 rather treats them as traitors, either executing or
 imprisoning them. The Government considers its own soldiers
 captured by insurgent forces as deserters who merit execution,
 imprisonment, or immediate reassignment to the war front if
 returned. However, the fate of 127 prisoners of war returned
 to Ethiopia from Eritrea via Djibouti in October is unknown.
 The Government prevents relief organizations from providing
 communications between families and the PDRE prisoners in
 rebel hands. In 1987 the EPLF allowed the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) limited access to some of
 its prisoners, but later, due to strained relations with the
 ICRC, the EPLF terminated the program.
 There were some positive human rights developments in 1988,
 including the release from prison of the 7 remaining female
 members of the Ethiopian royal family who had been
 incarcerated since 1974 (3 male members remain in detention)
 and the release of approximately 25 people arrested in 1987 in
 Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, and Gondar for reportedly arranging
 the surreptitious emigration of Jews from Ethiopia. The
 Ethiopian Attorney General was reported to have begun a prison
 census in 1988 to determine which prisoners were being held
 without charge or trial in violation of the new constitutional
 provisions. Recently, a major diplomatic initiative by the
 PDRE to improve its relations with Somalia led to a
 reestablishment of diplomatic relations and a negotiated
 prisoner exchange through the ICRC for those captured during
 the 1977 war between the two countries.
 Many Ethiopians remain in exile unable to return to Ethiopia
 for fear of persecution. One million Ethiopians reside as
 refugees in neighboring countries. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 112
 ETHIOPIA
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The modern court system has the Supreme Court at the apex and
 includes magistrate courts and a Special Court of Appeal. The
 loosely controlled military courts established in Tigre and
 Eritrea under the state of emergency, which have jurisdiction
 over a wide range of activities, operate without regard to
 constitutional protections.
 There continued to be no real separation between the executive
 branch and the judiciary. Courts are subject to political
 control and are responsive to the requirements of Ethiopia's
 leadership. Law enforcement, centralized in the Public
 Security Section of the Ministry of Interior, continued to
 bypass judicial procedures in the interest of state security
 regardless of constitutional provisions.
 In practice, the right to a fair public trial is observed and
 respected in civil and criminal cases of a nonpolitical
 nature. These cases generally are based upon the submission
 of evidence in a public setting. Minor cases are tried at the
 kebele level, while more serious criminal accusations are
 tried in cQurts where the accused has access to
 court-appointed lawyers. The criminal court system is open to
 political manipulations. For example, in one case in 1987, a
 high official, arrested for political reasons, was sentenced
 to more than 15 years in prison for a minor infraction after a
 trial which the judge himself agreed was based solely on
 circumstantial evidence.
 When the Ministry of Interior allows political trials to take
 place, they are almost always held in secret, with only the
 verdict (if even that) publicly announced. Prisoners cleared
 of charges or whose terms have been completed are not always
 promptly released from prison. AI's 1988 report notes the
 difficulty in obtaining information on political prisoners but
 mentions several categories of prisoners, e.g., those held on
 suspicion of having links with armed opposition forces (often
 based only on ethnic origin) and those attempting to flee the
 country, an offense which in special cases can bring the death
 penalty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the *inviolability of the house"
 and protects against unlawful entry into private homes. In
 reality, as in the past, warrants are not used for searches of
 offices or private homes. In Eritrea and Tigre the state of
 emergency grants the armed forces great latitude in searching
 or even confiscating suspected premises.
 Surveillance of persons--both visual or through the use of
 listening devices--continues with no legal restraints. All
 mail is subject to government monitoring. Ethiopian citizens
 can be called in at any time for questioning by authorities
 and for mandatory kebele meetings, political rallies, or
 marches. Refusal to appear for any of the above may result in
 imprisonment without hearing.
 Local kebele association officials monitor urban Ethiopians,
 whereas peasant association leaders perform the same function
 in the countryside. These officials monitor visitors
 received, items brought in and out of houses, any meetings,
 and adherence to local curfews. The scope of such
 
 
 113
 ETHIOPIA
 surveillance and petty interference in the private lives of
 Ethiopian citizens depends heavily on the makeup of the kebele
 and its leadership.
 Government proclamations designed to enforce Socialist
 patterns of work make it illegal for a private farmer to
 employ laborers on his farm or to own more than one home.
 Such proclamations, however, are apparently ignored in some
 remote areas of the country.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of'speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government closely monitors the pronouncements of public
 officials, academics, and clergy. Some instructors and
 professors in secondary schools and at the university have
 resisted the politicization of education. Academic freedom,
 although seriously circumscribed, especially in the political
 and social sciences, still finds limited expression at the
 university.
 The Government owns and operates all information media and
 exercises censorship through editorial boards and the Ministry
 of Information. Expression of unauthorized political opinions
 or of views at variance with the official government line can
 result in imprisonment. Political, economic, and social
 policies are formulated at top levels of government, then
 disseminated and monitored through the government-controlled
 media and government-organized citizen groups.
 Books and magazines can be confiscated if deemed to contain
 sentiments opposed to the regime. Foreign magazines and
 newspapers are not readily available since foreign exchange is
 not granted to purchase them. Foreign radio broadcasts are
 widely listened to by the Ethiopian elite. There is no
 evidence of overt attempts by the Government to interfere with
 radio reception.
 Local journalists are all considered to be government
 employees. Foreign journalists often have difficulty in
 obtaining visas, and the Government frequently restricts
 access to areas outside Addis Ababa, including the areas of
 conflict and famine and refugee camps.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Notwithstanding constitutional provisions, assembly of any
 sort, not previously approved by the Government, is strictly
 forbidden. In the few reported incidents of unauthorized
 assemblies, the Government reacted by sending the participants
 to rural settlement schemes, or, in the case of students, by
 refusing their return to the university. In contrast,
 attendance at government-sponsored rallies, meetings and
 parades is frequently mandatory and enforced by a wide range
 of sanctions. Ethiopians, traditionally cautious in their
 associations with one another and with foreigners, have become
 even more so under the present regime. Frequent or close
 association with foreigners can result in questioning, arrest
 and detention. Professional associations, such as the Rotary
 and Lions Clubs, are allowed to operate although their
 membership and activities presumably are monitored by the
 Government. Trade and professional associations were
 reorganized in 1986 by the Workers Party of Ethiopia. New
 
 
 114
 ETHIOPIA
 boards were selected for these groups from members approved by
 the party.
 In October 1987 and early 1988, students at two University of
 Addis Ababa campuses demonstrated against living conditions in
 the dormitories and the removal of the dean of students.
 About 10 students were arrested for their alleged leadership
 role in the demonstrations, but they were released a short
 time later.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Since April 1988, the PDRE's war mobilization has included a
 strong appeal to Ethiopian nationalism and traditional values,
 including religion, an integral part of the national culture.
 Government officials have indicated that religion is now being
 factored into aspects of national planning. After the death
 of the abuna, head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in June
 1988, the Prime Minister attended the funeral, which was given
 front page coverage in the daily newspaper. The Government
 carefully controlled the election of the new abuna apparently
 to ensure the election of someone who would be sympathetic to
 party policy.
 The positive aspect of the Government's new attitude toward
 religion is increased respect for freedom of worship and
 proselytism for the Orthodox Church and Islam (each claims
 about 50 percent of the Ethiopian population) as provided in
 the Constitution.
 Party members are officially prohibited from worshiping, but
 this ban is not enforced. According to press reports, kebele
 officials often discourage church attendance, generally by
 scheduling mandatory meetings on Sunday mornings. The
 Government nationalized most church property when it took
 power, and the Orthodox Church reportedly is dependent on
 annual government compensation payments to cover clergy
 salaries.
 Orthodox and Islamic holidays are recognized by the
 Government, and officials of both religions are allowed to
 exercise jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriage.
 However, the Government expunges reference to any deity from
 dialog in television programs and films and forbids such
 reference in government statements or publications. The State
 continues to monitor religious practice and any teaching which
 might be contrary to its political line. The Government also
 appoints officials to the Orthodox Church administration to
 ensure church conformity with party policies.
 Some other religions, particularly foreign Protestant
 evangelical organizations, which found their activities
 sharply curtailed after the 1974 revolution, have experienced
 a general trend of greater tolerance by central and local
 government officials over the last 2 years. Local government
 officials allowed a number of churches that had been closed to
 reopen. In 1986 a number of church officials were released
 from detention, including the general secretary of the
 Mennonite church (who had been detained since 1981) and
 leaders of the Ethiopian evangelical Mekane Yesus church. The
 Government issues permits to foreign missionaries to enter and
 work in Ethiopia in limited numbers, although ostensibly as
 
 
 115
 ETHIOPIA
 development specialists, not as missionaries. The Jehovah's
 Witnesses, however, remain totally banned.
 Ethiopia's small Jewish community (the Falashas) live in areas
 peripheral to insurgent activity in Tigre and Gondar. Stories
 of genocidal actions by Ethiopian authorities or of highly
 brutal behavior toward Ethiopian Jews have not been
 substantiated by American visitors to these areas. Although
 Jews do suffer some economic discrimination (a holdover from
 prerevolutionary practices), the PDRE has been incieasingly
 tolerant of the Falashas. The Government permits development
 assistance directed at the Falasha areas, even when such
 assistance has included a religious element (i.e.,
 construction of synagogues).
 Large numbers of Ethiopian Jews have surreptitiously left the
 country in recent years. Although the Government has
 attempted to block this exodus as part of its overall
 antiemigration policy (see Section l.d.), it did release about
 25 persons in 1988 who were under arrest for arranging the
 illegal emigration of Falashas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Permission is required for Ethiopian citizens to change their
 place of residence, and persons considered politically suspect
 can be forbidden to travel outside their home areas. Travel
 within Ethiopia has remained restricted particularly in Tigre
 and Eritrea. In addition, the state of emergency has closed
 off a number of districts in the two provinces to any
 civilians; homeowners were given 15 days from the date of
 declaration of the state of emergency to evacuate specific
 areas with their personal belongings. The state of emergency
 decree granted the Administrator Generals of the two provinces
 broad powers to move any person or group from one place to
 another within the region or outside the region.
 Late in 1987, the Government resumed the internal resettlement
 program, pledging to carry it out voluntarily and announcing
 plans to resettle 300,000 people during the following year.
 By April 1988 about 10,000 had been resettled before the
 Government's preoccupation with the war effort in the north
 led to temporary suspension of the program. Preliminary
 reports had indicated that most of those being resettled had
 volunteered, had been humanely transported, and had arrived at
 well prepared sites. However, about 40 people were killed
 or wounded on February 8 at Korem when soldiers fired
 indiscriminately on a crowd of several thousand drought
 victims after they passively refused a local administrator's
 demands that they board trucks for resettlement. When the
 international community called for the Ethiopian Government to
 investigate the incident of forced resettlement at Korem, the
 Government refused, labeling the reports of the incident as
 lies.
 The Government's mandatory "villagization" campaign, which
 collects scattered rural farmers into newly created villages,
 continued in 1988. It is sanctioned under article 10,
 subarticle 3 of the Constitution,,which states that "the state
 shall encourage the scattered rural population to aggregate in
 order to change their backward living conditions and to enable
 them to lead a better life." According to the Government,
 close to 12 million Ethiopians had been moved into such
 villages as of July 1, 1988 (31 percent of the rural
 
 
 116
 ETHIOPIA
 population). The Government has announced plans that call for
 50 percent of the rural population to be moved into villages
 by 1993.
 Peasants cannot avoid participating in the program, and to
 date almost everyone living in areas scheduled for
 villagization has been moved into the new settlements. The
 program has proceeded in the Gondar region despite some
 scattered antigovernment violence in opposition to the program
 early in 1987. The Government has devoted few resources to
 this large program. Farmers must dismantle their own houses,
 transport them to the government-selected village site, and
 reassemble them. Social qervices such as schools, new roads,
 or clinics--though promised--are rare. The Government has
 repeatedly stated that this program is a precursor to
 collectivization of Ethiopia's agriculture. Despite this
 goal, over 90 percent of agriculture is still on an individual
 family basis.
 The continued conflict in those Ethiopian provinces most
 affected by drought and famine has increasingly led both the
 Government and the rebels to utilize distribution of relief
 aid as a weapon. An October 1987 attack by insurgent forces
 on an unarmed and unescorted U.N. famine relief column,
 destroyed 23 trucks and 400 tons of wheat. In January EPLF
 forces attacked an unarmed and an unescorted commercial
 convoy, destroying 17 trucks and 176 tons of food. In April
 the Government expelled all expatriate relief workers in Tigre
 and Eritrea, disrupting the relief distribution effort in
 government-controlled areas and prohibiting food deliveries to
 extensive areas of two .drought-stricken provinces contested by
 insurgent forces. The Government's action thus denied food to
 more than a million of the 2 to 3 million Ethiopians
 previously being targeted by international relief efforts. In
 May United Nations personnel were allowed to reestablish a
 limited presence. Later in 1988, additional personnel from
 the U.N. and nongovernmental relief organizations were allowed
 to monitor relief distribution in some parts of the north.
 Travel abroad by Ethiopians is closely controlled by the
 Government through the issuance of passports and mandatory
 exit visas. Passport applications require a letter of
 recommendation from the appropriate kebele head. Foreigners
 in Ethiopia have always been required to obtain a travel
 permit for internal travel. The Government prohibits all
 foreign access to areas of conflict, especially in Tigre. In
 mid-1988, the Government often denied requests for permission
 of U.S. Embassy personnel to travel in nonconflict areas but
 later in 1988 approved all requests.
 Emigration is highly restricted, except in special
 circumstances such as marriage to or adoption by a foreign
 national. Leaving Ethiopia without authorization is a serious
 offense punishable by 5 to 15 years' imprisonment or, in
 exceptional cases, reportedly by death. Nonetheless,
 considerable illegal emigration occurs either under the
 subterfuge of travel abroad for business or to visit
 relatives, or by arduous treks overland and surreptitious
 crossing of borders.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for Ethiopians living
 abroad (numbering more than 1 million) remains in effect.
 Since December 1986, according to figures provided by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
 
 
 117
 ETHIOPIA
 approximately 25,000 Ethiopians spontaneously returned to
 Ethiopia from Sudan. In addition, UNHCR repatriation programs
 have successfully repatriated 3,591 Ethiopians from Djibouti
 since late 1986 and approximately 5,579 Ethiopians from
 Somalia during the same period. These official and
 spontaneous returnees were aided by the UNHCR. There are no
 reports that the returnees were mistreated or discriminated
 against upon their return. Also, it is thought, though not
 confirmed, that many Ethiopian refugees in northern Somalia
 may have returned to Ethiopia in an effort to fle6 civil
 strife.
 Instability in neighboring countries has stimulated a large-
 scale refugee movement into Ethiopia with more than 750,000
 entering the country--over 350,000 from Sudan and 400,000 from
 Somalia. The Government's limitations on access to refugee
 camps by much of the international community have made it
 difficult to ensure that the refugees receive relief
 assistance and adequate protection under the Geneva
 Convention. There have been no reports of the Government
 forcibly repatriating refugees. However, the Government has
 periodically harrassed Sudanese refugees and "people of
 concern" to the UNHCR. For example, in October Ethiopian
 security forces detained a Sudanese refugee shortly before his
 planned voluntary repatriation to Sudan. He was held several
 days before being released and allowed to return to Sudan.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Ethiopia are not free to change the Government.
 The new Constitution institutionalizes all power in the
 Workers Party of Ethiopia (WPE), the President, his advisors,
 and the 23-member Council of State. Political and economic
 policies are still dictated to the population with little
 opportunity for public debate.
 The WPE and its mass organizations purport to offer Ethiopian
 citizens a means of participation in government, but their
 real role is to ensure adherence to Marxist-Leninist
 principles. The WPE, like its Soviet counterpart, is an
 exclusive group--not everyone can join. Higher level
 government officials are required to join if they wish to keep
 their jobs. Kebeles, the primary party/government control
 mechanisms at the local level, control housing allocation,
 basic food rationing, political indoctrination, and
 implementation of other government policies, such as
 registration and selection of youths for national military
 service.
 To give a semblance of democracy to the newly organized-
 administration, the Government sponsored a referendum in 1987
 to approve the new Constitution and an election in the same
 year to choose the members of the 835-member National Shengo
 (one chamber Parliament) from slates of candidates approved by
 the WPE. Until now the Shengo has proved to be little more
 than a Government showpiece. It meets only once a year, and
 itz first session in July included a series of unanimous "yes"
 votes and the post facto "adoption" of various measures
 previously approved by the Council of State. Shengo elections
 are to be held every 5 years.
 The new Constitution mandates the formation of local Shengos
 in the 25 newly established administrative regions and the 5
 autonomous zones. Under the autonomy plan, the Assembly of
 
 
 118
 ETHIOPIA
 the Eritrean autonomous zone is to have the exclusive right to
 promulgate and enforce its own laws so long as they do not
 conflict with'national laws. The Assemblies of the other
 autonomous zones (Assab, Tigre, Dire Dawa, and Ogaden) would
 require permission from the central Government in order to
 formulate their own laws. The Constitution also lists a
 number of responsibilities reserved for the regional
 assemblies and their executive committees, including the
 preparation of social and economic plans and budgets for
 approval by the national Shengo. The PDRE hopes the autonomy
 plan will serve as a basis for a political solution to the
 various internal insurgencies, but its implementation still
 has not really begun.
 Women are, poorly represented at the top echelons of
 Government. There are 46 female members in the 835-member
 Shengo, and there are no female ministers or members in the
 Council of State.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government- resists attempts by international and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate human rights
 cases. It did not respond, for example, to Amnesty
 International's various inquiries in 1986, such as on the
 reported use of torture, or to its more recent appeals to
 respect major international human rights agreements. There is
 no governmental or private body to investigate alleged human
 rights violations. Ethiopia is not a signatory to any of the
 United Nations human rights documents or the African Charter
 of Human and Peoples' Rights. However, Ethiopia is a newly
 selected African representative to the U.N. Commission on
 Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all Ethiopians
 irrespective of nationality, sex, religion, occupation, social
 or other status. The highest government echelons are no
 longer dominated by the Amhara ethnic group but include many
 Oromos and a few Eritreans and Tigreans. Almost all senior
 government and political figures are of Christian origin,
 although the population is approximately 50 percent Muslim.
 While the rights of women are protected and promised
 additional government support by the Constitution, sex
 discrimination persists. Various U.N. studies indicate
 Ethiopian women are subject to many disadvantages such as
 cultural and traditional biases, marriages imposed at a very
 young age, hard and time-consuming labor, inadequate
 employment opportunities, and subaverage wages in urban
 areas. Village leadership is invariably male, and all clergy
 are male. However, women in the principal Ethiopian cultures
 (Oromo, Amhara, Eritrean, and Tigrean) enjoy certain economic
 rights equal to those of men. They may inherit, sell, or buy
 property and engage in business. In some rural areas, women
 have a subservient status within the home, and child marriages
 remain common, despite opposition by the Government.
 Long-established practices, such as female circumcision,
 remain prevalent among Ethiopian Orthodox and Muslim families
 despite government opposition. The Revolutionary Women's

 ETHIOPIA
 Association, a mass organization created in 1980, has the
 proclaimed goal of improving the status of women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The only labor organization allowed to operate is the
 government-controlled Ethiopian Trade Union (ETU). The ETU,
 one of Ethiopia's mass organizations under the party's
 control, is a political group used by the Government to
 implement its policies, expand party control within the work
 place, and prevent work stoppages. Strikes and slowdowns are
 forbidden. Many of ETU's top leaders have been trained in
 Eastern Europe, and the organization has close ties to Soviet
 and Eastern European labor organizations. The 1988 Report of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of
 Experts repeated its criticisms of the mandatory, single trade
 union structure in Ethiopia and renewed its request that
 freedom of association be granted to rural workers. The
 Committee noted the Government's assertion that, pursuant to
 the Constitution of 1987, a new labor code will be submitted
 to the National Shengo which will reflect the right of workers
 and employers to establish and join organizations without
 previous authorization, and which will take into account the
 Committee's comments, with particular reference to those
 concerning restrictions on the right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are not permitted to organize independently in
 Ethiopia. Labor/management negotiations do not occur in
 practice, although labor law does provide for it. Collective
 bargaining as such does not exist. Labor laws and practices
 are uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no information that forced labor is practiced in
 Ethiopia. However, on the demand of the kebele officials,
 citizens are required to "volunteer" their services for
 frequent community work programs. Workers are also expected
 to "volunteer" to work extra hours and weekends, at no pay, so
 that factory quotas can be met. The proclamation of the state
 of emergency in May was linked to a proclamation requiring
 that all employees donate 1 month of their salary to the war
 effort.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age of 14 for nonfarm labor seems to be respected
 in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The new Constitution recognizes in principle the right to work.
 and to rest. Given high unemployment, there is pressure for
 existing jobs in the modern economy. The maximum legal
 workweek of 48 hours is generally respected in practice, but
 as noted there is much "volunteer" labor to meet factory or
 office quotas, and government workers receive little of their
 promised time off. Health and safety codes for the workplace
 are rudimentary and remain unenforced.

 ETHIOPIA
 The minimum wage in Ethiopia is about $24 per month.
 Additional allowances effectively raise the minimum wage of a
 full-time employee to about $34. Day laborers in the
 agricultural sector receive almost $1 per day plus some
 payment in kind (shelter or a meal, for example). Day
 laborers in the urban areas receive almost $1.50 per day plus
 transportation to and from the workplace. The minimum wage
 has been under review for some time without decision. It is
 not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living, and
 employees paid at these minimum rates must supplement their
 income such as through help from the extended family, or
 through subsistence farming.
