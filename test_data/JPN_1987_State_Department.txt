 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy operating within toe
 framework of a Constitution adopted in 1947.. Sovereignty is
 vested in the people and the Emperor is defined as the symbol
 of state. Its thriving free.market economy is the second
 largest in. the.4orld in terms of gross national product.
 Although only :19 percent of the country is arable, agriculture
 is practiced so intensively that the country has an
 agricultural self-sufficiency rate of around 70 per-cent.
 Japa& .culture incorporates nany elements from .the West while
 retaining st;,rhg Eastern roots. Buddhist,- Shinto, -and
 Confucian  tgaditions continue to have a basic and pervasive
 influende'on thought end social institutions,, but several
 minor beligibns also flourish.  Less than 1 percent of the
 population is Christian.
 Although the Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas,-the
 citizens of this densely populated nation have a cultural,
 ethnic,.and racial homogeneity which makes them less willing
 to integrate alien resfdents in Japan into their society.
 While'the legal system has gradually evolved toward granting
 equality of opportunity to minorities,'there remains social
 prejudide against Koreans, around 587,000 of whom are first,
 second, and, third g4neration permanent residents, in addition
 to the appoximately 136,000 naturalized Japanese nationals of
 Korean acetry. There are also about 100,000 ethnic Chinese
 living in Japen, the majority of whom arepermanent residents
 rather than citizens. An estimated 1.2 million descendants of
 persons h4s1or-ically considered to be outcasts ("Burakumin")
 also suffer social but. iot legal discrimination. Additionally,
 there are reportedly over 24,000 descendants of Ainu, Japan's
 indigenous people, now concentrated in Hokkaido, as well as
 Okinawans, both of whom suffer social discrimination. The
 Japanese Constitution states, "All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in
 political,, economic, or social relations because of race,
 creed," sei  social status, or family origin."  The-human
 rights a'ssured by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are
 secured by a just and efficient legal system.
 On the niiona1 level, power is divided among executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. Executive power is vested
 in a cabinet bomposed of a prime ministeX and ministers of
 state and it is responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house
 parliament. The Diet, elected under a system of universal
 suffrage and the secret ballot, has the responsibility to
 designate the prime Iinister, who must be-a member of that
 body. Nearly 70 percentof the electorate usually votes in
 general elections, which involve candidates from six active
 and freely functioning political parties. The judicial system
 has several layers of courts, with the Supreme Court as the
 final authority. There is a well-organized and
 well-disciplined national police force and it is firmly under
 the control of the civil authorities.
 The right of workers to organize, bargain, and act
 collectively is assured by the Constitution. Slightly under
 30 percent of the active work force belongs to labor unions.
 Most unions' are involved in political activity as well as
 labor relations. The Equal Employment Opportunity Law,
 prohibiting discrimination in the workplace based on sex, took
 effect April 1986 but has yet to have a significant impact on
 the employment practices-of Japanese corporations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of politically motivated murder by the
 Government and no reports of such by other organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases in which people were abducted, secretly
 arrested, held in clandestine detention, or held hostage by
 security forces or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading-
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is provided for in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. There is no evidence that penal
 treatment varies by social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is assured by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Under the Criminal.Procedure Code, a suspect may
 be held for up to 10 days, during which the prosecutor must
 decide whethei to indict or release him. This period may be
 extended by a judge for up to another 10 days if a judge
 recognizes a necessity for such extension. People cannot be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be
 prepared to demonstrate before trial that probable cause
 exists to detain the accused. The'length of time before a
 suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of the
 crime, but rarely'exceeds 2 months; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Preventive detention does not exist.
 The key statute protectingworkers, the Labor Standards Law of
 1947, prohibits the use of forced labor. There- are no known
 cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all ciminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon. arrest and assured a public trial by an
 independent.civilian court with. defense pounsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures-defendants the
 right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as
 well as free and private.accels to counsel, although the
 latter may be'abrdgedin practice. Defendants arplso
 protected from the application of laws retroactively and have
 the right of access to incriminating evidence after a formal
 indictment has been made. Judges are appointed by the Cabinet
 for permanent terms but face periodic review through popular
 referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision
 of a trial court of first instance may, within the period
 prescribed by law, appeal to a higher court.. There are several
 levels of courts, with the Supreme.Court serving as the highest
 judicial authority. There is no trial by jury in Japan.

 JAPAN
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Japanese
 authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. In one instance in 1987, local
 police officials apparently attempted to wiretap a private
 telephone ag part of-an investigation. No indictments were
 passed down, but steps were taken to discipline the officers
 involved. There are no reports that the Government or any
 other organization has arbitrarily interfered with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence.'
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of' Speech and Press
 The Japanese Constitution, an independent press and judiciary,
 and a functiloning democratic political system combine to
 ensure freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided 'for in the Constitutio' and
 respected in practice.
 The Constltutic.rd-s.a1tes that unions have' thie right to
 organize, barSai1,-act  colectively-and (implicitly) -assures
 the right to-strlke , a'-rlght which has been exercised'
 frequently. Japanese law also allows them to lobby add to
 make pdlitical camphign contr ibutidns. Most unions actively
 engage in pdlitical" aswell as labor activity. They are
 involved also in internationalbodies and  bilateral exchanges.
 Slightly under 30 percent of th& active work force belong to
 labor unions. PublicFbmployees do not have the right to
 strike but  do hav e -eourse 'to mediation and arbitration in
 order to resolve disputes. 'Members of the armed forces,
 police officers, and firefighters are not permitted to
 organize. In exchange for a ban on their right to strike,
 government employees' pay raises are determined by the
 Governmentbdssd-on a recommendation' by the independent
 National Personnel Authority (NPA). The Government's failure
 to meet NPA recommendations in previous years led the General
 Council of Trade Unions of Japan to file a complaint with the
 International Labor Organization, but the NPA's recommendations
 have now been fully implemented.
 c. Freedom of-Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practicb. While'Bddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two'major reliï¿½i6ns-in JApan4 'there are many others,'-  .
 including-several-'Chistlan denominations. Missionaries are
 Welcome and receive specials'Pisa status. Some temnples and
 shrines, as treasured hational properties, re~eive'public
 support for maintenance;
 d. Freedom of Movemen Within the Country, Foreign
 -Travel, Emigration, and'Repatriation.
 Japanese citizens have the'right to travel freely, both within
 Japan-tnd abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to-repatriate voluntarily. -Nationality is never
 revoked.

 JAPAN
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of-Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of
 the Diet. The-Liberal Democratic Party, which has been in
 power continuously since 1955, won a substantial parliamentary
 majority in the July 1986 national elections. Five opposition
 parties are active. All adult citizens have the right to vote
 by secret ballot. Political interest groups can organize and
 engage in nonviolent political activity regardless of political
 beliefs. Well-organized-labor--unions ensure participation by
 workers in the political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 .f Human Rights
 Various.groups petitioned the office of the United Nations
 Commission for Human Rights (UNHRC) in- 1987 to take up
 allegations of-discrimination against Japan's indigenous
 people, the Ainu, and of maltreatment of mental patients. The
 Government responded to the complaints, and the UNHRC decided
 not to pursue further discussion or investigation. In response
 -to both domestic criticism and inquiries by the International
 Commission of Jurists on behalf of mental health groups itn
 1986, the Government in 1987 acted to improve mental health
 care. Steps were taken to modernize facilities, and the
 mental health law-was revised to include safeguards against
 involuntary admittance or discharge.
 Through its membership in the UNHRC, the Government works for
 improvement of human rights practices in other countries.
 There is a Human Rights and Refugee Division in the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs to give long-range attention to these-
 matters.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are some 23.3 million female workers in Japan, comprising
 34 percent of the employed population. Discrimination by
 private employers against women is prohibited by the
 Constitution and by legislative measures adopted over the past
 30 years to accord women the same legal status as men. In
 April 1986, an equal employment opportunity law came into
 effect. This law is intended to eliminate sex discrimination
 in such areas as recruitment and hiring, pay inequality, and
 the amount of night or overtime hours that can be worked.
 However, the law has been criticized as containing no concrete
 measures, such as penalties for violators, to ensure equality
 for women workers. In any case, it appears that passage of
 this legislation has not by itself changed the prevailing
 social attitudes which discourage women from seeking and
 obtaining positions of managerial responsibility. In fact,
 according to one authoritative survey taken in 1987, the
 number of women in Japan who disagree with the statement, "a
 woman's place is in the home," has decreased significantly
 during the past three years. Those who do wish to pursue
 careers find many obstacles remaining in their way and are
 unlikely to advance as quickly as their male counterparts.
 Significant disparities remain between the salaries of men and
 women workers, but these are not based overtly on sex.

 JAPAN
 As a homogeneous nation with a long tradition of isolation
 from other cultures, Japanese society has been resistant to
 the integration of alien residents despite its general
 receptivity to foreign ideas. Entrenched social prejudice
 against both ]Korean .residents (most of whom were born, raised,
 and educated in Japan) and members of the "Burakumin" community
 (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced so-called
 "unclean" professions such as hide tanning) restricts the
 access of both groups to private housing, employment, and
 marriage opportunities. Groups representing the Ainu and
 Okinawan communities also complain about discrimination,
 especially regarding employment opportunities.
 In recent years the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations extending to permanent resident aliens, 82 percent
 of whom are.Zoreans, the benefits of equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those who
 otherwise qualify, and certain public employment rights. The
 Foreign Ministry nQw.pronounces Korean names according to the
 Korean rather, than the Japanese reading of name characters.
 Korean residents of.Japan educated in private Korean schools,
 however, stil, suffer ome discrimination in admission to
 national unrversities.
 The Gover-nment acted to rectify an issue of concern to
 resident Kozeans in September-when it revised the Alien
 Registration Law to require only a single fingerprinting of
 foreign residents rather than repeated fingerprinting at.-
 5-year intervals.. Groups representing Korean -esidents'have
 called for abolishment of the fingerprinting requirement and
 are not satisfied with the revised law. The Government has
 also enacted,,the Special Measures for Regional Development
 Law, which provides funds until 1992 to complete projects
 started under a similar law which expired in 1987. This law,
 first issued in 1969, was designed to help assimilate Burakumin
 into mainstream society through a number of social, economic,
 and legal programs.
 According to the law, aliens with 5 years' continuous
 residence are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 been naturalized. Naturalization is a difficult and
 complicated process requiring "proof of assimilation into the
 Japanese culture," and many Korean residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization on the grounds that their cultural identity
 would be erased by the requirements. Korean human rights
 activists have urged Japan to..restore unconditionally the
 citizenship which Korean residents of Japan had previously but
 which was. revoked after World War II.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Revised Labor Standards Law of 1987 provides for the
 phased reduction of maximum working hours from the current
 .6-day, 48-hour, workweek to 40 hours by early in the next
 decade. Although introduced as a means of increasing leisure
 time available to the work force, the law has been criticized
 by employee groups because of the increased flexibility it
 gives employers in calculating actual working hours and
 vacation benefits. Under the law, workers under the age of 18
 may not be employed in dangerous or harmful work, and minors
 under 15 years of age may not be employed as workers. A
 system fixing minimum wages on industry and regional bases was
 introduced by the Minimum Wages Law of 1959. The Ministry of
 
 
 717
 JAPAN
 Labor effectively and efficiently administers the various laws
 and regulations concerning workers, .including those governing
 occupational health and safety, principal among which is the
 Industrial Safety and Health Law of 1972.
