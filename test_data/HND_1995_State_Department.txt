 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and unicameral Con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms and an independent judiciary headed by a Supreme
 Court of Justice (CSJ). President Carlos Roberto Reina took office in January 1994
 as the fourth democratically elected President since the reestablishment of democ-
 racy in 1982. Both major parties (Liberal and National) have now assumed power
 from the other after free elections.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise the army, air force, navy, and the
 police (Public Security Force-FUSEP) as a fourth branch. The HOAF operates with
 considerable institutional and legal autonomy, particularly in the realm of internal
 security and military affairs. It controls the police, numerous private sector busi-
 nesses, and the national telephone company. In January, however, the legislature
 removed the merchant marine from military control and placed it under civilian con-
 trol as of April. In September the Congress passed legislation which will transfer
 the police from military to civilian control in 1996.
 The Government established an Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Re-
 form in 1993, in response to credible allegations of extrajudicial killings by members
 of the FUSEP, particularly its Directorate of National Investigations (DND. In Jan-
 uary 1994 it established a new Public Ministry containing a new Directorate of
 Criminal Investigations (DIC) to replace the DNI; however, the DIC is not yet fully
 staffed or equipped. Human rights organizations, including the Government's Na-
 tional Commission for the Protection of Human Rights (CONAPRODE), say that re-
 ports of abuses have declined since the DNI was abolished. However, members of
 both the armed forces and the FUSEP continued to commit human rights abuses.
 The economy is primarily based on agriculture, with a small but growing light
 manufacturing sector. The armed forces play a sizable role in the national economy,
 controlling numerous enterprises usually associated with the private sector, includ-
 ing a bank, several insurance companies, and one of the two cement companies. In
 1994 a drought-induced energy crisis trigered a major recession with real gross do-
 mestic product declining 1.5 perent.   improved energy picture and booming
 world coffee prices created conditions for modest growth of 3-4 percent in 1995.
 Combined unemployment and underemployment were approximately 58 percent,
 and the Government estimated that 63 percent of all citizens live in poverty.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, lthough serious
 problems remain in certain areas. The most widespread human rights abuses con-
 tinued to be arbitrary, illegal and incommunicado detentions, and beatings and
 other abuse of detainees, sometimes including torture. There was once again a small
 number of vigilante killings. Impunit for members of the civilian and military elite,
 exacerbated by a weak, underfunded and sometimes corrupt judicial system, is a
 major cause of human rights problems. Prison conditions remained deplorable.
 Other continuing human rights problems were societal discrimination and violence
 against women, discrimination against indigenous people, abuse of street children,
 and the inability of the judicial system to provide prisoners awaiting trial with swift
 and impartial justice.
 Almost no elected official, member of the business elite, bureaucrat or politician
 was tried, sentenced, or significantly fined in 1995. However, there were a few ex-
 ceptions. Former Honduran Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, arrested on August 21 for
 the sale of Honduran diplomatic and official passports, was released on November
 29 for insufficient evidence. However, the Attorney General is still investigating the
 case, and three other officials involved in the same investigation remain in prison.
 Active duty police Colonel Juan Blas Salazar was sentenced-for narcotics trafficking
 in November. The mayor of Tegucigalpa was also jailed briefly on accusations of
 stealing municipal funds, but was released for lack of evidence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings, but members of the security forces allegedly committed several
 extrajudicial killings.
 The crime rate surged again in 1995, including a rise in the number of homicides.
 It has become increasingly difficult to differentiate between homicides that may
 have been extrajudicial acts by government agents and common crimes. Human
 rights groups have compiled credible evidence to indicate that in at least 40 of these
 cases renegade elements of the security forces or civilian groups working with them
 committed extrajudicial killings of supposed habitual criminals. Widespread frustra-
 tion at the inability of the security forces to control crime, and the well-founded per-
 
 
 ception that a deeply corrupt police force is complicit in the high rate of crime, has
 led to onsiderable pubic support for vigilante gups. Chief Wilfredo Alvarado of
 the Criminal Investigations Directorate publicly disclosed that the DIC has evidence
 of a death squad financed by local businessmen operating against criminals in the
 San Pedro Sula area.
 On September 17, the bodies of four alleged criminals were discovered on the out-
 skirts of Tegucigalpa. The bodies of all four showed signs of beatings and torture
 with bruises on their wrists indicating they had been handcuffed. Of the four, only
 18-year-old Rony Alexis Betancourt, who had been detained on September 15 by the
 pohce in a cell in the 7th Command of FUSEP located in downtown Tegucigalpa,
 has been identified. Betancourt was stabbed in the abdomen and shot three times.
 The police claimed they had released Betancourt, an alleged gang member, from
 custo~dy on September 16. DIC agents are onducting an investigation but have not
 yet identified any suspects.
 On August 3, the bodies of three businessmen (owners of an auto parts store)
 were found outside the city of La Paz riddled with bullets from M-16 and AK-47
 rifles. The three had been beaten and tortured with multiple bruises and fractures
 over all their bodies. The police, who alleged that all three were members of an auto
 theft gang, claimed that the killings occurred elsewhere and the bodies were
 dumped outside La Paz. There are no witnesses, and FUSEP had not interrogated
 or arrested any suspects by year's end.
 Credible allegations of extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP, particu-
 larly its now defunct Directorate of National Investigations, led to the creation in
 January 1994 of the new Public Ministry containing a new civilian-controlled Direc-
 torate of Criminal Investigations to replace the DNI. Human rights groups, includ-
 ing the Attorney General's Office, have noted a continuing drop in the number of
 reports of human rights abuses since the dissolution of the DNI. The new Ministry,
 responsible for investigating all cases of extrajudicial killings, has completed its pro-
 gram of training and organizing its staff. The Ministry will lack the capability, how-
 ever, to investigate adequately current or past criminal cases until the DIC reaches
 a higher level of operational capability. This may not be until the end of 1996 when
 the DIC expects to reach its goal of 1,500 fully trained and equipped agents. The
 DIC currently has 450 investigators with practically no communications or labora-
 to  equipment.
 June a civilian judge ordered the immediate arrest of Colonel Leonel Galindo
 Knutsen, implicated in the May 1991 murder of five unarmed members of the Na-
 tional Association of Honduran Peasants involved in a land dispute with him.
 Galindo has not yet been captured; the DIC continues to search but has been unable
 to locate him. He has been free since December 1993 when his case was transferred
 from the military to the civilian court system.
 There was no progress reported in investigations or prosecutions of other alleged
 extrajudicial killings committed in previous years. These included the 1994 killing
 of 78-year-old evangelical pastor Justo Irias Ordonez; the 1993 killings of Eduardo
 Pina van Tuyl, Guillermo Agurcia Lefebvre, Lourdes Enamorado, Roger David
 Torres Vallejos, Rigoberto Quezada Figueres, Cleofes Colindres Canales, Juan Jose
 Menendez, Glenda Patricia Solorzano Medina, and Jorge Alcides Medina Hernan-
 dez; the 1992 killings of Juan Humberto Sanchez, Rigoberto Boijas, Ramon
 Castellon Baide and Cayo Eng Lee; the 1991 murder of Manuel de Jesus Guerra;
 and the 1990 killings of Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramon Antonio
 Briceno.
 On May 18, after a full review of the trial records, the First Court of Appeals
 upheld the 16-year sentence of Colonel Castillo Maradiga and the 10-year sentence
 of Sergeant Santos Uovares Funez for the 1991 rape and murder of 18-year-old stu-
 dent Riccy Mabel Martinez. Both will serve their full sentences in the Central Peni-
 tentiary in Tegucigalpa.
 b. Dsappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In June the Attorney General opened investigations into the disappearances of
 some 180 people in the 1980's. Various witnesses, survivors, and a few former mem-
 bers of the military have charged that the HOAF, specifically a military intelligence
 group called Battalion 316, kidnaped, tortured, and murdered many of the dis-
 appeared. The Attorney General had several clandestine grave sites excavated in
 November, and forensic scientists identified several remains as those of persons on
 the list of disappeared. The Attorney General and the National Commissioner for
 Human Rights, Leo Valladares, requested from the HOAF and the US. Government
 information they might have to aid this investigation. The HOAF claimed to have
 no relevant information. The US. Government began a review of documents from
 that period and released to the Attorney General and the Commissioner documents
 which had already been declassified.
 
 
 452
 In October a judge called former chief of military intelligence Colonel Leonidas
 Torres Arias to testify in the case of Nelson Mackay, who disappeared in 1982 and
 whose body was exhumed and identified in Decemer 1994. Torres Arias repeated
 statements he had made in Mexico in 1982, that the then Chief of the Armed
 Forces, General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez (now deceased), ordered the forced dis-
 appearance of a number of Hondurans, including Mackay. Torres Arias also testified
 that while he had no evidence linking Colonel Alexander Hernandez to the dis-
 appearance and murder of Mackay and others, Hernandez had known of the crimes.
 c. Torture and Other Cru, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, and police and military authorities is-
 sued assurances throughout 1995 that the practice had been stopped, credible
 charges of torture and other abuse of detainees continue. Some members of the po-
 lice force resort to abuses to obtain confessions and keep suspects in jail. There were
 no reports of torture for political motives.
 The Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), part of FUSEP, investigates cases
 of alleged torture and abuse; OPR officials recommend sanctions for police agents
 found guilty of such mistreatment. However, neither the FUSEP General Command
 nor the OPR is empowered to punish wrongdoers; only the commander of the ac-
 cused agent has the authority to do so. Several human rights groups and the Public
 Ministry criticized the OPR for not being responsive to their requests for impartial
 investigations of FUSEP agents accused of torture and abuses. In June the Public
 Ministry established the Office of Human Rights Inspctor within the DIC to mon-
 itor the behavior of its agents. This office reports to the head of the Human Rights
 Section and to the minister. Investigations by this office resulted in the firing of 38
 DIC agents in 1995.
 One case of alleged torture involved 20-year-old computer technician Angel Anibal
 Aguilar Jimenez. On or about May 14 three DIC agents, without a warrant, ar-
 rested Aguilar for auto theft. They tooi him to DIC headquarters and placed him
 in a detention cell where he alleges they beat him severely over a 2-day period. He
 claims that one DIC agent placed a 9mm pistol in Aguilar's mouth, threatening to
 kill him if he did not confess. After failing to extract a confession, Aguilar said they
 released him. The Honduran Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Hon-
 duras (CODEH) referred this case to the OPR and the Public Ministry for investiga-
 tion. Authorities have not yet made any arrests.
 In another case, agents of the Cobra Squadron (special services police) in San
 Pedro Sula arrested 30-year-old Jose Fredy Aguilera Palma on May 17. They ac-
 cused Aguilera of the murder of Ramon Garcia and placed him in a detention cell
 where he claims they beat him savagely with fists and gun butts. Aguilera alleged
 that the Cobra agents placed over his head a hood laced-with lime and placed elec-
 trical wires on his tongue in order to extract a confession. Aguilera says he con-
 fessed to the murder after 24 hours because he could no longer stand the pain of
 torture. The case remains under investigation by the DIC. Authorities have not yet
 arrested any suspects.
 Prison conditions are consistently deplorable. Prisoners suffer from severe over-
 crowding, malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation. In the Central Peniten-
 tiary inTegucigalpa, there are 2,584 inmates, of whom only 517 have been convicted
 and are serving sentences. The rest are still awaiting trial, some for as long as 2
 years. More often than not, wardens house the mentally ill and those with tuber-
 culosis and other infectious diseases together in the same cells. A new, larger deten-
 tion faclity in Tamara lacked water and power and did not open in 1995. Prisoners
 with money routinely buy private cells, decent food, and conjugal visitation rights,
 while prisoners without money often lack the most basic necessities as well as legal
 assistance. The Government permits prison visits by international human rights or-
 ganizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law states that the police may arrest
 a person only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission
 of a crime, and that they must clearly inform the person of the grounds for the ar-
 rest. (By law the FUSEP cannot investigate; it only detains suspects.) Police must
 bring a detainee before a judge within 24 hours; the judge then must issue an initial
 temporary holding order within 24 hours, release an initial decision within 6 days,
 and conduct a preliminary investigation to decide whether there is sufficient evi-
 dence to warrant further investigation. However, in practice, the authorities do not
 routinely observe these requirements of the law. While bail is legally available, it
 is used primarily for ostensibly medical reasons. Poor defendants, even when rep-
 resented by a public defender, are seldom able to take advantage of bail.
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, a judge, the police, public officials,
 or any citizen may initiate criminal proceedings. Perhaps as many as 80 percent of
 the cases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal justice system but
 
 
 453
 instead are settled administratively by the police or by municipal courts, which are
 separate from the regular judicial court system.
 There were continued allegations that the FUSEP hired some former members of
 the DNI, and that these and other security force elements continued to practice ar-
 bitrary arrest and detention in a substantial number of cases. Local human rights
 monitoring organizations asserted, however, that this situation improved markedly
 after the issuance of a report bythe Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Re-
 form and the dissolution of the DNI.
 The Constitutionprohibits the expatriation of a Honduran citizen to another coun-
 try; exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tra.-Congress elects the nine Supreme Court justices
 and names the President of the Court. Their 4-year term coincides with those of the
 Congress and the President.
 There continued to be progress in using a career system to enhance qualifications
 of sitting judges and depoliticize the appointments process, and to break the
 subcultures o corruption, clientism, patronage, and influence peddling within the
 judiciary. However, elements within both major political parties continue to resist
 creation of a completely apolitical, independent judiciary. Members of the Congress
 and the private sector representing powerful economic and political interests contin-
 ued to put pressure on the President and Magistrates of the Supreme Court to post-
 pone action on reform initiatives presented to the Congress, thereby permitting poli-
 ticians to continue appointing judges and court functionaries purely on political cri-
 teria and without regard to professional and ethical qualifications. The judicial sys-
 tem and Public Ministry both suffer from extremely inadequate funding. The ability
 of the Public Ministry to investigate and prosecute human rights violations ade-
 quately while continuing to attack corruption in government depends heavily on the
 Congress' willingness to provide adequate funding.
 Traditionally, the Honduran Armed Forces insisted that only its own courts-mar-
 tial could try its members. However, in 1993 the Congress passed a resolution inter-
 preting the jurisdiction of the military court system to be subordinate to the civilian
 system in cases of civil-military jurisdictional dispute. Since then military authori-
 ties have remanded personnel accused of crimes against civilians to the civilian judi-
 cial system. Following much publicized investigations of past and present human
 rights violations by military personnel, in mid-1995 the Public Ministry placed for-
 mal accusations of attempted murder and illegal detention against 10 senior active
 and retired military officers in the civilian court system. A lawyer for three of the
 accused argued that they could not be prosecuted because they were covered by the
 three amnesties enactedbetwen 1987 and 1991 by the legislature. At year's end,
 an appeal was pending. Throughout the year, the military continued to respect civil-
 ian court juridcion over its members.
 An accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an ini-
 tial hearing by a judge, to bail, to an attorney provided by the state if necessary,
 and to appeal. The number of public defenders increased from 51 to 104, providing
 greater legal assistance to the poor. Despite their efforts, detention of criminal sus-
 pects pending trial averaged 18 months and constituted a serious human rights
 problem. In a number of cases, poor prisoners remain in jail even after acquital or
 completing their sentences, due to the failure by responsible officials to process re-
 lease papers.
 A major contributing factor to the problem of not providing due process in a time-
 ly manner is the antiquated criminal procedures system. A significant number of de-
 fendants serve the maximum possible sentence for the crime of which they are ac-
 cused before their trials even begin. In one case, a detainee who was recently re-
 leased spent 9 years in prison awaiting trial for stealing a tape recorder, a crime
 with a normal sentence of 6 years. Of the 7,949 detainees in the country's prison
 population, 7,135 (90 percent) have been neither sentenced nor exonerated.
 The passage of the 1994 Public Ministry Law and subsequent creation of the new
 ministry, with 196 public prosecutors assigned nationally (increased from 76 in
 1994), is intended to strengthen the citizenrys ability to seek redress from govern-
 ment abuses and to enjoy fair and public trials. The Public Ministry's independence
 from the other branches of government is also intended to reduce the opportunities
 for the politically and economically powerful to distort the investigative and prosecu-
 torial process with impunity. After little more than a year of being fully operational,
 the Public Ministry has taken decisive action by investigating and accusing not only
 military officers of human rights violations but also several high ranking former
 and current government officials of fraud, abuses of pwer, and diversion of public
 funds and resources crimes which seriously diminish the Government's ability to
 address fundamental economic issues affecting the human rights of the general pop-
 ulation.
 
 
 454
 Despite significant efforts by the Public Ministry and the DIC, at year's end the
 justice system still favored the rich and politically influential and remained weak,
 underfunded, marginally politicized, and generally inefficient. While the Supreme
 Court continued to make strides in both organization and investigation of corrupt
 court officials, the underfunded judiciary remained very vulnerable to influence and
 corruption.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons authorized
 by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the authorization of
 a competent authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or at
 any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission of crime. How-
 ever, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police and armed forces
 personnel iailed at times to obtain the needed authorization before entering a pri-
 vate home. Despite the new system of "duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to issue
 search orders, some judges still lack the discipline to make themselves available 24
 hours per day, 7 days a week. Coordination among the police, the court and the
 Public, Ministry continues to improve; however, interagency liaison problems still
 undermine the effectiveness of the system.
 Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specific
 purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. However, the armed
 forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national telephone company
 to monitor telephone lines of influential people in government, the military, and the
 private sector without authorization from the appropriate civilian judicial authority.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities largely respected these freedoms in practice. The
 media, while often openly critical of the Government and frequently willing to ex-
 pose  corruption, are   themselves  subject to high    levels of corruption   and
 politicization. Serious investigative journalism is still in its infancy. Some journal-
 ists request bribes to kill stories. There continued to be credible reports of intimida-
 tion by the authorities, instances of self-censorship, and payoffs to journalists.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for all forms of religious ex-
 pression, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enter and exit Honduras without arbitrary impediment, and
 the Government does not restrict travel within the country's borders. There were
 no known instances in which citizenship was revoked for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The Gov-
 ernment provides for granting asylum or refugee status in accordance with the
 standards of the 1951 United Nations Convention and its 1967 Protocol relating to
 the status of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government through democratic and
 peaceful means in the November 1993 elections. International observers found the
 elections to be free and fair. The national government is chosen by free, secret, di-
 rect, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, but the clergy and
 serving members of the armed forces are not permitted to vote. Any citizen born
 in Honduras or abroad of Honduran parentage may hold office except for members
 of the clergy and the armed forces. A new political party may gain legal status by
 obtaining 20,000 signatures and establishing party organizations in at least half the
 country's 18 departments.
 There are no legal impediments to women or minorities participating in govern-
 ment and politics, ut in practice, the proportion of women in political organizations
 and elective office is far lower than their overall representation in society. However,
 in the 1993 elections voters elected for the first time a woman, Guadalupe Jerezano,
 as one of the three vice presidents, and the losing opposition slate also had a female
 vice presidential candidate. Women hold a cabinet ministry and a Supreme Court
 position, as well as a number of vice ministerial positions. Of the 128 Deputies in
 
 
 455
 Congress, 14 are women and 5 are indigenous. There are few indigenous persons
 in leadership positions in government or politics, although the Honduran ambas-
 sador to the -United Nations is a member of-the Garifuna indigenous group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 On January 31, the Congress ratified a presidential decree amending the Con-
 stitution to give the National Commission for the Protection of Human Rights legal
 status, powers, and a separate budget. The local human rights group CODEH also
 received official recognition from President Reina, legalizing its status after 13 years
 of existence.
 Anonymous telephone callers threatened several individuals active in human
 rights endeavors. National Commissioner for Human Rights Dr. Leo Valladares re-
 ceived numerous telephone threats against himself and his family. CODEH presi-
 dent Dr. Ramon Custodio and Berta Oliva de Nativi coordinator for the Committee
 of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in londuras (COFADEH), also re-
 ceived numerous telephone threats. Judge Roy Medina has faced death threats since
 July, when he was assigned to the case of 10 active and retired military officers ac-
 cused of the detention and attempted murder of 6 students in 1982. Attorney Gen-
 eral Edmundo Orellana reported threats against himself and his family due to his
 investigations of several cases of persons disappeared in the 1980's.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination based on race and sex. Although it also bans
 discrimination on the basis of class, in fact, both the military and the political and
 social elite generally enjoy impunity before the legal system. Members of these
 groups are rarely arrestedor jailed. However, the Government made progress to-
 ward breaching this wall of impunity in 1995.
 On August 21 former Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar was charged and held
 without bail in the ongoing criminal investigation into the sale of Honduran diplo-
 matic and official passports. Although he was released on November 29 for lack of
 evidence, the Attorney General's office continues to investigate the case. Three other
 officials from the Foreign Ministry remain incarcerated, including Paz Aguilar's sis-
 ter Maria de Los Angeles Paz Aguilar. In November a judge convicted active duty
 police Colonel Juan Blas Salazar of cocaine trafficking and sentenced him to 21
 years in prison. Salazar has appealed.
 In 1994 the Congress passed a constitutional amendment to end compulsory mili-
 tary service, which entered into force in April. This measure was designed to end
 the common practice of forcible recruitment into the armed forces of middle and
 lower class Hondurans. Implementation of the voluntary service system has gone
 very slowly, with almost none of the recommendations necessary to attract recruits
 put into place. Troop levels have dropped sharply as the lack of implementation has
 given potential recruits no inducement to volunteer.
 The law does not prohibit homosexual behavior or activity. Gay nightclubs operate
 openly in three major cities. However, some sectors of society oppose homosexual ac-
 tivity. There were allegations that authorities do not adequately defend homo-
 sexuals from threat, harassment, or abuse and that some officials support, promote,
 or engage in these activities.
 Women.-Violence against women remains widespread, and serious weaknesses in
 the Penal Code severely impede efforts to combat it. The Honduran Women's Com-
 mittee for Peace-Visitacion Padilla has called for legislation to stren ten penalties
 for crimes against women. Congress continues to resist this legislation. The majority
 of such violence takes place within the family. The courts do not take action in do-
 mestic violence cases unless the victim is badly injured and incapacitated for more
 than 10 days. Except in the case of children age 12 or under, rape is considered a
 private crime. Rape victims over age 12 are therefore required to hire a private
 prosecutor, a luxury few can afford. The penalties for rape are relatively light, rang-
 ing from 3 to 9 years' imprisonment. There are no shelters specifically maintained
 for battered women. Although the law offers some redress, few women take advan-
 tage of the legal process, believing that judes would be unwilling to apply the law
 vigorously. Sexual harassment in the workplace is also a problem.
 Women are represented in at least small numbers in most of the professions, but
 cultural attitudes limit their career opportunities. In theory, women have equal ac-
 cess to educational opportunities, but family pressures often impede the ambitions
 
 
 456
 of women intent on obtaining higher education. The law requires employers to pay
 women, who make up 51 percent of the work force, equal wages for equal work, but
 employers often classify women's jobs as less demanding than those of men, as a
 justification for paying them lower salaries.
 Some organizations have begun to offer assistance to women, principally targeting
 those living in the rural sectors and marginal neighborhoods of cities. The Hon-
 duran Federation of Women's Associations, for example, provides home construction
 and improvement loans, offers free legal assistance to women, and lobbies the Gov-
 ernment on women's causes. The human rights group CIPRODEH continues an edu-
 cation program to make women aware of their rights under the law.
 Children.-Although the Government has committed itself to protecting children
 by allocating 30 percent of its 1995 budget to public education and health care, it
 is unable to prevent abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) and child workers (see
 Section 6.d.). In Tegucigalpa there are about 3,500 street children, of whom 2,000
 find shelter on any given day. Many of them have been sexually molested; at least
 10 percent are chronically addicted to glue sniffing. Over 75 percent of the street
 children find their way to the streets because of severe family problems; 9 percent
 are abandoned. Both the police and members of the general population engage in
 violence against street children. When the authorities arrest street children, they
 house many of them with adults who abuse them. Casa Alianza worked with the
 police to end the abuse of children who are arrested and incarcerated in adult pris-
 ons. As a result, a temporary center to house juvenile offenders was opened in Ta-
 mara July 6. However, detention of children with adults, vigilante violence, and po-
 lice abuse continue to be a problem due to a general lack of juvenile detention cen-
 ters.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no formal barriers to participation by dis-
 abled persons in employment, education, and health care, but neither is there spe-
 cific statutory or constitutional protection for them. There is no legislation that re-
 quires accessibility for disabled persons to government buildings or commercial es-
 tablishments.
 Indigenous People.-The small community of indigenous people have little or no
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, or the
 allocation of natural resources. All indigenous land rights are communal, and the
 law prohibits sale of such property either by individuals or the tribe. Tribal lands
 are often poorly defined in documents dating from the mid-19th century, and in
 most cases lack legal title based on modern cadastral measurements. The Honduran
 Forestry Development Corporation makes decisions regarding exploitation of timber
 resources on indigenous lands, often over strenuous tribal objection. Nonindigenous
 farmers and cattle ranchers regularly usurp indigenous lands.
 The courts commonly deny legal recourse to indigenous groups and show bias in
 favor of the nonindigenous parties, who are often people of means and influence.
 Failure to obtain legal redress frequently caused indigenous gups to attempt to
 regain land through invasions and other tactics, which usually provoked the au-
 thorities to retaliate forcefully. On July 7, the first anniversary of a 1994 pilgrim-
 age, some 5,000 Indians of various tribes again marched to Tegucigalpa to remind
 the Government of the promises it made in the past year and demand that their
 rights be respected. After negotiations with a special commission set up by Presi-
 dent Reina, indigenous leaders left Tegucigalpa pleased with the agreements that
 were reached specifying the projects that the Government pledged to implement in
 favor of Honduras' ethnic communities. They vowed to return to Tegucigalpa if the
 Government does not fulfill these agreements.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions, and with the exception of some "parallel" unions formed by the Government,
 the unions are independent of government and political parties. Although only about
 18 percent of the work force is organized, trade unions exert some economic and po-
 litical influence. In the past year this influence has somewhat diminished. Unions
 frequently participate in public rallies against government policies and make exten-
 sive use of the media to advance their views. There are also three large peasant
 associations directly affiliated with the trade unions. The Constitution provides for
 the right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic labor rights, which the
 authorities honor in practice. The Civil Service Code, however, stipulates that public
 workers do not have the right to strike. (This does not include those working in
 state-owned enterprises.) There were legal and illegal strikes during the year by
 workers in foreign-owned maquiladora (in-bond processing) plants, or "maquilas,"
 exporting textiles and garments to the United States.

 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity" associations, which are es-
 sentially aimed at providing credit and other services to workers and management
 who are members of the association. Organized labor, including the American Fed-
 eration of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations and the international Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions, strongly opposes these associations on the grounds
 that they do not permit strikes, have inadequate grievance procedures, and neutral-
 ize genuine and representative trade unions.
 The trade union movement maintains close ties with various international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects workers'
 rights to organize andto bargain collectively; collective bargaining agreements are
 the norm for companies in which workers are organized. However, although the
 Labor Code prohibits retribution by employers for trade union activity, it is a com-
 mon occurrence. Employers threaten to close down unionized companies, harass
 their workers and in some cases fire them for trying to form a trade union. Employ-
 ers actually ismiss relatively few workers for union activity once a union is recog-
 nized; these cases, however, serve to discourage other workers from attempting to
 organize. Workers in both unionized and nonumonized companies are under the pro-
 tection of the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the Min-
 istry of Labor. Labor or civil courts can require employers to rehire employees fired
 for union activity, but such rulings are uncommon. Generally, however, agreements
 between management and unions contain a clause prohibiting retaliation against
 any worker who participated in a strike or union activity.
 The same labor regulations apply in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest
 of private industry. Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free
 trade zone (7 of the 11 maquiladora companies there are unionized), but factory
 owners have resisted efforts to organize the new privately owned industrial parks.
 The Maquiladora Association has sponsored several meetings between its member-
 ship and major labor groups. As a result of these meetings, tensions declined and
 several maquilas unionized peacefully in the privately owned EPZ's. The attitude of
 the Government towards organized labor in the EPZ's is the same as for other in-
 dustries.
 In a number of U.S.-owned maquilas, workers have shown little enthusiasm for
 unionizing since they believe their treatment, salary, and working conditions are as
 good as or better than those in unionized plants. In the absence of a union and col-
 lective bargaining, several of the EPZ plants have instituted solidarity associations
 which to some extent exist as company unions for the purpose of setting wages and
 negotiating working conditions. Others use the minimum wage to set starting sala-
 ries and a ]ust the wage scale by negotiating with common groups of workers and
 individuals depending on skill, years of employment, and other related criteria.
 Talks between unions and EPZ plants continue.
 In February the dismissal of 48 maquila workers by an EPZ firm caused one labor
 organization to block the entrances of the Inhdelva Industrial Park, preventing
 some 6,000 workers in the park's 13 maquiladoras from entering. A few days later,
 workers at another EPZ firm were forced to stand on the sidelines while competing
 unions fought over which organization legally representd the company's employees.
 In July workers at the Galxy Industrial Park blocked the entrances, preventing
 workers from entering.
 Labor leaders blame the Government for permitting management to act contrary
 to the Labor Code, and say that this prob em will continue until the Ministry of
 Labor is reorganized to make it more efficient. They criticize the Ministry for not
 enforcing the Labor Code, for taking too long to make decisions, and for being timid
 and indifferent to workers' needs.
 The Labor Code clearly prohibits blacklisting; nevertheless, there was credible evi-
 dence that informal blacklisting occurred in the privately owned industrial parks.
 When unions are formed, organizers must submit a list of initial members to the
 Ministry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. Before offi-
 cial recognition is granted, however, the Ministry must inform the company of the
 impending union organization. Ministry officials have consistently been unable to
 provide effective protection to workers. There are credible reports that, particularly
 in the EPZ sector, some inspectors have gone so far as to sell companies the names
 of employees involved in forming a union, which some companies used to dismiss
 union organizers before recognition was granted. There is also credible evidence that
 military intelligence maintains files on union activists.
 The International Labor Organization plans to fund programs such as reform of
 the Labor Code.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the law pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor. Although there were no official reports of such
 
 
 458
 practices, there were credible allegations of forced overtime in EPZ plants, particu-
 larly for women.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit the employment of minors under the age of 16, except for children
 between the ages of 14 to 16 who have the permission of their parents and the Min-
 istry of Labor. The legal age for working without parental consent is 16. An em-
 ployer who legally hires a child under the age of 16 must certify that the young per-
 son has finished or is finishing his or her compulsory schooling. The Ministry of
 Labor grants a number of work permits to 14- and 15-year-oids each year. It is com-
 mon for 12- and 13-year-olds to obtain these documents or to purchase forged per-
 mits which use the Labor Ministry's letterhead.
 The Ministry of Labor does not effectively enforre child labor laws, and violations
 of the Labor Cod occur frequently in rural areas and in small companies. Many
 children work on small family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops to
 supplement the family income. According to the Ministry of Labor, human rights
 groups, and organizations for the protection of children, the most significant child
 labor problem is in the construction industry. Employment of children younger than
 the legal working age in maquilas probably occurs, but does not appear to happen
 on a large scale.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In December 1994, the Government decreed in-
 creases ranging from 15 to 33 percent in the minimum wage, the first since June
 1993. Daily pay rates vary by the sector of the economy affected and geographical
 zones: the lowest minimum wage is $1.60 (14.95 lempiras) per day in the ariculre
 sector. The highest minimum wage is in the mining sector at $2.79 (26 lempiras)
 daily. Urban workers earn slighty more than those in the countryside. The Con-
 stitution and the Labor Code stipulate that all labor be fairly paid, but the Ministry
 of Labor lacks the staff and other resources for effective enforcement. Even after the
 third consecutive annual increase, the minimum wage is considered insufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and ifmily.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek. There is a
 requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days. The Labor Code pro-
 vids for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after 4 years.
 However, employers frequently ignore these regulations due to the high level of un-
 employment and underemployment, and the lack of effective enforcement by the
 Ministry of Labor.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws,
 but does not do so effectively. There is no provision for a worker to remove imself
 from a dangerous work situation without jeopardy to continued employment. Reli-
 able reports indicate that there are still as many as 50 deaths per year resulting
 from serious health and safety hazards facing Miskito Indian scuba divers employed
 in lobster and conch harvesting off the Caribbean coast. Some complaints, although
 fewer than in previous years, allege the failure of foreign factory managers to com-
 ply with occupational health and safety aspects of Labor Code regulations in fac-
 tories located in free zones and industrial parks.
