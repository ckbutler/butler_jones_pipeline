 IRAQ
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive one-party apparatus under
 the domination of Saddam Hussein. The provisional constitution of 1968 stipulates
 that the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs Iraq, with executive and legis-
 lative authority exercised by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). Saddam
 Hussein wields decisive power as Chairman of the RCC, Secretary General of the
 Regional Command of the ABSP, and President of the Republic.
 In addition to both Shi'a and Sunni Muslim Arabs, the population includes Kurds,
 Turcomans, Assyrian Christians, and Jews. Sunni Arabs, comprising some 12 per-
 cent of the population, have traditionally dominated Iraq society. Ethnic and geo-
 graphic divisions have resulted in civil uprisings, particularly among the people of
 the north and south, whom the Government has repressed severely.
 The Government's security apparatus, including militias attached to the Presi-
 dent, the ABSP, and the Interior Ministry, has been responsible for widespread and
 systematic human rights abuses; security forces continue to play a central role in
 maintaining the intimidation and fear on which government power rests.
 The Government controls Iraq's oil-based economy and owns all the major indus-
 tries. Damaed by the Gulf war and under U.N. sanctions as a result of Iraq's 1990
 invasion of Kuwait, the economy remains hobbled. With limited exceptions, the
 sanctions ban all Iraqi exports and all imports except food, medicine, and essential
 humanitarian supplies. Iraq's failure to comply with United Nations Security Coun-
 cil Resolution (UNSCR) 687 has led to repeated Security Council extensions of the
 sanctions.
 The Iraqi regime's abysmna record on human rights continued without improve-
 ment in 1992. Systematic violations of human rights in virtually all categories con-
 tinued. There wer mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of tor-
 ture, extreme repression of ethnic groups, disappearances, denial of due process, and
 arbitrary detention. Freedom of expression and association do not exist, and citizens
 do not have the right to change their government. Particularly flagrant abuses com-
 mitted in 1992 involved military operations against noncombatant Shi'a civilians in
 southern Iraq in which hundreds and probably thousands of innocents, including
 children, were killed. In both the north and parts of the south, the regime has im-
 posed complete internal embargoes that cover such basic necessities as food, medi-
 cine, and fuel. In flagrant disregard of United Nations Security Council Resolution
 (UNSCR) 688's injunction against interfering with the international community's
 provision of humanitarian assistance, suspected government agents planted bombs
 on trucks carrying humanitarian relief supplies from Turkey to northern Iraq.

 RESPWr FOR HUMAN RIGHFS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrvjudicial Killing.-The Iraqi regime, which has long en-
 gaged in political killing on a large scale, continued that practice in 1992. During
 esring and summer Iraqi armed forces launched numerous attacks against the
 civilian population in te southern marshes, which are inhabited largeLy-by Arabs
 of the   ia sect as well as significant numbers of Iraqi army deserters. Helicopter
 gunships and fixed-wing ahiraft participated in some of these attacks, and there
 were unconfirmed reports of the use of napalm and chemical weapons. Even after
 the imposition of a no-fly zone over southern Iraq in August, government forces used
 land-based artillery to continue to shell marsh villages. Some of these attacks ap-
 peared to be specifically focused on civilian targets. (An armed opposition movement
 in the southern marshes draws on both the Shi'a tribes and the army deserters for
 membership). Indeed the current Prime Minister, in a meeting with army generals
 during the operation, was recorded on videotape instructing them to "wipe out"
 three lhi'a Marsh Arab tribes. The estimate of the number of casualties from these
 attacks range in the thousands. Credible accounts implicate Iraqi armed forces in
 the draining of some marsh areas in order to afford military units better access to
 targets. .
 There Were also reports that Shia civilians were arrested, removed from the area,
 and executed. For example, a human rights group reported that, in the first week
 of August, 2,500 men, women, and children were rounded up from the al-Kebaish
 marsh and taken to an army camp called Manareh where they allegedly were held
 in sheds guarded by Military Intelligence and Special Security Agency units. An es-
 capee from the camp said tat about 100 of the detainees were taken out and shot
 every night.
 As of the end of the year, Operation Provide Comfort the Joint US., British,
 French, and Turkish command, had at least temporarily ibited attacks on the in-
 habitants of northern Iraq, although reports persisted of intermittent, sometimes
 heavy shelling of northern villages y on -range artillery.
 The Iraqi regime has a well-established record of executing perceived opponents.
 In August authorities in Baghdad executed by hang   42 merchants-mostly Iraqi
 Sunnis--ostensibly for exploitative trade practices.  ore being executed  they were
 forced to submit to public ridicule and abuse, a punishment that appeared to be part
 of a campaign to create scapegoats for Iraq's economic woes. There were reports that
 15 raqis of Troman extraction were executed on September 23 on orders from De-
 fense Minister All Hassan al-Majid in rspnse to the convening of the Iraqi Opposi-
 tion Conference in Salahuddn. There were also credible reports in the spring that
 the al-Radwaniya prison near Baghdad was the site of mass executions. According
 to these reports, 100 or mere executions, thought to be of political prisoners, were
 being carried out each day.
 In December the Iraqi regime was implicated in the murder of a nuclear scientist
 on the streets of Amman. The scientist was reported to be trying to immigrate to
 a third country when he was murdered. In addition to the abuses    rpetrated by
 the Government, there were credible reports that the Iraqi Kurdish Front killed
 some prisoners taken during its military operations against the Turkish Kurdish
 Workers Party (PKK).
 b. Disappearance.-As in previous years, there were numerous credible reports,
 including from the U.N. Special Rapporteur, that large numbers of people "dis-
 appeared" while in the custody of Iraqi authorities.
 In February the Special Rapporteur reported 18,000 alleged cases of disappear-
 ance, of which 12,000 were sufficiently detailed to be taken up by the U.N. Working
 Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. To date few of these cases have
 been resolved.
 In September a London-based human rights organization released a list of 19
 Ira i Army officers who were arrested in June and July. Their whereabouts and
 conitions of detention and4the charges against them remain unknown. The same
 group also released the names of 10 people who were said to have returned from
 refuge in Turkey, Syria, and Iran in March and June in response to an announced
 amnesty for military deserters, only to disappear into the state security system.
 Iraq has failed to return or account for a large number of Kuwaiti citizens taken
 to Iraqduring Iraq's ocupation of Kuwait, although it is obligated to do so under
 UNSCR 687. The Kuwait Government's list of missing citizens believed to be held
 in Iraq! stood at 850 in late 1992. Despite the mediation efforts of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the fate of these persons is unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Though forbidden by the Iraqi Constitution, torture is routinely practiced by the se-
 
 
 1008
 curity services. Techniques employed by these services reportedly include electric
 shocks administered to the genitals and other sensitive areas, beatings, burnings
 with hot irons, suspension from ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, threat-
 ening rape of relatives, breaking of limbs, and denial of food and water. Mutilation,
 including castration and removal of eyes, has also been documented. The highly cen-
 tralized authority structure of the Iraqi regime indicates that torture, along with
 other egregious human rights abuses, is an essential component of domestic control,
 formulated at the highest level of the regime.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur reported on allegations of systematic rape sanc-
 tioned by Iraqi authorities. He found that young women are sometimes raped in
 order to blackmail them into becoming informants. Credible reports indicate that
 others are raped as a form of degradation.
 Knowledgeable sources report that al-Rashidiya prison on the Tigris River north
 of Taji, contains torture'chambers in its basement. Another prison, al-Shamma'iya,
 located in the East Baghdad quarter of that name, is known as the site of both tor-
 ture and disappearances. Al-Radwaniya prison (see Section L.a.) is also the reputed
 site of torture and arbitrary killings.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution and legal code
 prohibit it, arbitrary arrest and detention, as the Special Rapporteur noted in his
 February 1992 report, "are routinely practiced in Iraq and remain a major contrib-
 uting factor to the general climate of fear. In the context of other violations, such
 as torture, enforced disappearance, and summary or arbitrary execution, victims are
 almost always arbitrarily arrested and detained. In fact, arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion is often the precursor to much greater violations."
 The case of Grand Ayatollah Abdul Qasim al-Khoei is indicative of the Govern-
 ment's practice. In March 1991, authorities arrested the 93-year-old Khoei (one of
 hundreds of Shi'a clerics arrested in a drive against persons suspected of taking
 part in opposition activities) and took him to Baghdad where they compelled him
 to make proregime statements. While under arrest, he was occasionally subjected
 to the humiliation of government-supervised visits by foreign visitors, during which
 he was obliged to express support for the regime. When Khoei became seriously ill,
 the Government delayed nearly 2 weeks before bowing to international pressure and
 allowing an international medical team to treat him. Khoei died in July, while
 under house arrest in Najaf. Authorities forbade both a public burial and the
 mourning ceremony traditionally accorded Shi'a religious leaders. The whereaouts
 of 105 o7his associates (family members, supporters, families of the supporters) who
 were originally taken into custody with him are unknown, except in the case of one
 man, a Pakistani national, who was released.
 A human rights group has furnished the- names and occupations of 146 Iraqi
 Turcomans from the Kirkuk area, who are said to have been detained since May
 and June of 1992. (See Section L.a. regarding execution of 15 members of this
 group.)
 There were credible reports that the Iraqi Kurdish Front denied the ICRC access
 to PKK prisoners and that some PKK prisoners were turned over to Turkish mili-
 tary officials.
 While there is currently no known policy of exiling Iraqi citizens abroad, the re-
 fusal of Iraqi authorities to allow tens of thousands of Kurds and Turcomans to re-
 turn to their homes in Kirkuk amounts to a policy of internal exile (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tial.-Although the Revolutionary Court system was
 abolished by RCC Decree in 1991, the change was cosmetic. Iraq retains a bifur-
 cated judicial system, involving a distinct legal system for all cases deemed to have
 a security component and a more conventional court system to handle other charges.
 The procedural rules applicable in the regular (i.e., nonsecurity) court system em-
 body many internationally accepted legal norms. They provide for investigation by
 police and then by an inquiry judge, who may refer a case to the courts or dismiss
 it. Trials are open to public view, and defendants are entitled to counsel-at govern-
 ment expense if the defendant is indigent. Charges and evidence are available for
 review by counsel. Judges try criminal cases; there are no juries. Convictions may
 be appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to the Court of Cassation, Iraq's high
 court.
 There are no Shari'a (Islamic) courts as such in Iraq; however, family courts ad-
 minister Shari'a law according to Iraqi custom. Special security courts deal with a
 variety of charges, including espionage and treason, peaceful political dissent, smug-
 gling, currency exchange violations, and drug trafficking. The security courts' ap-
 proach to these cases, like that of the nominally defunct Revolutionary Courts, is
 to subsume the rights of the defense to the political interests of the regime. Defend-
 ants can be held incommunicado, and confessions extracted by torture are admissi-
 
 
 1009
 
 ble and often serve as the basis for conviction. In theory, appeals may be taken to
 the Chairman of the RCC, but there are also reports of executions shortly after trial.
 The yrohibition against political dissent encompasses an extremely wide range of
 activities in Iraq, and thousands have been imprisoned without charge or triil or
 after trials which do not meet international standards of fairness. Since public ac-
 knowledgement of arrest or imprisonment is rare, it is difficult to estimate the num-
 ber of political yrisoners in IraFH.
 f. Arbitrary  nterference    Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government frequently disregards constitutional protections of the rpht to privacy,
 particularly in situations where national security is deemed to be involved. Iraqi
 military and security forces often disregard constitutional guarantees of the invio-
 lability of the home in their operations--particularly in southern Ira . Iraq's tradi-
 tionally broad dehnition of security offenses was extended to exempt Iraqi authori-
 ties in virtually all circumstances from the legal requirement to obtain a search
 warrant before entering a suspect's home. Despite constitutional safeguards for the
 confidentiality of mail and telegraphic and telephone correspondence, official tele-
 phone monitoring and censorship of private mail are common practice.
 Pervasive networks of informers maintained by the security services and the
 ABSP serve to deter dissident activity and instill fear of the regime.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press--Freedm of speech and of the press do not exist
 in Iraq; political dissent is not tolerated. The Government and the ABSP own all
 print and broadcast media and operate them as propaganda outlets for the regime.
 Upposition views are not reported, and the Government periodically attempts to jam
 news broadcasts from outside Iraq (e.g., the Voice of America, the British Broadcast-
 ing Corporation, and radio stations maintained by Iraqi opposition groups in neigh-
 boring countries). During the second half of 1991, senior regime officials gave re-
 peated assurances that new laws expanding press freedom would be promulgated,
 but no action was taken.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Iraqi citizens may not legally
 assemble or organize for any political purpose other than to support the regime.
 Further, two organizations, the Communist Party and al-Dawa al-Islamiya ('Call
 of Islam") are outlawed, membership in either is a capital offense. Though Iraqi au-
 thorities insist that the penalty has never been invoked in such cases, the Special
 Rapperteur has received the particulars, including photographs, of over 50 persons
 allegedly executed for membership in these groups.
 c. Freedom of Rel'ion.-While the ABSP has traditionally sought to submerge re-
 ligious differences through the proimotion of secular nationalism, affiliation with a
 religious community remains important for most Iraqis. The Government closely
 regulates Islamic affairs under a 1981 law giving the Ministry of Endowments and
 Reigious Affairs authority over places of worship, appointment of clergy, publication
 of religious literature, and participation in religious councils and meetings.
 Despite legal guarantees of sectarian equality, the Government's calculated drive
 against the Sh'a of the south betrays a deep prejudice against Shi'ism. The regime
 reflected a similar animus in 1991 when, in its brutal response to the spring upris-
 ing, it destroyed Shi'a mosques, holy sites, libraries, and archives. The re~me has
 targeted Shi'a clergy for arbitrary arrest and other human rights abuses. Moreover
 it appears to seek to influence, through coercion, the selection of the next Grand
 Ayatollah to replace the late Abul Qasim Ihoei (see Section 1.d.)
 Since te uprising, the Iraqi armed forces have controlled the most important
 Shi'a holy cities of Karbala and al-Najaf. A human rights group reports that "reli-
 gious life is sharply restricted' in the two cities.
 The Government has been less intrusive into the religious affairs of Iraq's Chris-
 tians--a small community of around 300,000. Their freedom of worship in churches
 of established denominations is legally protected, but they may not proselytize or
 hold meetings outside church premises. However, most Christians live in the North,
 and have suffered from the.,regime's military campaigns in that region and from
 Baghdad's current internal blockade of the area.
 The Jewish community has decreased from 150,000 following World War II to an
 estimated 150, all in Baghdad. There is no recent evidence o overt persecution of
 Jews, but the regime restricts travel (particularly to Israel) and contacts with Jew-
 ish groups abroad.
 There are no penalties under Iraqi law for conversion from one religion to an-
 other although there is a social stigma for Muslims who convert.
 d. Preedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Within the country, sensitive border areas and numerous designated se-
 curity zones are off-limits to all travelers. There are police checkpoints on highways
 
 
 1010
 and outside major towns. Inspection teams of the International Atomic Energy
 Agency and the U.N. Special Commission (charged with overseeing the elimination
 ofraqi weapns of mass destruction programs and the dismantling of current
 stocks of such weapons) are authorized to travel to any site in Iraq witout impedi-
 ment, as stipulated by U.N. Security Council Resolutions 699 and 707. Nevertheless,
 Iraqi authorities have repeatedly and materially impeded the movement of inter-
 national inspectors. While UNSCR 688 called for access for U.N. relief workers to
 all ports of Iraq, the regime has denied such access to many areas, such as the
 southern marshes.
 A travel restriction imposed in 1992 limited all citizens to two trips outside of Iraq
 annually. The traditional requirement that a married woman have the approval of
 her husband to travel abroad remains in effect. There is no legal ban on emigration
 or special restrictions for members of minority groups, although emigrants often
 must leave behind substantial property because of the difficulty of exporting assets.
 Currency exchange violations are considered security offenses, and penalties can be
 severe.
 There is considerable evidence that the regime was attempting to pursue the dis-
 criminatory resettlement policies of recent years in which mass forced relocations
 and government demolition of villages denied hundreds of thousands of Kurdish, As-
 syrian, and Turcoman residents ofrnorthern Iraq the right to choose their places of
 residence. Roth the campaign against the Kurds and the recent drive in th~e south-
 ern marshlands seemed to have as prime goals the removal of certain people from
 their remote ancestral homelands to urban areas where the regime might more eas-
 ily control them. According to persistent reports, the Government offers pecuniary
 induements to Arab famigoes from central Iraq to resettle in the north.
 As a result of those policies and, even more, of the regime's widespread bloody
 suppression of the uprising in the spring of 1991, some 1.5 million Iraqis (roughly
 10 percent of the population) fled the country. Most went to Iran, Turkey, Saudi
 Arabia, or Kuwait, while others sought refuge in Jordan or Syria. However, the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that fewer than 100,000 of those refu-
 gees remain abroad. The great majority of them, particularly the Kurds, repatriated
 themselves to the area of northern Iraq which includes the area in which the allies
 have proscribed overflights by Iraqi aircraft and to those arena not under control
 of the Iraqi government. Of those who remain abroad, the distribution is apprxi-
 mately as follows: Iran--45,000, Saudi Arabia-22,000, and Turkey 8,000.
 A 1987 RCC decree requiring Iraqi students abroad who refused to return to Iraq
 to reimburse the Government or all education received at government expense (in
 Iraq or abroad) remained in effect. The decree is applicable retroactively to students
 who have refused to return since May 16, 1983, when the Government began requir-
 ing employees leaving government jobs before 20 years of service to reimburse the
 State for the cost of their education. Amounts due can be recovered by confiscation,
 and nonpayment may result in imprisonment of family members. Each student
 must provide a guarantor before traveling abroad. The guarantor and the student's
 parents ma be held liable if the student als to return.
 Non-Ira qi spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for 5 years must take
 Iraqi nationaity or leave raq. Many people have thus been obligedto accept Iraqi
 citizenship and becme subject to official travel restrictions. In March 1984, an
 order 'by the RCC reduced the residency period before naturalization to 1 year for
 the spouses of Iraqi citizens employed in government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces
 penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a substantial financial penalty,
 and repayment of the costs of education. Iraq does not recognize the concept of dual
 nationality, and many Iraqi "dual nationals, especially the children of an Iraqi fa-
 ther and a mother of non-Iraqi birth, have been denied permission to leave Iraq to
 visit the country of their other nationality. Some, including US. citizens, were forc-
 ibly conscripted into the Iraqi armed forces.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right fi Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iraqi citizens do not have the right to change their government. Full political par-
 ticipation is cenfined to members of the ABSP, estimatd to number 1  million, or
 about 8 percent of the population. The ABSP governs the country under the provi-
 sional Constitution of 1968, with legislative and executive authority vested in the
 RCC. The National Assembly is completely subordinate to the executive branch, as
 was the legislative assembly that existed in the Kurdish Autonomous Region before
 the war. General elections were last held for the 250-seat National Assembly in
 April 1989.
 Saddam Hussein continues to wield decisive power over all instruments of govern-
 ment as President of the Republic, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary General
 
 
 1011
 of the Regional (i.e., Iraq-wide) Command of the ABSP. A personal relationship with
 Saddam Hussein is much more important for political advancement than is ABSP
 membership or ideological affiliation. Almost all of Iraq's most powerful officials are
 either members of the President's family or long-time family allies from his home
 town of Tikrit.
 Alon5 with the ABSP, two small progovernment Kurdish parties constitute the
 Patriotic and Progressive National Front (PNF), essentially a vehicle of support for
 the Government. -The Communist Party (CP) was removed from the PNF and de-
 clared illegal in 1979. Membership in the CP is now punishable by death (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.). ABSP membership is not required for appointment to senior military or
 government positions or election to the National Assembly but is essential to attain
 political influence. Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely sup-
 pressed.
 In 1991 the RCC adopted a law which theoretically authorized the creation of po-
 litical parties other than the ABSP. In fact, it merely reinforced the preeminent po-
 sition of the ABSP by prohibiting parties based on any organizing principle ter
 than complete support for Saddam Hussein and the present Government. New par-
 ties must be based in Baghdad and are forbidden to have any ethnic or religious
 character. That stipulation effectively bars natural opposition constituencies like the
 Shi'a of southern raq or the Kurdish, Assyrian, and Turcman communities in the
 north from forming legal political organizations.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The one authorized human rights group in Iraq operates under official control and
 routinely corroborates official denials of any violations. In 1992 Middle East Watch
 and Amnesty International reported similar experiences with the Iraqi Government.
 Baghdad spoke in general terms of receiving human rights inspectors from each or-
 ganization, but when the groups set forth their requirements (e.g., freedom to travel
 throughout the country, broad access to officials and documents, permission for pri-
 vate interviews with and medical examinations of detainees), the invitations were
 never extended.
 The Government allowed the U.N. Special Rapporteur to visit in early 1992 but
 did not grant his request for permission to conduct on-site research in areas where
 human rights abuses were reported. Because of the chronic nature of the abuses and
 because of the Government's manifest unwillingness to investigate or cooperate in
 investigations, the U.. Special Rapporteur has recommended hat on-site monitor-
 ing teams be sent to Iraq. U.N. bodies have yet to ado pt this proposa.
 Iraq has failed to comply with the provision of UNSCR 688 that requires it to af-
 ford unrestricted access to humanitarian workers. Through most of 1992, the Gov-
 ernment threatened, harassed, and assaulted employees of the United Nations and
 nongovernmental organizations. Their equipment was damaged or destroyed by re-
 gime personnel. Other workers were denied entry. The regime also refused to issue
 visas for new U.N. guards-who protect U.N. personnel and operations--to replace
 ards who had finished their tours. By blocking the guards replacements, while
 intimidating those who remained, the Government succeeded early in 1992 in reduc-
 ing the guard contingent from 500 to just over 100.
 I November the regime agreed to a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
 with the United Nations on U . operations in Iraq. The MOU increases the num-
 ber of guards but confines them to the north. Nonetheless the Government contin-
 ued to fail to comply with UNSCR 688's injunction against interfering with the
 international community's provision of humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.
 Agents of the regime are believed to have planted bombs which exploded on trucks
 brmging relief supplies from Turkey to northern Iraq. The Government continued
 to refuse to avail itself of the provisions of UNSCR 706/712 which allow Iraq to sell
 oil and purchase humanitarian goods, the equitable distribution of which the UN
 would monitor.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The striking cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity of Iraqi society is not re-
 flected in the country's political and economic structure. Sunni Arabs, who con-
 stitute only about 12 percent of the country's population, have effectively controlled
 Iraq since independence in 1932. Shi'a Arabs, who make up nearly 60 percent of
 the population and live mainly in the Baghdad area and the south, have long been
 economically, politically, and socially disadvantaged. Like the Kurds of the north,
 the Shi'a of the south have, as a people, been targeted for particular abuse, includ-
 ing large-scale forced resettlement and closure and destruction of parochial schools,
 mosques, shrines, and libraries. (See Section L.a.)
 
 
 1012
 Iraq's Kurd, who make up 17 percent of the population, historically have suffered
 political and economic discrmination, despite the token presence of a small number
 in the Government. Kurds serve in the Iraqi military, -including the officer corps,
 but are excluded frm senior command positions.
 An example of discrimination against the Kurd and the Shi'a is the maldistribu-
 tion of basic supplies imposed by the regime on both .peoples since the Gulf war.
 The regime's total blockade of the north includes humaitarian necessities like food,
 medicine, and fuel At the beginning of the embargo in October 1991, the Govern-
 ment withdrew all its employees from the area, adding to the chaotic situation there
 which affects all the people of the north, including Turcomans, Chaldeans, Assyr-
 ians, and Kurds. The embargo in the north caused serious hardship there in the
 winter of 1991-1992 and was expected to do so again in 1992-1993. The embargo
 of the south also causes real distress, particularly as regards the nutritional and
 medical needs of the populace. While all water treatment facilities in the Baghdad
 areas are operational, those in the south have been neglected.
 The small but significant Iraqi Christian community has traditionally suffered lit-
 tle overt religious discrimination. Some churches were targeted by Iraqi forces dur-
 ing the uprising in 1991, however, and a number of Christians who fled to Turkey
 in the aftermath of the fighting cited both oppression by Iraqi authorities and dis-
 crimination by the Kurdish majority in the north as factors in their decision to re-
 main in Turkish refugee camps rather than return to Iraq. Moreover, as noted
 above, the Christians of the north have had to endure both military campaigns and
 Baghdad's internal blockade of the region.
 The use of minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish is an official language
 used by the media an schools in predominantly Kurdish areas, although the official
 curriculum disregards Kurdish history and culture. Turcomans publish in their dia-
 lect of Turkish, and Assyrian Christians often use Aramaic as well as Arabic. Citi-
 zens considered to be of Iranian origin carry special identification. They are often
 precluded from desirable employment.
 The ABSP is formally committed to equality for women, who comprise about 20
 percent of the Iraqi work force. Laws have been enacted to protect women from ex-
 ploitation in the workplace and from sexual harassment; to permit women to join
 the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; to require education for female
 children; and to equalize women a rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation, suf-
 frage, and election to the National Assembly.
 Violence against women, such as wife beating and rape is known to occur, but
 little is known about its extent. Such abuse is customarily addressed within the
 tightly knit Iraqi family structure. There is no public discussion of the subject. and
 there are no official statistics. Excessive violence against women would be grounds
 for divorce and criminal charges, but suits brought on these charges in Iraq are be-
 lieved to be rare.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions independent of government control do
 not exist in Iraq. The trade union organization law of June 2, 1987, prescribes a
 monolithic trade union structure for organized labor. Workers in private and mixed
 enterprises and in cooperativc-but not public employees or workers in state enter-
 prises-have the .rit to join a local unon committee. The ommittees are linked
 to trade unions, which in turn are part of provincial trade union federations. At the
 top is a s le umbrella organization, the Iraqi General Federation of Trade Unions
 which is hined to the Ba'ath Party and is utiized to promote party princilea and
 policies among union members. The General Federation is affiliated with the Inter-
 national Conederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Communist-deminated World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 Although workers are legally supposd to have the right to strike after providing
 notice to the Labor Minis, no laor strike has been reported over the past two
 decades. The Committee of Experts (COE) of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) commented in March on the Iraqi authorities' use of penal sanctions against
 workers who participate in strikes and noted that the only right to strike that seems
 specifically allowed relates to worker actions against private sector employers who
 refuse to abide by final decisions issued by the Court of Cassation to resolve labor
 disputes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is not recognized. Salaries for public sector workers (i.e., the bulk of the em-
 ployed) are set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private sector are
 set by employers or negotiated individually with workers.
 The Labr Code does not protect workers from antiunion discrimination, a failure
 that has been repeatedly criticized by the COE.
 
 
 1013
 There are no export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, ILO committees have noted that Iraq's Penal Code allows punish-
 ment of civil servants and employees of state enterprises with imprisonment, includ-
 ing compulsory prison labor, for breaches of labor discipline, including resignation
 from the job. Acording to ILO commitee reports, foreign workers in Iraq have been
 prevented from terminating their employment to return home because of the legal
 provisions imposing penal sanctions on persons who do so.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under age
