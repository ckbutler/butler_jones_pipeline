 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a longstanding multiparty parliamentary democracy
 operating within a federal system of government. The next
 federal elections must be held before March 1988.
 Australia's developed industrial economy, with important
 mining and agricultural sectors, provides most Australians
 with a high per capita income. Furthermore, the Government
 provides assistance for the minority of relatively
 disadvantaged citizens. Individuals are free to hold private
 property, to pursue their economic interests, and to organize
 trade unions.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. The Government makes a major effort to
 investigate reports of discrimination. Protection of the
 rights of Australia's approximately 180,000 aboriginals is a
 demonstrated concern of the Government, which recognizes that
 they are the group in Australia most disadvantaged
 economically and by societal discrimination, currently and
 historically. Aboriginal land rights remain an issue of
 controversy in Australia but the present federal Government is
 committed to some form of national legislation on the issue.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is respected.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. Australia has
 ratified and fully respects International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 105 concerning forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to both a fair hearing and
 a fair public trial with an unimpeded right of counsel. Free
 counsel is provided to indigents accused of crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Australia is a

 nation of liberal political traditions and common law, and the
 Government does not interfere in the private lives of
 individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A functioning democratic political system, an effective
 judiciary, and an independent press combine to insure freedom
 of speech and the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed in Australia. Australian
 law and practice afford workers great freedom to establish and
 to join trade unions, to choose their union representatives,
 to formulate union programs, and to be represented in
 negotiating the prevention and settlement of disputes with
 employers. Unions are extremely active and powerful.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion. There is no
 established church, and Australians are free to maintain links
 with coreligionists abroad. In 1985, the Government gave
 control of Ayers Rock, a sacred site for aboriginals, back to
 their complete control.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia, including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Australians participate in their government by electing a
 two-chamber federal parliament as well as numerous state and
 local bodies. Voting is compulsory in general elections for
 Australians 18 and over.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is the Government's policy to respond to any communication
 it might receive from the United Nations alleging violation of
 human rights in Australia. The Government also allows
 unimpeded access to all international and nongovernmental
 groups investigating supposed human rights violations.
 The 1985 Amnesty International Report had no entry on
 Australia. Freedom House rates Australia as "free."
 Internally, during the 12 months from August 1984 to August
 1985, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigated
 about 1,000 complaints under the 1985 Sex Discrimination Act,
 and about 400 complaints under the Human Rights Commission Act.
 Internationally, Australia has been active in promoting human
 rights as a member of the United Nations Human Rights

 Populations, and other forums.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Australia's 1985 population of 15,629,000 was growing at the
 rate of 1 percent a year. Forty percent of the Australian
 population is either foreign born or first generation
 Australian, an indication that Australian society is still
 rapidly evolving and is increasingly multicultural. Australia
 is an affluent country, enjoying one of the highest living
 standards in the world. In 1983 the per capita gross national
 product was US$11,490.
 In 1985 the infant mortality rate was 8.9 per 1,000 live
 births while life expectancy at birth was 74.7 years. About
 27.9 percent of the 1984-85 federal budget was devoted to
 social security and welfare. Basic food, shelter, health
 care, education, and social security benefits are guaranteed
 for the entire population, including recent immigrants.
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. The minimum wage is
 reviewed every six months by the federal Arbitration and
 Conciliation Commission with this in mind. A complex body of
 regulations and commission decisions prescribes the 40-hour
 (often 38) week, paid vacations, health and safety standards
 in the workplace, as well as other benefits, for the
 overwhelming majority of Australian workers. Australia is in
 the forefront of countries adopting regulations protecting
 children from dangerous or unsuitable employment.
 Women comprise 38.5 percent of the Australian work force.
 Although women are beginning to enter jobs previously occupied
 only by men, they remain concentrated in a narrow range of
 occupations predominantly occupied by females, characterized
 by low pay and low status. In 1985 the Government was
 considering voluntary affirmative action legislation.
 The Government acknowledges that the aboriginal population is
 the most disadvantaged group in such areas as education,
 housing, health, and employment. The Government has a broad
 range of programs aimed at providing Aboriginals services
 available to other Australians, plus additional services to
 improve their socioeconomic conditions. In 1985 the Cabinet
 endorsed the principles contained in the preferred model for
 aboriginal land rights. The Government has expressed the hope
 that states will implement these principles through their own
 legislation.
 Australia has recently introduced legislation to provide a
 written Bill of Rights.
