 FRANCE
 France is a democracy with full and effective constitutional
 guarantees  of  human   rights,  freely  functioning  political
 parties, and regular elections.     Voter participation   (with
 universal suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well as
 national  level are   occasions  for  ideological  and  topical
 debate;  even local elections are transformed by public opinion
 into referendums on the direction of national governmental
 policy.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy comprising a
 mixture of public and private enterprise.    The public sector
 was increased significantly during the first year-and-a-half of
 the Mitterrand Government when, in fulfillment of Socialist
 Party   campaign  promises,  a  number   of  important  private
 industrial enterprises and most of the remaining private banks
 were nationalized. Most of the economy is still privately
 controlled, however, and no firms or banks were nationalized in
 1983.
 Human rights is perhaps the single most consistent tenet of the
 Mitterrand Government. French leaders speak out frequently on
 worldwide abuses of human rights and make frequent reference to
 the protection of these rights within France.
 The July 1983 meeting in Geneva of the U.N. Commission on Human
 Rights expressed its admiration for recent reforms in the
 French judicial system.   In August 1983, the French Government
 proposed an additional series of legal reforms to expand
 individual  liberties,  provide   for  protection  of  victims'
 rights, and augment judicial discretion, particularly in the
 area of individual sentencing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Government does not condone political killing.      Acts of
 terrorism causing loss of life decreased in number from 1982.
 By French police count, 63 terrorist incidents resulted in 10
 deaths as of September 1983.    The single most deadly act of
 terrorism on French soil in 1983 was the bomb attack against
 Turkish Airlines at Orly Airport on July 15 which caused seven
 deaths (including one American).   Most acts of terrorism were
 carried out or claimed by non-French groups with ties to the
 Middle Eastern, including Armenian, terrorist groups. While no
 American citizens or officials in France were directly attacked
 by terrorists in 1983, concern for their safety remains high.
 American corporations received numerous bomb threats during
 1983. A bomb at the Marseille Trade Fair on September 30, which
 killed one person and caused extensive damage, was probably
 directed at the American Pavilion.      Several groups claimed
 responsibility  for   the  attack,   including  two  far-right,
 anti-immigrant groups.
 There were several bombings of French installations claimed by
 the indigenous anarchist terrorist group, "Direct Action."
 Separatist  groups   took  credit   for  several   bombings  in
 Martinique, including one in October at the building housing
 
 (979)
 
 
 980
 the American consulate.    Separatists in Corsica murdered a
 ranking French civil servant in August near Bastia, Upper
 Corsica.   Responsibility was claimed by    the Front for the
 National Liberation of Corsica, a Corsican separatist group
 which has traditionally limited its attacks to mainlander-owned
 property.  In January, the Government proscribed membership in
 the Front and, in September, the Front's political arm. Thefts
 of explosives and bomb attacks on property in Corsica continued
 steadily through 1983.  Increased law enforcement measures have
 had mixed results.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have engaged
 in  abduction  or  secret   arrests.   There  were  unconfirmed
 allegations of Government complicity in the disappearance and
 presumed murder of a Corsican with       separatist connections
 (Orsini)  in   August   1982,  which   prompted  a   continuing
 investigation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.  There have been no credible allegations of the use
 of torture.   During demonstrations in Paris in May and June
 against proposed higher education reforms, scattered street
 rioting  resulted   in   isolated  instances  of   beatings  of
 demonstrators.   On the whole, however, police reaction was
 restrained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French  law  guarantees   freedom  from  arbitrary  arrest  and
 imprisonment.  There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but a suspect can be held only for
 up to two days--five for drug cases--before being transferred
 to a magistrate for investigation. Elements of France's large
 Armenian community have protested the Government's detention of
 approximately 50 persons of Armenian descent (most of whom are
 French citizens) in connection with the Orly Airport bombing.
 After  the bombing, approximately    two dozen Armenians were
 placed in "provincial detention" (sent to outlying provinces
 with police escort) and have since been put under a form of
 house arrest requiring them to report to local police stations
 on a regular basis.     Five Armenians involved in the 1981
 takeover of the Turkish consulate in Paris remain in jail
 awaiting trial.
 The French judiciary plays an important, determining role in
 the detention process.   Government authority to hold a person
 beyond the prescribed periods is severely restricted and must
 be ordered by the competent court.
 France has for many decades been a home to thousands of persons
 fleeing political or    religious persecution.   There are   no
 substantiated  allegations   of   persons  being   exiled  from
 modern-day France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair, public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected  in practice.    Suspects have   the right to   legal
 counsel as soon as their case is transferred from the police to
 
 
 981
 a magistrate.   For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement in the
 Magistrate is limited normally to four months, with possible
 extensions in special circumstances not to exceed eight months.
 For felonies, pretrial confinement is not limited. French law
 provides for the right of appeal, except in jury trials of
 felony cases.
 Trials  in   France  are  normally   open  and  public,  though
 provisions  exist   for  the   defense  to  request   a  closed
 proceeding.   Discussion  is underway on    the possibility of
 publicly broadcasting the upcoming trial of Klaus Barbie, the
 former Nazi Gestapo Agent in Lyons. The press has free access
 to  records   of  court  proceedings,   though  cases   in  the
 investigatory or trial stages are protected under French law
 from disclosure by the prosecutor.    Though the judiciary is
 independent, the courts are not immune from subtle political or
 public pressure on certain cases.
 There is no indication that the Government detains any person
 solely for political reasons.   Other than allegations by the
 Armenian community of government persecution, there are no
 serious charges of political motivation in the detention of
 persons. To the contrary, the Government has been accused of
 enforcement laxity in the aftermath of several violent crimes
 carried out by common criminals who were amnestied and released
 by the Government in 1981.
 The 1983 Report of Amnesty International expresses concern over
 the status of conscientious objectors.   Pending completion of
 legislative  reforms, legal proceedings have been suspended
 against individuals whose requests for conscientious objector
 status  were  rejected.   There  are  still  some  individuals,
 however, who are now serving prison terms imposed by the
 Permanent Tribunals of the Armed Forces prior to 1983, because
 they did not present such     a request and refused military
 service. Such tribunals were abolished as of January 1, 1983.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 French law guarantees freedom from invasion of privacy and this
 is respected in practice.   The search of a private residence
 requires a search warrant. Searches must take place between
 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., except in special cases (such as drug
 offenses) when the search can be undertaken at any time.
 Telephone conversations may be monitored in conjunction with
 criminal proceedings   with  a  court order   and  in national
 security cases with administrative decree     from  the agency
 conducting the investigation.  The Government has occasionally
 opened correspondence to enforce currency regulations, though
 this is not a widespread practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These  freedoms  are   guaranteed  by  law   and  respected  in
 practice.   Criticism   of   government  policies   is  legally
 protected.  Newspapers and magazines are free from government
 control and carry views ranging across the political spectrum.
 Major radio and television stations are publicly owned, though
 the  Government  is  not  directly   involved  in  their  daily
 operation.  These media are subject to the jurisdiction of a
 "High  Authority"  whose   appointment  is   shared  among  the
 President, the National Assembly, and the Senate. In 1983, the
 Government authorized the establishment of private "free" radio
 
 
 982
 stations, many of which are sympathetic to the current political
 opposition.  Allegations of government pressure on television
 and radio continue to be heard and denied. Government influence
 on the audiovisual media, however, is not so significant as to
 represent a limitation of the freedoms enjoyed by the French.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is constitutionally
 guaranteed and respected in practice.    Labor unions have the
 right to organize free from government control.     Though less
 than one-quarter of labor is unionized, trade unions exercise
 significant economic and political influence. They are present
 and active in numerous tripartite (government, employers, and
 labor) bodies dealing with    social matters, including   labor
 courts and   the prestigious Economic   and Social Council, a
 constitutionally mandated consultative body.   In October, over
 30 million French workers, students, and unemployed citizens
 elected new Social Security Boards to oversee old-age, health,
 and retirement benefits.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France.  Separation of church and state is guaranteed by the
 French 1905 Concordat with the Vatican (except in Alsace and a
 portion of Lorraine where, for historic reasons, the Concordat
 does not   apply  and  the Catholic Church    enjoys a   favored
 status).  All other religious groups function freely without
 persecution or restrictions.    The civil service is open to
 members of all religions. There are parochial as well as public
 schools.  The Government has entered into discussions on a
 long-range and controversial program to reduce subsidies to
 private schools (96 percent of which are Catholic) and recreate
 a single, national school system.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 France  provides  for  freedom  of  internal movement, foreign
 travel,  emigration,   and  repatriation.    Currency  controls
 instituted in April (which expired in December) significantly
 reduced  the  amount of money    available  to  French  citizens
 traveling to most overseas destinations.     Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France. France
 has an extensive record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Cit-zens to
 Change Their Government
 The French Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 All French citizens of both sexes who have reached majority may
 vote. These provisions are fully respected in practice. A wide
 variety of political parties compete freely in elections.    In
 addition to national, Presidential, and legislative elections,
 there are regularly scheduled local elections. The Government
 is in the process of transferring significant powers from the
 executive branch to the locally elected assemblies.
 A  wide range   of  special  interest groups--labor, veterans,
 consumer advocates, ecologists, and others--organize freely,
 
 
 983
 and regularly run candidates for elective office. Legislation
 over  the  past   year  has  been   enacted  to  broaden  civil
 liberties.  While isolated incidents of racial, religious, or
 poltical discrimination occur, particularly against the large
 immigrant community, they are not condoned by the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area.  Human rights organizations operate freely in France,
 including Amnesty International, the International Federation
 for Human Rights, and the International Institute for Human
 Rights. Freedom House rates France "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 France has an advanced industrial mixed economy  accompanied by
 a  system  of  social  assistance   to  needy  members  of  the
 population,   regardless  of   race,   religion,   sex,  ethnic
 background, or political opinion.    France's population as of
 1983 is 54,604,000.    Population growth rate is 0.5 percent.
 Per capita gross national product is $12,128.80 (1981).    Life
 expectancy at birth is 74 years (as of 1980) and the infant
 mortality rate is 9/1000, as of 1983. Adult literacy rate is
 99 percent. The primary school enrollment ratio is 112 percent
 (i.e., including adults enrolled), and the ratio of calorie
 supply  available  for   consumption  relative  to  nutritional
 requirements is 136 percent.
 Women have equal status under the law, but they remain engaged
 in the continuing effort to maintain and strengthen their
 rights.  A Cabinet-level Ministry is charged with promoting
 women's rights.   The French Government continues to promote
 efforts  to  close  loopholes   in  French  legislation  on  sex
 discrimination in the workplace, to disseminate information on
 contraception, and   to implement partial state financing of
 abortions.
