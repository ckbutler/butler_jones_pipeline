 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy, with a president and a unicameral con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms. President Carlos Flores Facusse took office on Janu-
 ary 27, 1998, as the fifth democratically elected President since the reestablishment
 of democracy in 1982. The two major political parties, the Liberals and the National-
 ists, have alternated in power peace fully after free elections. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent but is often ineffective and subject to outside influence.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise the army, the air force, and the
 navy. The Congress in 1996 ratified a constitutional amendment to sever the Public
 Security Force (FUSEP), a paramilitary police force, from the HOAF. The police
 were transferred to civilian control in 1997; new legislation concerning how the civil-
 ian police force will function is expected to be approved in 1998. The armed forces
 operate with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, particularly in the
 realms of internal security and military affairs. The Government in 1993 estab-
 lished an Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Reform in response to credible
 allegations of extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP, particularly its Na-
 tional Directorate of Investigations (DNI). That decision led the Government to es-
 tablish a new Public (Justice) Ministry charged with administering a new Direc-
 torate of Criminal Investigations (DIC) to succeed the DNI. Human rights organiza-
 tions, including the Government's National Commissioner for Human Rights, ac-
 knowledge that reports of human rights abuses have steadily declined since the DNI
 was abolished; however, members of both the armed forces and the police continue
 to commit abuses.
 The economy is based primarily on agriculture, with a small but increasingly im-
 portant maquiladora (in-bond processing for export) industry that accounts for some
 90,000 jobs. The armed forces play a role in the national economy through their pen-
 sion fund, controlling some enterprises usually associated with the prvate sector,
 including a bank, several insurance companies, and one of two cement companies.
 However, some state enterprises, such as the merchant marine and the national
 telephone company, have passed from military to civilian control. Approximately 43
 percent of workers engage in agriculture; about one-third of those work on large
 plantations. The principal export crops are coffee and bananas, which are the lead-
 ing sources of foreign exchange; nontraditional products, such as melons and
 srimp, also play an increasingly important role in the economy. Annual per capita
 income is about $700; the Government estimates that 65 percent of its citizens live
 in poverty.
 The Governent's human rights record improved somewhat, but serious problems
 remaln. Members of the security forces allegedly committed extrajudicial killings.
 Incidents of police beating and other abuse of detainees remained a problem. Prison
 conditions remained harsh, detainees do not always receive due process, and lengthy
 pretrial detention is a problem. Considerable impunity for members of the civilian
 and military elite, exacerbated by a weak, underfunded, and sometimes corrupt judi-
 cial system, contributes to human rights problems. The judicial system continued
 to deny swift and impartial justice to prisoners awaiting trial. While no senior gov-
 ernment official, politician, bureaucrat, or member of the business elite was con-
 victed of crimes, the Government removed dozens of judges and police investigators
 from office on charges of corruption. Other human rights problems included societal
 discrimination and violence against women, discrimination against indigenous peo-
 ple, and abuse of street children. There was an increase in killings by vigilantes.
 hild labor is a problem, particularly in rural areas and in the informal economy,
 but not in the expert processing sector.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings; human rights organizations, however, continued to allege that
 individual members of the security forces committed extrajudicial killings. The Gov-
 ernment in September publicly denied such allegations.
 In April the security forces killed 2 persons and wounded 16 others in the process
 of routing protesters who had taken over a highway in El Paraiso. In November
 prison guards opened fire on prisoners escaping a fire the prisoners themselves had
 set killing at least one person (see Section I.c.).
 Human rights groups implicated members of the security forces in a number of
 killings of street children (see Section 5.).
 The crime rate surged again in 1997, due to worsening economic conditions, easy
 access by the general population to alcohol and weapons, the inability of the police
 
 
 to deter crime, and the difficulties encountered by an underfunded and understaffed
 DIC in investigating and solving more than a token number of crimes. The number
 of homicides nationwide rose, averaging five to six per day in the capital city of
 Tegucigalpa alone; random shootings also were common. The drastic increase in vio-
 lent crime contributed to the growth of private often unlicensed, guard services, and
 of volunteer groups who patrolled their neigiborhoods or mumcipalities to deter
 crime. The proliferation of private security forces, in turn, made it more difficult to
 differentiate among homicides that may have been perpetrated by government secu-
 rity personnel, common criminals, or private vigilantes.
 Human rights groups asserted that they had credible evidence that at least some
 of these homicides were extrajudicial executions. In such cases, persons presumed
 to be part of renegade elements of the security forces, or civilian (including vigi-
 lante) groups working with such elements, allegedly used unwarranted letha force
 against supposed habitual criminals. Widespread frustration at the inability of the
 security forces to control crime, and the well-founded pereption that corrupt secu-
 rity forces were complicit in the high rate of crime, led to considerable public sup-
 port for vigilante justice. The Government did not take effective action to try, con-
 vict, or punish anyone for these offenses.
 Credible allegations in the past of extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP
 led to the creation in January 1994 of a new, civilian-controlled Directorate of
 Criminal Investigations under the control of the Public Ministry (which also in-
 cludes a prosecutorial branch). The Attorney General and human rights groups have
 noted a continuing drop in the number of reports of human rights abuses since the
 creation of the DIC. The new Public Ministry, responsible for investigating all cases
 of extrajudicial killings, has completed its initial program of training and organizing
 its staff
 The Supreme Court in 1996 issued a special decree permitting officials associated
 with the criminal justice system (including the military, police, prison wardens and
 employees, criminal investigative agents, public prosecutors, judges, and other mag-
 istrates) who are undergoing investigation or trial to serve their preventive deten-
 tion at military bases and police centers, rather than at the central penitentiary in
 Tegucigalpa, as had been the case in the past. It was hoped that the decree, which
 applies only to preventive detention, would encourage military officers sought for al-
 leged human rights abuses in the 1980's to turn themselves in. The decree was de-
 signed as an interim measure, pending passage by the Congress of a new penal pro-
 cedure code that would modernize the existing antiquated code.
 Under terms of the decree, two low-level former FUSEP agents surrendered in
 July to face charges of alleged involvement in two 1992 disappearances in
 Choluteca. The authorities freed them in August for lack of evidence.
 Two former senior military and security officials were jailed in the case of Adan
 Aviles Funez and Nicaraguan Amado Espinoza Paz, who disappeared together in
 Choluteca on June 12, 1982. Retired police colonel Marco Antonio Matute Lagos sur-
 rendered to the authorities on November 3; colonel Manuel Enrique Suarez
 Benavides was jailed on August 25. Both faced charges of illegal detention and mur-
 der. At year's end, Matute awaited trial on the charges; Suarez was freed on appeal
 in November.
 There was no progress in the investigation or prosecution of other alleged
 extrajudicial killings committed in previous years.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Attorney General continued investigations into the disappearances of 184
 people in the 1980's. Various witnesses, survivors, and a few former members of the
 military have charged that a military intelligence group called Battalion 3-16 kid-
 naped, tortured, and murdered many of those who disappeared. The National Com-
 missioner for Human Rights, Leo Valladares, also continued his investigation into
 the human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by members of Battalion
 3-16 and the former DNI. The Attorney General and the Human Rights Commis-
 sioner requested from the HOAF and the U.S. Government information that they
 might have to aid this investigation. The HOAF claimed to have no relevant infor-
 mation, but the U.S. Government reviewed internal documents from the period in
 question and released to the Attorney General and the Human Rights Commissioner
 thousands of pages of declassified documents, including several hundred pages relat-
 ingto the 1983 disappearance of a U.S. citizen Jesuit priest, Father James Carney.
 Februar the Government completed payment of indemnifications to the fami-
 lies of Saul Godinez Cruz and Manfredo Velasquez Rodriguez that the Inter-Amer-
 ican Court of Human Rights levied in 1989. Godinez and Velasquez were students
 at the National Autonomous University in 1981 when DNI agents detained them;
 they were never seen again.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there were isolated reports that officials em-
 ployed such practices. Police beatings and other alleged abuses of detainees re-
 mained a problem. The police also engaged in violence against street children, in-
 cluding beatings and a number of killings (see Section 5).
 The National Police's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigates
 cases of alleged torture and abuse; OPR officials can recommend sanctions for police
 agents found guilty of such mistreatment. However, neither the police commander
 nor the OPR is empowered to punish wrongdoers- only the immediate superior of
 the accused agent has the authority to do so. The Public Ministry and human rights
 groups criticized the OPR for being unresponsive to their requests for impartial in-
 vestigations of police officers accused of abuses. In 1996 the Public Ministry created
 the Office of Human Rights Inspector within the DIC to monitor the behavior of its
 agents; the Inspector reports to the head of the human rights section of the Public
 Ministry and to the Attorney General. The DIC dismissed some 40 agents for in-
 volvement in corrupt activities and abuses of authority. The HOAF no longer exer-
 cise mission or funding authority over the police, and the Government in September
 established a seven-member review board to monitor the police until legislation pro-
 vides implementing regulations and ministerial authority. The police are scheduled
 to make the final transition to civilian authority in May 1998.
 Prison conditions remained harsh. Prisoners suffered from severe overcrowding,
 malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation. The country's 24 penal centers held
 over 9,000 prisoners; more than 90 percent of these were awaiting trial, some for
 over 5 years. In Augst, September, and November, a wave of prison protests across
 the country resulted in the burning by inmates of penitentiaries in Santa Barbara,
 Trujillo, and Gracias, and in mass escapes from other detention centers. After the
 Gracias fire, 134 prisoners escaped. Guards reportedly opened fire on them, killing
 one person and wounding five others. In September a physician who treated pris-
 oners in the central penitentiary in Tegucigalpa filed legal charges against its war-
 den and several guards for allegedly ordering and inflicting torture. In October a
 prisoner in San Pedro Sula publicly claimed that he had been raped by other ris-
 oners, and that he knew of seven similar cases, including that of a minor. These
 events increased public pressure for urgently needed penal reforms.
 Women are incarcerated in separate facilities under conditions similar to those of
 male prisoners, except that female prisoners do not have conjugal visit privileges.
 More often than not, wardens housed the mentally ill and those with tuberculosis
 and other infectious diseases among the general prison population. A new, larger
 detention facility for men located in Tamara, which had ben scheduled to open in
 1996, lacked water and had not yet beenplaced in operation. Prisoners with money
 routinely bought private cells, decent food, and conjugal visitations, while prisoners
 without money often lacked the most basic necessities, as well as legal assistance.
 The prison system budgets just $0.45 (6 lempiras) per day for food and medicine
 for each prisoner. Many street children under arrest were housed in adult prisons,
 where they were routinely abused.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law states that the police may arrest
 a person only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission
 of a crime, and that they must clearly inform the person of the grounds for the ar-
 rest. (By law, the plice cannot investigate; it onry detains suspects.) Police must
 bring a detainee be ore a judge within 24 hours; the judge then must issue an initial
 temporary holding order within 24 hours, release an initial decision within 6 days,
 and conduct a preliminary investigation to decide whether there is sufficient evi-
 dence to warrant further investigation. In practice, however, the authorities do not
 routinely observe these legal requirements. While bail is legally available, it is used
 primarily for ostensibly medical reasons; however, procedures for grnting it in such
 cases are confused and unclear. Poor defendants, even when represented by a public
 defender, are seldom able to take advantage of bail.
 Lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. More than 90 percent of prisoners were
 awaiting trial, some for over 5 years (see Section 1.c.).
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, judges, the police, public officials,
 or any citizen may initiate criminal proceedings. Perhaps as many as 80 percent of
 the cases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal justice system,
 but instead are settled administratively by the police or by municipal courts, which
 are separate from the regular judicial court system.
 The Constitution prohibits the expatriation of a citizen to another country; exile
 is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair trial. While the Government respects these prvisions
 
 
 559
 in principle, implementation has been weak and uneven in practice. A number of
 faors limit the effectiveness of the system: Both the judiciary and the Public Min-
 istry suffer from inadequate funding, the civil law inquisitorial system functions
 very poorly, and powerful special interests still exercise influence and often prevail
 in many courts. Also, many leading politicians enjoy constitutional immunity from
 prosecution because of their membership in either the Congress or the Central
 American Parliament, and that immunity extends to acts committed before taking
 office. The Attorney General in September publicly described the legal regime as "a
 system in collapse," and recommended a congressional review of the legal immunity
 statutes.
 The court system is composed of a Supreme Court with 9 magistrates; 10 appeals
 courts; 67 courts of first instance of general jurisdiction; and 325 justice of the peace
 courts of limited jurisdiction. Congress elects the nine Supreme Court justices and
 names the president of the Court; the Supreme Court, in turn, names all lower
 court judges. The 4-year term for justices of the Supreme Court coincides with those
 of the Congress and the President.
 Some progress was made in using a judicial career system to enhance qualifica-
 tions of sitting judges, depoliticize the appointments process, and break the subcul-
 tures of corruption, clientism, patronage, and influence-peddling within the judici-
 ary. Nevertheless, many courts remained staffed by politically selected judges and
 unqualified clerks and were inefficient and subject to influence by special interests.
 In September two members of the Supreme Court publicly questioned the political
 independence and financial integrity of fellow justices on the Court. The Attorney
 General investigated more than 100 judges suspected of corruption and malfea-
 sance; 44 judges were dismissed for cause, and 3 were imprisoned.
 An accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an ini-
 tial hearing by a judge, to bail, to an attorney provided by the State if necessary,
 and to appeal. Although the Constitution recognizes the principle of innocence, the
 Criminal ode is in practice often administered by ill-trained judges operating on
 a presumption of "guilty until proven innocent." Pretrial hearings and trials are
 written and at the judge's discretion may be declared secret and not "public." De-
 fendants and their attorneys are not always genuine participants in the process, de-
 spite rights accorded under law. Defendants may, through the judge, confront wit-
 nesses against them and present evidence on their own behalf. According to law,
 defendants and their attorneys have access to government-held evidence relevant to
 their cases, but in practice this is not always the case.
 In the inquisitorial system, judges are legally in charge of the investigation as
 well as the trial and sentencing. Both the Public Ministrys public prosecutors and
 private prosecutors may bring criminal charges against citizens. A judge may jail
 an accused person for 6 days before a determination is made of probable cause to
 admit the charge. If a judge sustains the criminal accusation, the accused remains
 in jail or may be released on bail while awaiting trial.
 A public defender program provides service to those unable to afford an adequate
 defense. There are 104 public defenders nationally providing free legal services for
 37 percent of the prison population; however, public defenders are hard pressed to
 meet the heavy demands of a nonautomated, inadequately funded, and labor-inten-
 sive criminal justice system. Pending consideration of proposed reforms, the Su-
 preme Court issued an instruction that holds judges personally accountable for re-
 ducing the backlogged cases; separates judges into pretrial investigative judges, and
 trial and sentencing judges; and creates a program to monitor and enforce compli-
 ance with these measures. The instruction is intended to ensure that the rights of
 the accused to a timely and transparent defense are more effectively respected.
 Detention of criminal suspects pending trial averaged 2 years and remained a se-
 rious problem. In a number of cases, poor prisoners remained in jail after being ac-
 quitted or completing their sentences, due to the failure by responsible officials to
 process their release papers. A significant number of defendants served the maxi-
 mum possible sentence for the crime of which they were accused before their trials
 were concluded, or even beun. As of year's end, more than 90 percent of all pris-
 oners had been neither tried nor sentenced.
 In the past 3 years, the Public Ministry has taken positive steps by investigating
 and accusing not only military officers of human rights violations, but also ranking
 officials of the past two governments of abuses of power, fraud, and diversion of pub-
 lic funds and resources. These are crimes that seriously diminish the ability of the
 Government to address fundamental economic issues affecting the welfare of the
 general population. At year's end, however, none of those accused had been con-
 victed.
 Following much-publicized investigations of alleged past and present human
 rights violations by national security personnel, judges in the civilian court system
 
 
 560
 brought criminal charges against a number of senior active or retired military offi-
 cers for murder, attempted murder, and illegal detention; those cases still awaited
 trial at year's end. Although the military continued to profess respect for civilian
 court jurisdiction over its members, only three military officers accused of human
 rights violations had turned themselves in.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable, and that persons in the em-
 ploy of the State may enter only with the owner's consent, or with the authorization
 of a competent legal authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m. and 6
 p.m., or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission of
 a crime. However, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police and
 armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization before en-
 tering a private home. Despite an improved system of "duty judges" and "duty pros-
 ecutors" to issue search warrants, coordination among the police, the court, and the
 Public Ministry remains weak. There was credible evidence that the military main-
 tained files on union activists (see Section 6.b.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the authorities largely respected these freedoms inpractice.
 The news media often were openly critical of the Government and exposed corrup-
 tion, but they themselves suffered from corruption and politicization. Serious inves-
 tigative journalism is still in its infancy; there were numerous credible reports of
 self-censorship and of payments, in cash or in kind, to journalists either to promote
 or to kill stories.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for all forms of religious ex-
 pression, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enter and exit the country without arbitrary impediment, and
 the Government does not restrict travel within the country's borders.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum and grants asylum or refugee status in accordance with the
 standards of the 1951 United Nations ConventionRelating to the Status of Refugees
 and its 1967 Protocol.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government through democratic and
 peaceful means in the November elections. International observers found the elec-
 tions to be free and fair. For the first time voters had the opportunity to cast sepa-
 rate ballots in the presidential, congressional, and municipal elections. Security at
 election sites was provided by police forces operating under civilian control for the
 first time in recent years. Voting was made easier for citizens by a change that al-
 lowed them to vote closer to their homes.
 The national administration is chosen by free, secret, direct, and obligatory ballot-
 ing every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, but the clergy and members of the security
 forces are not permitted to vote. Any citizen born in Honduras or abroad of Hon-
 duran parentage may hold office, except for members of the clergy, the armed forces,
 and the police. A new political party may gain legal status by obtaining 20,000 sig-
 natures and establishing party organizations in at least half of the country's 18 de-
 partments.
 There are no legal impediments to women or minorities participating in govern-
 ment and politics; in practice, however, theproportion of women and minorities in
 political organizations and elective office is far lower than their overall representa-
 tion in society. Women occupied a cabinet ministry and a Supreme Court position,
 as well as a number of vice ministerial positions, in the Government. Of the 128
 deputies in the Congress, 14 were women. In the November elections, a woman for
 the first time was the presidential candidate of a major political party, and a female
 candidate was elected to one of the three vice presidencies on the winning party's
 ticket.
 
 
 561
 There were few indigenous persons in leadership positions in government or poli-
 tics. Five indigenous persons were deputies in the Congress, and the ambassador
 to the United Nations is a member of the Garifuna indigenous group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 In 1996 the Congress ratified a presidential decree expanding the functions of the
 National Commissioner for Human Rights and unanimously reelected Leo
 Valladares to a 6-year term as National Commissioner. Under this new decree, and
 in fulfillment of his expanded functions, the National Commissioner has free access
 to all civilian and military institutions and centers of detention; he may enter with-
 out authorization or objection by anyone. The National Commissioner performs his
 functions with complete immunity and autonomy from all persons.
 Anonymous telephone callers continued to threaten persons active in human
 rights endeavors. Human Rights Commissioner Valladares received numerous tele-
 tphone threats against himself and his family. Ramon Custodio, president of the
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), and Bertha
 Oliva de Nativi, coordinator general of the Committee of Relatives of the Detained
 and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH), also received numerous telephone
 threats. DIC director Wilfredo Alvarado received death threats during his investiga-
 tion of senior government officials involved in illegal sales of Honduran diplomatic
 passports. Attorney General Edmundo Orellana reported threats against himself
 and his family due to his investigations of several cases of persons who disappeared
 in the 1980's and to recent public denunciations of high-level corruption.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination based on race or sex. Although it also bans
 discrimination on the basis of class, in fact, the political, military, and social elites
 generally enjoyed impunity before the legal system. Members of these groups rarely
 were arrested or jailed; legislators enjoy legal immunity. In 1996, however, the Gov-
 ernment detained two officials of the former Callejas administration, Jose Tomas
 Guillen Williams and Luciano Coello, on charges of corruption and abuse of author-
 ity. Both remained in the central penitentiary in Tegucigalpa, awaiting trial.
 Women.-Violence against women remained widespread, and serious weaknesses
 in the Penal Code severely impeded efforts to combat it. Most such violence took
 place within the family. The courts did not take action in domestic violence cases
 unless the victim was injured severely and incapacitated for more than 10 days. Ex-
 cept in the case of children 12 years of age or under, rape is considered a private
 crime, which means that rape victims must hire a private prosecutor, a luxury that
 few can afford. The penalties for rape are relatively light, ranging from 3 to 9 years'
 imprisonment. The law exonerates a rapist if he offers to marry the victim and she
 accepts. Under pressure from the Honduran Women's Committee for Peace-
 Visitacion Padilla, the Center for Women's Rights, and other women's advocacy and
 reform groups, the Congress in September adopted legislation to strengthen the
 rights of women and increase the penalties for crimes of domestic violence commit-
 ted against women.
 There were few shelters specifically maintained for battered women. The Govern-
 ment operates one shelter that can accommodate 10 women and their families. Six
 new centers for battered women opened in 1996, offering legal, medical, and psycho-
 logical assistance, but not physical shelter. Although the new law dealing with do-
 mestic violence offered some redress, few women took advantage of the legal proc-
 ess, believing that judges would be unwilling to apply the law vigorously. Sexual
 harassment in the workplace was also a problem.
 Women were represented in at least small numbers in most of the professions,
 but cultural attitudes limited their career opportunities. In theory, women have
 equal access to educational opportunities, but family pressures often impede the am-
 bitions of women intent on obtaining higher education. The law requires employers
 to pay women, who make up 51 percent of the work force, equal wages for equal
 work, but employers often classify women's jobs as less demanding than those of
 men in order to justify paying them lower salaries.
 Some organizations have begun to offer assistance to women, principally targeting
 those living in the rural sectors and marginal neighborhoods of cities. The Hon-
 duran Federation of Women's Associations, for example, provided home construction
 and improvement loans, offered free legal assistance, and lobbied the Government
 
 
 562
 on women's causes. The Center for the Investigation and Promotion of Human
 Rights (CIPRODEH) continued to operate a program to make women aware of their
 rights under the law.
 Children.-Although the Government committed itself to protecting children by
 allocating 37 percent of its 1998 budget to public education and health care, it was
 unable to prevent the abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.) and child laborers
 (see Section 6.d.). There were an estimated 4,000 street children, of whom only half
 reportedly have shelter on any given day. Many street children have been sexually
 molested, and about 40 percent regularly engaged in prostitution; approximately 30
 percent of the street children in Tegucigalpa an1d San Pedro Sula, the two popu-
 ation centers, were HV positive. At least 40 percent were addied to sniffing glue.
 Over 75 percent of the street children found their way to the streets because of se-
 vere family problems; 30 percent simply were abandoned. Both the police and mem-
 bers of the generalpepulation engaged in violence against street children. When the
 authorities arrested minors, many of whom were charged with the commission of
 capital and other serious crimes, they were housed with adult detainees who abused
 them; one such case in San Pedro Sula became public in October.
 In 1996 the Government opened juvenile centers in Tamara, El Carmen, and El
 Hatillo (located in sections of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula). Nonetheless, a gen-
 eral lack of juvenile detention facilities contributed to the detention of minors with
 adults and to vigilante violence against, and police abuse of, street children. A juve-
 nile who escaped from El Hatillo in March was killed while trying to avoid recap-
 ture, and four other runaways from El Carmen and El Hatillo in September were
 found beaten to death or executed by a shot through the head. Human rights groups
 implicated out-of-uniform security personnel in these and at least eight other juve-
 nile deaths. In October Casa Alianza de Honduras (Covenant House of Honduras),
 an organization dedicated to children's rights, brought charges before the Public
 Ministry against unnamed members of the armed forces and the police for the al-
 leged torture of 63 juveniles or minors, 35 of whom reportedly were murdered, since
 1990. Also in October, a police captain was placed in preventive detention and four
 other police agents were placed under investigation for illegally detaining and beat-
 ing three youths.
 New legislation covering children and adolescents took effect in 1996, covering the
 rights, liberties, and protection of children, including in the area of child labor (see
 Section 6.d.). It established prison sentences of up to 3 years for persons convicted
 of any manner of child abuse. In September the Government for the fifth consecu-
 tive year convened a national children's congress at which boys and girls from
 throughout the country discussed issues affecting the nation's youth. Street children
 participated in this congress for the first time.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no formal barriers to participation by dis-
 abled persons in employment, education, or health care, but neither is there specific
 statutory or constitutional protection for them. There is no legislation that requires
 access by disabled persons to government buildings or commercial establishments.
 Indigenous People.-The small communties of indigenous people had little or no
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, or the
 allocation of natural resources. Indigenous land rights are communal. While the law
 permits persons to claim individual freeholding titles, this was difficult to accom-
 plish in practice. Tribal lands often are defined poorly in documents dating back to
 the mid-19th century and, in most cases, lack any legal title based on modern cadas-
 tral measurements. The Honduran Forestry Development Corporation makes all de-
 cisions regarding exploitation of timber resources on indigenous lands, often over
 strenuous tribal objection. Nonindigenous farmers and cattle ranchers regularly
 usurp indigenous lands.
 The courts commonly denied legal recourse to indigenous groups and often showed
 bias in favor of nonindigenous parties who were people of means and influence. The
 illegal seizure of private property is punishable by 31/2 years' imprisonment, while
 unauthorized demonstrations in public venues can result in prison terms of 3 to 5
 years and fines ranging from $770 to $3,845. Failure to obtain legal redress fre-
 quently caused indigenous groups to attempt to regain land through invasions and
 other tactics, which usually provoked the authorities into retaliating forcefully.
 In April Candido Amador Recinos, a leader of the Chorti indigenous group who
 was active in efforts to regain tribal lands, was murdered in Corralitos; there has
 been no progress in the investigation of his death. In May after month-long protests
 by indigenous organizations that included a hunger strike, the Government signed
 a 22-point agreement with representatives of various groups that would make avail-
 able 9 initial land grants of 9,000 hectares each to different tribes, grant some con-
 tested land titles outright to indigenous petitioners, and set aside $15,385 in govern-
 ment funds for indigenous housing. The Congress also created a commission to
 
 
 563
 study indigenous land claims, which often conflict with the claims of small farmers.
 The Government in August transferred title to an additional 1,200 hectares of land
 to various indigenous groups after protesters temporarily seized the grounds of the
 President's office, the Congress, and a foreign embassy. On October 12, indigenous
 protesters destroyed a statue of Columbus in Tegucigalpa. One month later, leaders
 of the group turned themselves over to a court; the judge reduced the charges to
 vandalism and released them on bail.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions; the unions are independent of government and political parties. Three large
 peasant organizations are affiliated directly with the labor movement. Unions fre-
 quently participate in public rallies against government policies and make extensive
 use of the news media to advance their views. Since only about 14 percent of the
 work force is unionized, however, the economic and political influence of organized
 labor has diminished in recent years. The Constitution provides for the right to
 strike, along with a wide range of other basic labor rights, which the authorities
 honor in practice. The Civil Service Code, however, denies the right to strike to all
 government workers, other than employees of state-owned enterprises. There were
 illegal work stoppages during the year, conducted by public sector employees in
 heaith and related industries. In November the authorities ordered the security
 forces to remove striking health workers from public health facilities in Tegucigalpa.
 The health workers returned to their jobs after the Government agreed to establish
 a bipartite panel to review worker demands.
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity" associations, which are es-
 sentially aimed at providing credit and other services to workers and managers who
 are members of the association. Representatives of organized labor groups criticize
 these associations, asserting that they do not permit strikes, have inadequate griev-
 ance procedures, and neutralize genuine, representative trade unions.
 The trade union movement maintains close ties with various international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects workers'
 rights to organize and to bargain collectively; collective bargaining agreements are
 the norm for companies in which workers are organized. However, although the
 Labor Code prohibits retribution by employers for trade union activity, it is a com-
 mon occurrence. Some employers have threatened to close down unionized compa-
 nies and harassed workers seeking to unionize, in some cases dismissing them out-
 right. Employers actually dismiss relatively few workers for union activity, once a
 union is recognized; such cases, however, serve to discourage workers elsewhere
 from attempting to organize.
 Workers in both unionized and nonunionized companies are under protection of
 the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the Ministry of
 Labor. The Ministry took action in several cases, pressuring employers to observe
 the code. Labor or civil courts can require employers to rehire employees fired for
 union activity, but such rulings are uncommon. Agreements between management
 and unions generally contain a clause prohibiting retaliation against any worker
 who participates in a strike or union activity. In one instance, however, the Banco
 de Trabajadores received a court order to rehire two workers who successfully
 unionized that firm, but refused to reinstate them in their former duties; instead,
 the bank assigned the two workers to an empty office and denied them the oppor-
 tunity to work. Those individuals remained on the payroll at their former salaries,
 but it was assumed that the bank wished them to resign in frustration over their
 new office environment. The bank refused to cooperate with an investigation into
 these circumstances by the National Commissioner for Human Rights, who threat-
 ened to pursue legal action against the bank. In November the Government seized
 control of the bank's records and threatened to arrest bank officials for noncompli-
 ance with the court's edict.
 The same labor regulations apply in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest
 of private industry. Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free
 trade zone (7 of 11 maquiladoras there are unionized), but factory owners have re-
 sisted efforts to organize the new, privately owned industrial parks. In Februar two
 lawyers representing maquiladoras during labor negotiations in Puerto Cortes
 claimed to have received death threats. The Honduran Association of Maquiladores
 (ABM) over the past 2 years has sponsored seminars and other meetings between
 its membership and major labor groups. As a result, tensions have declined, and
 some two dozen plants have unionized peacefully in the privately owned EPZ's. The
 AHM in July adopted a new code of conduct governing salaries and working condi-
 tions in the industry and recognizing worker rights to organize. Although the AHM
 
 
 564
 neither consulted local unions before drafting it, nor provided for any formal role
 for organized labor in supervising its implementation with the industry, the code
 nonetheless represents a new, public commitment by apparel manufacturers to
 abide by local laws and regulations governing their industries. It provides a starting
 point for a dialog among the AIIM, organized labor, and the Government. The atti-
 tude of the Government towards organized labor in the EPZ's is the same as regards
 other industries.
 In a number of maquiladora plants, workers have shown little enthusiasm for
 unionizing, since they consider their treatment, salary, and working conditions to
 be as good as, or better than, those in unionized plants. In the absence of unions
 and collective bargaining, several EPZ plants have instituted solidarity associations
 that, to some extent, function as "company unions" for the purposes of setting wages
 and negotiating working conditions. Other EPZ plants use the minimum wage to set
 starting salaries, and adjust wage scales by negotiating with common groups of
 plant workers and other employees based on seniority, skills, categories of work,
 and other criteria. In June a South Korean-owned maquiladora plant agreed to per-
 mit an independent monitoring group composed of religious, human rights, and
 women's organizations to inspect its facility and observe the working conditions of
 its employees. Unions objected to the agreement because it excluded them, while
 other maquiladoras observed that the monitors lacked relevant expertise in the in-
 Labr  leaders blame the Government for allowing private companies to act con-
 trary to the Labor Code and expect the problem to continue until the Ministry of
 Labor is reorganized to make it more efficient. They criticize the Ministry for not
 enforcing the Lbor Code, for taking too long to make decisions, and for being timid
 and indifferent to workers' needs. Under a November 1995 Memorandum of Under-
 sanding between the Ministry of Labor and the Office of the United States Trade
 Representative, which called for greater enforcement of the Honduran Labor Code,
 the Ministry has made significant progress toward enforcing the code. The Ministry
 has increased its inspections of the maquiladoras and the training of its inspectors;
 however, it does not yet adhere completely to international labor standards. Along
 with other Central American nations, the Government in August agreed to fund a
 pregram to modernize the inspection and labor management functions of the Min-
 istry of Labor.
 TeLabor Code clearly prohibits blacklisting; nevertheless, there was credible evi-
 dence that informal black listing occurred in the privately owned industrial parks.
 When unions are formed, organizers must submit a list of initial members to the
 Minmistry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. Before offi-
 cial recognition is granted, however, the Ministry must inform the company of the
 impending union organization. The Ministry has not always been able to provide ef-
 fective protection to workers. There were credible reports that, particularly in the
 EPZ sector, some inspectors had gone so far as to sell the names of employees in-
 volved in forming a union to companies that then dismissed union organzers before
 the Ministry could recognize the unions. There also was credible evidence that mili-
 tary intelligence maintained files on union activists.
 c. Prohibtion of Forced or Compulsor  Labor.-The Constitution and the law pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor, and this applies equally to children. Although there
 were no official reports of such practices in the area of child labor, there were credi-
 ble allegations of compulsory overtime at EPZ plants, particularly for women, who
 constitute an estimated 80 percent of the work force in the maquiladora sector.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practces and Minimum Age for Employrent.-The Con-
 stitution and the Labor Code prohibit the employment of minors under the age of
 16, except that a child who is 15 years of age is permitted to work with the permis-
 sion of its parents and the Ministry of Labor. The new Children's Code prohibits
 a child of 14 years of age or less from working, even with parental permission, and
 establishes prison sentences of 3 to 5 years or individuals who allow children to
 work illegally. An employer who legally hires a 15-year-old must certify that the
 child has finished or is inishing his compulsory schooling. The Ministry of Labor
 grants a number of work permits to 15-yearolds each year.
 The Ministry of Labor cannot effectively enforce child labor laws, except in the
 maquiladora sector, and violations of the Labor Code occur frequently in rural areas
 and in small companies. Many children work on small family farms, as street ven-
 dors, or in small workshops to supplement the family income. According to the Min-
 istry of Labor, human rights groups, and organizations for the protection of chil-
 dren, the most significant chid labor problem s in the construction industry.
 The employment of children under the legal working age in the maquiladora sec-
 tor may occur, but not on a large scale. (Younger children sometimes obtain working
 permits or purchase forged permits containing the Labor Ministry's letterhead.) The
 
 
 565
 maquiladoras in recent years have raised their minimum employment age, and
 some now hire only at age 18 or above.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1995 the Government decreed a 25 percent
 increase in the minimum wage. Daily pay rates vary by geographic zone and the
 sector of the economy affected; urban workers earn slightly more than workers in
 the countryside. The lowest minimum wage occurs in the agricultural sector, where
 it ranges from $1.92 to $2.31 (25 to 30 lempiras) per day, depending on whether
 the employer has more than 15 employees; the highest minimum wage is $3.05
 (39.65 lempiras) per day in the export sector. All workers are entitled to the equiva-
 lent of an additional month's salary in June and December of each year.
 The Constitution and the Labor Code stipulate that all labor be fairly paid, but
 the Ministry of Labor lacks the staff and other resources for effective enforcement.
 Even after three annual increases, the minimum wage is considered insufficient to
 provide a standard of living above the poverty line for a worker and family. Labor
 leaders said that the Government was ignoring workers earning above the minimum
 wage (for example, those in the maquiladoras and in other industries, such as bank-
 ing), and called for an across-the-board increase of 35 percent that they claimed
 would benefit all workers.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour workday and a 44-hour workweek. There
 is a requirement of at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days.- The Labor Code
 provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year, and of 20 workdays after
 4 years. However, employers frequently ignored these regulations due to the high
 level of unemployment and underemployment and the lack of effective enforcement
 by the Labor Ministry.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws,
 but does not do so effectively. Although fewer than in previous years, some com-
 plaints alleged the failure of foreign factory managers to comply with the occupa-
 tional health and safety aspects of Labor Code regulations in factories located in the
 EP's and private industrial parks. There is no provision allowing a worker to leave
 a dangerous work situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
