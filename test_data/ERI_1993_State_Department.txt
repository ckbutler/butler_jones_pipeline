 ERITREA
 Following a U.N.-supervised referendum in April-in which Eritreans voted over-
 whelmingly for independence from Ethiopia-Eritrea became an independent State
 on May 24 with a single party. The dominating political and military force in the
 long struggle for independence and in the Government is President Isaias Afwerki
 and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). The Government, formerly
 known as the Provisional Government of Eritrea, has actually been in de facto con-
 trol of the country since May 24, 1991, when EPLF forces entered Asmara in the
 culminating battle against the Ethiopian army of then dictator Colonel Mengistu.
 The EPLF Government has announced that it intends to introduce a democratic,
 multiparty system, embodied in a new constitution, in approximately 4 years. It has
 begun to develop interim institutions, including a National Legislative Assembly
 (see Section 3). In 1993 it held local elections in all provinces-involving multiple
 candidates but no parties, established local legislative bodies based on those elec-
 tions, and in October formed a commission to begin work on preparing a new con-
 stitution. There is no interim constitution.
 The EPLF forces, which in 1992 comprised over 100,000 regulars, continued to
 serve as the main internal security force in 1993 and also served as the recruiting
 ground for the new police force being organized. A striking feature in 1993 was the
 virtual absence of security forces in the main cities. There were no reports of human
 rights abuses by these forces.
 The Eritrean economy, decimated by years of war, is based on subsistence agri-
 culture, in which 95 percent of the population is engaged. Poor rains and insect in-
 festation produced a notably bad harvest in 1993. The commercial (wage) sector is
 small and largely centered in Asmara, the capital, and the Red Sea ports of
 Massawa and Assab, through which most of Ethiopian imports and exports pass.
 With donor assistance, one of the Government's major reconstruction efforts is to re-
 build the port of Massawa, which was badly damaged by Mengistu's air force in the
 war. As Ethiopia is now landlocked, the Government assured-as part of an under-
 standing with the Transitional Government of Ethiopia-that it would not impede
 Ethiopian access to these ports.
 The Government generally respected human rights in 1993. The April referendum
 process was free and fair. During the year, the Government began to release many
 of the persons it had been holding for months for alleged human rights violations
 committed during the Mengistu period. In September it amnestied 260 prisoners in
 this category and reduced sentences for others. At the end of the year, it continued
 to hold approximately 137 persons for alleged past violations. It also held in deten-
 tion about 50 persons who were being investigated for association with radical Is-
 lamic political elements or terrorist organizations.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances in 1993. However
 there was international concern for the whereabouts of several officials of the armed
 opposition Eritrean Liberation Front-Revolutionary Council (ELF-RC) who were al-
 leged to have been abducted from Sudan in April 1992 and secretly detained in Eri-
 trea.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There have been no reports of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment, including in prisons, where physical conditions appear to be acceptable, and
 families have good access to prisoners. As far as is known, the political detainees
 mentioned in Section 1.d. were not mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Code presently in force is
 the Code used by previous governments of Ethiopia. Criminals are generally held
 without bail until their cases are heard, which usually is within 60 days of arrest.
 Since its advent to power in 1991, the EPLF has detained, without charge or trial,
 several categories of people: Those associated with the past Mengistu regime in Eri-
 trea who are suspected of human rights violations; persons associated with Muslim
 fundamentalism; and non-Eritreans who have been detained by internal security
 forces for association with political or terrorist organizations. There was very little
 information available on the latter category.
 In the first category, the Government initiated in September an amnesty program,
 releasing over 260 persons suspected of violations during the Mengistu regime in
 Eritrea. At the end of the year, the Government still held approximately 137 per-
 sons for past violations and gave no indication when these persons would be brought
 to trial. According to credible reports, the Government released some ELF-RC mem-
 bers. Although it is possible that additional ELF-RC members are being held, none
 of those released reported the names of others being held, nor did they report phys-
 ical abuse.
 The Government is carefully balanced to reflect the virtually even composition of
 the population between Muslims and Christians and is sensitive to outside efforts
 to influence this even division. For most of 1993, it detained without charge three
 Eritreans who returned from neighboring countries sponsored by religious or politi-
 cal entities in those countries to propagate political Islam. These persons were still
 detained at year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The current civil law system, borrowed from Ethi-
 opia, is derived from the Napoleonic Code. Serious crimes are brought before a panel
 of three judges in a public trial, where defendants have access to legal counsel. If
 the defendant is found guilty and wishes to appeal, he or she may appeal to the
 next highest court, the Court of Appeals. This Court, from which there is no further
 appeal, is composed of five judges. Crimes committed by members of the military
 are handled by military courts. Security cases, of which there are few, were not
 brought to trial.
 There are magistrate courts in the major cities. There are no special courts. The
 system suffers from a lack of trained personnel, legal resources, and infrastructure.
 The judiciary appears to be independent of the Government in most regular civil
 and criminal cases.
 Since the population is largely rural, traditional "courts" play a major role in the
 life of the citizens. Many local issues, e.g., property disputes, and most petty crimes
 are adjudicated by local elders according to custom or, in the case of Muslims, the
 Koran. These traditional courts have not given sentences involving physical punish-
 ment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Criminal Code, warrants are required to monitor mail, telephones, or other
 means of communication. While this restriction in the past has often been imper-
 fectly observed, there were no reports in 1993 of such surveillance or of entering
 of homes to conduct searches. Technical limitations on security services and lack of
 necessity for such operations also contribute to the absence of surveillance activities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-People spoke freely in 1993, and, in open public
 meetings with President Isaias, persons expressed concern over various issues, in-
 cluding increased taxes, bureaucratic slowness, and return of refugees from Sudan.
 The President responded verbally at that time and in print over a period of weeks
 thereafter.

 The small press, consisting of a biweekly newspaper (in Tigrinya and Arabic), is
 government financed and controlled and covers such subjects as government policies
 and the return of property confiscated by the former regime. It does not criticize the
 President or his Government. At the end of the year, the Government was still pre-
 paring a press law in concert with the drafting of the constitution. The question of
 a privately owned, independent newspaper di not arise in 1993, largely because it
 was not yet commercially feasible. Foreign newspapers and publications entered the
 countr without hindrance.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-No permits are required for
 public meetings or demonstrations. There appear to be no restrictions on the forma-
 tion of nongovernmental organizations, although the Government's permission is re-
 quired, andthere are long bureaucratic delays in granting these permits.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is religious freedom throughout Eritrea. All de-
 nominations and faiths are permitted to practice. There is no state religion, and no
 religion is supported over another. Religious groups may train clergy and children
 of the laity and may and do produce their own religious periodicals in their own
 langage.
 Pevious regimes did not allow the Jehovah's Witnesses to practice publicly. How-
 ever, under the present Government, they are allowed full freedom of worship.
 There is still some animosity between members of the population and Jehovah s
 Witnesses c',er the latter's refusal to recognize certain state symbols and functions.
 This animosity surfaced in May after Witnesses publicly stated that, on religious
 grounds, they would not vote in the independence referendum. In several incidents,
 small crowds verbally attacked and stoned Jehovah's Witnesses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law, all persons, Eritrean and foreign, may travel freely within Eri-
 trea and abroad without interference or permit. However, in practice, the Govern-
 ment maintained a restrictive policy concerning the return of up to 400,000 Eritrean
 refugees from Sudan, based on its asserted need for large-scale donor assistance to
 facilitate organized repatriation. The Government claims that some tens of thou-
 sands of such refugees have returned spontaneously. By year's end, it appeared the
 Government was considering a pilot repatriation and reintegrationproject for some
 10,000 refugees in Sudan, using funds pledged at a July donor's conference.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Government has promised to introduce multiparty democracy within 4
 years, citizens did not have this right in 1993. Under President Isaias, the EPLF
 controls the Government, and in 1993 it began to develop interim political institu-
 tions. To this end, the Government held local elections--involving multiple can-
 didates but no parties-in all 10 provinces each for local legislatures. In turn, the
 provincial legislatures sent three members, one of whom had to be a woman, to the
 National Legislative Assembly. Those elected in the provinces were, in general, el-
 ders and notables from the region. Voting in all provincial elections was by secret
 ballot. Senior government officials expressed disappointment regarding the lack of
 women and young candidates and the low voter turnout of approximately 55 per-
 cent.
 The National Legislative Assembly is composed of approximately 137 members
 and met for the first time in September. In addition to the female members of the
 regional delegations, 10 additional places for women are reserved in the National
 Assembly, thus assuring 20 seats for women (see also Section 5.a.). To date Presi-
 dent Isaias and the EPLF wield full power, although the National Assembly osten-
 sibly is to be responsible ultimately for the passage of laws.
 The Government is almost equally divided between Muslim and Christian with
 Muslims holding at year's end seven Ministries, including that of Foreign Affairs,
 and many sensitive provincial governor positions. In addition to the positions in the
 new legislative bodies, women hold senior positions in the Government, including
 in the Ministry of Justice, as well as certain senior positions in the military.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is a local human rights organization, the Regional Committee for Human
 Rights Development, which was in the process of obtaining recognition at the end
 of 1993. This organization is independent from the Government, but it was too early
 to tell how effective it would be in publicizing human rights abuses. The Ministries
 of Foreign Affairs and Interior handle human rights inquiries.
 The Government responds quickly to international inquiries about alleged human
 rights abuses, maintaining that it has not committed such abuses. During a trip to
 
 
 Eritrea in August, former President Carter presented the Government with a list
 of names of alleged detainees. The Government responded the next day.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There were no reported instances of official discrimination against any Eritrean
 because of race, religion, sex, disability, or social status.
 Women.-The Government has taken a consistently strong stand in favor of im-
 proving the status of women and including them in the political process (see Section
 3). In part, this stems from the important role Eritrean women played in the war
 (one-third of the EPLF fighters were women). In 1991 the then Provisional EPLF
 Government codified a broad range of rights for women, including guarantees of
 equal educational opportunity, land ownership, equal pay for equal work, legal sanc-
 tions against domestic violence, and other economic and legal rights. A part of the
 EPLF, the National Union of Eritrean Women, has been in the vanguard in cam-
 paigns against such traditional practices as female genital mutilation (see Children
 elow).
 Despite the strong policy positions of the Government, there are some elements
 of traditional discrimination against women in Eritrean culture. Women perform
 significant amounts of farm labor and almost all child-rearing. In schools, females
 are less obvious in lower grades than are males. This disparity is even more visible
 in predominantly rural Muslim areas. Notwithstanding strong pressure from Mus-
 lim clergy, the Government supports school attendance by Muslim females. Exact
 figures are not available, but a countrywide ratio of two boys in class for each girl
 is approximately correct.
 Domestic violence is not widespread. Wife-beating is the exception, not the rule,
 according to health officials and doctors. Police rarely intervene in such instances,
 and formal court cases are rare. Incidents of domestic violence are usually resolved
 through traditional processes at village level.
 Children.-There is little formal government commitment to children's human
 rights and welfare, as expressed in laws or established programs. Cbild welfare is
 not generally looked on as a serious social problem. There are few govrr'rment funds
 devoted to this issue.
 The Government has taken a strong stand against female genital mutilation (cir-
 cumcision) which is condemned by international health experts as damaging to both
 physical and psychological health. Nevertheless, it continues to be practiced in Eri-
 trea and is usually performed at an early age. Health officials suggest that the expe-
 riences of the civil war, in which many young women left their families to serve in
 the Eritrean forces, have contributed to educating women against this practice. (Be-
 fore the separation of Eritrea, an internatiional health expert estimated that 90 per-
 cent of the girls/women in Ethiopia had undergone this procedure.)
 People with Disabilities.-As a result of the recent extremely bloody civil war,
 there are thousands of disabled male and female former fighters. The Government
 expends large amounts for their care. Most physically disadvantaged Eritreans are
 viewed as heroes and are widely assisted by other citizens, as are those disabled
 for other reasons. There are no laws mandating access for the disabled to public
 buildings, although assistance is generally provided for those who need it. There is
 no discrimination in employment or education against people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under Proclamation Number 8 of the transitional
 labor laws of Eritrea, workers have the legal right to form unions. There are no gov-
 ernment restrictions on this right, and indeed the Government encourages labor as-
 sociation, but worker organization is only in its earliest stages. Approximately 95
 percent of the population is involved in subsistence agriculture, and only a minus-
 cule number of people work in commercial or government ente rprises. The Govern-
 ment is the largest employer, including in the few state-ownedenterprises. There
 have been few pressures 'or unionization, given the heavy competition among the
 large number of unemployed and still larger number of underemployed workers for
 the few wage jobs available.
 The most important "union" in Eritrea is a government-dominated union which
 seeks to represent worker rights in such areas as illegal firings and nonpayment
 of wages. It does not generally become involved in such traditional labor union is-
 sues as wage negotiations and working conditions.
 There were no strikes in 1993. The proposed new labor code will allow strikes.
 Eritrea became a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1993.
 
 
 In view of the limited state of worker organization, the question of Eritrean labor
 affiliation with international labor organizations has not yet arisen. None of the Eri-
 trean unions has joined the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While labor has the theoreti-
 cal right-but not yet the legal right-to organize and bargain collectively, such col-
 lective bargaining does not take place as a practical matter. The Government sets
 wages and working conditions. Because of the relative weakness of the organized
 labor movement and the high rate of unemployment, collective bargaining and simi-
 lar legal protections, such as protection against antiunion discrimination, have yet
 to be established.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-While there is no legal prohibition
 inplace, there is no forced or compulsory labor in Eritrea.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18, although apprentices may be hired at age 14. While the Commission
 on Social Welfare is responsible for enforcement, there is no random inspection of
 factories and shops for compliance. The number of children under 18 years old work-
 ing in commercial enterprises is small, given the high rate of adult unemployment.
 However, children at an early age help on family farms, and there are a few chil-
 dren selling small wares on the street, such as cigarettes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The free market determines the level of wages,
 and there is no legal minimum wage in Eritrea. While there is no legal provision,
 all employees receive at least 1 day of rest per week, and most receive 1 2 days of
 rest per week. There are no occupational health and safety laws 'or standards cur-
 rently in force.
