 CHILE
 Chile is a multiparty democracy with a Constitution which provides for a strong
 executive, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Approved by ref-
 erendum in 1980, the Constitution was written under the former military govern-
 ment and establishes institutional limits on popular rule. President Eduardo Frei
 leads the Christian Democratic party, which, in coalition with five other parties,
 won the 1994 elections. The National Congress comprises 120 deputies and 46 sen-
 ators. The government coalition holds a majority in the lower house. An opposition
 coalition, together with several independent and eight appointed senators, controls
 the upper chamber. Appointees of the former President, General Augusto Pinochet,
 continue to influence the constitutionally independent judicial branch. However,
 turnover in the courts has led to a steady diminution of that influence.
 The armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the President through an ap-
 pointed Minister of Defense but enjoy a large degree of legal autonomy. Most nota-
 bly, the President must have the concurrence of the National Security Council to
 remove service chiefs. The Carabineros (the uniformed police) have primary respon-
 sibility for public order and safety and border security. The civilian Investigations
 Police are responsible for criminal investigations and immigration control. Both or-
 ganizations-although formally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense,
 which determines their budget-are under operational control of the Minister of In-
 terior. The security forces committed a number of instances of human rights abuses.
 Some alleged perpetrators of human rights abuses during the military regime re-
 main on active duty in the army.
 The market-based economy experienced its 12th consecutive year of expansion.
 The most important export was copper; forestry products, fresh fruit, fish meal, and
 manufactured goods were also significant sources of foreign exchange. Gross domes-
 tic product grew more than 6 percent, unemployment declined to 5.4 percent, and
 inflation fell for the fifth consecutive year to under 8 percent. These factors have
 contributed to an improved standard of living, although the disparity in income dis-
 tribution leaves 28 percent of the population below the poverty line. According to
 the most recent figures (1994), there were over 400,000 fewer people living below
 the poverty level than in 1992. Annual per capita income has risen to $4,500.
 During the year there were few new cases of human rights abuse. The Govern-
 ment generally respected its citizens' human rights. However, there continued to be
 some problem areas. The most serious cases involve instances of police brutality.
 Members of the police forces have been charged by some local human rights activ-
 ists with excessive use of force leading to extrajudicial killings. There continue to
 
 
 355
 be reports of physical abuse in jails and prisons; military authorities continue to re-
 sist disclosing abuses from the past. Discrimination and violence against women,
 and violence against children are problems. Many indigenous people remain
 marginalized.
 Almost all other human rights concerns are related to abuses that occurred during
 the former military government, primarily between 1973 and 1978. In May the Su-
 preme Court upheld the convictions and sentences of retired General Manuel
 Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza for instigating the 1976 murders in the
 United States of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Leteler and his U.S. citi-
 zen assistant Ronni Moffitt. Contreras was the chief of DINA, the intelligence
 branch of the army during the military regime. These 2 prisoners were later joined
 by 10 other former officials of the military government convicted for a variety of
 human rights abuses. Efforts to uphold justice in the cases dating back to the early
 years of the military Government are limited by the conflicting requirements for us-
 tice and national reconciliation. In particular, the courts continue to struggle with
 the application of the 1978 amnesty law to cases that occurred during the first 5
 years of military rule. The judicial system continues to investigate, with mixed suc-
 cess, a number of other pending human rights cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 One individual was killed while in the custody of the police. The Committee for
 the Defense of the Peoples' Rights (CODEPU) reports that at least eight other indi-
 viduals died as a result of the excessive use of force by the Carabineros against
 criminals or suspects fleeing the scene of a crime or resisting arrest. These deaths
 received wide media coverage, and a majority of the cases are under investigation
 by the courts. The courts sentenced one police official to 5 years in jail for killing
 a woman in 1992 while under the influence of alcohol.
 Several landmark decisions were made during the year on cases which occurred
 under the military regime. In the most widely recognized case, the Supreme Court
 upheld on May 30 Justice Adolfo Banados' sentencing of Retired General Manuel
 Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza to 7- and 6-year prison terms, respectively,
 as the intellectual authors of the 1976 murder in Washington, D.C. of former Chil-
 ean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and his U.S. citizen assistant, Ronni Moffitt.
 Brigadier Espinoza surrendered in June to the authorities to begin his sentence.
 After legal attempts to avoid being moved to prison were rejected by the courts,
 Contreras was finally transferred on October 20 to the high-security Punta Peuco
 prison (see Section 1.c.), joining Brigadier Espinoza as the second military officer to
 be jailed for actions taken during the 17 years of military rule. Contreras' move to
 a naval hospital attracted international attention and set off a vigorous domestic de-
 bate concerning the equality of military officers under the law.
 In December the Supreme Court closed the investigative phase of the 1976 mur-
 der of Carmelo Soria, a Spanish citizen employed by the United Nations. All that
 remains is for the judge to decide whether or not to apply the 1978 Amnesty Law
 to this case or to convict the two ex-agents of the National Intelligence Center
 (CNI), the successor to DINA, who were indicted in June as author and accomplice
 in this crime. The difficulty in this case lies in the possibility that Soria, as a U.N.
 employee, may have enjoyed international protected person status and, if so, the
 case cannot be covered by the 1978 law.
 In October the Supreme Court applied the Amnesty Law to the case of the deten-
 tion and disappearance of two Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) members,
 Barbara Uribe and Edwin van Yurik. Authorities released ex-DINA agent Osvaldo
 Romo and dismissed charges against him. The two MIR members had been detained
 by the security forces in July 1974 and are now presumed dead. The sister of Bar-
 bard Uribe has requested that the case be extended to cover three more officials
 that were possibly involved in this crime. The appeals court is expected to apply the
 Amnesty Law to the 1974 murder of MIR activist Lumi Videla.
 The Supreme Court review of the case involving the 1982 murder of Tucapel Ji-
 menez is still in the preliminary hearing stage. In August the appellate court of La
 Serena (a city to the north of Santiago) ruled that retired army Major Carlos Her-
 rera (defendant in the Tucapel Jimenez case) and ex-Carabinero noncommissioned
 officer Armando Cabrera were guilty of unnecessary violence in 1984 which resulted
 in the death of the political militant Mario Fernandez. Fernandez was arrested and
 tortured to death while in the custody of CNI. The Government will pay his family
 100 million pesos ($263,000). The two ex-security agents, who are currently under
 
 
 356
 military detention, were sentenced to 10 and 6 years' imprisonment, respectively.
 These men are also facing charges of murder in another case dating from the mili-
 tarv regime.
 After more than 8 years and three previous refusals to consider the case, the mili-
 tary courts decided that the June 1987 deaths from the so-called "Operation Alba-
 nia were homicides. In that incident CNI agents killed 12 people connected to the
 Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FMN). At the time, the authorities claimed that
 all 12 died in shoot-outs with security officers, and therefore no crime was commit-
 ted. This decision to declare the deaths to be homicides will allow the case to be
 brought before the civilian courts. The lawyer in the case requested a special judge.
 Twenty-eight former officers and enlisted men are implicated in this case.
 The last appeal of arm catain Pedro Fernandez was denied by the Supreme
 Court on December 6. He a    een found guilty of the death by burning of Rodrig
 Rojas and the serious disfigurement of Carmen Gloria Quintana in July 1986. He
 has been sentenced to 600 days in prison and will be sent to Punta Peuco prison
 in the near future.
 In November the Supreme Court sentenced 15 ex-Carabinero officers and 1 civil-
 ian for the abduction and murder of 3 Communists in 1985. Five were sentenced
 to life imprisonment; the others received sentences ranging from 15 years to 41
 days. Eight of the officers have been transferred to Punta Peuco prison.
 Retired Carabinero captain Hector Diaz was transferred to Punta Peuco prison on
 December 13, where he will serve a sentence of 3 years and 1 day. Diaz was con-
 victed by the military courts for the death of the Socialist student Carlos Godoy.
 The youth had been detained for questioning by the Carabineros and subsequently
 died during interrogation.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The major human rights controversy of 1995 involved past "disappearances" and
 efforts by all political forces and the Government to reinterpret the 1978 Amnesty
 in such a way as to achieve both justice and national reconciliation. As interpreted
 under the so-called "Aylwin Doctrine" (named after former President Patricio
 Aylwin), the courts should not close a case involving a disappearance (those who dis-
 appeared are considered to have been "kidnaped") until either the bodies are found
 or credible evidence is provided to indicate that an individual is dead. This could
 affect up to 542 cases which cover about 1,100 persons still classified as "detained
 or missing" from the early years of the military regime. The application of the
 Aylwin Doctrine, however, has been uneven, as some courts (mostly military) contin-
 ued the previous practice of applying the 1978 Amnesty to disappearances without
 conducting an investigation to identify the perpetrators. Fourteen cases were closed
 this year though application of the amnesty, 186 cases are active, and an additional
 356 cases are temporarily closed but subject to being reopened.
 In a surprise decision, the Supreme Court decided unanimously on December 5
 not to apply the Amnesty Law in the case of two Mapuche peasants who were de-
 tained by security forces in 1974 and never seen again. Two ex-Carabineros and one
 civilian were given sentences of 4 and 2 years in prison, plus fines of approximately
 $12,000 (5 million pesos) each for the abduction of the 16- and 39-year-old men. This
 is tle first time a disappearance case was declared outside the 1973-78 limits of
 the Amnesty Law. The decision declared that the abductions were permanent
 "criminal offenses that continue after the actions themselves," thus beyond the time
 period covered by the amnesty.
 Four disappearance cases that were closed with the fate of the victims still un-
 known have been appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of
 the Organization of American States, where they were still pending at years end.
 Some progress has been made in locating a number of those who disappeared. By
 the end of the year, 100 of 125 bodies that had been buried in an unmarked grave
 were identified. It was determined that they died in 1973 during the first months
 of the military regime. The remains of three bodies were discovered in early Decem-
 ber on the grounds of a military camp situated 25 miles north of Santiago. The iden-
 tities of the deceased have yet to be determined, but it is fairly certain that they
 perished about 20 years ago. It is widely suspected that the 3 are part of the 1,100
 victims from the 1973-78 period. The Supreme Court denied a request for a special
 prosecutor to determine the facts of the case; therefore, it remains in the hands of
 the military authorities. There are suspicions that a large number of bodies were
 buried in military precincts, but the military authorities refuse access to these
 areas thus preventing the possible closure of a number of these cases.
 c. ortre and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids "the use of illegal pressure" on detainees, but CODEPU
 has received reports of instances of mistreatment and abuse by some Carabinero
 and Investigations Police units. CODEPU lawyers visit detainees during their inter-
 
 
 357
 gation (see Section l.d.) and represent many suspected terrorists in court.
 CODEPU alleged that during a 1  year period that ended in August, there were
 38 cases of torture by Carainers, 11 by members of the Investigations Police, and
 2 by meber of other entities.
 The Minister of Interior normally asks the courts to conduct independent inves-
 tigations of credible complaints of police abuse, but such investigations rarely result
 in arrests, due in part to the reluctane of judges, many ofthem      ted by the
 to pursue the issue vigorously. However, as iicated in the
 authorities often impose administrative sanctions on abusive
 officers without waiting for a judicial ruling.
 Prisons are overcrowded and antiquated, but the conditions are not life threaten-
 ing. Food meets minimal nutritional needs and prisoners may supplement the diet
 by buying food. Those with sufficient funds can often rent spae in a better wing
 of the prison. Although prison guards have been accused of using excessive force to
 stop attempted prison breaks, the guards generally behave responsibly and do not
 mistreat prisoners.
 The maximum security prison houses 81 prisoners, most of them charged with or
 convicted of terrorism. Prisoners continue to complain that strict security measures,
 prohibition on visitors, hidden cameras, and the extremely rigid regulations violate
 their rights.
 In June a new prison at Punta Peuco 25 miles north of Santiago, was completed.
 At year's end it had 12 inmates including Brigadier Pedro Espinoza and recently
 arrived retired General Manuel Contreras (see Section L.a.). This prison was con-
 structed specifically for government and military officials sentenced to jail and re-
 portedly would allow for privileged and exclusive treatment for these prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution allows civilian and mili-
 tary courts to order detention for up to 5 days without arraignment and to extend
 the detention for up to 10 days of suspected terrorists. The law affords detainees
 30 minutes of immediate and daily access to a lawyer (in the presence of a prison
 guard) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. The law does not permit
 a judge to deny such access; police authorities generally observed these require-
 ments.
 As of February, 9 percent of the general prison population were under investiga-
 tion but not charged with a crime, 50 percent were charged with an offense and
 were awaiting trial or sentencing, and 41 percent were serving sentences. The police
 have the authority to make arrests based on suspicion, particularly of youth in high
 crime areas late at night. In practice, the detainees are not promptly advised of
 charges against them, nor are they granted a speedy hearing before a judge. The
 Constitution provides for the right to legal counsel, but this is a fact only for those
 who can afford to pay. The poor, who account for the majority of cases, may be rep-
 resented by law students doing practical training (who are often overworked) or, on
 occasion, by a court appointed lawyer. Arrest procedures do not require police to
 allow detainees to telephone relatives or lawyer. The Constitution allows judges to
 set bail.
 There were no cases of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for a judicial system inde-
 pendent of the other branches of Government. Cases decided in the lower courts can
 be referred to the appeals courts, and ultimately to the Supreme Court. Although
 the judiciary, and particularly the Supreme Court, has been dominated by ap-
 pointees of the former military regime, the passage of time is changing this legacy.
 Criminal court judges are appointed for life, and appointments to the Supreme
 Court and the appeals courts are made by the President from lists prepared by the
 Supreme Court. The Supreme Court continues to work with the other branches of
 Government on broad judicial reform.
 The jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to cases involving military officers.
 If formal charges are filed in civilian courts against a military officer, including
 Carabineros, the military prosecutor asks, and the Supreme Court normally grants,
 jurisdiction to the military. This is of particular consequence in the human rights
 cases dating from 1973 to 1978, the period covered by the 1978 Amnesty Law.
 Based on the Napoleonic Code, the judicial system does not provide for trial by
 jury, nor does it assume innocence until proven otherwise. Criminal proceedings are
 inquisitorial rather than adversarial.
 On November 7, Sergio Buschmann, an inmate of the high-security prison whom
 the Social Aid Foundation of Christian Churches (FASIC) nad counted as the one
 political prisoner, was released on bail. Buschman, a professional actor and ex-lead-
 er of the Marxist FPMR, was arrested in 1986 for his part in smuggling arms into
 the country. He subsequently escaped, went into exile, and became an international
 spokesman for the Communist cause. Buschmann returned to his home country to
 
 
 face charges in 1994. Claiming that he was unjustly imprisoned for political, instead
 of criminal offenses, Buschmann continued to be the object of much world-wide at-
 tention. CODEPU reports seven political prisoners: these individuals have been con-
 victed for crimes related to terrorist acts; some have appeals pending.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions. A new pri-
 vacy law, promulgated on November 20, bars obtaining and dissemination of infor-
 mation by undisclosed taping, telephone intercepts, and other surreptitious means.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.
 The press maintains its independence, criticizes the Government, and covers is-
 sues sensitive to the- military, including human rights. The new privacy law will
 also apply to the media, which are not exempt from its provisions (see Section 1.f.)
 There is academic freedom.
 The print and electronic media are largely independent of government control.
 The State is majority owner of La Nacion newspaper, but the newspaper is edi-
 torially independent. The Television Nacional network is state owned but not under
 direct government control. It receives no government subsidy and is self-financing
 through the sale of air time. It is editorially independent and is governed by a board
 of directors which, although politically appointed, encourages "pluralistic expres-
 sion" through the network.
 Military courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for defamation of
 military personnel and for sedition, but their rulings can be appealed to the Su-
 preme Court.
 A draft press law, building on one proposed by the Aylwin Government in 1993,
 would transfer cases involving freedom of speech (including charges of defamation
 and sedition) for nonmilitary personnel from military to civilian courts. As the bill
 moved from the House to the Senate, it remained the subject of considerable con-
 trversy, with press organs arguing that some of its provisions may undermine as-
 pects of freedom of expression (e.g., by mandating right of reply and limiting con-
 centration of media ownership).
 A former cabinet member was charged with defaming "state institutions" after he
 claimed that unidentified members of Congress used drugs. A Socialist Youth leader
 was also charged with defamation after publicly making derogatory remarks about
 public officials. It is a criminal offense in Chile to besmirch the honor of state insti-
 tutions and symbols, such as the Congress, the military services, the flag, and the
 President.
 The courts rarely issued orders prohibiting media coverage of cases in progress,
 although several instances were reported, usually in cases of violent crime. The law
 does not set any limits on a judges power to impose such prohibitions nor does it
 require the reasons for the ban to be cited. In a widely noted case involving charges
 against three Carabineros for robbery and other crimes, the judge banned the
 media, explaining that coverage might impair the ongoing investigation. The judge
 also asserted that journalism has become a kind of aid for delinquents, stating that
 it is unpleasant to work with such limited resources and to have that work further
 complicated by a right to information.
 A celebrated 1993 slander case against Francisco Martorell for his book "Diplo-
 matic Impunity" resurfaced when he was sentenced on five counts of slander against
 prominent figures. Martorell remains in self-imposed exile in Argentina.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and there have been no reports of violations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All denominations practice their faiths
 without restriction. A recent municipal ordinance made it illegal to cause disturb-
 ances in the streets, which has been interpreted by some evangelical groups as an
 attempt to prevent them from proselytizing and preaching in public. Although
 church and state are officially separate, the Roman Catholic Church receives official
 preferential treatment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. For minor children to leave the country, either
 alone or with one of their parents, they must have notarized permission from both
 parents.
 
 
 359
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chile is a constitutional democracy, and citizens have the right to change their
 government through periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens 18
 years of age and over. The current Government still operates under some political
 restraints that were imposed by the previous regime. Under the 1980 Constitution,
 various national institutions, including the President, the Supreme Court, and the
 armed forces-dominated National Security Council, appointed an additional nine
 senators (beyond those elected) to 8-year terms prior to the transition to democracy.
 In effect, these senators were hand-picked by General Pinochet, and they join with
 the opposition on most matters. The legislative branch, with the exception of the
 nine institutional senators, is freely elected and independent from the executive
 branch.
 The former military government wrote the 1980 Constitution and amended it
 slightly in 1989 after losing a referendum on whether President Pinochet should
 stay in office. It provides for a strong presidency and a legislative branch with lim-
 ited powers. In addition, the Constitution includes provisions designed to protect the
 interests of the military and the rightwing political opposition. These provisions, ac-
 cording to their defenders and even some critics, assured stability in the political
 process during the transition. Some of these provisions are characterized by the 1ov-
 ernment coalition as "authoritarian enclaves" left over from the previous regime;
 while the right of center opposition describes them as integral to the system of
 checks and balances. They include limitations on the President's right to remove
 service chiefs, including chief of the army (the position which General Pinochet can
 hold until 1998), an electoral system that gives a minority party (or coalition) dis-
 proportionate representation in Congress, and the provision for nonelected institu-
 tional senators.
 Women have had the right to vote in municipal elections since 1934 and in na-
 tional elections since 1949, and they are active in political life at the grassroots
 level. Women make up a majority of registered voters and of those who actually cast
 ballots, but there are few women in leadership positions. There are 9 women among
 the 120 deputies, 3 women among the 46 senators, and 3 women among the 21 cabi-
 net ministers.
 Chile's over 1 million indigenous people have the legal right to participate freely
 in the political process, although relatively few are politically active. While their
 participation has increased since the 1990 democratic transition, there is only one
 member of Congress of indigenous descent. In 1994 the Government created the Na-
 tional Corporation for Indigenous Development and placed it under the Planning
 Ministry, in 1995, indigenous people elected their representatives to this body.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Chilean Human Rights Commission is affiliated with the International
 League of Human Rights and continues to gather evidence of police abuses. The
 Committee for the Defense of the People's Rights (CODEPU) provides legal counsel
 to those accused of politically related crimes and to victims of human rights abuses.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) say that the Government has cooperated
 with their efforts to investigate accusations of continued human rights violations.
 Many international NGO's also continue to follow closely human rights issues.
 The National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation issued-a report in 1991
 which helpd many Chileans come to terms with human rights abuses under the
 miitary dovernnment. The successor to the Commission, the National Corporation
 for Compensation and Reconciliation, continues to investigate cases. In December its
 mandate was again extended to the end of 1996 to allow it to complete investiga-
 tions of the last of 2,188 individual cases of human rights abuses on which it has
 information. The corporation also provides compensation to family members of
 human rights victims.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law, but it does not specifically
 ban discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or social status. There are no laws
 preventing gays or lesbians from exercising freedom of speech or other rights. In
 practice, however, homosexuality is widely rejected by almost all segments of soci-
 ety.
 
 
 360
 
 Women.-The public is only beginning to apreciate the extent of abuses such as
 wife beating. The National Women's Service (SERNAM), created in 1991 to combat
 discrimination against women, found that 26.2 percent of women it surveyed said
 that they had been subjected to some form of physical violence by their husband
 or partner while another 33.5 percent reported some form of psychological abuse.
 However, only 16 percent reported such violence to the police. SERNAM is now con-
 ducting courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence
 for Carabineros, who are usually the first public officials to intervene in such inci-
 dents.
 Counseling is ordered by the courts for those involved in intrafamily violence.
 There were 3,297 cases reported to the Carabineros Family Affairs Unit in Santiago.
 In 151 of those cases, men claimed that they were abused by their spouses.
 Carabineros also reported that the Family Affairs Unit received more than 2,700
 complaints of rape or sexual abuse during the year.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist despite a decision in 1989 to ratify
 the U.N. Convention to Eliminate all Forms of biscrimination Against Women and
 to give human rights treaties to which Chile is a party precedence over local laws.
 The law permits legal separation, but not divorce, so those who wish to remarry
 need to seek annulments. Since annulment implies that a marriage never existed
 under the law, former wives are left with little recourse for financial support. Al-
 though a recent law created conjugal property as an option in a marriage, some
 women actually saw this as a step backward, since the law on separate property
 (which still exists) gives women the right to one-half their husbands' assets but
 gives husbands no rights to theirs.
 Another SERNAM study found that the average earnings of female heads of
 household are only 71 percent of those of male heads of household. Women with no
 schooling received a salary that was 87 percent of that of their male counterparts
 without schooling, while women heads of-household with university training earned
 only 57 percent as much as their male contemporaries. SERNAM has a pilot pro-
 gram providinig occupational training and child care in an effort to alleviate this
 form of discrimination.
 Children.-The Congress enacted a law that segregates juvenile offenders from
 adult prisoners. Although juvenile offenders (i.e. those under age 18) had long re-
 ceived special treatment in the courts, some of them had been incarcerated with
 adults. A survey by the National Minors Service (SENAME) indicated that sexual
 abuse of minors occurred but that few cases were reported. A United Nations Chil-
 dren's Fund (UNICEF) report shows that 34 percent of children under 12 experience
 serious physical violence, though only 3.2 percent of the victims of intrafamily vio-
 lence reported to the Carabineros Family Affairs Unit were minors below the age
 of 18. The new Law on Intrafamily Violence was designed in part to deal with this
 problem. UNICEF estimates that 107,616 children between 12 and 19 years of age
 were in the work force. The majority of these were males from single parent families
 who worked more than 40 hours per week and did not attend school.
 People With Disabilities.-Congress passed a law in 1994 to promote the integra-
 tion of people with disabilities into society, and the National Fund for the Handi-
 capped (FONDIS) has a $1.5 million budget. The 1992 census found that 288,000
 citizens said that they had some form of disability, but FONDIS estimates that the
 actual number is closer to 1 million. The disabled still suffer some forms of legal
 discrimination; for example, blind people cannot become teachers or tutors. Al-
 though the law now requires that new public buildings provide access for the dis-
 abled, the public transportation system does not make provision for wheelchair ac-
 cess, and even a new subway line under construction provides no facilitated access
 for the disabled. Reserved parking for the disabled is becoming more common.
 Indigenous People.-The Mapuches from southern Chile comprise over 90 percent
 of the indigenous population, but there are small Aimara, Atacameno, Huilliche,
 Rapa Nui, and Kawaskhar populations in other parts of the country. A committee
 composed of representatives of indigenous groups articipated in drafting the 1993
 law that recognized the ethnic diversity of the in igenous population and gave in-
 digenous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions.
 It provides for eventual bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations,
 and replaced a statute which emphasized assimilation of indigenous people. How-
 ever, out of the population which identifies itself as indigenous (nearly 1 million,
 according to the 1992 census), about half remain separated from the rest of society,
 largely because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. In fact,
 the ability of indigenous people to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cul-
 tures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources is marginal at best.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritie.-Chile assimilated a ma or European (mainly
 German) migration in the last century and a major Middle Eastern and Croatian
 
 
 migration in the early part of this century. Smaller racial and ethnic minority
 groups experience some intolerance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have a right to form unions without prior
 authorization and to join existing unions; 13.7 percent of the work force is orga-
 nized. A recently enacted law provides government employee associations with the
 same rights as trade unions, and the associations' committees have drafted imple-
 menting regulations. Only the police and military are not allowed to form umons.
 The 1992 Labor Code permits nationwide labor centrals, and the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT) the largest and most representative of them legalized its status in
 April 1992. CUT and many other labor confederations and federations maintain ties
 to international labor organizations. Unions are independent of the Government, but
 union leaders are usually elected from lists based on party affiliation and maintain
 ties to their parties.
 Reforms to the Labor Code in 1990 removed some significant restrictions on the
 right to strike, although others remain. For example employers may no longer fire
 striking workers without paying severance benefits. Employers must show cause to
 fire workers, but "needs of the company" is a permissible cause. Union leaders claim
 that some employers invoke this clause to fire employees who are attempting to
 form unions or who are active in collective bargaining. There are no statistics on
 the number of cases in which needs of the company have been invoked by employers
 to fire workers for prounion activities. However, such acts and antiunion discrimina-
 tion in general are illegal under the law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the climate for col-
 lective bargaining has improved since the return to democratic government in 1990,
 most workers continue to negotiate individual contracts. Employers say that this is
 due to the emphasis that workers put on individual performance, but union leaders
 say that the Labor Code prevents many sectors from organizing. Employers may
 also include a clause in individual employment contracts that some classes of em-
 ployees are not allowed to participate in collective bargaining, although this sup-
 posedly applies only to supervisory personnel. Employees may object to the inclusion
 of such clauses in their contracts and may appeal to the Ministry of Labor for their
 excision.
 The Ministry is able to arbitrate about half of the complaints it receives. Workers
 are free to take unarbitrated cases before the courts and, if they succeed in proving
 they were fired unjustly, the employer must pay the discharged employees twice
 their normal severance payment. There are no statistics avail able concerning the
 disposition of complaints of antiunion behavior. There are allegations that employ-
 ers fire workers for prounion activity and attempt to avoid a complaint by imme-
 diately paying them twice the normal severance pay.
 Temporary workers--defined in the Labor Code as agriculture, construction, port
 workers, and entertainers-may now form unions, but their right to collective bar-
 gaining remains dependent on employers agreeing to negotiate with unions of tem-
 porary workers. The Labor Code provides sanctions for unfair bargainng practices
 that protect workers from dismissal during the bargaining process, ut labor leaders
 claim that companies invoke the needs of the company clause to fire workers after
 a union has signed a new contract, particularly when negotiations result in a pro-
 longed strike.
 The same labor laws apply in the duty free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it is cur-
 rently practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law allows children between
 the ages of 15 and 18 to work with the expresspermission of their parents or guard-
 ians. Children 14 years old may also work legally with such permission, but in addi-
 tion they must have completed their elementary education, and the work involved
 may not be physically strenuous or unhealthy. Additional provisions in the law pro-
 tect workers under 18 years by restricting the types of work open to them (for exam-
 ple, they may not work in nightclubs) and by establishing special conditions of work
 Ithey may not work more than 8 hours in one day). Labor inspectors enforce these
 regulations and compliance is good in the formal economy. Many children are em-
 ployed in the informal economy, however, which is difficult to regulate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages, hours of work,
 and occupational safety and health standards. The legal workweek is 48 hours
 which can be worked in either 5 or 6 days. The maximum workday length is 10
 hours, but a few positions like caretakers and domestic servants are exempted. All
 workers enjoy at least one 24-hour rest period during the workweek save for work-

 ers at high altitudes who voluntarily exchange a workfree day each week for a num-
 ber of consecutive workfree days every 2 weeks.
 A tripartite committee comprisig government, employer, and labor representa-
 tives normally suggests a minimum wage based on projected future inflation and
 increases in productivity. Congress approved the Government's proposal with little
 dissent, setting the minimum monthly wage at about $149 (58,600 pesos), which
 came into effect in April. The minimum wage is adjusted annually. This wage is de-
 signed to serve as the starting wage for an unskilled laborer entering the labor force
 for the first time. About 8 percent of the work force earn the minimum wage.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors enforce laws covering working conditions. The Gov-
 ernment has increased resources for inspections and targeted industries guilty of
 the worst abuses. As a result, enforcement is improving, and voluntary compliance
 is fairly good. Insurance mutuals provide workmen's compensation and occupational
 safety training for the private and public sectors. They reported a 24-percent decline
 in occupational injuries over the past 5 years, although 11 percent of the work force
 still submitted claims. Workers who remove themselves from situations that endan-
 ger their health and safety have their employment protected, provided they ask a
 workers' delegate to bring the problem to the attention of labor inspectors.
