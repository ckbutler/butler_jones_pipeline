 JORDAN
 Under the leadership of King Hussein, Jordan has been
 politically stable in spite of its involvement in the
 Arab-Israeli conflict, its proximity to Israel and to
 potentially hostile Arab neighbors, and its large and rest-
 less Palestinian population. Faced with these internal
 and external challenges, the government has sometimes re-
 sorted to detention without trial.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The use of torture is probably rare and is not condoned
 by the government. We do not know-what disciplinary
 measures the government has taken against those accused
 of inflicting it.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Persons taken into custody may be subjected to rough treat-
 ment by their jailors. Cruel or degrading treatment or
 punishment is not officially sanctioned.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There is freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment
 except in periods of war or major internaL turmoil. Those
 arrested are usually arraigned within 24 ours.
 Under Jordan's 1955 defense law; the couniry-may be ruled
 by military edict in times of emergency. Such a state
 of emergency was last proclaimed in 1973 and is still in
 force. Under this edict, regular civilian courts con-
 tinue to operate; however, provincial gov-nors may
 arrest and bring to trial before a military tribunal any
 person considered to be a "threat to public order or the
 general security." During the widespread civil strife
 in 1970 when the Palestinian fedayeen challenged the Jor-
 danian Government, hundreds of people were taken into
 custody under the military edict. Amnesty International
 in 1976 claimed that 147 of the persons taken into cus-
 
 (371)
 
 
 372
 tody since 1970 were still being detained without trial,
 but noted in 1977 that at least 26 such persons were re-
 leased.
 A 1973 amnesty edict provided for the release of all
 political prisoners except those convicted of espionage.
 Similar amnesties have since been declared, including
 two in 1977. Such amnesties have been applied both to
 those actually convicted and those held without trial.
 Our information indicates that a greater number of people
 than recorded by Amnesty International were actually re-
 leased from detention without trial in 1977, including
 more than 20 Palestinian fedayeen. Amnestied individuals
 are often fully reinstated in their previous occupations,
 even within the government and armed forces. As part of
 their rehabilitation and as a means to assure loyalty,
 a few--including a leader of an abortive coup attempt--
 have been given positions of high responsibility and trust.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are provided under an independent
 judiciary. A parallel legal system of traditional Mus-
 lim religious laws and traditions functions alongside
 the judiciary established by the government. Many crimes,
 accidental deaths, and the equivalent of civil suits are
 settled in this traditional framework.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry of private homes by Jordanian authorities
 does not occur to our knowledge. Arrests are made in
 homes only on the authority of the equivalent of legal
 warrants.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Despite its lack of natural resources, Jordan since 1958
 has with comparatively few interruptions pursued economic
 and social development programs aimed at improving the
 welfare of its populace and attaining a viable economy
 by the 1980s. Although Jordan suffered serious setbacks
 to its economic development resulting from the 1967 war
 
 
 with Israel and the consequent loss of the West Bank, in
 the past few years the momentum of development has once
 again steadily increased. Jordan remains heavily.depenr
 dent upon external financial assistance. Heavy emphasis
 has been placed on water resources, reforestation, ex-
 pansion of agriculture, tourism, and development of man-
 power skills. Basic education is compulsory through the
 equivalent of the eighth grade, and all Jordanian citi-
 zens have access to higher educational and technical
 training, including scholarships abroad. These pro-
 grams have benefited not only East Bank Jordanians but
 also, particularly since 1967, those Palestinian refugees
 who have assimilated themselves into the Jordanian economy
 and society.
 An exception is the-status of Palestinian refugees living
 in camps supervised by the UN Relief and works Agency
 (UNRWA). UNRWA's resources have not kept pace with the
 needs for education and training, particularly for child-
 ren. The Government of Jordan helps significantly, but
 has given higher priority to programs for its own citizens.
 There is no official discrimination against women. Edu-
 cational, social, and economic opportunities are open to
 them. Some have reached high positions in the govern-
 ment, and some are moving into a variety of professions
 with success (e.g., a substantial number of women are in
 Jordan's Diplomatic Service.) Nonetheless, Jordan's
 society remains male-dominated.
 3. -Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The 1952 constitution guarantees the liberties of speech,
 press, religion and assembly. Jordan is a signatory to
 the Covenant on Political and Civil Rights and the Cove-
 nant on Economic and Social Rights.  There are no restric"
 tions on the right to worship. People in Jordan are in
 most instances free to express their opinions, but the
 state-controlled radio and TV system, and newspapers and
 periodicals which are subject to government influence,
 practice a form of self-censorship on key matters of
 
 
 374
 state. Criticism of the government's performance on dom-
 estic matters in-the media occurs fairly frequently, but
 is rarely vehement. The press generally adheres to the
 government's position on major foreign policy issues.
 Newspapers are occasionally closed down temporarily for
 printing articles of which the government strongly dis-
 approves. The government recently began encouraging
 greater press freedom.
 The right of assembly is restricted in certain respects;
 see 3c below.
 Jordan has an active, officially encouraged labor move-
 ment supervised by the government.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Jordanians, including Palestinians (who are eligible for
 travel documents on the same basis as other Jordanian
 citizens), are free to travel within the country except
 into military areas, and they may go abroad. They are
 allowed to emigrate freely.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Organized political opposition currently is not permitted.
 Thus the right of assembly is restricted. There is a
 parliament which includes both elected members and ap-
 pointees of the Crown. The Senate's thirty members are
 appointed; the sixty members of the Chamber of Deputies
 are elected. The current parliament was adjourned sine
 die by the King in 1976 and no parliament has subsequently
 been convened. Parliamentary elections have been post-
 poned for the indefinite future because it might prove
 impossible to elect representatives of the occupied West
 Bank.
 In accord with ancient Arab and particularly Bedouin tra-
 ditions, any citizen can petition for redress of grie-
 vances directly to the King. Written petitions are often
 thrust into the hands of the King when he appears in pub-
 lic. The halls of government are filled daily with ordi-
 nary citizens seeking assistance or redress.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Jordanian Government is sensitive to outside moni-
 toring or criticism of its policies with respect to
 human rights, which it views as an internal matter. Ve
 are unaware, however, of any effort on its part to in-
 hibit outside inquiries or studies of these policies.
 Amnesty International has made inquiries about human
 rights issues from time to time. Jordan has provided
 official explanations for allegations of human-rights
 violations, often in the form of denials; in 1977,
 Jordan released some people whose detention Amnesty
 International had protested.' Particularly since 1973,
 human rights practices have made steady improvement.
 Jordan supports international progress on human rights
 issues, and is willing to do so publicly.
