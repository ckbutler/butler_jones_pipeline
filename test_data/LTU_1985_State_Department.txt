 LITHUANIA*
 The largest of the three Baltic states which were independent
 between the two World Wars, Lithuania was annexed by the
 Soviet Union in 1940 as a constituent republic of the Soviet
 Union. The United States does not recognize the forcible
 incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 Lithuania is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 the republics in the Soviet Union.
 As in the other Baltic states, the standard of living in
 Lithuania is somewhat higher than in the Soviet Union.
 Agricultural and industrial production increased in 1985, but
 Soviet redistribution policies continued to force down
 Lithuanian living standards toward lower Soviet levels..
 Respect for human rights remained substandard in 1985, as.
 Soviet authorities continued their campaign against the Roman
 Catholic Church.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Lithuanian activists have on occasion died in Soviet
 custody, it is difficult to establish official responsibility
 for the deaths of persons involved in human rights
 activities. There were no reports of known political killing
 in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Political dissidents are frequently mistreated during
 interrogation or confinement in labor camp, prison, or
 psychiatric hospital. Persons accused of publishing or
 distributing underground publications receive harsh sentences,
 including prison, labor camp, exile, and psychiatric hospital,
 typically on the charge of "anti-Soviet agitation and
 propaganda."
 Lithuanian Helsinki Group member Victoras Petkus, imprisoned
 for human rights activities, has reportedly been in very bad
 health since doing a term in the labor camp prison in
 1983-84. There has been no direct news of Petkus since August
 1983.
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Lithuania,
 the systemic human rights abuses described in the report on
 the U.S.S.R. apply also to Lithuania. This report discusses
 only instances of repression specific to Lithuania.

 On August 22, Father Vaclovas Stakenas, a member of the
 Catholic Committee to Defend the Rights of Believers, was
 violently attacked by two unknown assailants and then thrown
 into a pond.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The provisions of Soviet law are so broadly worded that they
 have been used to prosecute persons exercising basic human
 rights.
 A Catholic activist, 79-year-old Vladas Lapienis was sentenced
 in March to 4 years' imprisonment for "fabrications
 denigrating the Soviet system." Lapienis, who had recently
 finished serving a prison sentence for contributing to the
 Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania, had written his
 memoirs of his time in a labor camp. It was evidently because
 of those memoirs that he was rearrested, tried, and convicted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, Communist Party control of society is
 exercised in political cases to negate constitutional
 guarantees of the objectivity and independence of the judicial
 process. The self-determined compelling needs of the State
 override the rights of a defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Through devices ranging from a network of informers to
 censorship of mail, electronic monitoring of telephones, and
 jamming of foreign radio broadcasts, government authorities
 have the ability to interfere in every aspect of personal
 life. Constitutional guarantees to the contrary, Soviet
 investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry and
 illegal searches. Contacts between Lithuanians and foreign
 visitors are strongly discouraged, and those who indulge in
 such contacts are subject to harassment by the authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom .of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties provided that their exercise accords with
 the strengthening and security of the "Socialist system". As
 is shown by the frequent imprisonment of religious leaders,
 human rights activists, and those involved in underground
 publications, Soviet officials show little respect for freedom
 of speech and press, Despite the authorities' complete
 control of the legal media and strict censorship, however,
 underground publications continue to be produced.
 Publications such as the Chronicle of the Catholic Church in
 Lithuania, Ausra (Dawn), Tautos Kelias (The Path of the
 Nation), Lietuvos Ateitis (Lithuania's Future), and
 Perspektyvos (Perspectives) appear regularly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to associate is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations.

 LITHUANIA
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Lithuania.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement
 might spread, this has been especially true in the Baltic
 states.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activity is
 subject to systematic harassment. Soviet authorities have
 apparently mounted a large-scale assault on religion.
 Reportedly, they are taking control of church committees and
 excluding priests from them. Because of governmental control
 over admissions to Lithuania's only theological seminary, the
 shortage of priests is such that 139 parishes are said to have
 no permanent priest. Children are harassed to deter them from
 attending church services. In school, the children of
 believers are sometimes forced to join atheist organizations
 or are punished for not joining them. Catholics attending
 religious festivities have been interrogated and physically
 abused, and historic shrines or artifacts have been
 desecrated.
 Because of difficult conditions created by government
 reprisals and threats, a group of the Lithuanian Catholic
 Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights decided it
 could no longer function publicly and has gone underground.
 In January 1985, Father Jonas Matulionas became the third
 prominent Committee member convicted by Soviet authorities.
 His colleagues, Fathers Alfonsas Svarinkas and Sigitas
 Tamkevicius, had been convicted in 1983 of anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda. Father Matulionas received 3 years
 in labor camp for "disrupting public order." The charge
 reportedly stemmed from his having led an All Saints Day
 procession to a cemetery, an illegal activity under
 restrictive Soviet religious regulations. Matulionas was
 released on June 19, 1985, apparently under the terms of the
 Amnesty Decree of June 5. He was, however, rearrested on June
 26. Relatives were told that he would not be retried but
 would simply serve out the previous sentence. No reason for
 the rearrest was given. A young Catholic student, Roman
 Zemaitis, was convicted with him and sentenced to 2 years in
 labor camp.
 The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania reported in
 July that two residents of Klaipeda named Murauskas and
 Jonulis were arrested in early 1985 and charged with "illegal
 trade." The two men reportedly were privately printing
 religious cards and texts for use during religious festivals.
 Despite these convictions and continuous Soviet attempts to
 suppress its activities, the Catholic Church in Lithuania
 remains an active and vigorous religious denomination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The right to travel has been restricted even further since
 1980. Many Lithuanians have family and personal ties with
 Poland. In past years, travel back and forth was relatively
 frequent. Since the emergence of the independent Solidarity
 
 
 1031
 LITHUANIA
 trade union movement in Poland in 1980, the Polish-Lithuanian
 border has been closed for extended periods. The importation
 of printed materials from Poland was sharply curtailed during
 1981. Soviet propaganda in Lithuania against the Solidarity
 union, designed to suppress the formation of a free labor
 movement in Lithuania, was particularly active.
 Emigration from Lithuania has virtually stopped during the
 past 2 years. Although many Lithuanians have close relatives
 abroad, Soviet authorities use various vague phrases, such as
 "against the interests of the State," in order to refuse to
 permit the reunification of families. The authorities try to
 deter people from emigrating by dismissal from employment,
 psychological harassment, and alteration of the procedures for
 exit visa applications. On the U.S. Government Representation
 List of Divided Families, there are currently six Lithuanian
 families who have been repeatedly refused permission to
 emigrate to the United States. Five residents of Lithuania
 are on the U.S. Government Representation List of American
 Citizens, dual nationals who have been denied permission to
 settle in the United States. One of them, Vytautas Skuodis, a
 member of the Lithuanian Helsinki Group, has been serving a
 sentence of 7 years in labor camp and 5 years in internal
 exile since 1980, in connection with his human rights
 activities. There are 82 families on the U.S. Government
 Representation List of Soviet Jews Who Have Been Denied
 Permission to Emigrate to Israel..
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, through its leaders
 in Moscow, directs and controls all political, economic,
 cultural, and social developments. It is defined in law as
 the "leading and guiding force of Soviet society" and is the
 only political party that is tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Rejecting foreign criticism of its human rights record, the
 Soviet Government argues that it fully protects all
 internationally recognized human rights. It will not permit
 any investigation of the human rights situation in Lithuania.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lithuania is the most rural of the Baltic states, as well as
 the largest, with a population of 3.4 million. Despite
 Moscow's high priority on the development of industry, half
 the labor force remains employed in agriculture. Soviet
 statistics published for the first half of 1985 showed a
 relatively strong performance by the Lithuanian economy.
 Lithuania's 4 percent growth in industrial production was far
 above the pace of the other two Baltic republics and of the
 nation as a whole, although it trailed last year's growth of
 6.6 percent. Furthermore, the 3.4 percent growth in labor
 productivity outstripped the national average of 2.6 percent.
 Many Lithuanians, however, do not believe that this expansion
 of industrial production will carry over into a genuine
 improvement in the consumer situation. They believe that the
 deterioration of the average diet will continue in the
 
 
 1032
 LITHUANIA
 ,republic., even-in years of high production, since much of
 Lithuania's food:production is sent to the Soviet Union or to
 neighboring Poland. While the quality of housing remains
 above general Soviet standards, living conditions as a whole
 are falling to the lower level common to the republics of the
 -Soviet Union.
 The velative homogeneity, of Lithuania's population, its strong
 sense.of national identity, .and the binding force of the
 Lithuanian Catholic Church have helped to preserve many of the
 country's social and cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the
 disruptive effects of.'an antireligious ideology, forced
 collectivization, and a policy of industrialization have been
 severe. Rigid controls on cultural and religious expression
 have forced many Lithuanians-into underground activity, which
 brings them into conflict.with-the authorities. A reduction
 in the amount of Lithuanian language-instruction at the
 .primary level in. 1982, with. a corresponding increase in the
 teaching of-the Russian language and Russian history, has
 .aroused fear that the groundwork is being laid for cultural
 and eventual linguistic russificatiion of the country.
 Non-Lithuanians total about 20 percent of the population, and
 their proportion has been growing in recent years.
