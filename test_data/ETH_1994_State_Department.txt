 ETHIOPIA
 After a lengthy civil war, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
 (EPRDF) took power in 1991 and, together with other groups active in the anti-
 Mengistu strgge, adopted the National Charter which established the Transitional
 Government oflthiopia (TGE). The TGE, headed by President Meles Zenawi, has
 been responsible for overseeing the transition to multiparty democracy. The Council
 of Representatives, the interim quasi-legislature, is controlled by the four constitu-
 ent parties of the EPRDF. The EPRDF and by extension the TGE are dominated
 
 
 by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The ascendance of Tigrayans and
 a policy of promoting ethnic identity and regionalism have engendered animosity
 from Amharas, who have traditionally held centralized power in Ethiopia.
 The TGE continued to implement its planned devolution of authority to regional
 governments. In June the TGE held elections for the 548-seat Constituent Assem-
 bly, the body responsible for approving the new Constitution which was ratified on
 December 8 and replaced the interim National Charter. The Constitution is the
 basis for parliamentary elections that are scheduled to be held in on May 7, 1995.
 All major opposition parties boycotted the June Constituent Assembly elections,
 charging TGE manipulation of the political process. The new Constitution promotes
 a multiparty system and limits the role of the future central government to the
 preservation of the Constitution, defense, and foreign policy. Ratification of the Con-
 stitution represented an important step in the TGE's democratization program,
 which-despite imperfections--has provided Ethiopian citizens with greater political
 freedoms than at any time in the nation's history.
 Until the reestablishment and deployment of police forces in mid-1994, the
 EPRDF military wing served as both the national armed forces and an internal se-
 curity force. During 1994 the TGE continued to demobilize TPLF soldiers, integrat-
 ing some into new local and regional police forces, which were increasingly respon-
 sible for law and order. The December decision of the Fourth TPLF Congress to ban
 TPLF military commanders from party membership was a step toward the estab-
 lishment of a representative, nonpolitical national army. The military continued
 low-level operations to counter the actions of Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and Is-
 lamic fundamentalist movements, especially in the Oromo and Somali regions where
 periodic clashes with insurgent and bandit groups occurred.
 The economy is based on smallholder agriculture, with more than 85 percent of
 the population living in rural areas in very poor conditions. Coffee accounts for
 about 60 percent of export revenue. The TGE continued to implement an inter-
 nationally supported economic reform program designed to liberalize the country's
 economy and bring government expenditures into balance.
 The Government was consistent and forceful in its verbal commitment to respect
 human rights, but serious problems remain. The judicial system remains weak,
 understaffed, and at times subject to political influence. There were credible reports
 that members of the security forces committed a number of extrajudicial killings
 and beat or otherwise physically abused criminal suspects and detainees, although
 these practices do not appear to be widespread. The Government seldom tried, con-
 victed, and appropriately punished security force members and police who commit-
 ted such abuses. The Government harassed and detained without charge numerous
 journalists and a number of opposition party members, holding some for as long as
 several months. In September the authorities arrested approximately 50 members
 of the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO) on charges of unlawful assembly.
 Numerous reports alleged that EPRDF forces, opposition separatists, and Islamic
 militias all committed humanitarian violations, including the summary execution of
 civilians, in continued clashes in the eastern parts of the country. The TGE's some-
 times heavyhanded tactics and an opposition boycott ensured an EPRDF victory in
 the June Constituent Assembly elections. Discrimination and violence against
 women and abuse of children continued to be serious problems.
 However, the Government took a number of steps to improve its human rights
 practices. It released several thousand persons previously detained without charge
 and closed the camps in which they were confined. It undertook efforts to establish
 a nonpolitical and nationally representative military. In June the Government con-
 ducted a procedurally fair election in which opposition groups were allowed access
 to government-owned broadcast media, and on several occasions opposition groups
 staged rallies without interference.
 In December the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) began legal proceedings against
 the first group of detainees charged with crimes against humanity under the brutal
 Marxist regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam (1974-1991). Following the read-
 ing of charges against the initial group of defendants, attorneys for the accused re-
 quested and received a continuance until March 7, 1995, to permit more time to pre-
 pare their defense. At year's end, approximately 1,700 detainees suspected of in-
 volvement in war crimes remained in detention, most without charge after more
 than 3 years. The trials, which are expected to last for several years, may ultimately
 involve more than 3,000 defendants.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-According to informed sources, local
 and regional officials of the security services committed more than 20 extrajudicial
 killings in 1994. In at least one case thought to be politically motivated, in August
 government security officers assassinated the deputy mayor of Code. According to
 credible reports, in July EPRDF soldiers fired at five unarmed young men in Debre
 Zeit, killing two and wounding two others. At year's end, the Government had not
 be     a public investigation of either of these incidents or punished those respon-
 sible.
 In July Alebatchew Goji died under suspicious circumstances while in police cus-
 tody in the town of Orghessa, near Dessie. While the exact circumstances of his
 death were unknown, Alebathew had been detained and interrogated for 6 days
 about his futive uncle's whereabouts. After Alebatchew's death, the police dis-
 played his boy in public before instructing his father to retrieve the body for burial.
 There is no evidence that government authorities investigated this incident.
 There were numerous unconfirmed reports of summary executions of civilians by
 government and antigovernment forces during clashes in the eastern "Somali" re-
 gion which includes the Ogaden. Groups involved in these clashes include the
 EPRDF, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), and the Islamic fundamen-
 talist group "Al-Ittihad Al-Islami." There was no evidence to support occasional ru-
 mors of "killing squads."
 b. Disappearance.-The independent press published numerous accounts of al-
 leged disappearances throughout the year. In most cases, security forces arrested
 and held   espersons incommunicado for several weeks before eventually releasimg
 them without charge. For example, after the OLF abducted and held a British
 CARE internation    employee for a week, an Ethiopian CARE employee subse-
 quently disa pared. Despite repeated denials that he was in police custody, the
 local PRD   oce released him 6 days later.
 However, there was at least one unconfirmed report in which the whereabouts of
 a person allegedly last seen in police custody was unknown at year's end. According
 to international human rights groups, in May unidentified security forces reportedly
 picked up Mustafa Idris, a telecommunications worker and OLF supporter, in Addis
 Ababa. Previously detained by the Mengistu regime for 10 years, Mustafa had not
 been traced to any police station, and his whereabouts were unknown.
 Human rights groups continued to charge that the whereabouts of dozens of peo-
 ple the TGE arrested when it took power remained unknown. In response, the TGE
 claimed that some of the alleged missing were among the estimated 1,700 persons
 in detention awaiting trial for crimes committed against the civilian population dur-
 ing the Mengistu regime.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The National Charter and new Constitution prohibit the use of torture and mis-
 treatment. Nevertheless, there were credible reports that security officials some-
 times beat and otherwise mistreated detainees. However, instances of torture were
 rare. A reported form of mistreatment is tying a victim's upper arms behind his or
 her back with electrical wire, occasionally resulting in permanent damage to the
 limbs. According to some victims and one security official, mock executions are occa-
 sionally staged. In August EPRDF security officials took an opposition supporter to
 an unmarked house in Addis Ababa and beat and verbally insulted him for several
 hours. The victim was eventually taken to a police station. Police officers refused
 an instruction from the EPRDF officials to imprison the victim and then offered to
 take the victim to a hospital. The Government did not publicly investigate or punish
 those responsible.
 There were credible reports that EPRDF officials sometimes use unmarked homes
 as sites for the temporary detention and interrogation of political opponents. How-
 ever, there is no evidence to support allegations about the existence of a network
 of secret detention or interrogation facilities. The Government has agreed to allow
 international access to any area or facility suspected of being used in this manner.
 In September prison officials shaved the heads of more than 250 supporters of the
 AAPO who had -been detained on September 20 for assembling without a permit.
 None of the detainees had yet been charged with a crime, and it appeared that the
 act was designed to humiliate and intimidate the AAPO supporters (see Section
 .e.).
 The Government took steps to improve prison conditions. Although prison condi-
 tions are acceptable by local standards and are not life-threatening, overcrowding
 is a serious problem. Prisoners are often allocated less than 2 square meters of
 space in a room which may contain from 8 to 200 people. Prisoners typically receive
 
 
 adequate food, often supplied by relatives on the outside. Female prisoners are kept
 separately from men and receive generally equal treatment. Rape does not appear
 to-be aproblem in prisons.
 The TGE permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, military camps
 and police stations by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and
 often by diplomatic missions. However, the ICRC does not have immediate access
 to government facilities and must either request permission or notify each time it
 wants to visit. With the advent of regionalization, the ICRC was also obliged to ob-
 tain clearances from each of Ethiopia's 10 regions. An Embassy visit with impris-
 oned AAPO leader Asrat Woldeyes in October revealed that he is treated respect-
 fully, was in good health, and received food daly from his family (see Section .e.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The National Charter, the new Constitu-
 tion, and both the Criminal and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, any person detained must be charged and in-
 formed of the charges within 48 hours and, in most cases, be offered release on bail.
 Those persons believed to have committed capital offenses, such as murder and trea-
 sn, may be detained for 4 weeks while police conduct an investigation and for an
 additional 15 days while the prosecutor prepares the case aainst the suspect. In
 practice, people are often detained without a warrant, frequent y not charged within
 48 hours, and if released on bail, never recalled to court.
 Throughout 1994 the Government continued to arrest and detain persons without
 charge. Although most often it detained people for short periods only, thousands of
 criminal suspects remained in detention without charge or trial at year's end. Many
 of these cases result from a severe shortage of judges, prosecutors, attorneys, clerks,
 and courthouses. The Southern Regional Supreme Court has only 5 judges, out of
 an authorized complement of 15. Late in the year, the Southern Region had a back-
 log of more than 5,000 cases dating back as far as 1991. The TGE began to address
 these problems by creating special judicial teams to reduce backlogs in key areas,
 which resulted in the release or arraignment of hundreds of detainees in Region 4.
 In December a special team of judicial officials reviewed prisoner files and released
 220 detainees in the Southern People's Region, typically for lack of evidence.
 In August local police detained 46 supporters of the newly formed Ethiopian Na-
 tional Democratic Party (ENDP) in Awassa and Dills in the southern region alleg-
 edly for planning violent activities and possession of unregistered firearms. he au-
 thorities eventually released all but two of the ENDP members (nine not until early
 December) for lack of evidence. In a separate incident, the TGE detained the presi-
 dent of Region 5 (Somali), Hassan Jiri, in Code and Addis Ababa without charge
 for 55 days in connection with his refusal to step down. On September 11, Lemma
 Sidamo, acting vice-chairman of the Sidamo Liberation Movement, which the TGE
 accuses of engaging in armed insurrection, was removed from his residence by Addis
 Ababa police, acting on an arrest order from Sidam Zone. No charges were ever
 brought against Lemma, who was held in seclusion in Awassa and the town of
 Yerga Alem until his release in mid-November.
 In December 1993, the authorities arrested eight leaders of opposition parties
 when they arrived in Addis Ababa to attend a "peace and reconciliation conference"
 organized by political opposition groups. They charged seven with supporting armed
 uprising against the State and other related offenses but dropped charges in Feb-
 rary afer the group members signed individual statements renouncing violence.
 All of the detainees had been released by mid-February, except for Abera Yemane-
 Ab, who remains in detention on suspicion of involvement in crimes against  human-
 ity committed during the Mengistu regime (see Section i.e.).
 Throughout the year the Government closed several large detention facilities, in-
 cluding Hu      t and Didessa, and released over 4,000 persons, mostly OLF members
 and suppors who had been held for periods as long as 2 years. It arraigned about
 280 of the detainees in Ziway, formally charged them with crimes, and transferred
 them to civilian prisons. Atyear's end no trials for the 280 had e , despite gov-
 ernment indications it would bring these prisoners to trial quickly. The Government
 closed the detention facility at Agarfa ear ier in the year.
 Exile is illegal and not used as a means of political control. However, in May, at
 the behest of the Eritran Government, the TGE arrested 26 Ethiopians for alleged
 involvement in activties of the Eritrean Liberation Front-Revolutionary Command
 (ELF-RC), a group opposing the Eritrean Government. As an alternative to impris-
 onment or deportation to Eritrea, the Government permitted several of the ELF-RC
 memners to seek asylum in Europe and allowed the others to remain in internal
 exile in southern Ethiopia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public  rial.-The TGE continued to restructure the judiciary
 toward a decentralized federal system, featuring ourts at the district (woreda,
 zone, and regional levels. The Central (federal) Supreme Court adjudicates cases in-
 
 
 82
 volving federal law, transregional issues, and national security and hears both origi-
 nal and appeal cases.   hethe goal of a decentralized system may hold promise
 of bringing justice closer to the people, the reality is that the severe shortage of
 tramepersonnel in many regions, serious financial constraints, and the absence of
 a clear demarcation between central and regional jurisdictions combine to keep the
 judiciary weak.
 Until regional legislatures are established and empowered to pass laws particular
 to their region, the Criminal Code will remain the same at bth the regional and
 federal levels. Trials are public, and defendants have the right to a defense attorney.
 The Government established a public defender's office to provide legal counsel to in-
 digent defendants. In December, the central High Court appointed attorneys to rep-
 resent 46 of the initial group of defendants in the war crimes trials following claims
 by the defendants that they could not afford adequate defense. The Court Will pay
 each attorney the equivalent of $800 to cover necessary expenses. Ethiopian law
 does not grant the defense attorney access to accusatory material before trial.
 Shari'a (Islamic) courts hear religious and family cases involving Muslims. The
 new Constitution protects the existence of current Shari'a courts and gives the legis-
 lature of any jurisdiction the authority to empower future Shari'a courts. Under the
 Constitution, both parties have to agree to be subject to Shari'a law for it to be ap-
 plied. In addition, some traditional courts still function in remote areas and, thoug
 not sanctioned by law, resolve legal disputes for the large number of Ethiopians who
 live more than a day's walk from a ro=  and generally beyond the influence of mod-
 ern judicial facilities.
 The central courts continued to show signs of judicial independence. However,
 these efforts were sometimes undermined by political interference in other areas of
 the judiciary. The Central Supreme Court found against the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs for misdeeds committed by the previous government's Internal Affairs Min-
 istry. The central High Court reprimanded the Minister of Justice and other senior
 officials for ordering the release of two prominent detainees held by the Court. In
 December the central High Court found that the Ministry of Labor had overstepped
 its bounds in ordering the closing of the offices of the Confederation of Ethiopian
 Trade Unions (CETU).
 Senior judicial officers acknowledge government pressure, noting that judges are
 sometimes instructed to treat EPRDF defendants leniently. Anecdotal evidence sug-
 gests that the exact opposite is true for cases involving members of the opposition.
 At least one judge claimed he was fired for exhibiting too much independence and
 in another case a presiding high judge replaced one of two fellow judges to achieve
 a majority vote to deny bail to two AAPO detainees. At year's end, two regional
 judges remained in prison in the southern city of Jinka after being illegally dis-
 missed by local authorities for issuing an unpopular decision. Officials in Jinka
 claimed, incorrectly, that regionalization gives them complete autonomy over local
 affairs, and they ignored release orders from the chairman of the Southern Region
 Supreme Court and from the vice chairman of the regional council.
 In decentralizing the judiciary, the TGE also established in 1993 federal and re-
 gional Judicial Administrative Commissions (JAC's) which are empowered to help
 select and discipline judges. JAC's-which include the chairman of the relevant su-
 preme court, representatives of the appropriate legislative council, local lawyers,
 prosecutors, and Justice Ministry officials--have begun to function, although their
 impact was mixed.
 On October 25, the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) handed down long-awaited
 indictments against the first group of defendants to be tried for serious crimes, in-
 cluding for crimes against humanity during the "Red Terror" and forced resettle-
 ment and villagization, committed during the Mengistu dictatorship from 1974 to
 1991. The SPO was established in 1992 to create an historical record of the abuses
 during the Mengistu government and to bring to justice those criminally responsible
 for human rights violations and corruption. The trial of the first 66 defendants
 began on December 13. In this first group, the Government is trying 21 of the 66
 in absentia, including the former president, Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, who
 is in exile in Zimbabwe. It may eventually charge and try more than 3,000 defend-
 ants in connection with these crimes; some government officials expect the trials to
 go on for 3 to 5 years. In 1994 the Government arrested 25 former Air Force person-
 nel for having bombed civilian targets during the civil war. Over 1,600 suspects re-
 mained in detention without charge at year's end, some of whom have been detained
 for more than 3 years. The Government declared that the remaining detainees
 would be charged by July 1995.
 Following a high profile trial, the Central High Court convicted and sentenced
 AAPO leader Asrat Woldeyes and four accomplices to imprisonment for 2 years for
 involvement in a 1993 meeting in Addis Ababa during which plans for armed activi-
 
 
 ties against the TGE were allegedly discussed. In December the same court sen-
 tenced Asrat to prison for an additional 3 years for "incitement to war" in connec-
 tion with a speech made at the provincial town of Debre Berhan in 1992. At year's
 end, Asrat also faced charges of-involvement in a May 1994 prison break in Debre
 Berhan, during which several guards were killed. His confinement and trials re-
 ceived significant press attention and exacerbated tensions between the TGE and
 AAPO. In September, after pretesting without a required permit outside the Central
 High Court, the authorities arrested approximately 500 AAPO supporters and even-
 tually charged 250 with "public provocation" and "illegal assembly." They subse-
 quently released all of these on bail; further court action remained pending at year's
 end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial search warrants, but government critics allege they are seldom
 used in practice. The TGE implemented a nationwide campaign to uncover and con-
 fiscate unregistered firearms. Government security officials conducted searches of
 private and commercial vehicles, as well as private homes. Leaders of political oppo-
 sition groups claim their members have been singled out for illegal searches and
 often unfairly detained during this campaign. These charges were given additional
 credibility when 44 of 46 ENDP members, detained following accusations of illegal
 weapons possession in the Southern Ethiopian People's Region, were subsequently
 released without charge (see Section 1..Many people allege they are under sur-
 veillance for expressingantigovernment views.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The TGE continued to face low-level armed insurgency and banditry in var-
 ious parts of the country, and both the military and the insurgents committed seri-
 ous abuses, including extrajudicial kilings.
 In April the TGE armed forces launched a military operation in eastern Region
 5 to control military activities of the Islamic fundamentalist Al-Ittihad Al-Islami
 and the military wing of the separatist ONLF. Numerous unconfirmed reports al-
 lege that all parties summarily executed civilians and that Al-Ittihad and the ONLF
 employed land mines and hand grenades against both military and civilian targets.
 Toward the end of the year a number of suspected ONLF landmine attacks were
 directed at civilian targets, primarily along the Harar-Jijiga road, and resulted in
 more than 10 civilian deaths and numerous injured. In Regions 3 and 4 (Amhara
 and Oromia), rebel groups occasionally clashed with government forces resulting in
 deaths on both sides. Militants of the Oromo Liberation Front engaged TGE forces
 sporadically during the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the National Charter, the 1992 Press
 Law, and the new Constitution provide for the right to free speech and press, the
 TGE restricted both of these freedoms on numerous occasions. People are generally
 free to discuss publicly any topic they choose, but those expressing anti-TGE views
 were vulnerable to government harassment. For example, police detained a person
 overnight for speaking about Asrat's case (see Section 1.e.) and forced him to sign
 a statement forswearing any future discussion of the professor. Press criticism of
 both the Government and the opposition is common. Opposition parties and the
 Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) were generally able to hold rallies or
 press conferences expressing anti-TGE views without apparent retribution.
 The vast majority of Ethiopians outside Addis Ababa have no ready access to the
 print media. A small-circulation private press continued to operate in Addis Ababa
 despite the arrest of more than a dozen journalists for violations of the Press Law
 and Criminal Code. The Press Law is vague, and many journalists complain that
 it can be interpreted broadly to target journalists whom the Government dislikes.
 This often results in self-censorship. The clause most commonly invoked is the pro-
 hibition on dissemination of false information, which is often translated into "telling
 only one side of a story." Many journalists fall victim to this clause because of the
 refusal of virtually all government officials to speak to the private press, even to
 confirm or deny an allegation. Denial of entrance to private journalists at govern-
 ment press conferences further limits their access to information and undermines
 the TGE's affirmations of a free press as a cornerstone of democracy. However, some
 elements of the private press were irresponsible in their reporting of developments
 in the country.
 The authorities detained a number of independent journalists and editors for long
 periods (as long as 4 months) without informing them of the charges they face.
 Many publishers decided against continuing involvement in the news business after
 being detained, sentenced to prison, or fined up to $3,200 (20,000 birr). There were
 credible allegations of executive influence in judicial proceedings against journalists.
 
 
 84
 Judges set fines on an ad hoc basis. When a convicted person is unable to pay a
 fine, it is a common long-standing practice to divide his monthly salary into the out-
 standing fine to determine the number of months in prison. On three occasions
 judges applied this practice to detained journalists. As a result of poor management,
 market forces, and government harassment, the number of available newspapers de-
 clined from the high of 65 that were in operation at various times during 1993. By
 the end of 1994 there were about 20 weedy and 2 monthly magazines in circulation
 in Addis Ababa with a circulation of about 5,000 to 7,000 each.
 Foreign journalists, including from the Voice of America, continued to operate
 freely in Ethiopia during this period, often writing articles critical of TGE policies
 and practices. The Government controls radio, the most influential medium in
 reaching the rural population, as well as the sole television station, and ensures
 that TGE policies are reflected in their programming. The official media devoted
 slightly more coverage to the activities of opposition groups than in 1993, but much
 of this coverage was negative.
 The new Constitution provides for academic freedom. In January 1993, security
 forces killed an Addis Ababa University (AAU) student while dispersing an unau-
 thorized demonstration against Eritrean independence at the University, in which
 protesters threw rocks at police. In February 1994, a commission of inquiry, which
 had been established to investigate the incident, found that the students, university
 security, and police were each partly to blame.
 At year's end, none of the 41 AAU faculty members dismissed in April 1993 re-
 portedly for expressing antigovernment views, had been reinstated. Only 4 of? the
 41 received any type of compensation from the Government, and the teachers' suit
 against the Government for wrongful dismissal continued to move slowly through
 the courts. The negative impact of the dismissals continued to resonate among AAU
 faculty.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The National Charter and the
 new Constitution endorse the right of peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and
 the ri ht to engage in unrestricted peaceful political activity. Although the Govern-
 ment has used egal instruments and other measures to abridge these rights on nu-
 merous occasions, the    Government did    not interfere   with  several large
 antigovernment protests held in November and December. The TGE proclamation
 of Augnst 12, 1991, required organizers to inform authorities of peaceful demonstra-
 tions or public political meetings 48 hours in advance. In 1994 this process, not the
 law, was reversed and tightened. Organizers must now obtain a permit from re-
 gional authorities prior to a public demonstration.
 In a sign that the Government is responding more responsibly to legitimate public
 expressions of dissent during the period leading up to the 1995 elections, there were
 several large peaceful demonstrations in November and December. On November
 28, there was a peaceful rally and march by between 40,000 and 50,000 Muslims
 who demonstrated in Addis Ababa in support of unrestricted freedom to practice
 their religion. On December 4, several opposition groups staged a peaceful rally in
 central Addis Ababa to protest the Government's "'unilateral adoption of the new
 Constitution and to condemn human rights abuses. Approximately 50,000 people at-
 tended the rally, which proceeded without incident.
 The TGE permits the existence of independent nongovernmental associations but
 has sometimes harassed and intimidated groups, which have criticized the Govern-
 ment on purely political grounds, such as the Ethiopian Human Rights Council.
 These associations are required both to register with the Relief and Rehabilitation
 Commission and to hold a special permit issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 In particular, the permit is necessary for an association to open a bank account or
 acquire official seals. Three years after EHRCO applied for registration and a per-
 mit the Government continued to delay action on the applications, claiming that
 EHkCO is primarily a political organization (see Section 4). Many other nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) have made similar complaints.
 The TGE requires political parties to register with the National Electoral Board
 (NEB). As of year's end, there were 60 political parties (44 of whom had received
 registration certificates from the NEB); of these, 53 are regional parties and 7 na-
 tional.
 Credible reports from many sources demonstrate that the authorities at both the
 national and regional levels harassed opposition political parties. The authorities
 often refused to rent meeting halls to opposition parties, surveilled party activities,
 and harassed individual members. A member of the Ethiopian Democratic Union
 Party (EDUP) was detained and beaten severely by two EPRDF officials in Addis
 Ababa for several hours after they discovered his EDUP membership card while in-
 terrogating him and a friend on the street. Two officials of the opposition Southern
 Ethiopian People's Democratic Coalition (SEPDC) were allegedly summarily de-
 
 
 tained on December 28 after presenting local authorities in the town of Hosanna
 a written notification of SEPDC's intention to establish a party office. In August po-
 lice detained 46 supporters of the newly formed ENDP in Awassa and Dilla in what
 many suspect was an attempt by southern region authorities to dismantle the party
 (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The National Charter and the new Constitution provide
 for freedom of religion, including the right of conversion, and freedom of worship
 exists in practice. Roughly 40 percent of Ethiopia's population are Muslims who, for
 the first time in the nation's history, are able to participate fully in political, eco-
 nomic, and social life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement, including the right of domestic and foreign trav-
 el, emigration, and repatriation, is provided under the National Charter and the
 new Constitution. Citizens may freely change their residence or workplace. Citizens
 and residents of Ethiopia are required to obtain an exit visa before departing, which
 the authorities issue in most cases, except for persons with pending court cases or
 debts.
 An average of 100 Ethiopian Jews (Falashas) and Feles Mora (Ethiopians who
 claim Jewish heritage but have not been accepted as Jews by the Israeli Rabbinate)
 emigrated to Israel every month. This outflow has remained at about the same level
 since the major exodus of Falashas in 1991 and 1992. Several thousand Ethiopians
 who claim Jewish heritage remain in Ethiopia.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to foreign
 diplomats, the TGE treats asylum seekers fairly and is cooperative on issues con-
 cerning the repatriation of Ethiopian refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 This right has yet to be exercised in Ethiopia. The TGE extended the transitional
 period originally scheduled to expire in January until a new national government
 is elected in mid-1995. Throughout the year, the TGE continued preparations for a
 transition to multiparty democracy, and in December the Constituent Assembly an-
 nounced plans to the hold parliamentary elections within 6 months.
 Since taking power in 1991 the EPRDF has dominated the political process and
 maintains a preponderance of seats in the quasi-legislative Council of Representa-
 tives. Of the four constituent parties of the EPRDF, the TPLF is the most powerful,
 and its members included the President and (until their exclusion from the party
 at the December 1994 Congss] most key national security officials. The EPRDP
 also dominates the regional councils and executive committees as a result of the
 flawed 1992 elections in which principally the EPRDF, but also the OLF, were
 guilty of numerous breaches of the electoral process.
 In March the commission charged with drafting a new constitution completed its
 task and submitted the draft for review and approval by the Council of Representa-
 tives. In October, the 548-seat Constituent Assembly elected in June began delibera-
 tions on the draft constitution, which it approved on December 8. Opposition to the
 new Constitution includes an objection to the alleged "unilateral" nature of its adop-
 tion by a ruling party and to specific controversial articles. Prominent among the
 latter are provisions for self-determination "up to secession' (Article 39) and for
 state ownership of all land.
 All major opposition groups boycotted the June Constituent Assembly elections,
 claiming that the Government would impede their ability to participate in the politi-
 cal process. Leading up to the election, there were credible reports of EPRDF har-
 assment of some opposition party members and independent candidates, especially
 in regions outside Addis Ababa. The TGE and the National Electoral Board made
 credible attempts to investigate abuses when made aware of their occurrence. A lim-
 ited attempt was made to provide registered candidates with media access. In at
 least one instance, the NEB reversed an announced victory in favor of a non-EPRDF
 candidate. International observers considered the elections administratively fair.
 However, as a result of the lack of opposition candidates, the election was largely
 noncompetitive, and the better organized and funded EPRDF candidates won 89
 percent of the contested seats.
 In general, the opposition parties are poorly organized and funded and lack lead-
 ership and alternative programs. Most such parties also have little active support
 outside Addis Ababa,although 85 percent of the population lives in rural areas. Par-
 ticipation remains closed to a number of organizations which have not renounced
 violence or do not accept the TGE and its Council of Representatives as a legitimate
 authority. These groups include Medhin, the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic
 
 
 86
 Forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, the Oromo Liberation Front,
 and several smaller Somali groups.
 Neither law nor practice restrict the participation of women and minorities in pol-
 itics. Although by historical standards women's status and political articipation is
 greater than ever before, women are underrepresented in the TGE Council of Min-
 isters and among the leadership of all political organizations. Only 2 of the 20 Min-
 isters in the TGE Council of Ministers are women; 3 other women hold ministerial
 rank, and a number of others hold positions anng the senior ranks of government.
 Only 1 of 30 judges on the central High Court is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ethiopian Human Rights Council is the country's most prominent independ-
 ent human rights monitoring group, but it has been criticized for its political agen-
 da. However, EHRCO continued to operate without legal status because the Govern-
 ment considers it a political organization. The Government refused to register
 EHRCO, and security officials regularly monitored people visiting its office. Al-
 though in 1993 the Government arrested and released on bail the EHRCO Secretary
 General, it had not formally charged him with a crime by year's end. EHRCO public
 statements and periodic reports are highly critical of the TGE's political program
 as well as its performance on human rights. In its seventh report, it submitted a
 list of alleged extrajudicial killings to the Attorney General and the Ministry of In-
 ternal Affairs. The former repied that it was unaware of such cases; the latter had
 not responded as of year's end.
 Other human rights organizations include the Ethiopian Human Rights and Peace
 Center (EHRPC), affiliated with the law faculty at Addis Ababa University, the
 Ethiopian Congss for Democracy, and the Inter-Africa Group.
 The TGE allows visits by the ICRC and international human rights groups and
 permits them to operate and travel freely.
 International human rights groups and foreign diplomats have been encouraged
 to observe the war crimes trials which began in December. Although allegations of
 human rights abuses have been raised with the TGE, the Government took remedial
 action in only the most public and egregious cases. Rarely, if ever, did it punish re-
 sponsible officials for abusing or neglecting their authority. Officials in the Ministry
 of Interior have generally been responsive to requests for information about specific
 human rights cases and have facilitated visits to prisons and meetings with promi-
 nent detainees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law. The law
 provides that all persons should have equal and effective protection without dis-
 crimination on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opin-
 ion, national or social origin, wealth, birth, or other status.
 Women.-Although women played a prominent role (including service in combat)
 during the civil war and hold some senior government positions, in practice women
 do not enjoy equal status with men. Ethiopian law holds men and women to be
 equal, but tradition and cultural factors place the man as head of the household,
 and, in practice, men typically hold land tenure and property rights for the whole
 family.
 Discrimination is most acute in the rural areas, where 85 percent of the popu-
 lation lives, and where women work over 13 hours a day fulfilling household and
 farming responsibilities. In urban areas, women have fewer employment opportuni-
 ties than men, and the jobs available do not provide equal pay for equal work. In
 September 1993, the TGE launched an initiative to promote the equality of women
 by changing statutes and including women's concerns in the Government's develop-
 ment planning, although the Government took limited concrete action other than to
 establish women's affairs desks in each of the ministries.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating and rape, is a pervasive problem. While
 women theoretically have recourse through police and the legal system, societal
 norms inhibit many women from seeking Iegal redress. There was sporadic media
 coverage of domestic abuse cases, although the press rarely covers instances of rape
 because of the stigma attached to the crime. There are disturbing reports that some
 husbands force their wives into prostitution to supplement family income.
 Children.-The Government has not given children's issues a high priority, but
 has encouraged the efforts of domestic and international NGO's, such as Save the
 Children, which focus on children's social and health issues.
 
 
 Societal abuse against young girls however, continues to be a serious problem.
 Almost all girls undergo some form of female genital mutilation (FGM), which inter-
 national and TGE health experts have condemned as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health. Clitorectomies are typically performed 7 days after birth, and
 the excision of the labia and infibulation, the most extreme and dangerous form of
 FGM, can occur any time between the age of 8 and the onset of puberty. Early child-
 hood marriage is prevalent in rural areas with girls as young as 9 years beingp
 to arranged marriages. The National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethio-
 pia, an indigenous NGO, along with the Ministries of Health and Labor and Social
 Affairs, international organizations, and other NGO's, has begun a nationwide pro-
 gram to educate women, community leaders, and traditional leaders on the harmful
 effects of FGM. Ethiopia has an extremely high maternal mortality rate, partially
 due to food taboos for pregnant women and birth complications related to FGM, in-
 cluding infibulation.
 Nationall/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethiopia has more than 80 different ethnic
 groups. Although all of these groups have had some influence on the political and
 cultural life of the country, Amharas and Tigrayans from the northern highlands
 have traditionally dominated this process. Some ethnic groups, such as Oromos, the
 largest single group, claim to have been dominated for at least a century by the Am-
 haras and Tigrayans. In an attempt to rectify this problem, the Government has
 supported a loose federal system and in 1994 changed regional boundaries to encom-
 pass more completely entire (major) ethnic populations.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate access to buildings
 or government services for persons with disabilities. The new Constitution stipu-
 lates that the State shall allocate resources to provide rehabilitation and assistance
 to the physically and mentally disabled. There is no officially condoned or legally
 sanctioned discrimination against people with disabilities, but cultural attitudes to-
 ward the disabled are often negative, and even people with minor disabilities com-
 plain of rampant job discrimination. The Council of Representatives passed a law
 mandating equal rights for the disabled, but it is unclear if the law can be rigor-
 ously enforced. An official at the Rehabilitation Agency, a semiautonomous institu-
 tion under the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, estimated that there are more
 than 5 million disabled people in Ethiopia out of a population of roughly 53 million.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Only a small percentage of the population is in-
 volved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in the capital Ap-
 proximately 85 percent of the work force lives in the countryside, engaged in sub-
 sistence farming.
 Under the National Charter, Article 42 of the 1994 Constitution, and the 1993
 Labor Law, most workers are free to form and join unions and engage in collective
 bargaining, but only about 200,000 workers are unionized. Employees of the civil
 and security services (where most wage workers are found), judges, and prosecutors
 are not allowed to form unions. Workers who provide an "essential service" are not
 allowed to strike. Essential services include a large number of categories such as
 air transport, railways, bus services, police and fire services, post and telecommuni-
 cations, banks, and pharmacies.
 Unions are not affiliated with the Government or political parties. There is no
 legal requirement for unions to belong to the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade
 Unions (CETU), which was established in November 1993. CETU comprises nine
 federations organized by industrial and service sector rather than by region. In De-
 cember the Government decertified CETU following a 30-day probationary period
 given to permit CETU to resolve internal disputes. Under Ethiopian law a trade or-
 ganization may not act in an overtly political manner. The CETU split over allega-
 tions that CETU chairman Dawey ITrahim's harsh criticism of the Government's
 structural adjustment program was politically motivated. Factions of three federa-
 tions, including Dawey, took possession of CETU offices, prompting the Government
 to issue the order that CETU must resolve its internal problems. The central High
 Court later affirmed the Government's right to decertify CETU but found the deci-
 sion to close CETU's offices to be improper. Nonetheless, at year's end the CETU
 offices remained closed.
 The 1993 Labor Law explicitly gives workers the right to strike to protect their
 interests, but it also sets forth many restrictions which apply before a legal strike
 may take place. These restrictions apply equally to an employer's right to lockout.
 Strikes must be supported by a majority of the workers affected by the decision. The
 1993 Labor Law prohibits retribution against strikers. Both sides must make efforts
 at conciliation, provide at least 10-days' notice to the Government and include the
 
 
 reasons for the action, and, in cases already before a court or labor board, the party
 must provide at least a 30-day warning.
 If an agreement between unions and management cannot be reached, the Minister
 of Labor may refer the case to arbitration by a labor relations board (LRB). The
 TGE has established LRB's at the national level and in some regions. The Minister
 of Labor and Social Affairs appoints each LRB chairman, and the four board mem-
 bers are composed of two each from trade unions and employer associations. It is
 unlawful to strike against an order from an LRB.
 There were no strikes organized by unions during the year.
 In mid-1994 the TGE reinstated 46 of 52 employees of the Commercial Bank of
 Ethiopia who had been fired in 1992 for attempt'  to strike. In the absence of a
 labor law in 1992, the attempt to strike had been dged ilegal.
 Independent unions and those belonging to CETU are free to affiliate with and
 participate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law and under the new Constitution, and it is practiced
 freely throughout the country. Collective bargaining agreements concluded between
 1975 and the promulgation of the January 1993 Labor Law are covered under the
 1975 Labor Code and remain in force. Labor experts estimate that more than 90
 percent of unionized workers in Ethiopia are covered by collective bargaining agree-
 ments. Wages are negotiated at the plant level.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers. Grievance procedures are in place to hear allegations of discrimina-
 tion brought by individuals or unions. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 C. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The National Charter and the new
 Constitution proscribe slavery-which was officially abolished in 1942-and involun-
 tary servitude. The Criminal Code specifically prohibits forced labor unless insti-
 tuted by court order as a punitive measure. Forced or compulsory labor is virtually
 nonexistent.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the 1993 Labor Law, the
 minimum age for wage or salary employment is 14. Children between the ages of
 14 and 18 are covered by special provisions in the Labor Law. Children may not
 work mere than 7 hours per day, work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
 or on public holidays, or perform overtime. While some efforts to enforce these regu-
 lations are made within the formal industrial sector, large numbers of children of
 all ages work outside of most government regulatory control on farms in the coun-
 tryside and as street peddlers in the cities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage. How-
 ever, since 1985 a minimum wage has been set and paid to public sector employees
 who are by far the largest group of wage earners. This public sector minimum wage
 is $16.67 (105 birr) per month, which is insufficient to provide a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. According to the Office for the Study of Wages
 and other Remunerations, a family of five requires a monthly income of $62.40 (390
 birr), and even with two minimum wage earners a family receives only about half
 the income needed for healthful subsistence.
 The legal workweek is 48 hours, 6 days of 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. The 48-hour workweek is widely respected.
 The TGE, private industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. However, the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs enforces these standards ineffectively, due to a lack ofhuman and fi-
 nancial resources. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous sit-
 uations without jeopardy to continued employment.
