 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Since the overthrow of the repressive Macias dictatorship
 in August 1979, Equatorial Guinea has had a military govern-
 ment dedicated to national reconstruction and which has
 stated its commitment to human rights, the principles of
 international law, and the charters of the United Nations
 and the Organization of African Unity. While all the
 military men holding cabinet appointments and 'many civil
 servants had ties with the Macias regime at one time, many
 also suffered personally from the excesses of his regime.
 The government also includes Guineans who have returned from
 foreign exile. As part of its program for national recon-
 struction, the new government has reestablished a legal
 frame of reference while it builds new legal institutions
 and procedures. Decree law no. 4 of April 1979 states that
 only those penal, civil, mercantile, administrative, labor
 and military laws in effect before independence in 1968 will
 remain in force until new laws and regulations are passed,
 provided that pre-independence laws do not conflict with
 legislation passed since the present government assumed
 office in August 1979.
 Until the military government has completed the process
 of national economic, social, and administrative reconstruc-
 tion, it does not intend to permit political parties to
 function or to hold elections for a new civilian government.
 The government has stated that because of the destruction of
 the country's economy and social services under Macias, the
 almost total lack of government revenues and trained person-
 nel, and dependence on foreign assistance to restore agricul-
 tural production as well as health and education facilities;
 it may be several years before Equatorial Guinea enjoys
 political and civil rights. Meanwhile, on the government's
 first anniversary in August 1980, President Obiang Nguema
 reiterated a pledge to carry out the development process
 with full respect for law and human rights "within social
 justice and an absolute guarantee for the right of each
 individual."
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The government has promised "physical integrity of persons"
 and the "inviolability of all Guinean citizens." Whether
 this is complied with in practice is not known. There is
 no reliable information that torture, consistently used by
 the former regime, is still used. President Obiang has
 stated that "no one must suffer slavery, torture, or cruel,
 degrading or inhuman treatment.*
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reports that the new government, in contrast to
 the barbaric record of its predecessor, practices such
 treatment or punishment. Physical punishment is not known
 to be administered now, as it was under Macias. In September
 1979, former President Macias, together with six collabo-
 rators, was executed after a public trial which was described
 
 
 79
 as fair by foreign observers, including a representative of
 the International Commission of Jurists. A former government
 official also was found guilty of killings under the Macias
 regime and executed in Anisok. Prison conditions are harsh,
 given the government's lack of resources to improve the
 prisons inherited from the Macias regime.
 C.   Disappearances
 No information has been received that secret arrests
 and detentions continue in Equatorial Guinea, as practiced
 previously under the Macias regime.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The new government has announced the release of all political
 prisoners held by the previous regime, and has indicated
 that it is detaining no political prisoners, except those
 sentenced to prison terms in September 1979 as Macias
 collaborators. There are no indications that the new regime
 practices arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and President
 Obiang Nguema has stated that no one should be arbitrarily
 detained, made prisoner, or exiled. Decree Law No. 8.of
 June 1980 states that those who commit acts against public
 order must either be turned over to the *Judicial Authorities*
 or released within 72 hours. It is not known whether this
 is complied with in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The current court system in Equatorial Guinea appears to be
 a combination of traditional, civil and military justice.
 A representative of the United Nations Commission on Human
 Rights was told in November 1979 that civil cases were tried
 by traditional chiefs and/or civilian judges for the more
 serious cases. Criminal cases came under the exclusive
 jurisdiction of the military authorities. Macias and his
 co-defendants were given a public trial, provided with
 counsel, and informed of the charges against them. The
 tribunal, which applied Spanish law, was composed of three
 military and two civilian members. Military courts are now
 said to have jurisdiction only over military personnel.
 According to security officials, defendants are permitted
 access to counsel at all times.
 . f. Invasion of the Home
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government
 authorities 'may not enter or remain in the domicile of a
 private individual without his consent and without a legal
 order,' except, among other circumstances, when it is
 necessary to facilitate the prosecution of persons accused
 of crimes and when the public order is sertously disturbed.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The government has repeatedly stated its commitment
 to its people's basic economic rights. They do not now
 enjoy the economic rights outlined in the Universal Declar-
 ation of Human Rights, however, as a result of the syste-
 matic violation of these rights by the Macias regime and the
 lack of resources available to the new government.

 The key to restoration of the stagnant economy and to
 inrPrOvemit of the standard of living is the revitalization
 of cacao, coffee and timber production, all of which were
 important sources of employment and foreign exchange at the
 time of independence in 1968. New investment is required in
 both the public and private sectors. The government has
 established conditions for private land owners to recover
 and exploit their agricultural properties, but progress is
 slow. Cocoa and coffee cooperatives have been created both
 on the island of Bioko and in Rio Muni province on the
 continent; they are receiving international assistance.
 During the Spanish colonial period, land ownership is said
 to have been limited to four hectares per family while there
 were no such restrictions on foreigners. Today, property
 may be owned in common by tribal or family groups, or may be
 held in small parcels or in larger plantations.
 President Obiang has stated that for purposes of agriculture,
 livestock, and foreign development, private property is
 recognized as an acquired right. For the relatively small
 population of Equatorial Guinea, which remains under 300,000
 persons with less than a third on Bioko, ample opportunity
 exists for employment, especially on the cocoa plantations.
 Interest in this kind of work, formerly performed by imported
 Nigerian labor, is very low, however. The government has
 fixed a new minimum wage for agricultural workers of the
 equivalent of $34 a month plus room and board, or about $50
 without. The minimum wage in other areas of production is
 roughly $43 per month.
 To enhance the role of women in society, the government
 established a separate Secretariat of State for the Promo-
 tion of Women in September 1980. The secretariat, with
 representatives in each province and district, will promote
 programs integrating women into national development and
 productivity, focusing on the role of women in work and
 employment, health, teaching, and social and physical
 training. In past years, women have generally occupied a
 subservient position in Guinean society with few educational
 and employment opportunities. Today women are free to
 participate in social, economic and governmental affairs.
 Women serve in a number of working level government positions.
 Currently, the standard of living, health services and
 educational facilities are substandard. The rate of
 economic growth will remain minimal until cocoa production
 -- which was 40,000 tons in 1968 but only 7,900 tons in 1978 --
 is restored. The rate of population growth, which was
 negative during the Macias years because of refugee flight
 and increased deaths due to the then-prevailing harsh
 conditions, probably will increase as refugees return and as
 health services improve. Infant mortality is believed to be
 high now, and life expectancy is currently estimated to
 average 40 years.
 While Equitorial Guinea enjoyed good hospitals and a high
 ratio of doctors and hospital beds per capita at independence,
 there were less than twelve doctors in the country when
 Macias was overthrown. Hospitals lacked medicines, equipment,
 mattresses and other essentials. The Spanish government and
 other donors now are supplying doctors, medicines, and
 equipment, and are attempting to restore a minimal level of
 health services.
 
 
 Although Equatorial Guinea boasted a high literacy rate at
 the time of independence, the present younger generation has
 lost at least five years of normal education. Primary
 schools have begun to function again with Guinean and
 foreign teachers; school supplies are limited. During the
 1979-80 school year, the government says it rehabilitated
 468 primary schools with a school population of 44;140
 students. Of the 770 teachers, 500 had no teaching qualifi-
 cations. Of these students, 23,000 were taking pre-school
 courses and only 21,000 were enrolled in the primary grades.
 There were very few students in grades 6-8 (as a result of
 reduced enrollments under Macias' regime). Only seven secon-
 dary schools, with a total student enrollment of 2,729, have
 been restored.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Decree Law No. 11 of November 1979 makes specific reference
 to the 'right of information." The government owns and
 operates the country's few radio and television stations and
 a semi-weekly newspaper, Ebano, which began publication in
 August 1980. These media do not criticize the government
 and opposition viewpoints have no publib channel of expression.
 An August 1979 decree authorized reopening of churches of
 all religions recognized in Equatorial Guinea, and churches
 are again functioning. The new government has not made
 specific commitments on other civil and political liberties
 but it has warned those returning from exile that political
 factionalism will not be tolerated.  There is no functioning
 trade union movement in Equatorial Guinea.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no known restrictions on travel within Equatorial
 Guinea. Travel abroad is limited by the shortage of foreign
 exchange. The government recognized the right of voluntary
 repatriation when, in a general amnesty decreed in October
 1979, it invited exiles *to return without concern for being
 persecuted or punished for having abandoned Equatorial
 Guinea." Guineans are no longer seeking refuge outside the
 country and there are no foreign refugees known to have
 sought asylum in Equatorial Guinea.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The new military government of Equatorial Guinea is authori-
 tarian in nature, and rules by decree. The president
 and all cabinet members are military officers. Government
 ministries are staffed by civilians. Despite its commitment
 to restore democracy, the government has indicated that
 political parties and activities will not be permitted until
 progress has been achieved toward national economic recon-
 struction. The military government has set no timetable for
 the return to constitutional rule. As a result, political
 participation, opposition groups, and popular suffrage do
 not now exist.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 The military government invited representatives of the
 International Commission of Jurists to attend the trial of
 former President Macias and accepted a request from the
 United Nations Commission on Human Rights to evaluate the
 human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea. The International
 Commission of Jurists' report on the Macias trial was issued
 in Geneva in December 1979. A special rapporteur represen-
 ting the United Nations Human Rights Commission visited
 Equatorial Guinea in November 1979. His report, issued in
 February 1980, indicated that the government did not co-
 operate fully with the Commission and interfered to some
 extent with its mission. He returned for a second visit in
 late November 1980, and is expected to publish another
 report for the Commission early in 1981. There are no
 organizations in Equatorial Guinea which observe, report and
 contest human rights violations. Equatorial Guinea does not
 participate in any regional human rights bodies.
