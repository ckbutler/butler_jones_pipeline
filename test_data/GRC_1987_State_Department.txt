 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically elected
 Parliament. The party or coalition of parties with a
 parliamentary majority names the Prime Minister and forms the
 government. Several political parties vigorously and freely
 contest periodic parliamentary and municipal elections, the
 most recent of which were municipal elections in October
 1986. The President of the Republic, who serves as Head of
 State, is elected by Parliament.
 The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch of
 government and Parliament, and operates within a civil law
 framework with precedents from Roman law and French and German
 sources. Police practices respect detainees' rights.
 A member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified as a developed country by United Nations
 standards. It has a tradition of state intervention in the
 economy and currently faces serious economic problems which
 are intensified by a bloated public sector.
 The full range of universally acknowledged human rights is
 provided for by the Constitution, which includes many of the
 provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. Greece ratified the European Convention on
 Human Rights in 1974, and in 1985 it recognized the competence
 of the European Commission on Human Rights to accept petitions
 from individual Greeks who wish to appeal human rights cases.
 The Government, many of whose members suffered abuses during
 the Junta period (1967-74), is sensitive to the protection of
 individual freedoms. Most allegations of infractions fall in
 the area of religious expression, which, however, is protected
 within certain limits by the Constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killing by
 Government forces in 1987. The physical security of the
 person is generally asssured in Greece. Nevertheless,
 politically motivated terrorist acts have claimed a number of
 lives in recent years. The domestic terrorist group "November
 17," whose earlier victims included U.S. and Greek government
 officials, claimed responsibility for the "kneecapping" of
 Zaharias Kapsalakis, a physician, on February 4, 1987 and for
 two bomb attacks in April and August against buses carrying
 U.S. servicemen, which resulted in injuries but no deaths. A
 second domestic terrorist group, the "First of May," claimed
 responsibility for the attempted assassination June 21, 1987
 of trade union leader Panagiotis Raftopoulos.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrest, or
 clandestine detention during 1987.
 
 
 928
 GREECE
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. In November 1984, the Parliament
 passed legislation making the use of torture an offense
 punishable by sentences ranging from 3 years to life
 imprisonment. Allegations of isolated incidents of
 maltreatment or torture of detainees were reported in the
 Greek press in 1987, which also reported that the public
 prosecutor in two cases filed charges against law enforcement
 authorities. Amnesty International, in its 1987 Report
 covering 1986, expressed concern about allegations of torture
 and ill-treatment of prisoners and detainees.
 Prison and detention facilities generally provide adequate
 health care and diet. Greek human rights organizations and
 the press charged during 1987 that certain aging prison
 facilities are inadequate, resulting in maltreatment and the
 denial of basic rights. No distinction according to social
 class, race, sex, religion, or type of conviction is made in
 the treatment of prisoners. Cases requiring medical treatment
 receive special attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be
 visited by family members 3 times per week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is ensured by
 the Constitution, and this provision is respected in practice.
 Preventive detention does not exist in Greece. A person
 arrested on warrant or while committing a crime must be
 brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours and
 charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment
 or order the release of the detainee within 3 days of the
 examination unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit.
 The Constitution further states that the maximum duration of
 detention pending trial may not exceed a period of 1 year in
 the case of felonies or 6 months in the case of misdemeanors.
 A decision of a judicial council is required to extend these
 maximum durations (by 6 or 3 months, respectively) in
 exceptional cases. In practice, trials generally take place
 within 4 months of the submission of charges.
 Persons who have been arrested may petition a judicial council
 for release pending trial. The council is required by law to
 consider petitions within 5 days, but the limit is sometimes
 exceeded in practice. Release is granted only in special
 circumstances, e.g., for reasons of ill health, the standing
 of the perspf-,in the community, or when it is deemed unlikely
 that the persdn will become a fugitive. The council may also
 impose other conditions, such as the posting of a bond.
 Exile as a judicial remedy or government practice does not
 occur in Greece.
 The Constitution expressly prohibits forced labor, and no
 violations are known to have occurred in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are ensured by the Constitution and
 provided in practice. Defendants enjoy a presumption of
 
 
 929
 GREECE
 innocence. Defense lawyers are available to all accused
 persons. A defendant or his attorney may confront witnesses.
 Court sessions are public unless, as provided in the
 Constitution, the court decides that privacy is required for
 the protection of victims, when juveniles or moral offenses
 are involved, or in matters of national security. The latter
 provision is not abused. A legal provision permits a closed
 hearing for the sensitive portion of cases dealing with public
 order. In such instances, the court must publicly pronounce
 its "reasoned decision" on matters heard privately. A
 defendant may appeal a court verdict to an appeals court.
 Military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians. A 1983
 case involving the trial and sentencing of a U.S. serviceman,
 in a manner which did not meet standards of due process set
 forth in the applicable Status of Forces agreement, still
 remains under review by Greek authorities. There are no
 political prisoners in Greece.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life is protected by the Constitution. No
 house search may be made except in conformance with specified
 legal standards and always in the presence of representatives
 of the judiciary. Warrants, issued by a public prosecutor
 (who is considered a judicial officer in Greece), are required
 for an official to enter a private home. These constitutional
 provisions are respected in practice. A constitutional
 provision requires punishment and "liability for full damages
 to the sufferer" for violations of the sanctity of the home
 and for the abuse of power. The Constitution further ensures
 privacy of correspondence and communication. Opposition
 parties accused thd Government of illegal surveillance
 activity during 1987 and called for a parliamentary
 investigation. The Government established an all-party
 parliamentary investigatory committee to examine the matter.
 Private infractions are prosecuted.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of the press and
 prohibits censorship. Opposition viewpoints are constantly
 presented in the active Greek press, and criticism of the
 Government is unrestricted except by libel laws. Greece's
 television stations are government owned and operated. The
 political opposition (currently conservative and Communist)
 asserts that news and information programming tends to reflect
 the political perspective of the governing party, while its
 own views are neglected. The Government's response is that
 television is more open to the opposition than it was under
 the previous conservative government. During elections,
 television time is alloted to all major political parties
 according to their relative strength.
 In 1987 the Government sanctioned, pending enabling
 legislation, the establishment of municipally owned radio
 stations. Three such stations, which air a wide variety of
 viewpoints, have been launched thus far. It is expected that
 -privately owned broadcast facilities, also envisioned under
 
 
 930
 GREECE
 still pending legislation, will soon begin operations. In
 December the Government announced regulatory guidelines for
 municipally operated radio stations, which opposition parties
 protested as being too restrictive. Two municipalities, both
 controlled by the conservative opposition, attempted in late
 1987 to commence transmission of foreign television -
 broadcasts. The Government demolished the structures where
 the facilities were to be housed, and declared that it will
 enforce a 1975 law which prohibits the transmission of foreign
 television broadcasts by anyone other than the state-owned
 radio and television corporation.
 The Constitution allows for seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the President (the
 Head bf State), offend religious beliefs, contain obscene
 articles, advocate a violent overthrow of the political
 system, or disclose military and defense information. No
 periodicals or newspapers are known to have been seized in
 1987. Greece has strict libel laws. Violations of these laws
 are prosecuted under established legal procedures with the
 safeguards of due process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is provided for by the Constitution.
 Limits may be imposed on outdoor public meetings, however, if
 police authorities determine that a serious disturbance of
 social and economic life is threatened. A few demonstrations
 by small extremist groups were prohibited in 1987 following
 such determinations.
 The right of association is ensured by the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Workers and employers are free to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing without
 previous authorization, to draw up their own constitutions and
 rules, elect their representatives, and formulate their
 programs. They are also free to join in confederations and
 affiliate with international organizations. In 1987 an
 estimated 35 percent of Greek wage and salary earners were
 organized in unions. Both employer and trade union
 organizations maintain relations with the International Labor
 Organization. Trade union and employer organizations are
 protected against dissolution by administrative authority.
 The right to strike is provided for by the Constitution and by
 statute to both public and private sector workers. Exceptions
 are made for judiciary functionaries and those serving in the
 security services, who are prohibited from striking. Other
 employees of the State or public corporations, whose operation
 is of vital importance in serving the needs of the society,
 may only strike after 4 days' prior notice to their employer,
 the relevant ministry, and the Ministry of Labor. Striking
 trade unions in such categories are required to supply the
 necessarystaff to meet the essential requirements of the
 population during the strike. In 1984 the Government
 established procedures which placed greater restrictions on
 the rights of public sector unions to strike. Although these
 restrictions were criticized in some quarters, they were
 neither enforced nor challenged in the courts. In 1987 the
 restrictive legislation on public sector strikes was revoked
 although the effective date for the change has not yet been
 announced. Civil mobilization legislation, which allows the
 Government to mobilize striking public sector workers it
 considers vital to the economy, has been questioned on
 constitutional grounds. In a 1986 case involving the civil
 
 
 931
 GREECE
 mobilization and ultimate dismissal of Olympic Airlines
 personnel, government enforcement of the law was upheld by
 Greek courts.
 The main political parties maintain trade union affiliates,
 and most Greek trade unionists belong to or support one of
 those affiliates. In general, the trade union affiliates
 follow the guidance of their respective political parties.
 The Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) is currently
 controlled by PASKE (the governing Socialist Party's labor
 arm). Opposition labor factions boycotted or walked out of
 the GSEE congress in April 1986 and charged--both domestically
 and in international forums--that the present administration
 is illegal. This charge was not sustained by the courts.
 Labor unions are alleged not to be particularly effective in
 Greece as a result of the fragmentation of the labor movement
 and the central role of government in collective bargaining,
 arbitration, and the resolution of labor disputes. The
 Government has announced, but not yet implemented, a proposal
 for a new framework which would eliminate its role as
 arbitrator.
 All Greek wage earners by law contribute 0.25 percent of their
 basic wage to a Ministry of Labor organization known as The
 Workers' Hearth. Employers make a matching contribution. The
 Workers' Hearth uses this fund to finance trade union
 activities, apportioning funds to the unions in accordance
 with membership figures. The Minister of Labor has
 discretionary control over 8 percent of these funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discriminatory practices against religious
 minorities, which in Greece include small communities of
 Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox Christians. The Constitution,
 nevertheless, establishes the Eastern Orthodox Church of
 Christ, to which some 98 percent of the population at least
 nominally adheres, as the "prevailing" religion of Greece. In
 addition, it prohibits proselytizing by any religious group
 and bars exemptions for persons from discharging their duties
 to the State (i.e., military service) by reason of their
 religious convictions, As a result of these provisions,
 certain non-Orthodox 'religious groups, particularly
 evangelical sects, have encountered significant difficulties
 of a legal or administrative nature.
 In the past, the constitutional prohibition on proselytizing
 led primarily to the arrest and prosecution of Jehovah's
 Witnesses, although other non-Orthodox religious groups were
 also affected. The courts have recently held, however, that
 simple distribution of literature does not constitute
 "proselytizing," thereby sharply reducing the number of
 arrests. In December 1986, the courts convicted two local
 religious leaders who had attempted to prevent the
 distribution of religious material of Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Non-Orthodox religious groups have experienced difficulties as
 well in obtaining permits for the construction of places of
 worship. A building permit must be obtained from the Ministry
 of Education and Religion, which, in turn, must consider the
 opinion of the Eastern Orthodox hierarchy. In the past, some
 evangelical religious groups have.been denied such permits.
 
 
 932
 GREECE
 These groups have then appealed the Government's decision in
 the courts--without success.
 The Constitution includes the provision that "no person shall
 be exempt from discharging his obligations to the State or may
 refuse to comply with laws by reason of his religious
 convictions." Those persons most affected have been Jehovah's
 Witnesses who refuse on religious grounds to fulfill their
 military service obligation. In deference to them, the
 Government in 1977 modified the compulsory military service
 law to provide for alternative, noncombatant military
 service. Those refusing this alternative after induction are
 tried by military courts and sentenced to military prison, for.
 a period twice that of normal service. Currently, a portion
 of this sentence may be served in a civilian minimum security
 prison (frequently agricultural), where each day served is
 credited as,2 days toward fulfillment of the sentence. In
 1987 draft legislation was introduced in Parliament (but has
 not yet been considered) which will extend alternative
 noncombatant military service for those who refuse to bear
 arms for ideological reasons.
 The Muslim minority of approximately 126,000, made up of
 ethnic Turks, Pomaks, and some Gypsies, is principally located
 in Thrace in northeastern Greece. There are over 250 mosques
 in Greece. Muslims still disagree with the Government over
 the manner of appointment in December 1985 of a new religious
 leader (who also has judicial and administrative
 responsibilities) in one of the Muslim communities in Thrace,
 an appointment they argue should have followed the provisions
 of a 1920 Greek law. Greek authorities contend that this law
 was never implemented and is invalid and that all Muslim
 religious leaders (mufti), including the 1985 appointee, are
 selected according to a procedure dating from 1923, the date
 of the Treaty of Lausanne between Turkey and the Allied
 Powers. Under this method, the Government consults with
 Muslim leaders and then appoints the mufti from a list of
 qualified candidates.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution ensures freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. This right is
 generally respected in practice. Persons intending to
 emigrate and those returning to Greece experience no
 discrimination. The Greek citizenship code authorizes the
 revocation of citizenship of a citizen who is of foreign birth
 and is residing abroad with no intention of returning to
 Greece. Some Greek Muslims allege that their Greek
 citizenship was revoked while they were staying in Turkey.
 The Government states that the provision is used very
 sparingly, and only after it is determined that the citizen in
 question has severed material ties with Greece and established
 a permanent residence elsewhere. In 1982 the Government
 issued a decision which facilitates the repatriation of Greek
 citizens who have been in political exile in Eastern Europe
 since the end of the civil war in 1949.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 
 
 933
 GREECE
 laws and the officials governing them. The opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media, and hold public
 meetings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human rights organizations. Domestic human rights
 organizations are allowed to operate freely and actively
 assist those who believe that their rights have been
 violated. The Government also participates in multilateral
 human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both the Constitution and the Revised Family Law grant women
 the same individual, political, and social rights as men.
 Women leaders play a secondary role in the political life of
 the country, (e.g., there are 11 women in the 300-member
 Parliament). Women are represented in the Cabinet, and five
 serve as regional governors. The position of women in Greek
 society has undergone rapid change in conjunction with the
 process of industrialization and modernization, with
 increasing proportions joining the salaried labor force.
 Although the Constitution and legislation mandate equal wages
 for men and women performing the same task, disparities
 continue to exist. According to government data, in March
 1987 the average wage for women in industry was about $16.70
 per day, while men received an average of about $20.10. The
 Government's explanation for this disparity is that women have
 less night work and overtime, have fewer duties, and do not
 receive a family allowance. The Government has given
 concerted attention to the role of women, has instituted
 significant reforms in marriage, divorce, and property laws,
 and has expanded services to women in unemployment, family
 planning, and child care.
 The Treaty of Lausanne includes provisions relating to the
 educational and cultural rights of the Muslim minority, who
 are Greek citizens. Two Muslim members serve in the national
 Parliament. Many villages in Thrace regularly elect Muslim
 mayors.
 Members of the Muslim community complain that Turkish-language
 teaching materials imported from Turkey are vetted by Greek
 officials, as are Turkish teachers assigned to Muslim
 schools. The Greek Government states that educational
 materials and teachers are examined to ensure they meet Greek
 standards, according to the terms of a 1968 reciprocal
 agreement with Turkey. Muslim leaders have also complained
 that Muslims are not allowed to purchase land from
 non-Muslims. Greek officials maintain that there is no
 impediment to the Muslim right to purchase land, and that
 purchases have been made. Muslim minority associations in
 western Thrace have been denied the use of the word "Turkish"
 to describe themselves on the grounds that the Treaty of
 Lausanne recognizes only a Muslim minority in Greece. Greek
 courts have upheld this ruling.
 Tensions between Greece and Turkey have made each country's
 perception of the treatment of its coreligionists in the other
 qountry a sensitive issue, and both countries have viewed
 
 
 934
 GREECE
 human rights questions in light of historical and political
 differences. There is no evidence, however, of a generalized
 pattern of political, religious, or cultural repression of the
 Muslim community or a deliberate policy of discrimination by
 the Greek Government.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for work in industry is 15. However,
 legislation and regulations provide alternate minimum ages for
 work in specified areas or specific jobs. For example, those
 performing loading or unloading work must be at least 18,
 while workers for the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki must
 be 21. In family businesses, theaters, and the cinema the
 minimum age is 12 years. These age limits are generally
 respected, except in families engaged in agriculture or
 merchandising, in which younger children often assist part
 time or full time.
 The minimum daily wage in Greece as of September 1, 1987, was
 $13.50. Minimum wages and salaries, established by the
 national collective bargaining agreement and by branch
 collective bargaining agreements, are generally respected by
 employers. Employees who believe that they receive less than
 the minimum to which they are entitled may file a complaint
 with either the Ministry of Labor or the National Social
 Security Scheme which promptly investigates the allegation.
 The workweek is 40 hours in the private sector and 37.5 hours
 in the public sector.
 Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 provided for by legislation. Although the Greek Confederation
 of Labor characterizes health and safety legislation as
 satisfactory, it charges that enforcement of the legislation
 is inadequate and cites the high number of job-related
 accidents. The National Statistical Service reported, for
 example, that in 1983, 2.4 percent of workers insured by the
 National Social Security Scheme were injured at work.
 Enforcement reportedly suffers because of inadequate
 inspection, failure to enforce compliance with regulations,
 and outdated industrial equipment and plant.
