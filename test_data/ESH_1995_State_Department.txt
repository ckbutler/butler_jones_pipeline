 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of a dispute between
 the Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front, an organization seeking inde-
 pendence for the region. The Moroccan Government assumed administration of the
 northern two-thirds of the Western Sahara after Spain withdrew from the area in
 1975, and it extended its administration to Oued Ed Dahab after Mauritania re-
 nounced its claim to it in 1979. The Moroccan Government has undertaken a sizable
 economic development program in the part of the Western Sahara under its control.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front has challenged successively the claims of Spain,
 Mauritania, and Morocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces had fought
 intermittently from 1975 to the 1991 cease-fire and deployment to the area of a
 United Nations peacekeeping ontingent, known by its French initials, MINURSO.
 In 1975 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the sta-
 tus of the Western Sahara. The Court held that while the region's tribes had histori-
 cal ties to Morocco, the ties were not enough to warrant recognition of Moroccan sov-
 ereignty. According to the Court, the pople of the Western Sahara, called Sshrawis,
 are entitled to self-determination. Most Sahrawis live in the area administerd by
 Morocco, but there is a sizable regee opulation near the Western Saharan border,
 in Algeria, and to a lesser extent, in Mauritania. The bulk of the Sahrwi popu-
 lation lives within the area delineated by a Moroccan-constrcted berm, which en-
 closes most the territory's land.
 Efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sovereignty
 question collapsed in 1984 when the OAU recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic
 Repubic, the c     a           Polisario Front. Morocco withdrew from the OAU
 1988 Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted the United Nations' plan for a
 referendum that would allow the Sahrawis to decide between integration with Mo-
 rocco or independence for the region. The referendum was scheduled for January
 1992 but was postponed because the parties were unable to agree on a common list
 of eligible voters. A complicated formula for determining voter eligibility was ulti-
 mately devised, and in August 1994 MINURSO personnel began to hold identifica-
 tion sessions for voter applicants. At such hearings, applicants must present evi-
 dence of identity and residence; tribal elders may present testimony on the bona
 ides of an applicant's claim.
 The voter identification process has been halted numerous times because of the
 refusal of one party or the other to participate in the proceedings. Matters were fur-
 ther delayed in June when the Polisario Front withd w from the identification
 process for several weeks. This action was taken to protest 20-year sentences hand-
 ed down to eight Sahrawi youths arrested following demonstations in Laayoune de-
 manding Saharan independence. The sentences were later commuted to 1 year,
 leading the Polisario Front to rejoin the identification process. In an October report,
 Human Rights Watch alleged that the Moroccan Government has obstructed the
 U.N.-sponsored referendum and that the United Nations has exercised inadequate
 control over the process.

 Since 1977 the Saharan provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections. The southern province of Oued Ed Dahab has par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections since 1983. Sarawis fill all 10 seats allotted to the
 Western Sahara in the Moroccan Parliament.
 The civilian population living in the Western Sahara under Moroccan administra-
 tion is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign human rights groups
 report that Sahrawis have difficulty obtaining Moroccan passpots, that the Govern-
 ment monitors the political views of Sahrawis more closely than those of Moroccan
 citizens, and that the police and paramilitary authorities react especially harshly
 against those suspcted of supporting indepenence and the Polisario Front.
 After years of deny..g that Sarawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government released 300 such prisoners in
 1991. Entire families and Sahrawis who had disappeared in the mid-1970's were
 among those released. The Government has failed to conduct a public inquiry or to
 explain how and why those released were held for up to 16 years in incommunicado
 detention without charge or trial.
 There were reports of over 20 disappearances during the year, most occurring in
 May following demonstrations in Laayoune advocating Saharan indepndence. The
 disappeared were presumably arrested following the demonstrations. Eight Sabrawi
 youths were arrested during the demonstrations and put on trial for "threatening
 the security of the State" (see Section i.e. of the Morocco report).
 The Polisario Front claims that t            e continues to hold several hun-
 dred Sahrawis as political prisoners. The Government formally denies that any
 Sahrawi noncombatants remain in detention. According to the International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Morocco holds 66 Sabrawi combatants, and 6 civil-
 ians, as prisoners of war (POWs).
 The ICRC also reports that the Polisario holds approximately 2,000 Moroccan
 POWs. In November a group of 185 of them were repatriated to Morocco in a hu-
 manitarian airlift conducted under ICRO auspices. The Moroccan Government had
 earlier refused to accept these POWs.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. Elsewhere, security forces subject travelers to arbitrary questioning and de-
 tention.There is little organized labor activity in the Western Sahara. The same
 labor laws that apply in Mo    are applied in the Moroccan-controlled areas of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccan unions are present in the Moroccan-controlled Western
 Sahara but are moribund. The 15 percent of the territory outside Moroccan control
 does not have any major population centers or economic activity beyond nomadic
 herding. The Polisario-sponsored labor union, the Sario Federation of Labor, not ac-
 tive in the Western Sahara.
 There were no strikes, other job actions, or collective bargaining agreements in
 1995. Most union members are employees of the Government or state-owned organi-
 zations. They are paid 85 percent more than their counterparts outside the Western
 Sahara. Workers m the Western Sahara are exempt from income and value-addd
 taxes and receive subsidies on such commodities as flour, oil, sugar, fuel, and utili-
 ties.
 Moroccan law prhlbits forced labor, which does not appear to exist in the West-
 earn Sahara. Regulations on the minimum age of employment are the same as in Mo-
 rocco. Child labor appears to be less common than in Morocco, primarily because
 of the absence of industries most likely to employ children, such as r  knotting and
 garment making. A government work program    or adults, the Promotion Nationale,
 provides families with enough income that children need not be hired out as domes-
 tic servants. Children in the few remaining nomadic groups presumably work as
 shepherds along with other gup members. Adult unemployment in the Western
 Sahara is below 5 percent. The minimum wage and maximum hours of work are
 the same as in Morocco. In practice, however, workers in some fish processing
 plants may work as much as 12 hours per day, 6 days per week, well beyond the
 10-hour day, 48-hour week maximum stipulated in Moroccan law. Occupational
 health and safety standards are the same as those enforced in Morocco. They are
 rudimentary, except for a prohibition on the employment of women in dangerous oc-
 cupations.
