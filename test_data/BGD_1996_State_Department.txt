 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy headed by Prime Minister Sheikh
 Hasina Wajed, leader of the Awami League, which came to power in national elec-
 tions in June. Major opposition parties include the previous ruling Bangladesh Na-
 tionalist Party (BNP), the Jatiyo Party and Jamaat-E-Islami. Elections under the
 BNP in February were boycotted by all other major parties (which demanded that
 the BNP hand over power to a neutral caretaker administration) and marred by rig-
 ging and violence. Faced with mounting antigovernment agitation, the Parliament
 in March passed a constitutional amendment requiring a caretaker regime for all
 future general parliamentary elections. The June elections, under a caretaker gov-
 ernment headed by a retired Chief Justice, were deemed to be generally free and
 fair by domestic and international observers. Although the BNP blamed its losses
 on vote-rigging by the Awami League and partisan government employees, it none-
 theless joined Parliament as the largest opposition party. The judiciary displays a
 high degree of independence.
 The Home Affairs Ministy controls the police and paramilitary forces, which bear
 rimary responsibility for maintaininginternal security. The army and paramilitary
 orces are responsible for security in the Chttagong Hill Tracts (CHT), where a trib-
 al group has waged a low-level insurgency since 1974. A case-fire between govern-
 ment forces and insurgents generally held throughout the year; however, there were
 sporadic violations. Police officers committed a number of serious human rights
 abDUses.
 Bangladesh is a poor country. Annual per capita income is approximately $250;
 about 43 percent of the counts 123 mlion people exist on incomes insufficient
 to meet minimum daily needs. Eighty percent of the work force is involved in agri-
 culture, which accounts for approximately one-third of the gross domestic product.
 There is a growing industrial sector, based leely on the manufacture of garments,
 textiles, industrial goods such as rerolled steel, cement, and jute. There is a small
 wealthy elite, and a middle class is emerging. Efforts to reform the economy have
 been hampered by political turmoil and the opposition of public sector enterprises,
 government bureaucrats, and other vested interests.
 The Government continues to restrict or deny many fundamental rights. Police
 committed extrajudicial killings, and 17 detainees reportedly died in police custody.
 Police routinely use torture and other forms of abuse in interrogating suspects. The
 Government rarely convicts and punishes those responsible for torture or unlawful
 deaths. The Government continues to use national security laws to detain political
 opponents and other citizens without formal charge. A large case backlog slows the
 judicial process, and lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. The Government places
 some limitations on freedom of assembly. Women, minorities, the disabled, religious
 minorities, and indigenous people face societal discrimination. Violence against
 women and prostittion and trafficking of children remain serious problems. The
 Government continues to limit worker rights, and child labor is a problem.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were numerous extrajudicial
 killings during the year. In the western city of Bogra, from August 22 to 25, violence
 between police and students lead to the death of three students and a police officer.
 The violence began when, following the death of a student in a traflic accident,
 other students staged a violent demonstration and attacked buses. Police then fired
 on the demonstrators, killing two students, and the demonstrators in turn shot and
 killed a police officer. During a confrontation the next day at the police station,_po-
 lice shot and killed another student. The firings wound many other persons. The
 Government established a judicial investigation committee, which has yet to issue
 a report. While in this weI-publicized case the Government compensated the fami-
 lies of those killed, and withdrew several police officers from the post, a general cli-
 mate of police impunity from punishment remains a serious obstacle to ending po-
 lice abuse and extrajudicial killings.
 According to human rights monitors, 17 persons died while in custody in the first
 9 months of 1996. According to the Government, six persons died in custody, but
 there was no evidence that any died from mistreatment. However, numerous press
 and human rights reports concerning police abuse and deaths of prisoners indicate
 that this claim is inaccurate and masks serious abuse. For example, in July police
 reportedly beat to death two men in their custody in Dhaka. In October police re-
 portedly tortured to death an activist of the BNP youthwing, the Jatiybadi Jubo
 Dal, in Dhaka.
 Violence, often resulting in killings, is a pervasive element in the political process.
 Demonstrators from all parties, and even within parties, often clash with police and
 with each other during rallies and demonstrations. The year was marked by wide-
 spread political violence leading to numerous deaths. In June journalist and Awami
 League member S. M. Alauddin was killed, possibly due to factional fighting within
 the party (see Section 2.a.). BNP activists used deadly force to disrupt opposition
 p arty gatherings. The Awami League, and other opposition parties, used armed vio-
 lence and intimidation to enforce their bycott of the February national elections
 and to enforce numerous general strikes. They similarly disrupted BNP gatherings
 and government activities. The violence perpetrated by both sides resulted in more
 than 100 deaths, hundreds of injuries, extensive property damage, and large busi-
 ness losses across the country.
 Violence among student political groups, allied with the major national parties,
 is endemic and reportedly resulted in at least 12 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and
 the closure of dozens of educational institutions. For example, in August struggles
 between rival student groups for control of dormitories resulted in approximately
 100 injuries and the closure of Dhaka University for 20 days. In September a clash
 between student activists of rival parties in Cox's Bazar led to one shooting death,
 and a day-long hartal (general strike) stopping commerce and movement in that
 town.
 In 1995 the Government charged former President Hossain Mohammed Ershad
 with ordering the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of President Ziaur Rabman.
 Previously held in Dhaka central jail, Ershad is currently held in converted quarters
 (a "subjail") within the Parliament compound. He was moved there by the new
 Awami League government in July, when Parliament convened. He enjoys periods
 of 24-hour parole to attend Parliament sessions (he was elected as a Member of Par-
 liament for the second time in June), although he cannot leave the Parliament
 premises. The murder case is not being actively pursued by the Government. Ershad
 was already serving a 20-year sentence for corruption (see Section 1.c.).
 In August the Government arrested under the Special Powers Act (SPA) retired
 Lt. Colonel Farok Rahman, the self-confessed organizer of the 1975 assassination
 of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The Government initially told the press
 that Farook was suspected of illegal weapons possession and plotting to assassinate
 government officials; later, however, it officially accused him with the 1975 killings
 in Dhaka Central Jail of four Awami League leaders. Two alleged accomplices in
 the 1975 murders were arrested at the same time as Farook. Several diplomats
 were also recalled from abroad as suspected coconspirators (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There was one possible incident of politically motivated dis-
 appearance during the year. On June 12, Kalpana Chakma, Central Organizing Sec-
 retary of the Hill Womens' Federation, an organization of tribal people in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts, disappeared from her house. Witnesses and human rights
 monitors allege that the army abducted her, but one human rights group reported
 that she was alive in India. The Government formed an investigative committee
 which has yet to issue any findings.
 
 
 1419
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading pun-
 ishment, police routinely employ psychological and physical torture and other abuse
 during arrests and interrogations. Torture may consist of threats, beatings, and, oc-
 casionally, the use of electric shock. The Government rarely convicts or punishes
 those responsible for torture, and a climate of impunity allows such police abuses
 to continue.
 Police brutality occurs regularly, and government inaction allows it to continue.
 In January police raided a dormitory at Dhaka University inhabited mainly by eth-
 nic and religious minority students, ostensibly to search for illegal weapons. The
 dormitory was well-known as a stronghold of the Awami League Student Front Or-
 ganization. Police reportedly used excessive force, and more than 200 students were
 injured. In June police attacked and injured at least 30 journalists who were cover-
 ing the sweaning-m of new members of Parliament.
 Numerous press and human rights monitors' reports indicate that police abuse of
 detainees is a widespread problem and fequently results in death (see Section l.a.).
 Lt. Col. Farok Rabman was arrested on August 13 under the SPA, and later ac-
 cused in connection with the 1975 deaths in Dhaka Central Jail of four senior
 Awami League party officials. During his 32 days in police remand, the police re-
 fused to grant his family and lawyers access to him. According to unconfirmed press
 reports and sources close to his family, he was subjected to various forms of torture.
 Rape in police custody is also a problem. In July a police officer in a village near
 Dinaj pur reportedly raped a woman._In October four police officers raped a woman
 they had arrested near Chittagng. In this case, the four officers were suspended
 from their positions and arrested. The press reported seven instances of rape in po-
 lice custdy during the first 9 months of the year, but women's rights activists esti-
 mate that the real number was several times higher.
 Most prisons are overcrowded and lack adequate facilities. The current prison
 ulation nearly 45,000 in August, is more than double the official rison capacity.
 Tereare three classes of ells: A, B, and C. Common criminals and iow-level politi-
 cal workers are generally held in C cells, which often have dirt floors, no furnish-
 ings, and poor quality food. The use of restraining devices on prisoners in these cells
 is common. Prisoners in the C cells reportedly suffer the worst abuses, including
 beatings or being forced to kneel for long periods. Conditions in B and A cells are
 markedly better; A cells are reserved for prominent prisoners.
 A government-appointed committee of private citizens monitors prisons monthly
 but does not release its findings. In general, the Government does not permit prison
 visits by independent human rights monitors but does make occasional exceptions.
 Former President Ershad is serving a 20-year sentence for corruption. He was
 also charged during 1995 with the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of President
 Zia (see Stion  .a.). Ershad's treatment and ondition came under scrutiny in late
 1995 due to complaints from his family about inadequate medical care to treat his
 health problems (hepatitis), and poor living conditions. His health slowly improved,
 however, and the Government insisted that it was providing treatment equal to or
 better than that of any local hospital. In July the Government moved Ershad to a
 sub-jail within the Parliament compound.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Both the BNP and Awami Leaue Gov-
 ernments continued to use national security legislation, namely the Specia Powers
 Act (SPA) of 1974, to detain citizens without formal charges or specific complaint
 being filed against them. Past governments have vowed to abolish the SPA, but so
 far there has been no action.
 Under the SPA, the Government or a district magistrate may, to prevent the com-
 mission of an act likely "to prejudice the security of the country", order anyone de-
 tained for 30 days. The Government (or magstrate) must within 15 days inform the
 detainee of the grounds for detention, and the Government must within 30 days ap-
 prove the grounds for detention or release the detainee. In practie, detainees are
 sometimeseld for Ionger periods without the Government stating the grounds for
 the detention or formaly approving it. Detainees may appeal their detention, and
 the Government may grant early release.
 After 4 months, an advisory board composed of two persons who have been, or
 are qualified to be High Court judges, and one civil servant examines cases of de-
 tainees. If the Government adequately defends its detention order, the detainee re-
 mains imprisoned; if not, the detainee is released. Detainees are allowed to consult
 with lawyers while in detention, although usually not until a charge is filed. Detain-
 ees may receive visitors, and incommunicado detention is generally not practiced.
 However, the Government has held incommunicado some prominent prisoners, nota-
 bly Lt. Col. Farook Rahman. In addition, it several times extended Farook's time
 in police remand (see Section i.c.).
 
 
 1420
 According to the Government, the authorities detained more than 3,600 persons
 under the SPA during the first 9 months of the year, approximately 1,400 during
 the BNP government (January to March) and 1,250 following the elections (July to
 September). As of September, the courts had ordered about 2,700 detainees re-
 leased. Government figures indicate that almost 1,000 persons were in detention
 under the SPA at the end of September. Human rights monitors and political activ-
 ists charge that both the BNP and Awami League governments have used the SPA
 as a tool to harass and intimidate political opponents. The claim that both govern-
 ments arrested hundreds of opposition activitists under te SPA, most being later
 released when no charges could be brought. Actual numbers of party activists ar-
 rested were not verifiable.
 In February the Government arrested five senior opposition party leaders under
 the SPA, including the Awami League mayor of Chittagong. All were released with-
 in 2 weeks.
 The Government allowed another widely used statute, the Anti-Terrorism Act to
 expire in 1994. However, 120 cases filed under this act were still pending on Sep-
 tember 30, and 52 cases came to trial during the first 9 months of the year.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary displays a high degree of independ-
 ence, as mandated by the Constitution, especially at the higher levels. The judiciary
 often rules against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically controver-
 sial cases.
 The court system has two levels the lower courts and the Supreme Court. Both
 hear civil and criminal cases. The lower court consists of magistrates, who are part
 of the administrative branch of government, and session judges, who belong to the
 judicial branch. The Supreme Court is divided into two sections, the High Court and
 the Appellate Court. The High Court hears original cases and also reviews cases
 from the lower court. The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals of judg-
 ments, decrees, orders, or sentences of the High Court. Rulings of the Appellate
 Court are binding on all other courts.
 Trials are public. The law provides the accused with the right to be represented
 by counsel, to review accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal verdicts.
 In practice, the largely rural, illiterate population does not always understand these
 rights, nor do the authorities always respect them. There is a system of bail, and
 bail is commonly granted for both violent and nonviolent crimes. However, if bail
 is not granted, the law does not specify a time limit on pretrial detention. State-
 funded defense attorneys are rarely provided, and there are few legal aid programs
 to offer financial assistance.
 There is corruption within the legal process. Small sums must be paid to a num-
 ber of court officials in order for a civil suit to be fied. While these may appear
 to be processing fees, they are more in the nature of bribes; they are not estab ished
 by statute or regulation, are paid to officials personally, and there is no accountabil-
 ity for failure to discharge duties paid for. Defendants can sometimes pay to avoid
 being served with a notice or suit. Because of the difficulty accessing the courts and
 because litigation is time-consuming, alternate dispute resolution by traditional vil-
 lage leaders is popular in rural communities.
 Amajor problem of the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases. Accord-
 ing to government testimony in Parliament, about 720,000 cases in July were pend-
 ing in criminal and civil courts (almost a 50 percent increase from 1995), and more
 than 30,000 people, or 67 percent of the country's total prison population, were
 awaiting trial. Government sources show that the period between detention and
 trial averages 6 months, but press and human rights groups report many instances
 of pretrial detention lasting or several years. These conditions, and the corruption
 encountered in the judicial process, effectively prevent many people from obtaining
 a fair trial or justice.
 The Government claims that it holds no political prisoners, but both the BNP and
 Awami League charge that their activists have been arrested under the SPA for po-
 litical reasons (see Section 2.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a home. However,
 according to human rights monitors, police rarely obtain warrants, and officers vio-
 lating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the SPA permits searches with-
 out a warrant. The Government reportedly opens international mail and monitors
 telephone calls on occasion.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Shanti Bahini, a tribal group, has waged a low-level conflict in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) since the early 1970's to deter nontribal Bengali set-
 tlers who seek to exploit the Tracts' fertile and sparsely populated land. Govern-
 
 
 1421
 ment settlement programs increased the number of Bengali inhabitants in the CHT
 from 3 percent of the region's total population in 1947 to an estimated 48 percent
 in 1996. Although the Government prohibits further settlement of the area except
 for the purpose of starting a business, such as rubber planting, citizens from the
 flatlands continue to arrive.
 All of the groups that participate in or are affected by the conflict--indigenous
 tribes, settlers, and security forces-have accused each oter of human rights viola-
 tions. It is difficult to verify facts in specific incidents because government travel
 restrictions, tight securi  difficult terrain, and unsafe conditions created by the in-
 surgency limit access to the area.
 In September the most violent incident occurred in several years of conflict. Twen-
 ty-eight Bengali woodcutters were abducted by the Shanti Bahini and murdered,
 possibly the result of a dispute over payment of "tolls" (protection money extorted
 by the Shanti Bahini). A government-appointed committee is investigating the
 killings.
 In other violence related to the Chittagong Hills conflict, several police officers,
 soldiers, rebels, and noncombatants were killed during the first 9 months of the
 year.
 During the political turmoil of the first half of the year, there was little progress
 in the Government's talks with Shanti Bahini's political wing, the Jana Sanghati
 Samiti (JSS). However the two sides agreed at short regular intervals to extend
 their cease-fire. Talks between the two groups resumed in late December, during
 which they extended the cease-fire until March 31, 1997.
 The Government estimates that 45,000 Chakma tribal members fled the conflict
 in the CHT and sought shelter in refugee camps in India. Few of them returned
 to Bangladesh in 1996. The Shanti Bahini allegedly discouraged refugees from repa-
 triating, and organizations based in the hills claim that returnees face persecution
 by the Government. Government officials claim that voluntary refugee returns, al-
 though small in number, increased slightly from the previous year and that the
 Government assisted returned refugees in their resettlement.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 expression, and the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of secu-
 rity, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, and morality, or
 to prohibit defamation or incitement to an offense. With some exceptions the Gov-
 ernment generally respects freedom of speech. On occasion the BNP government
 censored criticism of Islam.
 Following the boycotted February elections, the press played a key role in per-
 suading the BNP Government to turn over power to a caretaker government in
 April, setting the stage for the national elections in June, won by the Awami
 League. Demonstrations in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka and nation-
 wide strikes were widely reported. Candidates from dozens of political parties cam-
 paigned freely prior to the June elections, and in several subsequent by-elections.
 Allegations by the BNP of Awami League voter fraud in September by-election bal-
 loting in two constituencies were reported openly in the press. The BNP regularly
 stages walk-outs of parliamentary sessions and threatens noncooperation with the
 Government, all of which is widely reported in the press.
 There is one government-owned and one privately owned wire service that distrib-
 ute news nationally. In September the Awami League reportedly issued verbal guid-
 ance to the government wire service to allow stories that are critical of the Govern-
 ment but not those that are "atrocious" or "unfairly overly critical."
 Newspaper ownership and content are not subject to direct government restric-
 tion. The press, numbering hundreds of daily and weekly publications, is a forum
 for a wide range of views. Newsprint is allocated from government factories at sub-
 sidized prices. Papers that cannot obtain enough government newsprint to meet
 their needs must buy it on the open market at higher prices. On occasion govern-
 ment favoritism in allocating newsprint is alleged. An acute shortage of newsprint
 in early 1996 resulted in many newspapers reducing the number of their pages.
 Some editors complain that the Government places advertising to reward support-
 ers and punish critical newspapers, a practice that fosters self-censorship.
 Foreign publications are subject to censorship. When enforced, this is most often
 for immodest or obscene photographs or perceived misrepresentation of Islam.
 In August the Awami League Government allowed the circulation of the Indian-
 published Bengali language magazine Desh. It had been banned since 1994 for pub-
 lishing an article containing comments perceived to cast doubt on the legitimacy of
 Bangladesh.
 
 
 1422
 The Government owns and controls radio and television, which under both the
 BNP and Awami League have provided more extensive and favorable coverage to
 the ruling party than to the opposition. While several local business people have ex-
 pressed interest in establishing private radio and television stations, there are no
 indications that this is likely to happen in the near future. However, the British
 Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Cable News Network (CNN) international
 news and features are retransmitted live and uncensored for several hours each day.
 There are no restrictions on the installation of satellite dishes, which are widely
 owned both in Dhaka and throughout the country, including remote villages.
 The Government's film censor board did not ban any films during the year, how-
 ever, in past years the board banned several locally produced and foreign films, usu-
 ally on the grounds that the films promoted immorality. The fim censor board also
 considers issues of state security, law and order, religious sentiment, foreign rela-
 tions, defamation of a person, and plagiarism in deciding whether to ban a film.
 In June S.M. Alauddin, editor of the Khulna newsweekly Patradut was killed in
 the town of Satkhira. Alauddin was a member of the ruling Awami League, which
 the week before had gained power. Five persons were arrested in connection with
 the murder, but speculation persists that others escaped and that the killing was
 the result of factional fighting within the party.
 In June at least 30 journalists were injured at the Parliament building when
 baton-wielding plice charged reporters and photographers covering the oathtking
 of newly eleted members of Parliament from the Jatiyo Party.
 In September, following th         n in whc the opposition BNP lost seats,
 several BNP activists assaulted eight hotographers covering a BNP rally in Dhaka
 near Bangla Motor Crossing. They   so threatened to seek out journalists from a
 newspaper critical of the BN. BN officials condemned the attack while blaming
 it- on Awami League infiltrators.
 Feminist author Taslima Nasreen, whose writings and statements provoked death
 threats from some Islamic groups in 1993 and 1994, has remained abroad since her
 departure for Europe in 1994. The Government charged Nasreen in 1994 under a
 section of the Penal Code that stipulates punishment for anyone convicted of inten-
 tionally insulting religious beliefs, but it did not actively pursue its case against her
 during 1996. The Government has taken no action against those who issued death
 threats against Nasreen, even though such threats also violate the law.
 Academic freedom is generally respected. Teachers and students at all levels are
 free to pursue academic assignments except on extremely sensitive religious and po-
 litical topics.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, subject to restrictions in the interest of public order and public
 health. The Government sometimes prohibits rallies for security reasons.
 Both the Government and opposition parties frequently interfere with each other's
 rallies and public meetings. Throughout the year partisans of the ruling and opposi-
 tion parties used violence to disrupt political gatherings. In addition, both have used
 a statute that allows public assemblies to be prohibited-to prevent possible vio-
 lence-if two or more parties have scheduled rallies for the same time and place.
 Political parties, after learning of planned opposing-party public gatherings, sched-
 ule other rallies for the same time and place, in hopes of forcing authorities to can-
 cel both events.
 The Constitution provides for the right of every citizen to form associations, sub-
 ject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of morality or public order, and in
 general the Government respects this right. In practice, individuals are free to join
 private groups, but a local magistrate must approve public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion
 but also stipulates the right to practice the religion of one's choice, and the Govern-
 ment respects this provision in practice. Approximately 88 percent of the 123 million
 population is Muslim Some members of the Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minori-
 ties continue to perceive and experience discrimination toward them from the major-
 ity community (see Section 5).
 The law permits citizens to proselytize. However, strong social resistance to con-
 version from Islam means that many of the missionary efforts by non-Muslims are
 aimed at Hindus and tribal groups. The Government allows various religions to es-
 tablish places of worship, train clergy, travel for religious purposes, and maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad. Foreign missionaries may work in Bangladesh, but
 their right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution, and proselytization
 is frequently discouraged by the Government. Missionaries sometimes face problems
 in obtaining visas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are able to move freely within the country. Travel by foreign-
 
 
 1423
 ers is restricted in the CHT and some other border areas. Citizens are generally free
 to travel abroad and emigrate. The right of repatriation is generally observed.
 Approximately 250,000 Rohingyas (Muslims from Burma's Arakan province)
 crossed into southeastern Bangladesh in late 1991 and early 1992, fleeing repres-
 sion. Following voluntary repatriation efforts by the U.N. High Commisioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 31,000 Rohingyas remain in the area of Cox's
 Bazar. The UNHCR estimates that the majority of the remaining refugees will repa-
 triate in 1996; however, repatriation efforts were slowed by reports early in the year
 of violence and other abuse inside Burma against returning refugees and by the lim-
 ited number of clearances issued by Burmese authorities.
 During the first 5 months of 1996 another influx of Rohingyas arrived. Estimates
 of their numbers vary from 6,000 to 15,000, and most are thought to be living in
 villages and towns in the southeast. Many other Rohingyas, considered by both the
 BNPand Awami League governments to be economic migrants rather than refu-
 gees were reportedly forced back into Burma by Bangladesh security forces. On
 April 20, 15 Rohingyas drowned near Teknaf when their boat capsized after
 Bangladeshi securityforces ordered it back to Burma.
 In August about 200 people reported to be Bangladeshis working illegally in
 Pakistan, were forced back to Pakistan when they attempted to enter Bangladesh.
 The Government said that they carried false passports, denied their claim to citizen-
 ship, and excluded them from the country without judicial process. This occurred
 despite efforts by their local family members to persuade the Government that the
 returnees were citizens.
 There are about 238,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis, who have re-
 mained in Bangladesh since 1971 awaiting settlement in Pakistan.
 Bangladesh is not a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government generally cooperates with
 the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The law
 does not provide for first asylum or resettlement of asylum seekers. However, the
 Government does in practice grant temporary asylum to individual asylum seekers
 whom the UNHCR has interviewed and recognized as refugees, on a case by case
 basis. At the request of the UNHCR, the Government has allowed about 200 asylum
 seekers, mostly from Somalia and Iran, to remain in Bangladesh for several years,
 until they can arrange their resettlement in a third country. In the case of the early
 1996 Rohinga arrivals and attempted arrivals, the Government effectively denied
 first asylumby catagorizing them as illegal economic migrants, denng theUNHCR
 official access to those that did successfully enter Bangladesh, jailing at least200
 of them with common criminials, and turning back as many as possible at the bor-
 der. Abuses such as the forced return and mistreatment of individual refugees al-
 ready living in UNHOR camps have been reported, but these appear to be the excep-
 tion rather than the rule. Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) with access to
 the camps claimed that the new arrivals had fled various hardships and mistreat-
 ment, including forced labor.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bangladesh is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which elections by secret
 ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage. Members of Parliament are elected
 at least every 5 years. The Parliament has 300 elected members, with 30 additional
 seats reserved for women, who are in turn elected by Parliament.
 Bangladesh held national elections twice in 1996, in February and June. Since
 March 1994, when opposition parties accused the BNP of intimidation and'vote-rig-
 e      a parliamentary by-election, the Parliament had been attended onl  B
 Members of Parliament. The combined opposition parties, led by the AwamiLeague
 under Sheikh Hasina, first boycotted Parliament and later resigned their seats (146
 in all), demanding that general elections be held under a neutral caretaker adminis-
 tration. Despite the boycott, resignations, and continuing agitation programs (ral-
 lies, demonstrations, transport blockades, and general strikes), the Parliament re-
 mained in session until the end of its 5-year term. The February elections, held
 under the BNP Government, were boycotted and actively resisted by all major oppo-
 sition parties. illegal actions by both opposition and ruling party activists marred
 the election. Opposition parties, led bythe Awa  League, engaged in widespread
 intimidation of voters, including attacks on polling places and theft of ballot boxes,
 in order to reduce turnout. The ruling BNP engagedin ballot-be x stuffing to ensure
 the victory of its candidates. Many B h candidates were elected unopposed in many
 constituencies, and the BNP ended u with all but two seats in Parliament.
 In the face of increasing pressure from the combined opposition (a continuous gen-
 eral strike or "noncooperation movement" virtually shut down the country for 3
 
 
 1424
 
 weeks in March), the Parliament drafted and passed a constitutional amendment
 mandating a neutral caretaker government for future interim periods after the dis-
 solution of Parliament prior to general elections. The BNP then dissolved Par-
 liament and, according to the terms of the amendment, handed over power to a
 caretaker administration headed by the President. All parties participated in the
 June elections; domestic and international observers deemed these to be generally
 free and fair, and high voter turnout set new records for the country. The Awami
 League won a majority of seats (more than 170, including reserved women's seats)
 and formed a government. The BNP charged the Awami League and government
 employees with conspiring to rig the vote, but it nevertheless joined Parliament and,
 with 113 seats, became the largest opposition party in the country's history.
 In addition to the 30 parliamentary seats reserved for women (whose occupants
 are chosen by Parliament), women are free to contest any seat in Parliament. Seven
 women were elected in their own right in the June national elections. Seats are not
 specifically reserved for other minority groups, such as tribal peoples. However, trib-
 al peoples have some parliamentary representation; eight members from minority
 groups won seats in the last elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permits human rights groups to conduct their activi-
 ties. In 1996 such groups published reports, held press conferences, and issued ap-
 peals to the Government with regard to specific cases. The Government is sensitive
 to international opinion regarding human rights issues. It has been open to dialog
 with international organizations and foreign diplomatic missions regarding issues
 such as detention of opposition leaders and problems of trafficking in women and
 children.
 The Government has put pressure on individual human rights advocates. Father
 Richard Timm, an American Catholic priest and human rights advocate who has
 worked in Bangladesh for over 40 years, has faced long delays in obtaining a new
 reentry visa. After his visa's expiration in May, he waited until August before re-
 ceiving another, valid only until October. Other missionaries who advocate human
 rights have faced similar problems in the past.
 The Government has since 1991 refused to register the Bangladesh section of Am-
 nesty International. However, the Government recently registered the Bangladesh
 Human Rights Commission's Treatment Center for Trauma Victims. No major inci-
 dents of attacks on NGO workers or human rights activists were reported during
 the year. In p ast years representatives of lcal human rights groups have at times
 been physically attacked by religious extremists, who considered their activities un-
 Islamic. The Government has failed to bring to justice those who engaged in such
 violence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled
 to equal protection by the law." In practice, the Government does not strongly en-
 force laws aimed at eliminating discrimination. In this context, women, children, mi-
 nority groups, and the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages.
 Women.-Violence against women is difficult to quantify because of unreliable sta-
 tistics, but wife beating appears to be widespread. A widespread and growing aware-
 ness of the problem is fostered by the Government, media, and by women s rights
 organizations.
 Much of the violence against women is related to disputes over dowries. According
 to one human rights group, there were 73 dowry related killings during the first
 9 months of the year. Human rights groups and press reports indicate that incidents
 of vigilantism against women-sometimes led by religious leaders-are common oc-
 currences, particularly in rural areas. These include humiliating, painful punish-
 ments, such as whipping of women accused of moral offenses. For example, in Janu-
 ary in Habiganj local religious leaders reportedly subjected a woman to 101 lashes
 for adultery, and in October in Maulvibazar district, a woman reportedly died after
 being beaten by village leaders for the same offense. Few perpetrators are pros-
 ecuted.
 The Government has enacted laws specifically prohibiting certain forms of dis-
 crimination against women, including the Antidowry Prohibition Act of 1980, the
 Cruelty to Women Law of 1983, and the Women Repression Law of 1995. Enforce-
 ment of these laws is weak, however, especially in rural areas, and the Government
 seldom prosecutes vigorously those cases that are filed. However, in August the
 
 
 1425
 Government accepted a suit against the State by a women's activist group in con-
 nection with the 1995 rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl by police officers.
 Women remain in a subordinate position in society. The Government has not
 acted effectively to protect their basic freedoms. Approximately 30 percent of women
 are literate, compared to 35 to 40 percent of the general population. In recent years
 female school enrollment has improved. Approximately 50 percent of primaxy and
 secondary school students are female. Women are often unaware of thenr rights, be-
 cause of continued high illiteracy rates among adults and unequal educational op-
 portunities. Strong social stigmas and lack of economic means to obtain legal assist-
 ance frequently keep women from seeking redress in the courts.
 According to the 961 Muslim Family Ordinance, female heirs receive less inherit-
 ance than male heirs, and wives are more restricted in divorce rights. Men are per-
 mitted to have up to four wives, although this right is rarely exercised. Laws pro-
 vide some protection for women against arbitrary divorce and the taking of addi-
 tional wives by husbands without the first wife's consent, but the protections gen-
 erally apply only to registered marriages. Marriages in the countryside are often not
 registered because of ignorance of the law.
 While employment opportunities have been stronger for women than for men in
 the past few years, this isto a large extent due to the growth of the garment indus-
 try, in which female workers are prevalent. Programs extending credit to large num-
 bers of rural women have also contributed to greater economic power for them. How-
 ever, women still occupy only a small fraction of other wage-earning jobs, and hold
 fewer than 5 percent of government jobs. The Governments policy to include more
 women in government jobs has had limited effect.
 Children.-The Government undertakes programs in the areas of prim edu-
 cation, health, and nutrition. The Government made universal primary education
 mandatmry in 1991 but stated thati implement the law bcause of
 a lack of resources. The Government has also initiated programs that offer incen-
 tives for female children between the ages of 12 and 16 to remain in school.
 Reports from human rights monitors indicate that child abandonment, kidnaping,
 trafficking for labor bondage, and prostitution continue to be serious and widespread
 problems. UNICEF recently estimated that there were about 10,000 child pros-
 titutes in Bangladesh. Other estimates have been as high as 29,000. The law does
 not allow anyone under 18 years of age to engage in           and stipulates a
 maximum sentence of life imprisonment for persons found guilty of forcing a child
 into prostitution. However, procurers of minors are rarely prosecuted. Prostitution
 is legal for those over 18 with government certification. Human rights monitors re-
 port that police and loal government officials often either ignore prostitution and
 trafficking, including that of children, or actually profit from it. Awareness of the
 issue is increasing, and it receives press coverage.
 There is extensive trafficking in both women and children, primarily to the Mid-
 dle East, India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia, and also within Bangladesh. The
 trade, which mainly is for purposes of prostitution and labor servitude, is difficult
 to quantify. Press reports and evidence from human rights monitors indicate that
 it is widespread. The connivance of officials at various levels allows the trade to
 function. Enforcement of laws against it is hampered by poor records and easy ac-
 cess to forged identity documents. Most trafficked persons are lured by promises of
 good jobs or marriage. The BNP and Awati League governments have expressed
 concern about the problem and have worked with UN. agencies and nongovern-
 mental organizations to seek ways to combat it.
 People With Disabilies.-The laws provide for equal treatment and freedom from
 discrimination for the disabled, hut they face social and economic discrimination.
 The Government has not enacted specffic legislation or otherwise mandated acces-
 sibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Tribal peo ple, especially in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, have
 a marinal ability to influence decisions concerning the use of their lands. Until
 1985 the Government regularly parceled out land in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to
 Bengali settlers.
 The Government has moved toward granting the tribal peoples more authority in
 the Chit tagongHll Tracts. In July 1991, tribal-dminated local government councls
 assumed control over primary education, health, family welfare, and the agricul-
 tural extension service, although the real extent of their autonomy is limited. The
 Government continues to withold from the councils authority in several govern-
 mental functions for which they were originally intended, including law and order
 as well as land use (see Section 1.g.).
 Tribal people in other areas have reported similar problems of loss of land to
 Bengali   usms   nrough eastionable legal practices and other means. The Gaes,
 who live in the Madhapur Forest region in north central Bangladesh, have encoun-
 
 
 1426
 
 tered problems in maintaining their cultural traditions and livelihoods in the face
 of reforestation projects. Human rights monitors in the region claim that the Garos
 are being harassed and intimidated into leaving their homes to make way for gov-
 ernment-run, internationally financed economic development pr cts.
 Religious Minorities.-Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists make up an estimated
 10 percent of the population. Although the Government is secular, religion exerts
 a powerful influence on politics. The Government is sensitive to the uslim con-
 sciousness of the majority of its citizens. However, the Jamaat-E-Islami, the coun-
 trys largest Islamic political party, went from 18 seats in Parliament after the 1991
 elections, to 3 in the June elections. The Awami League Government has not ac-
 tively sought its political support.
 Islamic extremists have occasionally violently attacked women, religious minori-
 ties, and development workers. The Govenent has sometimes failed to denounce,
 investigate, and prosecute perpetrators of these attacks.
 Religious minorities are in practice disadvantaged in such areas as access to gov-
 ernment jobs and political office. Selection boards in the government services are
 often without minority group representation.
 Property ownership, particularly among Hindus, has been a contentious issue
 since independence in 1971, when many Hindus lost landholdings because of anti-
 Hindu discrimination in the application of the law. Prior to its June election victory,
 the Awami League promised to repeal the Vested Property Act, the law used to de-
 prive Hindus of their property. However, The Government has so far taken no ac-
 tion. There have been cases of violence directed against religious minority commu-
 nities that have also resulted in the loss of property. Such intercommunal violence
 has caused some members of religious minority gups to depart the country. While
 intercommunal violence occurred infrequently during the year, there were violent
 incidents in which Hindus were targeted in Chittagong during the June elections.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to join unions
 and-with government approval-the right to form a union. Approximately 1.6 mil-
 lion members of the country's total work force of about 45 to 50 million workers be-
 long to unions. Only about 3 million workers are involved in the formal industrial
 sector. There is a large unreported informal sector,, regarding which no reliable
 labor statistics exist.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee partici-
 pation in the workplace is required. Moreover, would-be unionists are technically
 forbidden to engage in many labor "activities" prior to registration. Labor activists
 have protested that this requirement severely restricts workers' freedom to organize.
 With the exception of workers in the railway, postal, telegraph and telephone de-
 partments, government civil servants are forbidden to join unions. This ban also ap-
 plies to security-related government employees such as the military and police. Civil
 servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers and nurses, have formed associa-
 tions that perform functions similar to labor unions, i.e., providing for members'
 welfare, offering legal services, and airing grievances. Collective bargaining, how-
 ever, is prohibited. Some workers have formed unregistered unions, particularly uni-
 versity employees and workers in the construction and transport (both public and
 private) in ustries.
 Ten to 15 percent of Bangladesh's approximately 4,200 labor unions are affiliated'
 with 23 officially registered national trade union (NTU) centers (there are also sev-
 eral unregistered NTLs). There are no legal restrictions on political activities by
 labor unions, although the calling of nationwide general strikes or transportation
 blockades by unions is considered a criminal rather than a political act and thus
 forbidden. Some unions had complained that the BNP government used its Anti-Ter-
 rorism Law as a means to suppress both opposition political workers and union
 members rather than bona fide terrorists. In late 1994, however, the Anti-Terrorism
 Law lapsed, and the BNP government decided not to renew it. No arrests of labor
 leaders under the law have been made since 1993.
 While unions are not part of the government structure, they are highly politicized.
 Virtually all the NTU centers are affiliated with political parties, including one with
 the ruling Awani League. Some unions are militant and engage in intimidation and
 vandalism. Illegal blocades of public transportation routes by strikers occurred fre-
 quently during the year. Pitched battles between members of rival labor unions
 occur regularly; hundreds were injured (and at least three combatants died) in 1996
 in various large jute and textile mills, as well as in the inland water transport and
 overland transport sectors. Fighting often is over the control of rackets or extortion
 payoffs and typically involves knives, guns, and homemade bombs.
 
 
 1427
 Workers are eligible for membership on their unions' executive staff, the size of
 which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members. Registration of
 a union may only be canceled by the Registrar of Trade Unions with the concur-
 rence of the Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been taken in
 1996. Several cases were filed, invariably by employers claiming a union's member-
 ship had fallen below the requisite level, but, because of a backlog and other admin-
 istrative problems, these cases have not come under review.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law, but strikes are a com-
 mon form of protest. The most prominent recent strikes have been by inland water
 transport employees, who claimed that they were not receiving the required mini-
 mum wage. other major strikes have been by jute and textile workers, who sought
 increased wages and benefits along with guarantees against future privatization and
 job loss. Employees organized in professional associations or nonregistered unions
 also strike. In 1996 nurses, private elementary teachers, and members of the non-
 administrative cadre of the civil service were among the striling groups. They
 souht better pay or benefits, a greater share of the public budget,  usion in the
 public setor, or administrative reform. University teachers strike for short periods
 from time to time over the continuing problem of campus violence. General strikes
 are standard tools of political opposition groups and are used to pressure the Gov-
 ernment to meet political demands. They caused significant economic and social dis-
 ruption during the year. Wildcat strikes are illegal but occur frequently, with vary-
 ing government responses. Wildcat strikes in the transportation sector are particu-
 larly common.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector that it declares essential. This ban, generally obeyed, has so
 far been applied to national airline pilots, water supply workers, shipping operations
 employees and electricity supply workers. The bans tend to be renewed every 3
 months. The Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time
 before or after the strike or lockout begins and to refer the dispute to the Labor
 Court. Mechanisms for conciliation, arbitration, and Labor Court dispute resolution
 were established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have
 the right to strike in the event of a failure to settle. If a strike lasts 30 days or
 longer, the Government may prohibit the strike and refer the dispute to the Labor
 Court for adjudication. This has not happened since 1993.
 There are provisions in the Industrial Relations Ordinance for the immunity of
 registered unions or union offiers from civil liablity. Enforcement of these provi-
 sions is uneven. In the case of illegal work actions, such as transportation block-
 ades, police have arrested union members under either the Special Powers Act, the
 Antiterrorism Law (now no longer in effect), or regular criminal codes.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 unions and federations maintain a variety of such links. Trade unionists are re-
 quired to obtain government clearance to travel to International Labor Organization
 (ILO) meetings, but no clearances were reported denied in 1996.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is legal
 only for private sector workers on condition that the workers are represented by
 unions legally registered as collective bargaining agents by the Registrar of Trade
 Unions. Collective bargaining occurs on occasion in large private enterprises such
 as pharmaceuticals or jute and textiles, but with unemployment in the 30 percent
 range, workers' concerns over job security often outweigh wage and other issues.
 Collective bargaining generally does not occur in small private enterprises.
 Public sector workers' pay levels and other benefits are recommended by the Na-
 tional Pay and Wages Commission. The Commission's recommendations are binding
 and may not be disputed except on the issue of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example, the
 ordinance allows arbitrary transfer of workers suspected of union activities or termi-
 nation'with payment of mandatory severance benefits (2 weeks' salary). Complaints
 that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination and harrassment, in-
 cluding physical attack, are particularly common in the garment industry. In prac-
 tice, private sector employers, sometimes working in collaboration with local police,
 tend to discourage any union activity. The Registrar of Trade Unions rules on dis-
 crimination complaints. In a number of cases the Labor Court has ordered the rein-
 statement of workers fired for union activities. However, the Labor Court's overall
 effectiveness is hampered by a serious case backlog, and there have also been alle-
 gations that some of its deliberations have been corrupted by employers.
 The law prohibits professional and industry-based unions in te two export proc-
 essing zones (EPZ's). A small number of workers in the EPZ's have skirted prohibi-
 tions on forming unions by setting up associations. The BNP government stated in
 
 
 1428
 1992 that labor law restrictions on freedom of association and formation of unions
 in the EPZ's would be lifted by 1997. So far neither the BNP nor the Awami League
 governments have taken action toward this end. In the burgeoning garment indus-
 try there have been numerous complaints of workers being harassed and fired in
 some factories for trying to organize unions. In addition to the prohibition on
 unions, no collective bargaining takes place in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Factories Act and Shops and Establishinent Act, both
 passed in 1965, set up inspection mechanisms to enforce laws against forced labor.
 These laws are not rigorously enforced, partl because resources for enforcement are
 few. While there is no large-scale bonded labor, there is forced labor to the extent
 that workers are often required to work later than stipulated by law, with no special
 compensation. This is a notable problem in the garment industry.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits labor by chil-
 dren. The Factories Act of 1965 bars children under the age of 14 from working in
 factories. This law also stipulates that young workers (children and adolescents) are
 only allowed to work a maximum 5-hour day and only between the hours of 7 a.m.
 and7 p.m.
 Enforcement of these rules is inadequate. According to a 1990 labor force survey
 by the Bureau of Statistics, the country has 5.7 million working children 10 to 14
 years of age. The United Nations estimates that about one-third of the population
 under the age of 18 is engaged in some type of formal or informal employment. Chil-
 dren are commonly seen driving rickshaws, breaking bricks at construction sites,
 carrying fruit, vegetables, and dry goods for shoppers at markets, and working at
 tea stalls. They are found as peelers, packers, and beachcombers in the shrimp in-
 dustry. Also, children work side by side with other family members in small-scale
 and subsistence agriculture. Children routinely perform domestic work. Cases of
 children being physically abused and occasionally killed by heads of households
 where they work are reported in the press. Under the law, every child must attend
 school through the fifth grade. However, the Government continues to maintain that
 it does not yet have the resources to implement this law effectively.
 In anticipation of possible foreign legislation prohibiting the import of products
 made by child labor, thousands of underage workers employed in Bangladesh's
 ready-made garment industry were fired in 1993. Many were probably rehired later
 by other factories or in subcontracting operations, but the fangladesh Garment
 Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) pledged to make its member
 factories child labor-free. Protracted negotiations led to the July 1995 signing of a
 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the BGMEA, UNICEF, and the
 ILO to eliminate child labor in the garment sector. The MOU establishes a coopera-
 tive program to identify' underage workers (through surveys of the garment fac-
 tories), remove them from their factories, and place them in new schools. It also pro-
 vides that no children would be fired until education programs were ready to receive
 them. The children receive a monthly stipend while attending school to help replace
 their lost income. The ILO takes the lead on monitoring implementation of the
 MOU, and UNICEF on providing education. As of mid-November, 285 schools had
 opened, with 7,622 former child workers enrolled. The number of children working
 in nonexport, or nonfactory garment production is unknown. UNICEF estimates
 that as many as 200,000 children under the age of 14 are employed in some connec-
 tion to the garment industry. The ILO calls that estimate exaggerated. Child labor
 in the industry has not ended, but the process of the elimination of child labor in
 this sector appen to be making progress.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Instead,
 the Wage Commission, which convenes every several years, sets wages and benefits
 industry by industry. In most cases, private sector employers ignore this wage struc-
 ture. Organized jute and textile workers have called strikes in an attempt to win
 wage_parity for their industry's private sector workers. The average monthly wage
 is sufficient to provide an individual with a minimal standard of living but is not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with 1 day off mandated. A 60-hour
 workweek, inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The law is
 poorly enforced in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive but appears to be largely ignored by employers.
 Workers may resort to legal action for enforcement of the lawns provisions, but few
 cases are actually prosecuted. Enforcement by the Labor Ministry's industrial in-
 spectors is weak. Due to high unemployment and inadequate enforcement of the
 laws, workers demanding correction of dangerous working conditions or refusing to
 participate in perceived dangerous activities risk losing their jobs.
