 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a multiethnic,
 Federal state comprising six republics, one of which has two
 autonomous -provinces. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 (Communist Party) is the only legal political party. The
 ideology and practice of Yugoslav communism and workers'
 self-management differ substantially from the centralized
 Soviet model of Communist rule. In the highly decentralized
 system set up by the late President Tito, Republic and
 Provincial authorities wield power that the Federal Communist
 -bureaucracy has difficulty challenging. This system has
 helped preserve stability among Yugoslavia's contentious
 ethnic groups but has thus far thwarted effective leadership
 at the national level.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic secretariats for internal affairs.
 Security and police forces are generally subject to, and
 heedful of, overall direction from the political level,
 although they operate with considerable independence.
 In the economic system, workers' self-management theoretically
 provides-that the workers run their own enterprises through a
 system of elected workers councils. In some Republics and
 Provinces, however, local political officials exercise
 considerable, and frequently decisive, influence over the
 management of enterprises in areas under their jurisdiction.
 Growth in 1987 in the largely decentralized Yugoslav economy
 was broadly based, but the rate of inflation was well over 100
 percent. The implementation of austerity and economic reform
 programs adopted in earlier years has progressed slowly, and
 the Federal Government is grappling with an uneven foreign
 trade performance, a high level of hard currency debt, and the
 perceived need to protect the Yugoslav living standard while
 enforcing financial discipline. Nearly 85 percent of
 agricultural land is privately owned, and there are a growing
 number of private enterprises in services and small-scale
 manufacturing, particularly in the Republics of Croatia and
 Slovenia.
 In 1987 Yugoslav society continued to evolve toward greater
 openness, Including more freedom of speech and the press.
 There is relatively open debate on the implementation of
 workers' self-management, the boundaries of permissible
 -olitical -nd cultural expression, and the functioning of the
 political system. Some issues, however, .appear to be so
 sensitive that free speech is only partially tolerated.
 Hence, Yugoslav officials, wary of historically rooted
 separatist sentiments, have taken stern measures to repress
 displays of what they term ethnic "nationalism."
 Political decentralization has led to considerable differences
 among the Republics and Provinces in their attitude toward and
 respect for civil and political rights. The Republic of
 Slovenia, for example, is notably more tolerant than other
 Republics and Provinces. Slovenian officials in 1987 called
 for repeal of Federal laws against "verbal crimes," i.e.,
 those usually included under the rubric of "nationalism" or
 "hostile propaganda." Slovenes have not arrested anyone on
 such charges for more than a decade, although arrests and
 convictions continue elsewhere in Yugoslavia. Slovenia also
 openly tolerates unofficial political groups.
 In other developments related to human rights, several mass
 demonstrations occurred without incident in 1987, but police
 
 
 1080
 YUGOSLAVIA
 in Macedonia used cattle prods to break up a protest about
 water.rights. Milovan Djilas, among other well-known
 dissidents, received i passport for travel abroad. On the
 other band, confrontation between Serbs and ethnic Albanians,
 especially in the Aut6n6mous Province of Kosovo, continued to
 generate outbursts of violence and many short prison sentences
 on charges of "hostile propaganda" and other "political"
 crimes. The death of four Yugoslav soldiers at the hands of
 an ethnic Albanian recruit in September was officially
 attributed to nationalist and anti-Yugoslav feeling.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported instances of killing by government
 forces. In the past, Serb-Albanian ethnic tensions in Kosovo
 have resulted in Violence and occasional fatalities. Attacks
 by members of one nationality on the other continued at a
 steady level in 1987. The ethnic Albanian draftee, who in
 September killed four non-Albanians and, wounded five others in
 an army barracks'in Serbia, was widely regarded as having been
 motivated by nationalist, anti-Yugoslav sentiment.
 b.*' Disappearance
 No instances of prolbnged or permanent disappearance were
 repqortec.
 c; 'Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or PunIshment
 Although both Yugoslav law and the Constitution forbid
 torture, various sources, including imnesty International,
 report that people are baten, treated harshly, or threatened
 during pretrial detention, while serving sentences, or while
 being questioned as possible witnesses. In 1987 the press
 reported on steps taken by the authorities to deal with
 unwarranted use of force by police.
 Extensive reports published in 1986 on the alleged abuse in
 prison in recent years of the Croatian dissident Dobroslav
 Paraga led to his trial in 1987 on charges of spreiding false
 information. He was found guilty and given a conditionally
 suspended sentence. His subsequent appeal was denied. A
 newspaper series on political prisoners revealed some abuses
 .but generally cast,the Yugoslav penal system in a positive
 light. Croatian officials have announced their intention to
 close by 1989, for economic reasons, the Goli Otok island
 prison, where prison staff allegedly have singled out
 political prisoners for especially harsh treatment.
 d. 'Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Yugoslav criminal procedures derive from Napoleonic law and
 are generally followed in all, including political, cases.
 Arrests are conducted pursuant to warrants, defendants are
 usually brought before a judge within 24-hours of arrest,
 there is a functioning system of bail, persons arrested for
 political reasons are usually charged with specific sections
 of the Criminal Code, and defendants have the right to
 independent counsel. There are provisions for pretrial
 
 
 1081
 YUGOSLAVIA
 detention. Persons charged for misdemeanors may be tried and
 sentenced by administrative courts to up to 6 months in prison.
 The Federal Criminal Code defines a number of criminal acts
 generally referred to as political criminal acts. These
 include such crimes as armed rebellion, terrorism, and
 espionage, as well as some broad, imprecise categories as:
 "hostile propaganda;" arousing national, racial and religious
 hatred, dissension, or intolerance; and damaging the reputation
 of Yugoslavia. In addition, Republican and Provincial criminal
 codes cover a variety of misdemeanors considered political
 crimes, including spreading of false rumors, and defaming the
 peoples and nationalities of Yugoslavia.
 With wide variations in local practice, authorities may bring
 charges against those who make allegedly derogatory or
 inflammatory ethnic statements. Such oral statements and
 other forms of personal expression, e.g., painting slogans or
 singing "nationalist" songs, may be grounds for criminal
 prosecution; charges of disturbing the peace are sometimes
 brought in such cases. During 1987 discussion continued in
 the press and public about the desirability of eliminating
 Federal legal provisions against so-called verbal crimes,
 specifically "hostile propaganda." Slovenian party leaders
 have openly called for repeal of these provisions.
 Yugoslav law permits the arrest and imprisonment of Yugoslav
 citizens for acts considered criminal offenses under Yugoslav
 law, even when they are committed abroad and are not crimes in
 the country in which they take place. Such cases are often
 based on the expression of views "hostile" to the Yugoslav
 regime or association with anti-Yugoslav emigre groups. One
 such case occurred in 1987, involving a Yugoslav-Australian
 dual national. He was released upon conviction and allowed to
 return to Australia.
 There were no reports of the practice of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public, not all political trials are. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trials and to have an attorney,
 at public expense if needed. Yugoslav political authorities
 usually do not actively interfere in judicial proceeding-s
 concerning political cases. In selected cases, however,
 substantial evidence exists that government or party officials
 have sought to orchestrate the trials of those charged with
 political crimes. Some human rights organizations believe
 that the outcome in political cases is predetermined. Other
 observers, including critics of the Government, hold that the
 courts have a measure of independence, particularly in
 determining the length and type of sentences, if not innocence
 or guilt.
 Many persons accused of political offenses are able to find
 capable, energetic counsel. Government authorities have
 sometimes attempted to intimidate or chastise attorneys who
 took political cases.
 The precise number of political prisoners is difficult to
 determine. Unofficial estimates place the figure between 500
 and 1,000. Such estimates and official statistics generally
 refer only to criminal sentences under Federal law, excluding
 the many sentenced under Republic or Provincial laws on
 
 
 1082
 YUGOSLAVIA
 political charges or for disturbing the peace through public
 or other behavior considered politically unacceptable. On the
 other hand, those sentenced may not necessarily be imprisoned.
 In addition, a substantial percentage of those classified as
 politicai prisoners may be persons who committed acts of
 violence tbemselves or were involved in organizations which
 committed crimes of violence aimed at undermining the present
 regime.
 According to official statistics, in 1986 there were 296
 sentences imposed for political criminal acts. From 1981 to
 1985, there were 1,652 persons sentenced for political crimes,
 522 of them'on charges of "hostile.pr6paganda.* Of the 1,652,.
 almost two-thirds were ethnic Albanians tried on charges
 relafing to alleged nationalism and separatism. In its 1987
 Report, Adiiesty International cited official statistics
 indicating fhat 1,400 people, almost all ethnic Albanians,
 were charged with political crimes in Kosovo between 1981 and
 mid-1986, and a further 6,500 were summarily sentenced for
 minor political offenses. Prison terms for such misdemeanors
 may range up to 6 months. These sentences handed down by
 Yugoslav authorities--primarily local ethnic Albanian
 officials in Kosovo--are meant to contain a perceived threat
 to political stability posed by so-called irredentist or
 separatist activity on the part of ethnic Albanian
 "nationalists."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 .,Correspondence
 Yugoslav authorities are widely believed to interfere on
 occasion in the private lives of citizens. Allegations of
 such interference are most common from those citizens actively
 engaged in nonofficial political activity. Although the
 judicial system provides elaborate safeguards concerning
 procedures for conducting searches, these safeguards are
 sometimes ignored. Many Yugoslavs also believe that
 authorities.eavesdrop on conversations, read private mail, and
 tap telephones. While Yugoslav citizens are generally free to
 receive and read foreign publications, the publications of
 "certain Yugoslav emigre groups, particularly those advocating
 the dissolution of the Yugoslav federation or the redrawing of
 its internal political boundaries, are considered hostile in
 themselves, and their importation, possession, or sale is
 illegal.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Yugoslavia continues its slow and halting movement toward
 greater  qpenness and freedom of speech and press. Both the
 Yugoslov Jonstitution and Yugoslav law affirm these freedoms.
 There is considerable latitude for disagreement with government
 policy, and for commentary and criticism in the media and in
 academic'and quasi-official public forums so long as the
 Government does not regard it as threatening national unity.
 A few topics remain sensitive, such as Tito and his
 leadership, the status of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo,
 and tendentious interpretation of the history of and relations
 between ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians. Although Tito
 personally remains beyond criticism, the other topics were
 debated quite openly during 1987. Press criticism of
 government policies and proposals concerning domestic
 political and economic issues is frequent and often sharp. At
 
 
 1083
 
 YUGOSLAVIA
 times, press criticism sparks government charges of
 irresponsibility and may result in the transfer of editors and
 journalists from one publication to another. There is also
 ample direct criticism of the Federal Cabinet and of the
 League of Communists at all levels. Speculation about the
 implication of the �'hen-Vice President in a major financial
 scandal probably contributed to his resignation in September.
 Unprecedented calls for the resignation of the Prime Minister
 for mishandling the economy began to appear in the press
 during the last quarter of 1987.
 Although both Yugoslav law and practice impose some
 restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom to publish,
 press autonomy has increased markedly in recent years.
 Normally, neither the print nor broadcast media are censored
 prior to dissemination. However, there were at least three
 instances in 1987 in which bans were challenged on the grounds
 that they were imposed prior to actual publication. One
 journalist was arrested and charged with "disparaging
 sociopolitical organizations" in an article which was never
 published. He was released before his 45-day sentence was
 completed. Government oversight of the media is carried out
 through publication boards, which include ranking party
 officials, and through editorial staff's use of self-
 censorship. This type of control, however, is incomplete and
 varies from Republic to Republic.
 In 1987 the major publishing house in Belgrade, Politika,
 proved to be the battleground for important struggles among
 government and party leaders for influence over editorial
 policy and news content. The Slovenian Youth Press continues
 to discuss issues considered sensitive by most senior party
 and government officials, such as civilian alternatives to
 military service, political prisoners, and prison conditions.
 A short-lived "Solidarity Fund", set up last year with the
 stated intent of aiding journalists and others who might
 suffer because of their political opinions, was denounced, as
 were many of its adherents, when party officials concluded
 that it had taken on a political cast and constituted an
 attempt to organize an opposition political party.
 Public prosecutors have the power to ban the publication and
 sale of books or periodicals if judicial authorities hold that
 the content is, for example, "false" and could "disturb" the
 public. Banning of publications is often a local option, and
 standards of what is acceptable vary throughout Yugoslavia.
 In book publishing, the authorities generally provide only
 loose political oversight. Police and prosecutors rarely
 intervene. The works of Soviet and other Eastern European
 dissidents are published in large press runs and sold widely.
 Works by some authors, such as Milovan Djilas, have long been
 banned, but there have been press reports that publication of
 some of Djilas' writing is being considered.
 In 1987, as the limits of official tolerance were tested,
 certain publications were banned, including: one issue each
 of the Slovenian Youth papers Katedra and Mladina, because of
 articles critical of Yugoslav officials; the book "Plesci" by
 a Roman Catholic priest, for its "Fascist" treatment of the
 work of a literary figure; and "Society Under Suspicion" by
 Milorad Vucelic, a collection of earlier published articles,
 because of a new introductory text and a cover illustration
 portraying Tito in a negative light. In November, however,
 the Slovenian Supreme Court overturned the Katedra banning.
 
 
 1084
 YUGOSLAVIA
 On the other hand, bans imposed at the end of 1986 on books by
 historian yeselin Duretic ("The Allies and the Yugoslav War
 Drama"), and by dissident Vojislav Seselj ("Treason Trial")
 were upheld after lengthy argument in the courts, and two
 other books by Seselj were banned. An interview with Milovan
 Djilas was held back by one Slovene youth magazine but later
 carriea in another. Infrequently, the importation and
 distribution of a particular issue of a foreign publication
 are b5inned, usually because of information about the regime
 which the uthorities consider false or hostile. There were
 six such known cases in 1987.
 Arrests-and convictions for what are called "verbal crimes"
 (most often on charges involving "nationalism" or "hostile
 propagnda") continued in Kosovo Province at a significant
 level. In Bosnia and Hercegovina, Miladin Nedic was convicted
 in March. and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison. Also in
 Bosnia, three Moslems, Fadil Fadilpasic, Munib Zahiragic, and
 Ibrahim Avdic were sentenced to 4, 5, and 2 years'
 imprisonment, respectively. In Croatia, a Zagreb court in
 March sentenced Rastislav Vranic, an army captain, to 4 years
 in prison,. Slovenia, with no such arrests in more than a
 decade, was the most notable exception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are permitted only by official
 organizations and generally only in support of government
 policies. .Others may be suppressed. Public gatherings and
 meetings 6f private organizations are permitted but must be
 registered beforehand with'the authorities.
 The year 1987 was witness to numerous instances of protest
 rallies and mass demonstrations, most of them related to
 events in ethnically troubled Kosovo Province which passed
 without'incident. Police use of nightsticks to control a
 minor scuffle at one gathering of 15,000-20,000 Serbs in
 Kosovo resultea in'disciplinary measures taken against 6
 police officials. In contrast, use of cattle prods by police
 to break up a protest regarding water rights in southern
 Macedonia (causing injury to 40 people, including minors) was
 investigated but determined to have been justified, a finding
 disputed by the participants in the protest.
 The Serbian Writers' Association held a series of 15 meetings
 on the theme "About Kosovo, For Kosovo." Although organized
 as "literary evenings," the participants heatedly examined the
 state of political events between ethnic Serbs and Albanians
 in Kosovo.
 The Socialist Youth Alliance of Slovenia actively promoted
 public debate on issues such as nuclear energy, the concept of
 civilian alternatives to military service, and political
 reform, particularly of the system of leadership selection.
 In the fall, the official Slovenian youth organization set up
 a "political picnic" attended by 2,000-3,000 people, at which
 the head of the Slovene Socialist Alliance fielded spontaneous
 questions on a wide variety of political issues.
 An academic conference on the theme "Possibilities for Reform
 in Socialist States" was sponsored by the Center for Philosophy
 and Sodial Theory in Belgrade in July with invitees from
 outside Yugoslavia. Due to government pressures, it was
 cancelled at virtually the last moment, possibly over concern
 about the reactions of some Warsaw Pact governments.
 
 
 1085
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Trade unions are organized geographically by Republic and
 Province, and by trade within these boundaries. At the
 Federal level, the trade union organization almost invariably
 supports government policies while pleading that any negative
 effects on workers be minimized. In practice, responding to
 Yugoslavia's persistent economic difficulties, union leaders
 are becoming more active in advocating worker interests on
 such matters as the impact of inflation, the standard of
 living, and wage policies. Under Yugoslavia's system of
 workers' self-management, however, unions generally play a
 relatively minor role in representing worker interests in the
 management of enterprises, including the distribution and
 levels of income, the determination of working conditions, the
 settlement of disputes, and the conduct of strikes.
 Despite the absence of direct union participation and support,
 the number of strikes increased dramatically in 1987. In
 November, the President of the Federal Trade Union announced
 .that during the first 11 months of 1987 Yugoslavia had
 experienced a record 1,262 work stoppages involving some
 196,000 workers, compared to 851 strikes involving 88,860
 workers in all of 1986.
 The application of temporary legislation aimed at holding down
 wages was responsible for a large increase in the number of
 the strikes during the first quarter. Striking workers at a
 particular enterprise generally seek changes in either the
 amount or distribution of personal income. Changes in
 enterprise management are also frequently sought. In recent
 years, strikes have been brief, -most lasting 4 to 8 hours,
 some a few days. In 1987 major strikes lasted much longer. A
 34-day strike at the Labin coal mine in Croatia is thought to
 represent a record for postwar Yugoslavia. A few strike
 actions were organized and announced in advance rather than
 taking place spontaneously. Public debate continues on
 whether and how to regulate strike activity and on the role of
 the trade unions in strike situations. The apparent anomaly
 of labor strikes in a worker self-management system is central
 to the discussion.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored religion, and the Government officially
 encourages atheism. Yugoslavia is a multireligious state.
 Most Yugoslav believers are either Serbian Orthodox or Roman
 Catholic, or-adherents of the Islamic faith. Many Macedonians
 belong to the Macedonian Orthodox Church, a church not
 recognized by other Eastern Orthodox churches. Since World
 War II, the Jewish community has numbered fewer than 10,000
 persons. There is a small Protestant community which includes
 fundamentalist denominations.
 Although freedom to practice religion is cited in the
 Constitution, public proselytizing through electronic media or
 personal witnessing is forbidden. The religious communities
 have vigorous publishing programs, although they do not have
 their own printing facilities. Their publications are
 normally sold only through subscription or at places of
 worship. Bibles and Korans are readily available. Contacts
 with coreligionists abroad are extensive and unhindered.
 However, Yugoslav authorities regard ties between Yugoslav
 Muslims and Islamic fundamentalist groups abroad with
 suspicion.
 
 
 1086
 YUGOSLAVIA
 The construction of new places of worship requires the consent
 of local government authorities, which often presents
 bureaucratic, obstacles- Construction is continuing on the
 Serbian Orthodox St. Sava Cathedral in Belgrade; the Zagreb
 mosque opened in September after frequent delays (a number of
 court cases concerning violation of building laws are still
 pending); and agreement has been reached in principle on.
 construction of a new synagogue in Z-agreb. However, it is"
 often difficult for religious organizations to obtain
 permission to build churches in newly developed urban-areas.
 For example, efforts to purchase land to build places of
 worship in the city of New Belgrade have been unsuccessful.
 Several major religious events were celebrated in 1987. In
 mid-September, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern
 Orthodox Church visited Yugoslavia and was met by thousands of
 people in the Republics of Serbia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. The
 new mosque, in Zagreb opened to a crowd of roughly 3,000.,
 Government officials participated in both these events.
 Authorities-continue to tolerate large-scale pilgrimages by-
 domestic and foreign visitors to Medjugorje, a village in
 Bosnia-Hercegovina where the Virgin Mary is said to appear
 regularly to several young people.
 Religious believers are not subject to overt persecution. A
 party member who is a religious- believer and, takes part;
 publicly~in:the sacraments of his or her church,-however,-
 risks disciplinary action or expulsion from the .partyz Open
 - practice of one's faith  s normally--a tdisqualification for-1-
 high positions in government and bUsiness.-, Constraints on
 occasional attendance at services an& the religious   --
 instruction of children vary from region. to region. Primary
 education outside the state system i s.not, permitted in
 Yugoslavia,;but. religious education at the secondary and
 university level isc--allowed and exists for all major faiths.
 Yugoslav religiouscommunities also make vigorous-efforts to
 provide religious instruction outside of school for children
 and young people.- Prisoners-and active duty military
 personnel are not allowed to be visited by clergy or to attend
 religious services. The Slovene Roman Catholic Bishops
 Conference has suggested that the Yugoslav Government is
 violating the International Agreement on Citizenship and
 Citizen Rights by not permitting~priests to administer -the
 sacraments to prisoners.
 Conflicts between the State and religious communities develop
 if the latter engage in what authorities consider
 *nationalist' or political activities. The authorities have
 frequently-criticized the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia for
 alleged support of.Croatian nationalism and political
 activism, and the Serbian Orthodox Church similarly ,for
 Serbian nationalism. Criticism of the Islamic clergy for
 encouraging Albanian nationalism and separatism has begun-to
 appear in Macedonia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is provided for by the
 Constitution and permitted in practice. There is a prevalent
 belief among Serbs and throughout Yugoslavia that the movement
 of ethnic Serbs out of Kosovo Province is the result of anti-
 Serbian behavior (including personal threats and intimidation,
 vandalism, and occasional violent acts) on the part of the
 ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo. Serious efforts have been
 
 
 1087
 YUGOSLAVIA
 undertaken at all levels of government to stem Serbian
 emigration from Kosovo (or at least to ensure that ethnic
 pressures are not to blame) and to deal with serious
 underlying problems of economic development. Nonetheless, the
 emigration persists and remains a significant political
 problem.
 Almost all Yugoslavs are able to emigrate and seek employment
 abroad. Half of the country's population possesses valid
 passports, and no exit permits are required to visit the more
 than 135 countries with which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or
 consular relations. A very small number of Yugoslavs are
 denied passports either temporarily or permanently on national
 security, political, or criminal grounds. In 1987 passports
 were issued to several well-known dissidents, including
 Milovan Djilas, wh6 had not been allowed a passport since
 1970. Approximately 600,000 Yugoslav workers, some with
 family members, are employed as "guest workers" in Western
 Europe.
 The law on the entry of foreigners into Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In addition,
 Yugoslavia extends temporary asylum to refugees who, with the
 assistance of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees 4UNHCR), seek permanent resettlement
 in third countries. At present, there are about 600 such
 refugees in Yugoslavia. Since 1984 there have been no known
 cases in which a refugee under UNHCR protection was forcibly
 repatriated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change the system of
 government. In a one-party state, the 2-million-member League
 of Communists of Yugoslavia maintains a monopoly on political
 power, but its authority is greatly dispersed and diluted
 because of the decentralization of decisionmaking power to the
 six republics and two provinces. As Yugoslav politicians and
 the press regularly note, the country's eight regional party
 organizations hold widely differing views on key political and
 economic issues, and this has made it difficult for the Federal
 Government to take decisive action. With few exceptions, no
 major initiatives can be taken by the Federal Government
 without the unanimous consent of the republics and provinces.
 Extensive press and television coverage i-s often given to
 high-level party meetings. In 1987 portions of a major party
 meeting, including the act of voting, were televised live.
 Governmental bodies are responsible for administering and
 drawing up specific policies, especially economic policies.
 At the top of the government structure are the collective
 State Presidency (Chief of State), the Federal Executive
 Council (Cabinet), and the Federal Assembly (Parliament). The
 Presidency is responsible for overall policy direction. The
 Federal Executive Council, headed by a chairman who is the
 Prime Minister, is responsible for running the governmental
 machinery and proposing specific legislation. Government
 offices mandate a rotation of officials every 1 to 5 years,
 with the possibility of extension for one additional term in
 many cases.
 The Federal Assembly is responsible for enacting legislation.
 It operates sometimes by majority vote and sometimes by
 
 
 1088
 
 -YUGOSLAVIA
 consensus among delegations representing the country's eight
 federal units. Active and contentious in recent years, it has
 several times rejected or drastically altered proposals
 endorsed by the Presidency and Cabinet, and is often the scene
 of sharp debates which generally are fully reported in the
 media.
 Federal law% must also be adopted separately by Republic and
 Provincial assemblies before they can be implemented, and thus
 these redional, assemblies wield considerable power, frequently
 amotinting to an actual veto of Federal authority. In certain
 cases, delegates to the Federal Assembly must'have authorizing
 instructions from their Republic or Provincial assemblies
 before engaging in negotiation or compromise on Federal
 legislative measures.
 Members of Communist party bodies are selected by the party
 bodies themselves in ways ranging from secret ballot and
 majority vote to prearranged appointment. Members of
 government bodies are chosen by a delegate system.
 Nominations originate in the various sociopolitical
 organizations which are members of the mass umbrella
 organization, the Soci'alist Alliance of the Working People.
 This includes the trade -unions, the LeagUe of Socialist Youth,
 and the Union of Veterans- On te local level, ordinary
 wQrkers pan and do..play an active role in the selection
 process. Draft constitutional amendments are now being
 considered which would drop. the delegate system in favor of a
 system of dirdct election for many governing bodies.
 Yugoslavia's ethnic groups generally have equal access to
 political positions, especially through their respective
 Republics and Provinces. Many senior executive government and
 party positions rotate periodically from one nationality to
 another according to a predetermined national "key."
 For a 4-year term until 1986, the Federal Prime Minister was a
 woman. Two'members of the current Cabinet are women. While
 full and unimpeded opportunities for women are mandated by
 law, women are underrepresented at higher levels, reflecting
 longstanding social attitudes and customs, and there are still
 allegations that women cannot participate fully in government
 aji political life.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to Western charges of human rights
 violations within Yugoslavia. Often it attempts to dismiss
 such charges as efforts to bring pressure on Yugoslavia to
 alter its social, economic, or political system. In recent
 years, the Government has been willing to. discuss human rights
 problems with outside organizations. For example, on at least
 two occasions in 1987, international observers were permitted
 to attend politically sensitive trials. Late in the year, the
 Socialist Alliance began to consider possible formation of a
 Yugoslav human rights commission.
 A nascent Helsinki Watch group was formed in mid-1987 by
 private Yugoslav human rights activists. The loosely
 organized Committee for-the Defense of Freedom of Thought and
 Expression continues to speak out from time to time on human
 rights and political issues. Committees of the Serbian
 Writers' Association conducted numerous public meetings and
 
 
 1089
 YUGOSLAVIA
 issued many statements on human rights issues during 1987.
 There has been some criticism of these groups and the leading
 figures in them.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Government is officially opposed to
 racial discrimination. Despite government efforts, however,
 some social prejudice continues to exist, particularly with
 regard to ethnic Albanians and gypsies. As noted above, the
 Serbian minority in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo has
 complained sharply about discriminatory practices on the part
 of the Albanian majority.
 The Government has taken steps to improve the status of
 women. Maternity leave for employed women is very liberal and
 is ;outinely granted for periods between 9 and 12 months.
 Depending on the republic, working mothers are given day-care
 allowances based on their salaries and the number of children
 to be cared for. Also, a working mother may take sick leave
 when her child is ill (up until 2 years after its birth), and
 the father may do so when the mother is ill.
 The role of women in Yugoslavia's work force has slowly
 improved as a result of increased education and urbanization.
 According to statistics for 1985, 37.8 percent of the work
 force in the socialized sector was composed of women, as
 opposed to 34.5 percent in 1974. However, most women still
 hold relatively low-level, poorly paid positions. The
 Constitution charges government authorities at all levels with
 protection of the cultural rights of all the peoples of
 Yugoslavia. The use of the major local language is required
 in official communications between Belgrade and the various
 republics, and local languages are used in the schools,
 courts, and local media. The various nationality groups have
 the right to use their own flags, with some restrictions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Factories are owned in theory by society as a whole, with
 their assets administered by their workers, organized in
 enterprise-level workers' councils. In practice, the influence
 of workers' councils varies, but they are actively involved i'n
 determining workers' incomes, fringe benefits, and working
 conditions. Through their trade union organizations, workers
 participate in decisions affecting housing, transportation,
 continuing education, and other living and working conditions.
 Yugoslavia has extensive Federal and Republican laws and
 regulations-on worker safety. Reports in the local press
 indicate, iowever, that in some areas safety regulations are
 not uniformly observed. The standard workweek is 42 hours.
 Common practice is to work five 8-hour days per week and one
 Saturday per month. Most workers have the right to 1 month's
 paid vacation per year, as well as extensive sick leave. The
 minimum age for the employment of children is 16 years.
 Seventy-eight percent of those unemployed in Yugoslavia are
 under the age of 30, and, in practice, young people often wait
 a long time for their first job. Those with jobs are assured
 a minimum wage amounting to 75 percent of the average wage for
 the area during the previous accounting period.
