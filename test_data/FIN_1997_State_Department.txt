 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic with an elected head of state (president), par-
 liament, and head of Government (prime minister), and with an independent judici-
 'he security apparatus is effectively controlled by elected officials and supervised
 by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy, primarily and extensively market based.
 During the year there were no reported violations of fundamental human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Purushment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court,
 and the lower courts. The President appoints Supreme Court justices, who in turn
 appoint the lower court judges.
 The law provides for the right to fairpublic trial and the judiciary vigorously en-
 forces this right. Local courts may conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile,
 matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or en-
 danger the security of the State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold
 from the public any or all information pertaining to charges, verdicts, and sentences.
 The law provides for sanctions against violators of such restrictions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice. Nontraditional religious groups freely profess
 and propagate their beliefs. Such groups are eligible for some tax relief (e.g., they
 may receive tax-free donations), provided they are registered with the Government
 as religious communities. Eight-seven percent of the population belong to two state
 churches, the Lutheran and the Orthodox Churches. All citizens belonging to one
 of these state churches pays, as part of their income tax, a church tax. These church
 taxes are used to defray the costs of running the state churches. Those who do not
 
 
 1076
 want to pay the tax must notify the tax office. Such groups as Jehovah's Witnesses
 and the Mormon Church have been active in Finland for decades. However, al-
 though they have applied, Scientologists are not registered as a religious community
 but as an association. Their application reportedly remained pending while the Gov-
 ernment awaited    additional information  that it had requested   from  the
 Scientelosts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 mpractice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Approved refu-
 gees and asylum seekers are processed directly for residence. The issue of the provi-
 sion of first asylum has never arisen. There were no reports of forced expulsion of
 those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 In 1996 711 persons applied for asylum in Finland, down from 854 in 1995. Dur-
 ing 1996 the Directorate of Immigration issued asylum decisions affecting 593 per-
 sons, awarding refugee status to only 11 but awarding another 334 temporary resi-
 dence permits. Responding to criticism that it lacked a comprehensive program for
 dealing with refugees, the Government has been reviewing its refugee policy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their Gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women are fairly well represented in Government. There are 67 in the 200-mem-
 ber Parliament, and 6 in the 18-member Cabinet. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs
 and Defense as well as the Associate Minister of Finance are women, as are the
 Speaker of Parliament and the President of the Bank of Finland. In 1995 Par-
 liament passed quota legislation for all state committees, commissions, and ap-
 pointed municipal bodies, requiring a minimum of 40 percent membership from each
 sex.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, lan-
 guage, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 In the past several years, the problems of racism and xenophobia in Finland have
 received increased attention from the Government and the public. Assaults by local
 "skinheads" on a black American in 1995 helped to focus attention on these twin
 problems. In February a ministerial group headed by the Associate Minister of Edu-
 cation prepared a report that became the basis for new government measures to
 combat racism and xenophobia. These measures include a mechanism that allows
 officials to intervene sooner, and at a lower level, in race-related incidents. Accord-
 ing to an ongoing university study of the image of minorities in the media, the
 media tend to reinforce popular prejudices by reporting on minorities only when
 problems arise.
 Women. -The law provides for stringent penalties for violence against women;
 this rovision is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shel-
 ter Homes as well as the municipalities maintain such homes for female, male,
 adult, and child victims of violence in homes all over the country. The total number
 of shelters is around 55. Many of the people served by the shelters are women with
 small children fleeing from abusive husbands. Increasing numbers of elderly per-
 sons--the parents of abusive (usually male) offspring-have sought safety in the
 shelters. Generally the conditions that cause both young and old to avail themselves
 of the shelters are alcohol-related. Studies show that the opening of a shelter in an
 area brings cases of family violence out into the open. The concept of family violence
 in Finland includes negligence in care, psychological violence, and economic abuse.
 The annual number of calls to the police relating to domestic violence is not cen-
 trally compiled but is estimated at some 10,000 to 12,000. Shelter officials state that
 the figure is less than half of the number of actual incidents. Police statistics from
 January to June show virtually no rise in domestic assault figures over correspond-
 ing figures from the previous year (statistics not broken down by sex). There were
 
 
 1077
 193 cases of rape reported to police during this period compared with 100 such cases
 during the same period in 1996.
 Researchers at the University of Helsinki estimated that 11,000 persons-almost
 all women-were involuntarily sterilized during the period 1935-1970 in keeping
 with laws intended to "improve mankind" by sterilizing the mentally ill, those suf-
 fering from hereditary illnesses, alcoholics, and criminals. The current law, enacted
 in 1970, contains safeguards against a repetition of such abuses.
 The Government-established Council for Equality coordinates and sponsors legis-
 lation to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, or retirees.
 In 1985 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights law that mandates equal
 treatment for women in the workplace, including equal pay for "comparable" jobs.
 In practice comparable worth has not been implemented ecause of the difficulty of
 establishing criteria, but the Government, employers, unions, and others continue
 to work on implementation plans. Women's average earnings are 81 percent of those
 of men, and women still tend to be segregated in lower paying occupations. While
 women have individually attained leadership positions in the private and public sec-
 tors, there are disproportionately fewer women in top management jobs. Industry
 and finance, the labor movement, and some Government ministries remain male
 dominated. Some 60 percent of Finnish physicians are women. Women are per-
 mitted to serve in the military. The Government's Equality Ombudsman monitors
 compliance with regulations against sexual discrimination. Of the 118 complaints
 processed by the Ombudsman between January 1 and June 30, 27 cases were estab-
 lished as violations of the law.
 In February the Government approved a special program to promote women's
 equality during the period 1997-99. This program consists of 30 projects. In addition
 the Government seeks to integrate women's viewpoints into all of its activities at
 the United Nations and the Council of Europe. One of the purposes of this approach
 is to identify the sex of human rights victims in United Nations reports.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, and the national consensus
 supporting children's rights is enshrined in law.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law has required since the 1970's that
 new public buildings be accessible to people with physical disabilities, many older
 buildings remain inaccessible to them. There is no such law for public transpor-
 tation, but each municipality subsidizes measures to improve accessibility to vehi-
 cles. Local Governments maintain a free transport service that guarantees 18 free
 trips per month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided interpre-
 tation services ranging from 120 to 240 hours annually. The Government provides
 subsidized public housing to the severely disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Sami (Lapps), who constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent
 of the population, benefit from legal provisions protecting minority rights and cus-
 toms. Sami language and culture are supported financially by The Government. The
 Sami receive subsidies to enable them to continue their traditional lifestyle, which
 revolves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and civil rights and are
 able to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cultural interests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the rights of trade
 unions to organize, to assemble peacefully, and to strike, and the Government re-
 spects these provisions. About 87 percent of the work force is organized. All unions
 are independent of the Government and political parties. The law grants public sec-
 tor employees the right to strike, with some exceptions for provision of essential
 services. In the first quarter of the year, there were 34 strikes, 30 -of which were
 wildcat strikes.
 Trade unions freely affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are usually
 based on incomes policy agreements between employee and employer central organi-
 zations and the Government. The law protects workers against antiunion discrimi-
 nation. Complaint resolution is governed by collective bargaining agreements as
 well as labor law, both of which are adequately enforced.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and this prohibition is honored in practice. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children and adults, and such practices do not exist. The
 Government enforces this prohibition effectively.
 
 
 1078
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.). Youths under 16
 years of age cannot work more than 6 hours a day or at night, and education is
 compulsory for children from 7 to 16 years of age. The Labor Ministry enforces child
 labor regulations. There are virtually no complaints of exploitation of children in the
 work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage, but the
 law requires all employers-including nonunionized ones-to meet the minimum
 wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in the respective industrial sec-
 tor. These minimum wages generally afford a decent standard of living for workers
 and their families.
 The legal workweek consists of 5 days not exceeding 40 hours. Employees working
 in shifts or during the weekend are entitled to a 24-hour rest period during the
 week. The law is effectively enforced as a minimum, and many workers enjoy even
 stronger benefits through effectively enforced collective bargaining agreements.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Labor
 Ministry effectively enforces them. Workers can refuse dangerous work situations
 without risk of penalty.
