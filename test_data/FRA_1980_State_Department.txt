 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy in which the govern-
 ment's authority is balanced between executive and
 legislative branches. The French political system is
 based on the thesis that the plurality of power provides
 the checks and balances essential to ensure that the
 rights of individuals stand higher than the claims of
 the state. France has an established tradition of
 respect for human rights and of their promotion at home
 and abroad. The French government and people fully
 support this element of national tradition and policy.
 The French government administers a generous social
 welfare system designed to protect economic and social
 rights. France continues to accept large numbers of
 Indochinese refugees for resettlement. France quietly
 offers refuge to political exiles from many countries
 around the world.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by Article 303 of the
 Penal Code and respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Occasional complaints are raised in the press about
 alleged differential treatment of minorities.
 Prison conditions are adequate and physical plant facili-
 ties generally are well maintained. Reimbursed work
 programs are widely available to inmates; the parole
 system is liberal, and the possibility of periodic
 release for family visits is available. No reports have
 been received of ill treatment of prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of abduction or secret
 arrest by security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is
 guaranteed by French law and respected in practice.
 There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus in the
 French legal system. There are legal limits to the
 length of time a suspect can be held by police before
 being transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 Normally, the limit is 24 hours, although a magistrate
 can extend the period to 48 hours. In narcotics cases
 the period is four days, and six days in state security
 cases.

 * e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as a case is transferred from the police
 to a magistrate. Pretrial confinement in the magistrate
 phase is limited to four months for misdemeanors (Law
 of 17 July 1970) but can be longer in cases of felony.
 French law provides for the right of appeal.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. Search warrants are required,
 and searches cannnot take place between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 France provides extensive social benefits, unemployment "
 compensation, full health services and free education to
 all residents through university levels. France
 operates an extensive vocational training system. Rates
 of unemployment are higher among the youth, immigrant
 minority groups and women. The unemployment compensa-
 tion system available to all has minimized the social
 effects of the current period of economic recession in
 France.
 Women are assuming an increasingly significant place in
 French economic life. They occupy an important place in
 the professions.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Radio and television are government-operated.
 Newspapers display a wide range of opinion and do not
 hesitate to criticize the government.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of internal movement, foreign travel and
 emigration. Arriving.refugees immediately accrue these
 rights.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in democratic processes is fully respected.
 The rights of women and minorities are guaranteed by law.
 A cabinet level official is charged with responsibility
 for women's affairs. Women are expanding their participa-
 tion in the national life of France as ideas about the
 broader role of women gain greater acceptance in the
 society. Labor practices entail full respect for the
 right to organize, to strike and to bargain collectively.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 
 
 783
 Amnesty International has criticized French laws as
 inadequate concerning conscientious objection to
 military service. French Law (Article L.51-50, Code
 of National Service) provides for alternative public
 service in the civilian sector.
 Amnesty International maintains a major office in Paris.
 The French government participates actively in
 international and regional human rights bodies.
