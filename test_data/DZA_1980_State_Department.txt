 ALGERIA
 Algeria is a developing country for whose people and leaders
 the central historic experience continues to be the long, bitter,
 and hard-fought struggle for independence. Although the Alger-
 ian constitution contains human rights guarantees, political
 and civil liberties are restricted, and the closed nature of
 Algerian society makes information scarce. Algeria has a single
 political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN). Most
 important political decisions are taken by the government and
 party leadership headed by President Chadli Bendjedid. There
 is little freedom to deviate significantly from the path pre-
 scribed by ruling authorities. Nevertheless, there have been
 several encouraging trends. Since the advent of Bendjedid's
 presidency in February 1979, all known political prisoners have
 been released from custody. On November 1, 1980, former Presi-
 dent Ahmed. Ben Bella, who had been restricted to living in a
 province remote from the capital, was restored to complete
 freedom. The Algerian government's response to the devastat-
 ing earthquake at Al Asnam on October 10, 1980 was, by all
 accounts, remarkably efficient.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Articles 48 and 71 of the constitution prohibit torture. No
 reports have been received of its use in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment oe Punishment
 Although punishment for crimes against security may be severe
 and include the death penalty or life imprisonment, there are
 no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In the
 past, death sentences usually have been commuted to life im-
 prisonment. In-several instances, these prisoners have been
 released later. Several persons, however, reportedly were
 executed summarily as locters in the aftermath of the Al Asnam
 earthquake.
 Prison conditions vary from primitive to modern. In the pri-
 mary civil prison in Algiers (El-Harrach), prisoners are
 crowded into cells and sanitary conditions are poor. Better
 conditions are found in some smaller outlying prisons and
 jails. All prisons have medical facilities, and each prison
 has a contract with a local doctor who visits the prison regu-
 larly to treat ill prisoners. Prisoners who are seriously ill
 may be transferred to local hospitals. Prison diet is rarely
 adequate, and the prisoners' families often provide much of
 their food. Families are allowed to visit prisoners and, in
 some cases at the discretion of local prison authorities, con-
 jugal visits are permitted. Prisoners convicted of civil
 crimes are quartered apart from those convicted for crimes such
 as terrorism; the treatment is generally similar, however.
 Counsel are allowed regular access to their clients. Their
 meetings take place under the visual supervision of a guard.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross does not have
 access to detainees or prisoners.

 c. Disappearances
 There are no recent reports that persons have disappeared.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution of November 19, 1976, states that no one can
 be prosecuted, arrested or held except in cases provided for
 by law. It also provides that detention for questioning in
 criminal investigation cases cannot exceed 48 hours, after
 which the suspect must be charged or released. The urban
 police and the more rurally-oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to this constitutional requirement.
 Military Security forces (SM), however, operate under fewer
 actual restrictions and have bean known to hold suspects up
 to a month before releasing or charging them. SM is autho-
 rized to investigate not only military offenses but cases
 involving internal security and foreign intelligence collec-
 tion, as well. It can also investigate civil crimes that
 ordinarily would eunder police jurisdiction.
 Once charged, an individual can be held under preventive deten-
 tion while his case is being investigated. Given the crowded
 court dockets and number of cases under investigation, this
 period of preventive detention can last many months.
 All political prisoners apparently have been released since
 President Bendjedid took office in February 1979. Pre-
 independence Algerian political leaders, such as Ferhat Abbas
 and Ben Youssell Benkhedda, who had been placed under house
 arrest in 1975 for criticizing the regime, were released
 shortly after Bendjedid came to power. Former President Ben
 Bella was released from prison in July 1979, but remained
 restricted to the province of M'Sila until November 1, 1980,
 when all remaining restrictions were lifted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants havefee access to counsel and there is no harass-
 ment of defense counsel by the government. As far as is known,
 defendants are made fully aware of the charges against them at
 the time they are bound over for trial. Trials are public,
 and defendants have the right of appeal. The judicial system
 is divided into three parts: civil courts, military courts,
 and state security courts. The civil courts are generally
 independent of executive or military  control. Military courts
 deal directly with offenses committed by military personnel;
 such as absence without leave and theft, and also with espion-
 age. The national security court at Medea meets for important
 cases of national security and generally provides due process
 similar to that of civilian courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the constitution
 and generally is honored in practice. With the exception of
 the SM, police forces may not enter a house without a warrant
 from the local prosecutor or investigating magistrate. In
 addition, police and other security forces may not enter a
 residence during night hours. There have been occasions, how-
 ever, when SM has made unauthorized searches and seizures. It
 is not known whether SM personnel involved have been disciplined.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care, and
 Education
 The Algerian economy is largely socialist, with the main economic
 sectors in the hands of state-owned companies. Income distri-
 bution is reasonably equitable and the tax system is highly
 progressive. An estimated 3.2 percent annual population in-
 crease makes it difficult to meet food and social needs and
 provide full employment, but minimum vital needs are being met.
 The National Popular Assembly adopted a five-year plan (1980-
 1984) on November 10, 1980 which gives greater priority to ful-
 fillment of social needs, such as housing and health care. Per
 capita gross domestic product (GDP) was $1,612 in 1979. Total
 GDP was $29 billion in 1979, of which about one-half is con-
 sumed and the other half is invested. The rate of real growth
 in 1979 was 9percent. About 13 percent of non-agricultural
 workers are unemployed.
 The government controls most food supplies. One-third of the
 nation's food must be imported because of inefficient agricul-
 ture. While food supplies are adequate, the cost is high and
 distribution is irregular. A special program established in
 the spring of 1980 to alleviate this problem through increased
 imports has somewhat improved the situation.
 Housing is in extremely short supply, but efforts to correct
 the shortage are underway. Pending legislation would permit
 residents to purchase French properties appropriated by the
 government at the time of independence, thereby increasing
 private ownership and stimulating a housing market. A total
 of 450,000 dwelling units are scheduled for construction in
 1980-84.
 Most health care is rudimentary, but free and widely available.
 Education is free through the university level. It is compul-
 sory between the ages of six and thirteen. Educational facili-
 ties, however, generally are inadequate in both rural and urban
 areas. The literacy level in Arabic, French, or both is
 approximately 40 percent of the population over nine years of
 age.
 Some corruption exists in Algeria; it does not appear to hinder
 .seriously development or the fulfillment of vital human needs,
 however.
 3.  Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although the constitution guarantees-freedom of expression and
 assembly, it states that they may not be used to undermine the
 foundations of the socialist revolution. All of the printed and
 electronic media, including foreign publications,-are controlled
 or monitored by the government. Foreign newspapers and maga-
 zines are generally available, but certainissues have been
 seized. The French language weekly Jeune Afrique is proscribed.
 Many economic and social problems are frankly discussed in the
 government-controlled media, and government policies often are
 criticized without naming individuals.
 Although in law an Islamic country, Algeria protects the rights
 of the small Christian and Jewish minorities. On several
 occasions, the government has intervened to prevent desecration
 of Christian and Jewish cemeteries and places of worship.
 
 
 939
 The government has a continuing problem of reconciling its
 policy of developing the identity of Algeria as an Arab nation
 with the desires of the Kabylie Berbers (about 15 percent of
 the population) to preserve their own culture and language,
 while retaining French as a language of education and work.
 In March 1980, student demonstrations occurred in'the Kabylie
 region to the east of Algiers, followed by a general strike in
 the region in April. While security forces generally showed
 restraint, a clash with students and their supporters on
 April 20 reportedly led to some casualties and arrests. Those
 arrested were eventually released. The government since has
 permitted Kabylie cultural events to take place, but at the
 same time has remained firm in its policy of making Arabic,
 instead of French, the language of education.
 While there generally are no legal impediments to freedom of
 assembly, there is only one legal political party and one
 umbrella labor union, the General Union of Algerian Workers
 (UGTA). These and other party- or government-sponsored "mass
 organizations" for youth, women, farmers and veterans are the
 primary recognized associations in Algeria. Security personnel
 watch public gatherings closely. Limited political opposition,
 such as student demonstrations, is tolerated and opposition
 political tracts are circulated with almost certain knowledge
 of the government. In addition, workers have successfully
 used strikes, without the sanction of the national union, to
 win more pay and benefits.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One
 of the first acts of the Bendjedid government was to remove the
 exit visa requirement for Algerians traveling abroad. The
 amount of hard currency which Algerians may carry abroad has
 been doubled, but remains the primary limitation on foreign
 travel. These changes have resulted in significantly increased
 Algerian travel abroad. The Algerian and French governments
 have agreed on a series of measures, such as special benefits,
 to encourage some of the many Algerian workers in France volun-
 tarily to return to Algeria. Except for foreign diplomats, who
 must apply for permission to travel farther than 50 kilometers
 from Algiers, travel within Algeria is generally unrestricted.
 Visitors must fill out police registration forms if they are
 staying overnight in a locality. The gendarmerie occasionally
 sets up vehicular check points in the countryside to verify
 ownership and physical condition of vehicles and occasionally
 to imprese the populace with the government's vigilance.
 A special problem are those Algerians (Harkis) who fought on
 the French side during the war for independence and have since
 resided in France. In general, the Harkis are not permitted to
 return to Algeria.
 The constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 According to estimates of international experts, there are up
 to 120,000 refugees in camps near Tindouf, most of them apparent-
 ly from the western Sahara. There also are several thousand
 refugees around Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, mostly from
 Mali and Niger, who left those countries at the time of the Sahel
 drought. The government contributes to the support of all of
 these refugees, as does the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees.
 
 
 940
 The government supports various liberation and dissident groups.
 Many of their representatives (some of whom may be considered
 refugees) are located in Algiers.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is largely confined to
 the single party, and there is little freedom to deviate sig-
 nificantly from the path prescribed by ruling authorities.
 While fundamental policy options are not questioned, there is
 considerable airing of popular aspirations and grievances
 within the party organization and within the elected assemblies
 which exist at national and local levels.
 The status of wommnin Algeria is improving, but tradition and
 culture make it difficult for any woman to follow an independent
 path. Women are legally equal to men but, in fact, have less
 freedom than do men. The great majority of Algerian women
 remain in traditional roles, but their participation in public
 life is growing. Ten women have been elected to the Popular
 National Assembly, two are members of the Central Committee of
 the FLN party, and several women have been elected to the Council
 of the National Committee of the Party. Women also serve in
 the armed forces.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women from
 men in equality of educational opportunity. According to gov-
 ernment statistics, 62 percent of all school-age girls were
 enrolled in 1980 compared with 39 percent in 1965. In 1979,
 about 40 percent of all students were female.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged violations of
 Human Rights
 The government has not allowed foreign or international organi-
 zations to visit Algeria to investigate alleged violations of
 human rights. With the release of former President Ben Bella
 and other political prisoners, the government has responded to
 a major criticism leveled against it by such organizations as
 Amnesty International.
