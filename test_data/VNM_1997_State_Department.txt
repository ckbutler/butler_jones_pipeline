 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a small South Pacific island nation of approximately 170,000 people
 which was jointly administered by Britain and France prior to its independence in
 1980, has a parliamentary form of government with a 50-member Parliament, a
 Prime Minister, and a President. The latter's powers are largely ceremonial, except
 when acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Political legitimacy is based
 on majority rule. The courts are normally independent of executive interference.
 The civilian authorities normally control the small police force and the para-
 military Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF). In the wake of a mutiny by elements of the
 VMF in October, 1996, the mutineers were arrested, tried and sentenced. Seven of
 them were dismissed from the VMF by the Police Service Commission. The Govern-
 
 
 924
 ment accepted recommendations placing the VMF more firmly under the operational
 control of the Police Commissioner.
 Subsistence and small-scale agricultural production and fishing support more
 than 80 percent of the population. Copra, cocoa, and beef cattle are the main cash
 crops. The service sector-government, tourism, and an offshore financial center-
 provides most formal employment and represents the largest component of the coun-
 try's gross domestic product.
 Government control over much of the media, attacks on an outspoken ombuds-
 man, together with discrimination and violence against women, were the country's
 major human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Constitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. The law provides that
 prisoners shall have recourse to the Ombudsman, a constitutional position.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors, if requested.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests. Arrest is by warrant. The Constitutional provision that suspects must be in-
 formed of the chares and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in prac-
 tice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The courts are normally free of military or execu-
 tive interference. Most routine legal matters appear before magistrate's courts.
 There is also a Supreme Court, and above the Supreme Court an Appeals Court
 with three judges, two of whom are appointed by the President and chosen from
 among supreme court judges in other south Pacific nations as required.
 The judicial system is based on British law. The courts uphold constitutional pro-
 visions for a fair public trial, presumption of innocence until gult is proven, prohibi-
 tion against double jeopardy, the right of judicial determination of the validity of
 arrest or detention, and appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the executive has
 tried to pressure the largely expatriate judiciary in cases with political implications.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, these provisions have not always been honored in practice.
 The Government controls much of the country's media, including a weely news-
 paper, one AM and one FM radio station, and a limited-service television station
 confined to the capital, Port Vila, which provides English and French news service
 three times a week. In late 1994, an independent weekly, which has since expanded
 into semiweekly editions, began publishing. Opposition political parties and
 groupings occasionally publish newsletters.
 In July the Council of Ministers began moves, which are currently under court
 review, to remove Ombudsman Marie Noel Ferrieux Patterson, who had angered
 some politicians by continued reporting of their corruption and malfeasance. Two
 weekly newspapers, the Vanuatu Weekly Hebdomadaire and the Vanuatu Trading
 Post, covered the ongoing controversy.
 Vanuatu governments have not been as concerned over media reports directed to
 external audiences. PACNEWS, a Pacific regional news agency located in Vanuatu
 since 1994, continued to transmit stories throughout the region even when they in-
 cluded criticism of the country's leaders. Correspondents for international media are
 also allowed to report without interference.
 The Government respects academic freedom. Vanuatu has three institutions of
 higher education-a teachers college, an agricultural school, and an annex of the
 University of the South Pacific.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies; they are routinely granted.
 The Government does not restrict the forming of political parties and other
 groups.
 
 
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respected it in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations work
 without restriction. The Government apparently has not attempted to enforce the
 1995 Religious Bodies Act, which the President refused to sign on constitutional
 grounds. The act gives the Government the right to register and potentially to con-
 trol the activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4 years, through
 which citizens can freely change their government. Parliamentary majorities have
 been unstable, with legislators spending much time and energy accumulating sup-
 port for votes of no confidence on the one hand and fending them off on the other.
 None of the three main parties gained a majority in the general elections held in
 1995. The present Government, a coalition led by Prime Minister Serge Vohor, as-
 sumed office in October 1996 after two earlier coalitions had been toppled by no-
 confidence votes. Since that time, Vohor has shuffled his cabinet several times. Al-
 though the President dissolved Parliament on November 27 and called for new elec-
 tions on January 20, 1998, the Appeals Court is reviewing whether the dissolution
 of Parliament was constitutional. The prospects for elections remained uncertain at
 year's end.
 While outside observers generally consider the November 1995 voting to be fair,
 the government's influence on the media prevented opposition parties from fully
 publicizing their views. That government, as well as successor governments, have
 also been accused of politically-biased employment practices.
 Traditional attitudes, in which men are dominant and women are frequently lim-
 ited to customary family roles, hamper women from taking a more active role in eco-
 nomic and political life. One Member of Parliament is a woman, who also served
 briefly as a cabinet minister in the current government. The Ombudsman is a
 woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local human rights organizations,
 and Vanuatu's first, the Human Rights Forum, was founded in 1994.
 In July the Council of Ministers began moves, which are currently under court
 review, to remove Ombudsman Marie Noel Ferrieux Patterson, who had angered
 some politicians by continued reporting of their corruption and malfeasance (see
 Section 2.a.). In November Parliament repealed the Ombudsman Act. The President
 refused to sign the bill into law until the Supreme Court had reviewed it. If the
 repeal of the act is upheld, the current Ombudsman would remain in office until
 a new act is drafted and passed.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1980 Constitution provides fundamental rights and freedoms to "all persons
 . . . without discrimination on the grounds of race, place of origin, religious or tradi-
 tional beliefs, political opinions, language, or sex.] Despite constitutional and legal
 protections, women remain victims of discrimination in this tradition-based society.
 Due to high rates of unemployment, there are few jobs available to the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is believed to be com-
 mon, although no accurate statistics exist. Courts occasionally prosecute offenders
 using common law assault as a basis for prosecution since there are no specific laws
 against wife beating. However, most cases of violence against women, including
 rape, go unreported ecause women, particularly in rural areas, are reluctant to re-
 port them for fear of further abuse. In addition police are frequently reluctant to
 intervene in what are considered to be domestic matters.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly emerging
 from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general reluctance to
 educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote themselves pri-
 marily to childbearing. In announcing Vanuatu's ratification of the U.N. Convention
 on Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) at the 1995
 U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, the then-Deputy Prime Minister stated that
 it would take time to implement the laws giving equal rights to women.
 
 
 926
 The majority of women enter into marriage through "bride-price payment," a prac-
 tice that encourages men to view women as property. Women are also inhibited by
 tradition from owning land, and at least one women a advocate believes this limita-
 tion serves to underpin their secondary status. Many female leaders view village
 chiefs as a major obstacle to attaining social, political and economic rights for
 women. The National Council of Women organized seminars prior to the November
 1995 general elections to increase women's awareness of their political rights.
 Children.-Although the Government has made education a priority, access to
 education is limited and school attendance is not compulsory. Children are protected
 within the traditional extended-family system. Members of the extended family, par-
 ticularly paternal uncles, play an active role in a child's development. As a result,
 virtually no children are homeless or abandoned. There is no societal pattern of
 abuse, although cases of child abuse are occasionally reported.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled and no legislation mandating access for them. Their protection and care
 is left to the traditional extended family and to voluntary nongovernmental organi-
 zations.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is made up of Mela-
 nesians. Small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans
 are generally concentrated in two towns and on a few plantations; they experience
 discrimination with regard to land ownership. There is no evidence to suggest a pat-
 tern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of the limited basic services which the
 Government provides.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to organize
 unions. Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without gov-
 ernment permission.
 Approximately 29,000 persons participate in the formal economy as wage earners.
 There are five trade unions. The unions are grouped under an umbrella organza-
 tion, the Vanuatu Council of Trade Unions, a member of the International Coned-
 eration of Free Trade Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Government
 and ran a number of candidates under the Labor Party banner in the November
 1995 general elections, although no Labor candidate was elected to Parliament or
 received more than a small percentage of the votes.
 The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agriculture and
 fishing deters extensive union activity. In addition membership in the Vanuatu Pub-
 lic Servants Union fell dramatically following the Government's wholesale dismissal
 of hundreds of full-time public servants during a protracted general strike in 1994.
 The Supreme Court in February 1994 ruled that the union had not complied with
 its own rules when it undertook the general strike and declared the strike illegal.
 Combined union membership in the private and public sectors reportedly has fallen
 from more than 4,000 to less than 1,000 in the aftermath of the 1994 strike.
 The law prohibits retribution if the strike is legal. In the case of private-sector
 employees, violations would be referred to the Labor Department for conciliation
 and arbitration. In the public sector, violations would be handled by the Public Serv-
 ice Commission.
 In August 1995, Parliament passed a law requiring unions to give 30 days' notice
 of intent to strike, with a list of the names of intending strikers.
 There was no significant strike activity in 1997.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 3-member arbitration board appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The board
 consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management, and the
 senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the beard,
 labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees. Unions
 and management, however, generally reach agreement on wages without having to
 refer the matter to arbitration. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are referred
 to the Commissioner of Labor. While the law does not require union recognition,
 once a union is recognized, it does prohibit antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no re-
 ports that either adults or children were subject to conditions of forced, bonded, or
 compulsory labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits children under 12 years of age from working outside of family-owned agri-
 
 
 cultural production, where many children assist their parents. There were no re-
 ports of forced or bonded labor by children, which is prohibited by law (see Section
 6.c). Employ ent of children from 12 to 18 years of ae is restricted by occupational
 category and conditions of labor, for example, restctions on employment in the
 shipping industry and on night-time employment. The Labor Department effectively
 enforces these laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. In February 1995, it was raised to a
 flat rate of approximately $143 (16,000 vatu) per month for both urban and rural
 workers. The previous minimum wage was approximately $93 for rural workers and
 $107 (13,200 vatu) for urban workers. The minimum wage would not support an
 urban family living entirely on the cash economy. Most families are not dependent
 solely on wages for their livelihoods.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek, with at least one 24-
 hour rest period weekly. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor Depart-
 ment, includes provisions for safety standards. However, the 1987 safety and health
 legislation is inadequate to protect workers engaged in loggi, agriculture, con-
 struction, and manufacturing, and the single inspector attached to the Labor De-
 partment is hardpressed to enforce the act fully. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued em-
 ployment.
