 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. The Constitution vests legislative power in
 the 38-seat National Assembly (Parliament), elected every 5 years, and executive
 F ower in the President, currently Sir Ketu mile Masir, who was reelected in 1989
 or a second 5-year term. The President selects his Cabinet from members of the
 National Assembly. While Botswana has several active political parties, the coun-
 try's politics are dominated by the governing Botswana Democratic Party (BDP).
 The courts operate independently of both the legislative and executive branches. All
 citizens, regardless of race, are free to participate fully in the economic and political
 life of the country.
 Botswana's military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), numbers about 8,000
 soldiers and the Botswana National Police (BNP) has about 3,000 members. Both
 the BDF and the BNP are subordinate to civilian authority.
 The economy is market oriented with strong encouragement for private enter-
 prise. Spurred by diamond revenues, the country's economy expanded rapidly in the
 1980's, although the growth rate slowed in 1992-93. Since independence in 1966,
 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has increased from $69 to a current figure
 of about $2,590. However, more than 50 percent of the population lives outside the
 formal sector, gaining its livelihood from subsistence farming and animal hus-
 bandry. Furthermore, income distribution is heavily skewed, with the top 20 percent
 of the population probably earning more than 60 percent of total income and the
 bottom 40 percent earning as little as 10 percent of the total.
 Botswana's laws and legal system provide for a broad range of individual rights
 and freedoms which are widely observed in practice. However, women face signifi-
 cant legal and practical discrimination, and violence against them is a growing prob-
 lem. Dwellers in remote areas and groups not numbered among the eight "pnncipal
 tribes" identified in the Constitution do not enjoy full political rights or full access
 to social services. One man died while in police custody in November 1992 after al-
 legedly being tortured; five police detectives were convicted of manslaughter and
 sentenced to 5 years in prison (of which 3 years were suspended) for causing the
 man's death. There were credible reports that occasional mistreatment of suspects
 continued in 1993. Labor has the right to organize freely, although trade unions con-
 tinue to face certain legal restrictions. The press, human rights groups, and others
 sharply criticized the Government's use of its power to expel foreigners without giv-
 ing reasons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The death of the suspect in the No-
 vember 1992 case was the only confirmed killing by police resulting from beatings
 or shootings which were not strictly in self-defense.
 b. Disappearance.-No instances of politically motivated disappearances were re-
 ported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although not authorized or routine, torture of suspects appears to be more common
 practice than was previously known. Officers found to have abused suspects have
 been subjected to internal disciplinary procedures and criminal prosecution. A sus-
 pected robber died in police custody in November 1992 after reported suffocation by
 a plastic bag. Five police detectives were convicted of manslaughter and sentenced
 to 5 years in prison (of which 3 were suspended) for causing the man's death. The
 murder charge was downgraded to manslaughter because the police were acting in
 the line of duty at the time. The judge explained the relatively light sentence by
 pointing out that the officers had no prior records of misconduct and that he did
 
 
 14
 not want to "demoralize" the rest of the force. Several credible accounts of such suf-
 focation torture to extract confessions or leads in serious crimes surfaced after the
 1992 death. Game scouts (wardens) accused of mistreating suspects in 1992 were
 suspended and prosecuted during 1993 but were acquitted of assault due to lack of
 evidence. A former policeman alleged that torture of suspects in murder cases is
 "common" and not reported or stopped by higher authorities. Annually, a handful
 of game scouts and police found to have abused suspects have been been subject to
 disciplinary actions (transfer, suspension pending investigation, and reprimands),
 but police are reluctant to punish abuse of authority in their ranks and even more
 reluctant to have it publicized; so many abusers have not been disciplined. Prior to
 1992 there were succesful civil suits against police for mistreatment, and another
 well-documented civil suit for damages stemming from a 1991 case-but signifi-
 cantly against the chief suspect in the 1992 death case-is currently in court. Such
 punishments do not appear to have been an adequate deterrent, for credible allega-
 tions of mistreatment continue.
 The Government makes efforts to protect women in custody from rape and other
 abuse. Arrested women are placed in the charge of female police officers, reducing
 the potential for mistreatment by male police officers. Prison conditions are gen-
 erally acceptable. Basic nutritional and hygenic requirements are met. Inmates, in-
 cluding some illegal immigrants later found to be elgible for refugee status, com-
 plained of mistreatment (pushing, rude treatment, denial of meals or privileges for
 relatively minor infractions). Such abuse does not appear to be widespread or con-
 doned. Prisoners' complaints were not rigorously investigated; no prison officer was
 punished in 1993 for mistreatment of inmates.
 Caning is allowed for certain offenses for men below age 40. Strict conditions reg-
 ulate the size of the cane, require medical examinations of the prisoner before and
 after punishment and prescribe strokes only across the buttocks. A recent High
 Court opinion forbids corporal punishment for children under 14. Parents and vil-
 lage headmen, however, may beat children under rules of "traditional punishment."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Citizens are protected from arbitrary ar-
 rest under the Constitution. An arresting officer must explain the crime an arrestee
 is accused of and advise that the arrestee has the right to remain silent. In most
 cases, a suspect may contact anyone of his or her choosing and must be charged
 before a magistrate within 48 hours of arrest. Bail is allowed and detainees have
 the right to hire attorneys of their choice. Poor police training and poor communica-
 tions in rural villages, however, make it difficult for detainees to obtain legal assist-
 ance, and procedures are not strictly followed. An automatic public defender service
 for those unable to afford a lawyer is lacking.
 Once a suspect has appeared before a magistrate, he or she may be detained only
 if the magistrate issues a writ of detention, valid for 14 days and renewable ever
 14 days thereafter. Observance of these procedures has been uneven, but police offi-
 cers exceeding their detention authority have been administratively punished or
 sued successfully in civil actions.
 These restrictions on detention do not apply to illegal immigrants (mostly
 Zimbabweans or Zambians). Hundreds of such illegal immigrants are found in peri-
 odic sweeps by the police and deported, although many are detained for periods
 rangng from a few hours to over a year, pending deportation.
 The Constitution allows the President to declare a foreigner a "prohibited immi-
 grant" (PI) and order deportation. This provision was used in 20 or more cases in
 1993. The law does not require any explanation for declarations of PI status, nor
 is any normally given. The order is not subject to judicial review, although one con-
 troversial 1993 order expelling a prominent businessman was rescinded by the
 President after public protests. Further, no explanation or judicial review of can-
 cellation of residence permits for foreigners is required. This method of expulsion
 also came under public fire in 1993, resulting in presidential reversal of one such
 residence permit revocation.
 Persons charged under the National Security Act (NSA) must be arraigned before
 a magistrate within 96 hours, and suspects may be held indefinitely. However, this
 act has rarely been invoked and was not used in 1993. Security cases are tried
 under ordinary criminal procedures after an initial hearing.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches of government in beth law and practice. This was reaffirmed
 in 1993 with the bribery conviction and sentencing to jail of a prominent ruling
 party member of the National Assembly. No instances of the courts being used to
 intimidate or silence political dissent were reported.
 In late 1993 no political prisoners were held in Botswana, although migrants
 claiming refugee status were routinely detained and deported without due process.
 In some cases, refuge-seekers have been held without charge for over a year even
 
 
 after the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) determined that
 they met the legal criteria for refugee status.
 Botswana has two court systems the civil courts and the customary (traditional)
 courts. In the civil courts, a defendant's right to due process is provided for by law
 and largely honored in practice, although many defendants are not informed of their
 rights in pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Most trials are held in public and court records are public. However, trials under
 the National Security Act may be held in secret. As a rule, courts appoint public
 defenders only for those charged with capital crimes (murder and treason); lawyers
 in these cases serve on a pro bono basis. Thus, those charged with noncapital crimes
 are often tried without legal representation if they cannot affbrd an attorney. How-
 ever, defendants may in any case confront witnesses and present evidence and are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. There are clearly defined appeal procedures,
 which are often employed.
 Customary courts handle land, marital and property disputes as well as minor
 crimes but are open only to members of the given tribe. No rules of evidence apply
 in these courts, and there are no attorneys for either side. Tribal chiefs who preside
 over the court do not have judicial training and have been known to taunt defend-
 ants for confessions. Maximum punishment is limited, and appeals are permitted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Privacy
 in family matters and correspondence is respected, and there is no evidence of arbi-
 trary surveillance of persons or their communications.
 Court-issued search warrants are required, but police officers of the rank of ser-
 geant and above may enter, search, and seize property provided they believe "on
 reasonable grounds" that criminal activity is involved and that evidence would be
 lost or compromised by waiting for a warrant, and provided that the evidence is
 later brought before a magistrate. In practice, this means that seizures of property
 are frequently made without resort to search warrants. Evidence gained without a
 warrant is admissible in court. Judges may and do disqualify such evidence if it can
 be shown that it would not likely have been compromised by taking the time to ob-
 tain a proper warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 in the Constitution and respected in practice. Opposition viewpoints and criticism
 of the Government are freely expressed in Parliament and elsewhere.
 The Botswana Press Agency (BOPA), Radio Botswana, and the Daily News are
 all part of the Department of Information and Broadcasting. Each is independent
 of the other two, although Radio Botswana and the Daily News get the majority of
 their news stories from BOPA. Both the Daily News and Radio Botswana are run
 with a modest degree of autonomy. The Daily News, made available free of charge,
 consists largely of reports of speeches of ministers and other high officials and inter-
 national wire service stories. In addition, there are four independent weeklies which
 frequently disagree with or criticize senior officials. These papers have reported inci-
 dents of fraud and misconduct, which led to resignations and prosecutions of promi-
 nent political figures. While opposition parties' activities receive press coverage, the
 Government media gives more space to ruling party viewpoints. The independent
 press is more evenhanded and publishes a wide variety of opinions and features.
 In the past, the Government clashed with the independent press over the proper
 reporting of national security issues. In 1993 the Government prevented the media
 from fully covering National Police Day celebrations, claiming that the restriction
 was required for logistical reasons.
 Individual ministers and members of Parliament have brought suits against criti-
 cal independent media, and in late 1993 a case was still pending against one paper
 for publishing allegedly secret documents regarding internal government delibera-
 tions in worker grievance cases. Books and publications are not censored. Academic
 freedom is fully respected. Although a law was passed in 1990 authorizing restric-
 tions on certain kinds of student protests, such restrictions have never 'Len im-
 posed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Botswana has a long history
 of peaceful assembly which is integral to traditional village life and is exemplified
 in the village meeting, the Kgotla. During Kgotla meetings, men freely question
 leaders and voice opinions on local and national politics. Traditionally, women do
 not speak out at Kgotlas and are discouraged from expressing their opinions. Per-
 mits are required for public meetings and demonstrations and are usually granted
 if the police believe public order will not be threatened.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. There is no
 state religion, and while the majority of the population is Christian, many other
 
 
 faiths are practiced freely. No restrictions are put on places of worship, the training
 of members of the clergy, religious publishing, religious education, conversion, or
 participation in charitable activity. Restrictions were not placed on missionaries or
 foreign clergy during 1993.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Botswana has no restrictions on movement within the country, foreign
 travel, emigration, or the right to return. Passports are easily obtained by citizens
 and are valid for 10 years.
 Refugees documented by the UNHCR are readily accepted into Botswana but are
 normally required to live in the refugee settlement at Dukwe in the northeast, al-
 though the Government may authorize them to live elsewhere. Refugees currently
 in Botswana number about 700. South Africans continued to be processed as refu-
 gees in 1993, but displaced persons arriving from more distant east and central Afri-
 can countries were frequently detained as illegal immigrants and not referred to the
 UNHCR for possible determination of refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Botswana citizens have the right to change their government peacefully through
 democratic means, although in practice one party, the BDP, has dominated Par-
 liament since independence 27 years ago. Members of Parliament are elected by se-
 cret ballot and universal suffrage of citizens 21 years of age and older; the President
 is elected by the Parliament. In the National Assembly, 34 of the 38 members arc
 elected every 5 years; the remaining 4 are appointed by the President. In the 1989
 elections, the BDP won 31 of the 34 elected seats. Parliamentary debate is vigorous,
 and government policies are freely criticized as each proposed bill goes through
 three readings. Members of Parliament frequently demand that ministers define
 and defend their departments' policies and performance. New parties are freely
 formed. Of the eight active political parties, only two, the BDP and Botswana Na-
 tional Front (BNF), are represented in Parliament.
 The leading opposition party, the BNF, threatened to boycott the 1994 elections
 if the BDP did not agree to certain electoral reforms to reduce what they saw as
 built-in advantages of incumbency. Although the opposition received more than 25
 percent of the national vote in 1989, it won only 3 seats in Parliament. Opposition
 parties complain that election administration is partisan and that the BDP uses ap-
 pointed seats to district and town councils to undo hard-won opposition victories in
 local elections.
 The political rights of women and minorities are not restricted by law, but tradi-
 tional patriarcha society has discouraged women from taking part in politics. Yet,
 women vote in geater numbers than men, and the number of'positions, including
 senior posts, heFd by women in various institutions is increasing. Women hold seats
 in local and district councils, and two women are in Parliament; one of them is the
 Minister of Foreign Affairs. Groups living a nomadic life style in remote areas have
 difficulty participating in the political process and are poorly represented in politics
 (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate openly and independently. The Botswana As-
 sociation for Human Rights aims to focus national attention on needed legal re-
 forms, to make recommendations to the National Law Reform Committee, to height-
 en public awareness about human rights, and to pressure the Government to ratify
 more of the international human rights instruments. Independent organizations
 dealing with the rights of women, the handicapped, and rural dwellers are also ac-
 tive.
 The Government also permits international organizations involved in human
 rights and humanitarian affairs, including the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and the International
 Labor Organization, to operate in Botswana. Amnesty International (Al) reported in
 1993 on mistreatment of indigenous hunters apprehended for poaching in 1992 and
 earlier years. The Government disputed Al's assertions and its conclusion but did
 not obstruct the investigation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination based on color,
 race, nationality, or creed but do not mention discrimination based on sex. More-
 over, a number of laws and customs have the effect of restricting social and eco-
 nomic opportunities for women. For example, women married "in common property"
 
 
 become legal minors and, without their husbands' consent, may not purchase or sell
 property, gain access to credit, or make other legally binding agreements. While a
 woman may enter a binding transaction as a public trader, she may become a trader
 only with her husband's consent. Marriage license applications are increasingly ac-
 companied by explanations of marriage "out of common property" under which a
 woman retains the property she brings to a marriage as well as full adult legal
 standing after marriage. Although frowned upon by more traditional families, these
 marriages are increasingly common. Under customary law a husband may have ad-
 ditional wives after consulting with his first wife and the families, although this
 practice is dying out.
 A woman is required to obtain her husband's permission for operations to prevent
 conception. Abortion is allowed in cases of rape or incest and when the physical or
 mental health of a mother is threatened, or when a child will suffer grave physical
 or mental abnormalities. Two physicians must agree that the health of the mother
 is threatened, or that the child will have severe abnormalities. If the health of a
 married couple's child is at risk, or the mother is an unwed minor, abortion is a
 family decision. A married woman must get her husband's consent to abort a child
 if he is the father and the unborn child's health, not the mother's, is in question.
 An unmarried minor seeking an abortion requires the parents' concurrence.
 The Attorney General maintains that women have no legal recourse in sex dis-
 crimination cases. However, a recent case attracting international attention (Dow
 vs. State) sucessfully challenged the Citizenship Act, arguing that the law discrimi-
 nated by preventing a woman from transmitting Botswana citizenship to her chil-
 dren. The ruling, upheld by the High Court in 1992, means the Citizenship Law
 must be rewritten. At year's end the reform of Botswana's citizenship transmission
 laws was still under discussion within the Government. No decision had been made
 to hold a referendum on the issue or attempt to amend the Constitution. Inheritance
 laws and customs call for each child, regardless of sex, to receive a share of an es-
 tate. The oldest male child receives a larger share but is responsible for his widowed
 mother and minor siblings.
 Violence against women, including rape, is a growing problem. Police statistics in-
 dicate that 172 women died between 1990 and 1992 as a result of domestic violence.
 In 1989 and 1990 alone, 1,000 women reported being victims of battery. Men have
 traditionally had the right to "chastise their wives, and wife beating involving
 bruising to face and body is still accepted. No support groups or shelters for battered
 women exist. However, a legal center in Mochudi provides legal services and coun-
 seling to victims of violence. Most women are reluctant to report cases of assault
 because they fear their husbands will be publicly reprimanded. The parents of a
 couple are expected to help reconcile any differences, with the consequence that po-
 lice are unwilling to intervene. In serious cases, however, a woman must file a police
 report before being admitted to a hospital for treatment of injuries resulting from
 assault and battery. The maximum penalty for a convicted rapist is life imprison-
 ment with mandatory corporal punishment; the average sentence is 4 years with
 corporal punishment. A few traditional doctors still perform a type of female cir-
 cumcision on rare occasions.
 Agricultural labor is shared, with men generally responsible for plowing, planting,
 and assistine with the harvest. Women traditionally weed farm plots and protect
 them from birds, cattle, and other animals. Cattle herding, the most important pas-
 toral activity in Botswana society, is a male responsibility. Women are responsible
 for household management, including child rearing, budgeting, and allocating tasks
 to other female relatives. Urban women with modern sk ills and education appear
 to have entry-level opportunities nearly equal to men, but women's access dwindles
 sharply in the higher echelons of business and public service. Urban women without
 such skills are generally relegated to low-paying service jobs. Concerted government
 action to improve the status of women has been limited, but there is no evidence
 of particular jobs being reserved for men. Women are increasingly visible in the pro-
 fessions and commerce and as laborers. The number of women's organizations is
 growing. The most active group is Emang Basadi, which seeks to educate women
 about their rights, argues for the enforcement of fathers' obligations to support their
 children, and advocates day-care in institutions like the National University and
 banks which employ large numbers of women. In addition, numerous local women's
 groups are organized for self-help.
 Children.-Children's rights are addressed in the 1981 Children's Act, which man-
 dates a separate judicial process for juveniles, compulsory schooling until age 13,
 and the legal obligation of both parents to care for their children (including those
 born out of wedlock). The employment section of the act prohibits children from
 heavy lifting and any participation in industrial labor or nighttime employment.
 
 
 18
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Tswana majority, made up of eight
 principal tribes, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with "minor" tribes, chief
 among which are the Kalanga, who constitute 25 percent of the population. Each
 of the Tswana tribes is represented in the House of Chiefs while other groups are
 only allowed a subchief, who is not a member of the House. Although ethnic rival-
 ries are not entirely absent, no ethnic groups suffer from direct discrimination. The
 most prominent complaint concerns the Government's refusal to allow school in-
 struction in minority languages, especially Ikalanga.
 Groups living in remote areas, including the Kgalagadi and the San (also called
 Basarwa or Bushmen), do not have full access to government services and legal re-
 dress, partly because of their distance from settled areas and their nomadic lifestyle.
 They are poorly represented in politics and have few opportunities for power, even
 at the local level. The Government is revising controversial policies that limit re-
 mote area dwellers' access to land and the ability of foreign nongovernmental orga-
 nizations (NGO's) to work with the San.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate on the basis of
 physical handicaps, and, working with the NGO community, promotes special edu-
 cation and training. A growing number of job opportunities exist for the disabled
 in both the private and public sectors, but opportunities do not match the number
 of those in need. Public buildings and vehicles can rarely accomodate wheelchairs,
 although a handful of newer buildings in the Gaborone area offer ramps and ele-
 vators. Those features are not, however, the result of legislation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers, except for civil servants, have the legal
 right to establish or join trade unions. These government workers may form associa-
 tions that function as quasi-unions but lack the right to negotiate wages. Unions
 are well developed in the mining, railways, and banking sectors, as well as among
 government blue-collar workers. There is one major confederation of trade unions,
 the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU). Trade unions are independent
 of government control or party affiliation and actively seek to represent their mem-
 bers' interests. Unions may employ administrative staff, but the law requires elected
 union officials to work full time in the industry the union represents. This severely
 limits union leaders' effectiveness and has been criticized by the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), with which the BFTU is affiliated.
 In addition, the law severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theo-
 retically possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but, in practice, none of
 the country's strikes has been legal. No significant strikes took place in 1993.
 Unions may join international organizations, and labor representatives regularly
 attend international conferences. The Minister of Labor must approve any affiliation
 with an outside labor movement, but unions may now appeal to the courts if an ap-
 plication to join or form an amalgamation is refused. Union officials and members
 may receive foreign scholarships and travel expenses without government permis-
 sion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although employers are re-
 quired under the Trade Union Act to bargain with any trade union that organizes
 at least 25 percent of the work force in a given industry, in practice, a union s abil-
 ity to bring employers to the bargaining table depends on its overall strength. Col-
 lective bargaining is common in the mining sector, where trade unions are strong,
 but is virtually nonexistent in most other sectors.
 Public sector salary levels set under the Government's incomes policy used to
 serve as a benchmark for private sector wages, but that policy was voided by Par-
 liament in 1990. Since then, private sector pay raises and inflation indexing must
 be negotiated directly with employers.
 Dismissals may be appealed to labor officers or civil courts, but labor officers rare-
 ly do more than order 2 months' severance pay.
 Workers cannot be fired or suspended for legal union-related activities, and any
 person who has been dismissed would have the right to demand reinstatment. The
 Government itself fired a handful of union activists in 1992 but did so on other legal
 grounds.
 Labor law and practice in Botswana's only export processing zone, in Selebi-
 Phikwe, are the same as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither forced nor compulsory
 labor is practiced, and both are specifically forbidden by the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although education is not compul-
 sory, it is almost universally available, and most children attend school at least
 through the seventh grade. The Government is rapidly making 9 years of free public
 education universally available. The employment of children under age 13 by any-
 
 
 19
 one except members of the child's immediate family is strictly prohibited. No juve-
 nile under the age of 15 may be employed in any industry, and only persons over
 16 may be employed in night work. No person 16 or younger is permitted to work
 in hazardous jobs including mining. In addition, young people may not be recruited
 for jobs outside the country. The hours and workling conditions of children in the
 informal sector, particularly in rural areas, are difficult to assess. Such employment
 is almost always in family enterprises or on family farms, in which case juvenile
 labor laws do not apply. There were no reported cases of formal sector employers
 violating these statutes in 1993. The Department of Labor is insufficiently staffed
 to enforce compliance by small enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As of April 1993, the minimum monthly wage
 was $100 (pula 237). The Central Statistics Office calculated a minimum monthly
 wage of $210 (pula 500) was required to provide food, clothing, and transport for
 a family of five. The minimum wage generally varies by industry, but in most cases,
 workers must supplement it with a second job or subsistence farming. Most families
 have more than one wage earner. An average salary for a better paid worker would
 be between $400 and $700.
 The minimum wage is legislated by the Government and is enforced and observed
 in urban areas for citizens of Botswana. Adherence is more sketchy in the pastoral
 sector, especially where housing and food arepart of the employer-employee agree-
 ment. Citizens of neighboring states, notably Zimbabwe, are frequently employed in
 the domestic service sector, where many work for low wages and in substandard liv-
 ing conditions. Such illegal migrants would be subject to arbitrary deportation if
 they attempted to take their cases to the police, making them particularly vulner-
 able to exploitation.
 The law mandates a maximum 48-hour workweek with provisions for overtime
 pay (time and a half) for more than 48 hours. Most major employers use the stand-
 ard workweek, but some smaller firms do not pay overtime, and action is seldom
 taken against them.
 The Government establishes basic health and safety standards to which most in-
 dustries adhere, although compliance by construction firms is sometimes lax. Never-
 theless, industrial accident rates are not high on the whole. Though the Government
 employs a corps of safety and health inspectors, enforcement of safety standards,
 a shared responsibility of the Ministries of Labor, Mines, and Health is hampered
 by inadequate staffing. Workers who complain about hazardous conditions are le-
 gally protected from dismissal, but enforcement of this protection has been uneven.
