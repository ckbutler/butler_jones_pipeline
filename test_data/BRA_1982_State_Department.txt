 BRAZIL
 A gradual process of political liberalization begun in the
 mid-1970's has substantially moderated the authoritarian
 military-based regime established following the 1964 coup.
 .Brazil has a functioning congress and a constitutionally
 independent judiciary, but the focus of political power
 remains the presidency, which is strongly supported by the
 military and which has been held by retired officers since
 1964. The post-1964 regime originally based its legitimacy
 on an appeal to national security and economic development,
 and the Government's professed goal is to return to a
 representative democracy in a manner consistent with these
 fundamental objectives. The Government has relinquished most
 of its extraordinary instruments of political control. A
 general amnesty decreed i-n 1979 resulted in release of
 political prisoners and return to political life of many
 exiles and others formerly deprived of their political
 rights.
 .This political 'opening' is taking place in an atmosphere of
 vigoroua debate., and the.right to criticize government
 policies is freely exercised. Nationwide elections for
 congressional, gubermatorial, and state and local offices
 took place as scheduled on November 15. Opposition parties
 won gubernatorial races and legislative majorities in ten
 states as well a majority in the lower house of the federal
 congress. The election results will determine the make-up of
 the electoral college that will choose the next president in
 1985.
 The integrity of the person is generally respected in Brazil,
 and such exceptions as do occur are localized aberrations
 that do not reflect official policies. Constitutionally
 guaranteed civil and political rights, including freedom of
 speech, press, religion, and assembly are respected in
 practice, with a few, fairly well-defined qualifications.
 Apart from.the successful completion of the national
 elections, .there have-been few significant changes during
 tle past year in the state .ofhuman rights. The long-term
 improvement in human rights protection and observance began
 with.,political, legal, and institutional changes during the
 late 1970's; 1982,-has witnessed the continued consolidation
 of the earlier .changes and the practical exercise of these
 rights. within the expanded amplitude for political activities.
 1. -Respect for the Integrity of the Person, .Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 .In.1982 there were no reported incidents of killing for
 :political reasons attributed to federal or state government
 authorities, political parties, or other organized political
 -entities. During the election campaign there were reports of
 at least one-death (at a clash during a political rally at a
 remote town in the State of Para) and a few attempted
 assassinations of candidates. The indications are that these
 incidents were the result of local animosities and personal
 feuds rather than a pattern of organized or planned political
 violence. There is no evidence that the Government or the
 leadership of the opposition political parties have
 participated in or condoned such actions.
 
 
 422
 b. Disappearance
 Abduction, disappearance, and secret and clandestine
 detention for political reasons were not reported in 1982.
 In common crimes, charges of clandestine detention have
 occasionally been levelled against police authorities by
 organizations such as the National Bar Association, the
 Catholic Church, as well as individual families. In some
 cases where the officials responsible for clandestine
 detentions were identified, they have been brought to trial
 and some have been convicted, while others have been
 acquitted for lack of evidence.
 A Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) report of August
 1982 states that many past cases of disappearance remain
 unresolved. It also states that there is evidence of peasant
 farmers disappearing in the northern regions in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the penal code. The National Bar
 Association and church authorities allege that torture has
 been committed by local police in cases of arrest for common
 crime. There is no particular pattern in these reported
 cases, which appear to be localized aberrations rather than a
 reflection of official policy. In 1982 in Nova Iguacu (in
 the State of Rio de Janeiro), a local police officer was
 sentenced to 23 years in prison for participation in the
 torture and murder of a suspected drug trafficker. The only
 such accusation against federal authorities during 1982 took
 place when church authorities claimed squatters in the State
 of Para were tortured to obtain evidence against two French
 priests charged with violating the National Security Law.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Despite o~ficial policy against such treatment, excessive
 police violence used while apprehending suspects is sometimes
 reported in the press. Press accounts also on occasion
 allege non-official participation by local police officials
 in so-called 'death squad* killings (whose victims apparently
 are petty criminals or involved in drug traffic) in the
 impoverished suburbs of Rio de Janeiro, despite efforts to
 stop such practices.
 Detention facilities are overcrowded, and the level of prison
 health care, diet, and sanitation is low. Officials contend
 that the country lacks the resources to upgrade detention
 facilities. As an expression of his concern over conditions
 in the Ilha Grande prison, Cardinal Dom Eugenio Sales refused
 to offer Christmas mass there in 1981, citing what he called
 the refusal of government authorities to rectify
 reprehensible prison conditions and their failure to treat
 prisoners in a civilized fashion. Subsequently he announced
 the resumption of his prison pastoral activities after
 concluding that conditions had improved. Although there are
 no legal distinctions based on race, sex, or religion,
 different treatment is rendered to prisoners based on social
 class. For instance, while undergoing trial, detainees with
 a university degree are held in special facilities not open
 to other prisoners.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus is constitutionally guaranteed and respected in
 
 
 423
 practice.  Courts are required to rule immediately on habeas
 corpus petitions. In the event of arrest, the law provides
 for the immediate notification of a judicial authority who
 must then determine the legality of the arrest and set bail
 if the offense permits it. Brazilian courts have ruled that
 the immediate notification period may extend up to 24 hours
 for investigative purposes. If this procedure is not
 followed, an attorney may file a habeas corpus request on
 behalf of the prisoner and request the punishment of the
 police authority who detained the prisoner illegally. When a
 judicial authority is notified about the arrest, the prisoner
 must receive from the police a notification informing him
 about the charges against him. The press has reported a few
 isolated deviations from such practice, which apparently were
 subsequently rectified.
 Brazilian law permits persons arrested to be held without
 bail in certain cases. The detention may be administrative
 (as in cases of extradition or embezzlement) or judicial (as
 when a judge believes that the defendant would not appear for
 trial or that his release would constitute a threat to
 society or to the legal process). Detention without bail
 must be ordered by an administrative authority (such as a
 minister of state) or a judge; it cannot be ordered by police
 authorities. Such detention may be extended until trial
 takes place or until the authority or judge finds that the
 basis for the detention no longer exists.
 In cases arising from offenses against the National Security
 Law, arresting authorities--police or military--may order
 detention without bail for a maximum of 60 days. A judge
 must approve such detentions beyond 30 days. National
 security cases are subject to habeas corpus and immediate
 notification.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 By law and in practice Brazil guarantees the right to a fair
 public trial. Normally cases are tried before a single
 judge, but jury trials are required in cases of willful
 crimes against life. Defendants are entitled to counsel,
 which the Government provides free of charge if they cannot
 pay. Brazilian law requires that defendants be made fully
 aware of the charges against them, and defendants and their
 lawyers are legally entitled to be informed of the evidence
 on which the charges are based.
 The Brazilian judicial system is an independent branch of the
 Government. The system provides for a range of courts to
 deal with specific types of activity -- i.e. criminal, civil,
 electoral, family, and labor. The Government is now
 proposing to establish a system of small claims courts to
 provide access to legal process by those who cannot afford to
 pay for court and counsel costs. The proposed new system
 will adopt the summary process of law, and petitioners will
 not require an attorney to present their case.
 The military court system, which is part of the judicial
 rather than the executive branch, hears cases involving
 members of the military and civilians charged with offenses
 against the National Security Law or military institutions.
 Judgments by military courts can be appealed to the civilian
 Supreme Federal Tribunal.
 
 
 424
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Judicial warrants are required for police authorities to
 enter a home, except in cases of accidents or when a crime is
 in the process of being committed. Notwithstanding these
 provisions, the Brazilian press has carried reports of
 illegal entry into homes by police officials.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and a free press is guaranteed in
 the Brazilian Constitution (with certain qualifications based
 on national security) and these liberties are vigorously
 exercised. Members of the political opposition are free to
 criticize the Government and exercise this right in speeches,
 interviews with electronic and print media, and in writing.
 There is no government censorship of the print media,
 although they are legally accountable for what they publish.
 Discussion of public issues and criticism of official
 policies and the performance of government officials is
 freewheeling, and in some publications criticism is often
 scathing and highly personal. Radio and television are
 somewhat more cautious and exercise some internal controls
 over programming to avoid potential conflicts with the
 Government over content, especially in matters of national
 security   Frequently, however, they broadcast varying
 viewpoints on controversial social and political topics.
 There have been .no reports of government censorship or
 closing of communications media. Similarly, books are not
 censored, and foreign publications are widely distributed in
 translation as well as in the original language. Films, both
 domestic and foreign, are subject to censorship for political
 .content as well as for sex and violence. Such censorship is
 sparing, mostly in the form of a rating system analogous to
 that used in the US.
 There has. been no reported-interference with academic inquiry
 in the natural or social sciences or persecution of
 professional groups.
 The principal qualification to these freedoms is a provision
 of the National Security Law which makes it a criminal
 offense to divulge *false or tendentious statements, or true,
 partial, or distorted facts in a manner to turn or attempt to
 turn the people against constitutional authorities.' One
 federal deputy was convicted under this law for alleging that
 three army generals were involved in terrorist acts that took
 place in 1980. There are similar cases pending against two
 other deputies, and in the past the law has been applied on
 occasion against journalists. In September 1982 a leading
 newspaper publisher was charged under this law for an
 editorial which allegedly offended the honor of a major
 government official. The case was later dismissed by the
 court on the grounds that it did not affect national security.
 There were instances of harassment of the "dirty tricks'
 variety against opposition political figures during 1982
 (e.g. spurious classified advertisements, distribution of
 scurrilous pamphlets, alleging sexual or other
 improprieties). Perhaps the most serious was the publication
 and distribution of false editions of the newspaper of the
 Archdiocese of Sao Paulo designed, to discredit the church.
 There are indications that right-wing elements of government
 
 
 425
 security forces were involved. The incidents, which are
 still under investigation, have not prevented the objects of
 such harassment from disseminating their views to the public.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal limitations on assembly except when the
 public order is threatened. Illegal organizations such as
 the National Students Union have in fact been allowed to
 assemble and organize, but participants in a December 1982
 congress of the Brazilian Communist Party were arrested under
 the National Security Law on grounds that they were
 attempting to reorganize a clandestine, proscribed political
 party. All were released within a few days pending trial.
 There have been infrequent instances of official suppression
 of political demonstrations, marches, or rallies, usually
 arising when organizing entities have persisted in carrying
 through on their plans after permits were denied them by
 Brazilian authorities. These episodes have not resulted in
 violence, however, and permission for peaceful political
 rallies and demonstrations is usually granted, though
 normally the locations and times for such activity are
 specified and must be adhered to.
 Labor unions have the effective right to organize, negotiate,
 and strike. However, strikes in essential industries (which
 have been broadly defined) or that threaten public order are
 illegal, and unions are prohibited from engaging in partisan
 political activity. Unions nevertheless openly engage in
 direct lobbying efforts to influence legislation affecting
 labor in the National Congress despite this ban. Union
 leaders are under no such restrictions, however, and many
 union officials ran for political office in the November
 elections, while others openly supported and campaigned for
 political candidates. Although labor unions are beginning to
 play a growing, if still limited, political role, their
 primary concerns are still with bread-and-butter issues. The
 Government has taken a tolerant attitude toward strike
 activity -- even some illegal strikes -- but the frequency of
 strikes remained low in 1982 principally because of the
 depressed economy. A single, unified labor central is not
 permitted by current labor legislation. Nevertheless, a
 conference of labor leaders took place for the purpose of
 forming such an organization in August 1981 without
 government interference, and a committee set up then has
 continued to work toward this goal.
 Brazilian labor syndicates were created by the central
 Government in the 1930's. While the Government continues to
 exercise influence over organized labor, the degree of
 influence varies greatly from one union to another and also
 by locality. The level of unionization averages around 20
 percent among metal, chemical and mine workers, retail
 workers, and in transportation, communications, banking, and
 the teaching profession, and runs slightly lower--about 15
 percent--among agricultural workers. The metal workers of
 the Sao Paulo area are the most highly organized sector, with
 a membership of around 40 percent.
 There was little evidence of harassment of labor unions
 during 1982, nor of interference with scientific bodies or
 professional organizations. Both unions and professional
 organizations maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies in their fields. In April former
 
 
 426
 metalworkers union leader Luis Inacio (Lula) da Silva and ten
 other labor leaders convicted under the National Security Law
 for conducting an illegal 1980 strike were effectively
 exonerated when the Supreme Military Tribunal declared itself
 incompetent to rule on the case.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is fully respected. There is no state
 religion. Minority religions are not persecuted or
 harassed. Adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 advantage or disadvantage in secular areas. Although the
 overwhelming majority of Brazilians belong at least nominally
 to the Roman Catholic Church, there are no legal or. actual
 restrictions on the religious activities of other
 denominations or faiths, and they are free to proselytize.
 Conflicts have arisen between state and church authorities
 over activities of priests and missionaries involved in
 'certain political and social action programs which the
 Government views as subversive or disruptive of governmental
 authority or social order. Two French priests were convicted
 in June under the National Security Law for inciting land
 invasions by peasants in a remote area of the State of Para
 that led to violent confrontations with local police.. In
 general, however, the church is able to carry out social
 action programs, including political 'education," without
 overt government interference, although isolated instances of
 harassment have occurred.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country or
 on emigration or repatriation, nor are women or other groups
 subject to separate provisions in these areas. Brazil
 applies a selective refugee policy, based essentially on
 geographical proximity, cultural affinity, and the nation's
 ability to absorb newcomers. Hence Brazil accepts refugees
 primarily from southern cone countries -- Argentina, Chile,
 and Uruguay. A limited number of Indo-Chinese refugees
 rescued at sea by Brazilian flag vessels have also been
 accepted. After years of a much more liberal policy, Brazil
 has now slowed overall immigration to a trickle. Brazilian
 law provides for political asylum but is not precise on
 criteria.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political liberalization process begun in the mid-1970's
 has greatly moderated the authoritarian regime established in
 1964. Political power, however, remains highly centralized
 atid concentrated in the office of the President, who is
 elected indirectly by an electoral college. Like all
 presidents since 1964, the incumbent is a retired general who
 governs with the strong support of the military as well as
 the pro-government civilian political party. There is a
 functioning congress but its influence in major national
 decisions has been limited. Despite their minority position,
 however, the opposition parties in past congresses have
 sometimes managed -- with help from dissident government
 party members -- to defeat government-sponsored proposals.
 Particularly below the presidential level, there is genuine
 freedom to participate in the political process. National
 
 
 427
 elections for municipal, state, and congressional offices
 were held on November 15. State governors were directly
 elected for the first time since 1962. Five parties -- one
 government party and four opposition parties -- competed for
 these offices. The opposition parties won ten of twenty-two
 gubernational and legislative races--including the important
 states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro--and, as a group, will
 have a majority in the lower house of the federal congress
 when it convenes in march 1983. The Government party will
 retain control of the federal senate and will have a
 plurality in the lower house. In all, some 44,000 offices
 were filled by an electorate of approximately 55 million.
 The election results also determine the make-up of the
 electoral college that will elect the next president in
 1985. Under current legislation, the electoral college will
 consist of the full federal congress plus six representatives
 from each state chosen by the majority party in each state
 legislature. The elections were therefore a major step in
 the political liberalization process.
 Citizens are free to participate in government through such
 avenues as suffrage, political party affiliation, membership
 In interest groups, and direct approach to office holders.
 All of these means are openly availablef use of them varies
 with educational level, interest, physical proximity, and
 other factors. Opposition parties and groups -- except for
 the Communist Party, which remains illegal -- operate freely
 and'participate vigorously in the political process.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for adult literates;
 illiterates may not vote. The 1982 elections, as well as
 previous ones in 1978, 1976, and 1974, were generally
 acknowledged as being free of significant fraud. Prior to
 the November elections, members of the opposition charged
 that some Government changes in the election rules were
 designed to increase the vote for the Government party, but
 it is not clear that the rule changes had that effect.
 Access to radio and television for campaign purposes is
 strictly controlled, with all parties given equal access, but
 other types of campaign propaganda (billboard, printed
 advertisements, leaflets, and posters) are liberally used.
 The election campaign was generally free of violence,
 although there were isolated instances of attacks against
 candidates, mostly in northeastern states. These acts appear
 to have arisen from local animosities, and there is no
 indication that federal or state authorities fostered or
 condoned such acts.
 Discrimination on the basis of sex and race is illegal.
 Nevertheless, women and members of minority groups find
 places in the governing structure in much smaller numbers
 than their proportional share of the population. Their
 relative underrepresentation may be due more to prevailing
 cultural attitudes and economic realities rather than to
 outright discrimination. Problems of nationality and
 statelessness are not significant factors.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the Brazilian Government considers international and
 third country investigation into alleged human rights
 
 
 428
 violations as unwarranted interference in Brazil's internal
 affairs, the federal Government has not impeded visits by
 representatives of such organizations in recent years. No
 visits to investigate possible violations in Brazil are known
 to have taken place in 1982.
 Non-governmental Brazilian organizations such as the National
 Conference of Brazilian (Catholic) Bishops, the National Bar
 Association and its local chapters, the Brazilian Press
 Association, and local lay and church-sponsored "justice and
 peace" groups are able to investigate and publicize alleged
 human rights violations or institute legal proceedings to
 redress them.
 Brazil is a party to a number of United Nations Human Rights
 conventions including the conventions on genocide, racial
 discrimination, refugees, and the political rights of married
 women. Brazil has not signed the Inter-American Convention
 on Human Rights.
 Among non-governmental human rights organizations, Amnesty
 International, in its 1982 report, expressed its concern
 about 'the growing number of prosecutions of civilians by
 military courts on charges related" to the National Security
 Law. Other observers disagree on this alleged trend.
 Freedom House's 1982 report classified Brazil as "partly
 free."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 After a decade of impressively high growth rates, the
 Brazilian economy is in a period of adjustment. From an
 average annual growth rate of 11.5 percent in the years
 before the OPEC oil crisis, growth dropped to an average 6.6
 percent in the subsequent period (1975-1980). Compared to
 1980's eight percent real growth, GDP growth in 1981 was
 minus 1.9 percent, and economic activity appears to have been
 flat in 1982. ' The economy continues to face difficulty,
 especially in regard to inflation and the balance of
 payments. Stable oil prices have helped while the
 strengthening of the dollar and high international interest
 rates in combination with lower world growth have had a
 negative impact. Planned Government austerity measures will
 likely keep growth low in 1983. Brazil converted a 1980
 trade deficit of $2.8 billion into a surplus of $1.2 billion
 in 1981. The 1982 trade surplus was expected to be smaller
 than 1981's. Brazil's foreign debt exceeded $72 billion in
 1982. Inflation climbed from 77 percent in 1979 to 110
 percent in 1980, declining slightly to 95 percent in 1981.
 Despite lower growth and government efforts, the 1982 annual
 rate was again close to 100 percent.
 Seventy percent of Brazil's population of approximately 124
 million lives within 100 kilometers of the coast.
 Rural-to-urban migration is concentrating population
 increases in cities, where basic economic needs are more
 adequately met. Preliminary 1980 census data indicate that
 the annual population growth rate for the past decade has
 been 2.5 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for the 1960-70
 decade. Population growth and migration have complicated the
 Government's ability to keep up with the expanded need for
 public health and social services.
 Income distribution is a serious domestic social problem,
 even though evidence suggests that nearly all social strata
 
 
 429
 have benefitted from the country's economic growth. In 1980
 GNP per capita was slightly above $2,000. According to
 government statistics, between 1960 and 1976 the
 concentration of income in the richest 10 percent of the
 population increased from 29.6 to 59.4 percent, while the
 share received by the poorest 50 percent fell from 17.4 to
 13.5 percent. Regional income differences are marked, with
 the south-southeast -- containing slightly more than 50
 percent of the population -- earning 82 percent of the
 income. The present national salary law provides that
 workers earning from one to three times the statutory minimum
 wage (equivalent to approximately $100 per month in the major
 states) receive semi-annual.wage adjustments of 110 percent
 of the calculated rate of inflation.
 It is difficult to generalize nationally about an absolute
 poverty level because of marked regional differences in
 income and living standards. The Brazilian Government
 divides the country into five regions each having a different
 minimum wage (which constitutes one view of poverty level)
 varying from approximately $60-100 per month. In the major
 population renters, it is likely that such an income would
 fall within the definition of poverty, whereas in some more
 remote areas, where inhabitants are less integrated into the
 economy, a readysource of food such as fish and some
 subsistence farming may provide minimum nutrition to a family
 with a negligible cash income. Life expectancy is officially
 estimated at 62.8 years. Nationally, infant mortality is 92
 per 1,000 live births, but again there are widespread
 regional differences.
 Health personnel and health facilities are concentrated in
 urban areas and the industrial southeast, which accounts for
 80 percent of the physicians, 73 percent of the nursing
 personnel, and 79 percent of the hospital beds. The
 Government is attempting to improve safety and health
 conditions in the work place.
 Significant portions of the society lack some vital needs --
 nutrition, potable water, basic education, and medical care.
 Illustrative of this are the findings of a 1980 Brazilian
 congressional inquiry which found that Brazil has two million
 abandoned children and eighteen to twenty-five million
 children without the basic necessities of life. Adult
 literacy was officially estimated in 1979 at 75.7 percent
 (although some Brazilian educators believe this figure to be
 high). The primary school enrollment ratio in 1977 was 89
 percent, but the Ministry of Education estimates that some
 seven million school-age children are not being reached by
 the educationalsystem.
 In the course of Brazil's rapid though uneven economic
 development, women have made some strides in attaining equal
 status. Basic legal rights are guaranteed without regard to
 sex. In Brazil's relatively affluent, economically and
 politically dynamic urban areas, women are becoming
 increasingly active in the professions, industry, education,
 the arts, and media as well as political life, including a
 small representation in the national congress. This level
 and this range of activities are much less in evidence in the
 rural, economically underdeveloped sectors of the country,
 and especially in the northeast, where poverty and
 traditional attitudes constitute obstacles. Although a legal
 requirement, equal pay for equal work is not widely practiced.
 
 
 430
 Upon taking office in 1979 the Figueiredo administration
 announced it sought to improve living standards (in the form
 of better health care, housing, education, and social
 services), reduce income disparities among individuals, and
 improve the lot of disadvantaged regions. At the same time
 the Government made clear that its immediate priorities were
 to raise agricultural production and reduce inflation. It
 also indicated that the fulfillment of its social and
 economic objectives would depend, over the medium run, on
 resolving the balance of payments and energy problems. Faced
 with these economic restraints, the Government is finding it
 more difficult than in previous years to make progress in the
 fulfillment of vital needs. The social welfare system is a
 very visible and controversial example of the conflict in
 priorities. Severe financial difficulties, which led to
 increases in the contribution rates in 1981, continue to
 plague the system, leaving the Government to face the choice
 of increasing public expenditure, increasing the rate of
 contributions, or reducing services. Similiar financial
 constraints confront other social services. Over the next
 few years, it is likely the Government will have all it can
 do just to keep vital services from deteriorating, much less
 find the resources necessary to improve or expand them.
 The country's estimated 200,000 Indians have suffered in
 recent decades from the gradual encroachment of Brazil's
 coastal-based population and from the Government's efforts to
 promote economic development in the Amazon region and
 frontier areas where most Indians live. The increasing
 contact between Indians and newcomers has bred occasional
 conflict. The Figueiredo administration has renewed the
 government's commitment under the 1973 Indian Statute to
 protect the Indian population, and the federal Indian Affairs
 Agency has been charged under the law with the task of
 demarcating tribal lands, which would provide a greater
 measure of security for the Indians. The process of
 demarcation of tribal lands is continuing but, partly because
 of numerous disputes that have arisen, is expected to take
 several years to complete.
