 IRELAND
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of orderly transfer of
 power. The Government is headed by a President and a Prime Minister, and there
 is a bicameral Parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 The national plice are under the effective civilian control of the Minister of Jus-
 tice and have soe responsibility for internal security. Ireland's principal internal se-
 curity concern has been to prevent the spillover of terrorist violence from Northern
 Ireland. The Irish Republican Army's (IRA) declaration of a cease-lire on July 19
 led to the start of substantive political negotiations between key parties to the con-
 flict.
 Ireland has an open, market-based economy that is highly dependent on inter-
 national trade. It is a large net recipient of funds from the European Union (EU)
 designed to raise per capita gross national product to the EU average. Despite
 strong economic growth over the past few years, unemployment remains 10.8 per-
 cent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Human
 rights problems arise primarily from: prison overcrowding and substandard facili-
 ties; instances of abuse by police and prison officials; the continuation of special ar-
 rest and detention authority and the nonjury court; discrimination and violence
 against women; abuse of children; the occasional censorship of films, books, and
 periodicals; discrimination against refugees; and a lack of explicit antidiscrimination
 legislation, especially in relation to persons with disabilities and "travelers" (an itin-
 erant ethnic community).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 1125
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and security personnel generally did not employ
 them.
 While mistreatment of persons in police custody is not widespread, an unspecified
 number of cases have been filed by detainees claiming damages for injuries sus-
 tained while in police custody. No official public action has yet been taken in the
 case of two persons accused of murdering a police officer in 1996, who alleged that
 they had been severely beaten while in police custody and who appeared in court
 with physical injuries consistent with their allegations.
 Ireand has a low incarceration rate (76 inmates per 100,000 population), and the
 prison regime is generally liberal. However, the physical infrastructure of many
 prisons is barely adequate: facilities are plagued by chronic overcrowding, requiring
 doubling-up in many single-person cells. Although 2 new prisons have been built,
 most of the country's 14 prisons are very old buildings that were originally intended
 for other uses; as a result, many cells do not have toilets and running water. The
 Government is in the process of u p grading prison facilities to improve sanitary con-
 ditions and to meet statutory health and safety standards.
 According to the Justice Department, no cases had been filed against the State
 for alleged mistreatment of prisoners as of October, although an unspecified number
 of complaints were being processed by individual prison governors.
 The Government continued to arrest and incarcerate at Portlaoise prison persons
 involved in paramilitary activity. Conditions for these inmates are the same, if not
 better, than those for the general prison population.
 The Government began a 3-year prison construction plan to build 800 new cells
 and a new women's prison annex at Mountjoy prison.
 International human rights monitors are permitted to visit prisons without res-
 ervation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that no per-
 son shall be deprived of personal liberty without due process under the law. A de-
 tainee has the right to petition the High Court, which is required to order release
 unless it can be shown that the person is being detained in accordance with the law.
 Under the 1984 Criminal Justice Act, the maximum period of detention for ques-
 tioning in most cases is 12 hours, plus a possible extension of 8 hours overnight to
 allow a detainee to sleep.
 Detention without charge is permitted for up to 48 hours, however, in cases cov-
 ered by the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act. This act allows police to arrest
 and detain for questioning anyone suspected of committing a "scheduled offense,"
 i e one involving firearms, explosives, or membership in an unlawful organization.
 Although the stated purpose of the act is to "prevent actions and conduct calculated
 to undermine public order and the authority of the state," it is not restricted to sub-
 versive offenses. Therefore, the police have broad arrest and detention powers in
 any case involving firearms. However, under the terms of the decommissioning law
 enacted in February in support of the Northern Ireland peace process, proceedings
 may not be instituted aganst persons in relation to any offense that may be com-
 mitted in the course of decommissioning illegally held arms in accordance with an
 approved arms decommissioning scheme.
 The act also provides for the indefinite detention, or internment, without trial of
 any person who is engaged in activities that are "prejudicial to the preservation of
 public peace and order or to the security of the state." While this power has not
 been invoked since the late 1950's, the Government could do so by simply issuing
 a proclamation. There are no provisions for the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act
 to be renewed; it continues indefinitely.
 The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act of 1996 permits detention without
 charge for up to 7 days in cases involving drug trafficking. To hold a suspected drug
 trafficker for more than 48 hours, however, the police must seek a judge s approval.
 Following approval in 1996 of a referendum calling for stricter bal laws, legisla-
 tion was enacted in May that is designed to allow a court to refuse bail to a person
 charged with a serious offense where it is reasonably considered necessary to pre-
 vent the commission of a serious offense by that person. A serious offense is defined
 by reference to a schedule of offenses contained in the bill and must be one that
 carries a penalty of 5 years' imprisonment or more. However, by year's end the Jus-
 tice Minister had not signed a statutory order which would allow the courts to im-
 plement the law's provisions. The lack of accommodations for prisoners was cited
 as the reason for the delay.
 The authorities do not impose exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 
 
 1126
 The judicial system includes 23 district courts, 8 circuit courts, the High Court,
 the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Supreme Court. Judges are appointed by the
 President on the advice of the Government.
 Most criminal cases are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, a state
 official with semiautonomous status. Jury trial is the norm. The accused generally
 may choose his or her attorney. For indigent defendants, the state assumes the cost
 of counsel.
 However, the Constitution explicitly allows "special courts" to be created when
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and
 the preservation of public peace and order." In 1972, under the 1939 Offenses
 Against the State Act, the Government set up a nonjury "Special Criminal Court"
 (SCC) to try "scheduled offenses" (see Section 1.d.). Largely a reaction to the spill-
 over of paramilitary violence from Northern Ireland, the SCC has been justified over
 the years as addressing the problem of jury intimidation in cases involving defend-
 ants with suspected paramilitary links.
 Three cases were completed in the Special Criminal Court between January and
 June, and 13 cases were pending as of October. In addition to "scheduled offenses,"
 the Director of Public Prosecutions can have any nonscheduled offense tried by the
 SCC where he is of the opinion that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure
 the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order
 in relation to a trial of a person on such charges and so certifies in writing.
 In lieu of a jury, the Special Criminal Court always sits as a three-judge panel.
 Its verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence are essentially the same as in
 regular courts, except that the sworn statement of a police chief superintendent
 identifying the accused as a member of an illegal organization is accepted as prima
 facie evidence. Sessions of the SCC are usually public, but the judge may exclude
 certain persons other than journalists. Appeals of SCC decisions are allowed in cer-
 tain circumstances.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Su-
 preme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in the Con-
 stitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected
 in law and practice. This ruling is fully honored by the Government.
 In 1996 the High Court upheld a referendum that removed the ban on divorce.
 The Government enacted implementing legislation allowing courts to grant divorces
 under certain circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides individuals with the
 right to "express free ly their onvictions and opinions.' Freedom of the press, how-
 ever, is subject to the qualification that it not "undermine public order or morality
 or the authority of the state." Publication or utterance of "blasphemous, seditious,
 or indecent matter" is prohibited. While the press, in practice, operates freely, the
 1961 Defamation Act (which puts the onus on newspapers and periodicals accused
 of libel toprve defamatory words are true) and the 1963 Official Secrets Act (which
 gives the State wide scope to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of sensitive govern-
 ment information) are believed to result in some self-censorship.
 Broadcasting remains mostly state controlled, but under the 1988 Radio and Tele-
 vision Act, private sector broadcasting is growing. There are 21 independent radio
 stations, and negotiations are proceeding or an independent television station. The
 Broadcasting Complaints Commission oversees standards and investigates com-
 plaints about programming. The 1960 Broadcasting Act empowers the Government
 to prohibit the state-owned radio and television network from broadcasting any mat-
 ter that is "likely to promote or incite to crime or which would tend to undermine
 the authority of the state." It was on this basis that the Government banned Sinn
 Fein (the legal pelitical front of the IRA) from the airwaves from 1971 to 1994.
 Films andvideos must be screened and classified by the Office of the Film Censor
 before they can be shown or sold. Distributors must pay a fee of about 11 cents (7
 Irish pence) per foot of film, which is used to finance the censor's office. Under the
 1923 Censorship of Films Act, the censor has the authority to cut or ban any film
 that is "indecent, obscene or blasphemous" or which tends to "inculcate principles
 contrary to public morality or subversive of public morality." No films were banned
 in 1997. Decisions of the censor can be appealed to a nine-member appeal board,
 but neither the censor nor the appeal board is required to hear arguments or evi-
 dence in public or to state the reasons for its decisions.
 Books and periodicals are also subject to censorship. The 1946 Censorship of Pub-
 lications Act calls for a five-member board to examine publications referred to it by
 the customs service or a member of the general public. It can also examine books
 
 
 1127
 or periodicals on its own initiative. The board can prohibit the sale of any publica-
 tion that it judges to be indecent or obscene. In 1997 the board banned at least 24
 books and 90 periodicals, compared with 46 books and 43 periodicals in 1996.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the right to 'assemble peaceably and without arms" and to form associa-
 tions and unions. However, it also allows the State to "prevent or control meetings"
 that are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance
 to the general public. Under the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, it is unlawful
 to hold any public meeting on behalf of, or in support of, an illegal organization.
 Although the Government prosecutes and incarcerates persons for mere membership
 in a terrorist organization, it allows meetings and assemblies by some groups that
 are associated with illegal terrorist organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. Even though Ire-
 land is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, there is no state religion. However, almost
 all primary and secondary schools are denominational, managed and controlled by
 the Catholic Church. Religious instruction is an integral part of the curriculum, but
 there are provisions for parents to exempt their children from such instruction.
 There is no widespread discrimination against nontraditional religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as well as
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation.
 The Government approved a new refugee law in 1996 but, except for provisions
 relating to the Dublin Convention of 1990, which harmonizes European Union (EU)
 asylum procedures, it has not been implemented. Under provisions of the Conven-
 tion, persons who arrive in Ireland from another EU state and claim asylum are
 to be returned to the EU state from which they arrived to make their claim. Ireland
 implements its obligations under the 1951 United Nations (U.N.) Convention Relat-
 ing to the Status of Refugees on an administrative basis. Specific administrative
 procedures for the determination of refugee status were drawn up in consultation
 with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees; in 1992 the Supreme'Court ruled
 that these procedures were binding on the Minister of Justice. However, as the
 number of asylum seekers has increased (from only 31 in 1990 to nearly 3,000 in
 the first 9 months of 1997), these administrative procedures have proved inad-
 equate. In particular there have been complaints of long delays and a lack of trans-
 parency in decisions concerning refugee status. There is an estimated backlog of
 4,000 asylum cases. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1997;
 nor were there reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution. Allegations of racism in dealing with asylum seekers sparked a public
 debate on immigration (see Section 5).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitutional requirement that parliamentary elections be held at least
 every 7 years has always been met. Suffrage is universal for citizens over the age
 of 18, and baloting is secret. Several political parties have seats in the bicameral
 Parliament. Members of the Dai (House of Representatives)--the chamber that car-
 rie out the main legislative functions--are popularly eleted; in the Seanad (Sen-
 ate), some members are elected and some are appointed by various bodies. The
 President is popularly elected for a 7-year term and is limited to 2 terms. An ap-
 pointed Council of State serves as an advisory body to the President.
 Women are underreprsented in government and politics. Although a woman is
 president, only 20 of the 166 deputies in the Dail and 8 of the 60 senators are
 women. Three of the 15 government ministers are women, as are 2 of the 17 junior
 ministers. There are 3 women on the 20-member High Court; only 1 of the 8 Su-
 preme Court judges is a woman. While women participate in all departments of
 Government, they are underrepresented at senior levels.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal independent organization monitoring domestic human rights prob-
 lems, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), operates generally without hin-
 drance from the Government. However, with regard to allegations of mistreatment
 of two suspects held in connection with the murder of a police officer in 1996, the
 ICCL indicated in a report issued jointly with British Irish Rights Watch in July
 that its efforts to investigate these allegations did not receive the cooperation of the
 police authorities. The ICCL report said that "this incident raises serious questions
 
 
 1128
 
 about the attitude of the Garda (police) authorities toward bona fide human rights
 organizations investigating allegations of human rights abuses in the Republic of
 Ireland." The ICCL report requested the Irish Government to set up a "fully inde-
 pendent inquiry, headed by a judge and with high court powers to summon and
 question witnesses, to investigate the treatment of persons arrested in Limerick fol-
 lowing Garda Mccabe's murder." The Minister of Justice told the Dail in December
 that, while he would not be prepared to tolerate any abuse of persons in custody,
 it would not be appropriate to take any action on the allegations pending completion
 of the murder trials.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution, as amended, forbids state promotion of one religion over an-
 other and discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief, or status. Ex-
 cept as regards employment, however, neither the Constitution nor the law prohibits
 discrimination on the basis of disability, race, sex, language, or social status.
 To address these and other shortcomings in civil law, the Government in 1993 cre-
 ated the Department of Equality and Law Reform, whose responsibilities were fold-
 ed into the Department of Justice in 1997. An equal status law and an employment
 equality law drafted by the Department were passed by the Dail in 1997 but were
 ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
 Women.-A government task force on violence against women issued its report in
 April. The task force concluded that the problem, in particular domestic violence,
 is widespread and that many women believe that existing services are incapable of
 responding to their needs in trying to deal with violence in relationships. The task
 force found that many women believe that the legal and court systems minimize the
 seriousness of crimes committed against women, fail to dispense justice, and make
 women feel at fault for what happened. The task force cited a need to compile more
 accurate and comprehensive statistics on the nature and extent of the problem, and
 issued a series of recommendations that are under government review.
 The task force found that only a small number of rape cases are ever reported
 to the police and that an even smaller number lead to criminal proceedings. Accord-
 ing to the Dublin Rape Crisis Center, while crime generally fell over the 18 months
 to Juhe, the level of reported rapes continued to rise. The Center received 6,270
 calls between June 1996 and May 1997 and concluded that there was disquieting
 evidence that rape and sexual assaults-by their very number and frequency-were
 dulling the response of the public at large. The Center estimated that only 28 per-
 cent of rape victims report the crime to police and that only 2 percent of these cases
 resulted in convictions in 1996. A 1990 act criminalized rape within marriage and
 provided for free legal advice to the victim. There are 12 women's refuges in the
 country, funded in part by the Government, with accommodation for about 50 fami-
 lies.
 Discrimination against women in the workplace is unlawful, but inequalities per-
 sist regarding pay and promotions in both the public and the private sectors.
 Women hold about 37 percent of public-sector jobs. Working women are also ham-
 pered by the lack of adequate child care facilities. The Maternity Protection Act was
 passed in 1994, providing a woman 14 weeks of maternity leave and the right to
 return to her job. The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment
 Equality Act of 1977 provide for protection and redress against discrimination based
 on gender and marital status. The Employment Equality Agency monitors their im-
 plementation. The number of cases brought to the agency has fallen in recent years,
 but progrss in eliminating the differential in earnings has been modest. In 1997
 the hourly industrial wage for women was abut 70 percent of that received by men,
 and weekly earnings of women averaged 69 percent of the weekly pay of men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare and rights of children,
 as demonstrated by its ongoing implementation of the 1991 Child Care Act. Edu-
 cation is compulsory for children 6 to 15 years of age. Among other things, the act
 places a statutory duty on government health hoards to identify and help children
 who are not receiving adequate care and gives the police increased powers to remove
 a child from the family when there is an immediate and serious risk to health or
 welfare. The Minister of State (junior minister) for Health has special responsibility
 for children's policy, including implementation of the Child Care Act. The Status of
 Children Act of 1987 abolished the concept of illegitimacy and provided for equal
 rights for children in all legal proceedings.
 Sexual abuse of children continued to receive significant media attention, with al-
 most daily reports involving cases of incest or pedophilia. The Dublin Rape Crisis
 Center reported that 53 percent of contacts with its crisis line involved child sexual
 
 
 1129
 abuse. The Government has sought to strengthen procedures for reporting child
 abuse but has refrained from enacting a mandatory reporting requirement.
 People With Disabilities.-An estimated 15 percent of the adult population have
 a disibility; 80 percent of those are unemployed. There is currently no legislation
 to protect persons with disabilities from discrimination in employment or in other
 matters or to improve their access to buildings or transportation.'Few public or pri-
 vate buildings have facilities for people with disabilities. The Government is study-
 inag the recommendations of the report issued in 1996 by the Commission on the
 Status of People with Disabilities. Following the Supreme Court's ruling that the
 employment equality bill was unconstitutional, the Government stated that it plans
 to introduce new employment equality legislation.
 NationollRaciallEthnic Minorites.-There are some 25,000 nomadic people in
 Ireland who regard themselves as a distinct ethnic group called "travelers, roughly
 analogous to the Roma of ontinental Europe. The "traveing" community has its
 own history, culture, and language. The travelers' emphasis on self-employment and
 the extended family distinguish them from the rest of Irish society. In 1991 a Euro-
 pean Parliament committee reported that in Ireland, "the single most discriminated
 against ethnic group is the 'traveling people.'" That remained true in 1997.
 Travelers are regularly denied access to premises, goods, facilities, and services;
 many restaurants and pubs, for example, have a policy of not serving them. Despite
 national school rules that provide that no child may be refused admission on ac-
 count of social position, travelers frequently experience difficulties in enrolling their
 children in school. Sometimes they are segregated into all-traveler classes. Of an es-
 timated 4,000 traveler families, about 1,000 live on roadsides or on temporary sites
 without toilets, electricity, or washing facilities.
 The equal status bill passed by the Dail would have prohibited discrimination
 against travelers, among other categories of people, but it did not take effect, as it
 was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
 Under new procedures designed to respond to a large influx of asylum seekers-
 nearly 3,000 by the end of September-more than 500 persons were refused entry
 and returned to the United Kingdom. Advocates for refugees and other immigrants
 claimed that nonwhite persons were disproportionately singled out under the new
 port controls. The influx of asylum seekers, some of whom were migrating for eco-
 nomic reasons, sparked a public debate over how open society is to new immigrants
 and triggered isolated racist incidents.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to join a union is provided for by law, as
 is the right to refrain from joining. About 55 percent of workers in the private and
 public sectors are members of unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited
 rom striking, but they may form associations to represent themselves in matters
 of pay, working conditions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely exer-
 cised in both the public and private sectors. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990
 prohibits retribution against strikers and union leaders; the Government effectively
 enforces this provision through the Department of Enterprise and Employment. In
 1997 the number of industrial disputes and the number of work days lost by strikes
 declined from 1996. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) represents 65
 unions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Both the ICTU and the
 unions affiliated with it are independent of the Government and of the political par-
 ties. Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. The Anti-Discrimination
 (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment
 Equality Agency responsible for oversight of allegations of antiunion discrimination.
 If the Agency is unable to effect resolution, the dispute goes before the Labor Court,
 which consists of one representative each for the employer and the union, plus an
 independent chairperson. The Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 provides various forms
 of relief in cases of employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination, including the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, in the context of a national economic pact negotiated every 3 years by the
 "social partners," i.e., representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the Gov-
 ernment. A 3-year agreement negotiated among the social partners in 1996, entitled
 "Partnership 2000," remains in effect.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission,
 which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to the Labor Court, which may recommend
 
 
 1130
 terms of settlement and may set up joint employer-union committees to regulate
 conditions of employment and minimum wages in a specific trade or industry.
 There is an export processing zone at Shannon airport with the same labor laws
 as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced and bonded labor, includ-
 ing that performed by children, is prohibited by law and does not occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-By law
 children are required to attend school until the age of 15. Under the terms of the
 Protection of Young Persons Act, which took effect in 1997, employers may not em-
 ploy those under the age of 16 in a regular full-time job. Employers may hire 14-
 or 15-year-olds for light work on school holidays, as part of an approved work expe-
 rience or educational program, or on a part-time basis during the school year (for
 children over the age of 15 only). The act gives effect to international rules on the
 protection of young workers drawn up by the ILO and the EU; it sets rest intervals
 and maximum working hours, prohibits the employment of 18-year-olds for late
 night work, and requires employers to keep specified records for their workers who
 are under 18 years of age. The law prohibits forced and bonded child labor, and the
 Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage law, but
 there are several minimum rates of pay applicable to specific industrial sectors,
 mainly those with lower-than-average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum
 wages is not sufficient to provide a decent living for a family of four, low-income
 families are entitled to additional benefits such as subsidized housing and children's
 allowances.
 The standard workweek is 39 hours. Working hours in the industrial sector are
 limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime is limited to 2 hours
 per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. The Department of Enterprise
 and Employment is responsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing with occupa-
 tional safety that provide adequate and comprehensive coverage. No significant com-
 plaints arose from either labor or management regarding enforcement of these laws.
 Recent regulations provide that employees who find themselves in situations that
 present a "serious, imminent and unavoidable risk" may leave without the employer
 being able to take disciplinary action.
