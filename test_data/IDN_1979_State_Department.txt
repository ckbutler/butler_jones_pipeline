 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous nation, contains
 a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, religious
 and geographic groups. The Government stresses national
 unity through a secular political philosophy (Panca Sila).
 The themes of public policy emphasize independence,
 economic development, public order and nationalism.
 Indonesia became an independent constitutional democracy
 in 1945. After only one election, the government became
 increasingly authoritarian under Indonesia's first President,
 Sukarno, with power divided among the President, the Army
 and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). The unsuccessful
 attempt of the PKI to seize power by force in 1965 set off
 a chain of traumatic events which culminated in the formal
 transfer of power from Sukarno to the current President,
 Suharto, in 1967. The 1965 events and their accompanying
 turmoil were a watershed event and influence the perceptions
 of the nation's current leaders and public. Two of the three
 national elections since independence have been held by the
 current Government.
 During 1979, the three-year program of releasing approximately
 30,000 detainees from the 1965 period was completed on
 schedule with the last group of 2,150, including 105 who
 were placed on parole status, released in December.
 The Government also released four prominent Muslim leaders
 and a number of other detainees from the 1977/78 election
 period. It now states it holds only 23 PKI detainees under
 indictment for prosecution in civil courts and a few prisoners
 from the last election period who will be brought to trial
 for criminal acts ranging from murder to throwing incendiary
 bombs. Liberalized guidelines for access by detainees to
 lawyers have been issued. Conditions in East Timor have
 been a matter of international concern. The Government
 permitted significantly greater access to East Timor for
 international observers in 1979 and invited two major
 humanitarian organizations to begin relief efforts in
 cooperation with foreign governments, including the U.S.
 Indonesia also provides a very receptive and humane environ-
 ment in Southeast Asia for some 40,000 Vietnamese refugees.
 Continuing human rights issues include the broad powers of
 detention held by security authorities; the lack of bail
 and habeas corpus in existing legal codes (inherited from
 the Dutch); and the need to replace the Anti-Subversion
 law and the old Dutch penal code. The Government intro-
 duced in Parliament this year a draft law on criminal
 procedures which is designed to replace the series of
 colonial laws which now provide the only guidance for
 the legal system.
 Other concerns are the need to improve prison treatment and
 conditions and the status of about one million ethnic Chinese
 who are classified as alien residents.
 1.   Respect for the Intecrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is noz condoned as a matter of policy by the
 Government of indonesia. However, some former detainees
 and their lawyers have over the years alleged beatings
 and other abuse o: criminals and of some political
 dissidents, particularly PKI and extremist Muslims.
 
 
 451
 A student leader on trial for insulting the President
 charged in his court testimony, published this year in the
 United States but banned in Indonesia, that he and certain
 other'students were "brutally interrogated" in detention and
 experienced beatings, electrical torture, and isolation
 cells. While the Government has taken no official cogni-
 zance of the charges, spokesmen privately deny it-
 A key defense lawyer for the students cast doubt on the
 validity of these charges. He and another lawyer for the
 students did claim that their clients were confined for
 certain periods with criminals who beat them and subjected
 them to personal indignities. However, they consider this
 treatment as an exception rather than the rule to normally
 very restrained treatment in prison of students and other
 political detainees.
 During the past year, President Suharto, Vice President
 Malik and Minister of Defense Jusuf launched a campaign
 to implement legal reforms and restrain over-zealous law
 enforcement authorities. Partially as a result of high-
 level interest and of public criticism, it has now become
 more common for defense counsel or representatives of legal
 aid societies to monitor the interrogation of suspects and
 detainees.   Indonesian officials are also emphasizing that
 disciplinary action will be taken against law enforcement
 officials who abuse their authority. Public and media
 attention to allegations of wrongdoing plus the continuing
 ICRC prison inspections reinforce the trend toward better
 treatment of prisoners.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government policy does not condone cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Overcrowded conditions,
 minimal food and occasional mixing of political detainees
 with ordinary criminals have given rise to charges of
 abuse. Student detainees generally enjoy special faci-
 lities, as do certain other classes of political
 prisoners.
 There have been  allegations, which have been impossible
 to confirm or deny, of executions and disappearances of
 former Fretilin soldiers and their families in East Timor.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has
 undertaken a continuing program of visitations to detention
 centers and prisons during 1979.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In December, the Government completed on schedule its
 three-year release program for approximately 30,000 persons
 detained without charge on suspicion of complicity in or
 sympathy for the 1965 Communist coup attempt, including 105
 who were released on parole. Indonesian Government figures
 provided'.during the 1979 release ceremonies showed 9,739
 prisoners ware released that year in addition to the 19,994
 detainees released over the previous two years. The Govern-
 ment announced in early December that, in addition to 23
 persons who will be tried, 1,014 detainees had already been
 tried in civil courts. Of those, 752 were serving their
 sentences while 262 had been freed. Of those serving sentences
 331 were reportedly released from prison on December 15,.
 apparently as a result of an administrative decision resulting
 in the reduction of the sentences by the time already spent
 in detention and the qonditional release of those persons
 who had completed tuo-thirds of their terms with good conduct.
 
 
 The Government explains that minor discrepencies between
 the 1978 and 1979 release figures are due to accounting
 difficulties, reclassifications and newspaper reporting
 errors. Without clarifying the basis for its figures,
 Amnesty International (AI) has also insisted in the past
 that there were at least 55,000 prisoners and perhaps as
 many as 100,000 held without trial in Indonesia.
 In October 1978, AI estimated that "almost certainly
 still more than 30,000" are being held.  Over the past two
 years, the Department of State has carefully reviewed all
 available information and found no evidence to support Lhe
 much higher estimates.
 Integration of the released prisoners into Indonesian
 society remains a problem.
 The Indonesian Government has in periods of threatened
 disorder detained students, political activists, intellectuals
 and persons accused of corruption. Some are brought to
 trial under existing legal codes, some released and others
 continued in detention without charges. During the past few
 years, detentions fell into two groups; students and oppo-
 sition leaders arrested during the protests surrounding the
 electoral process in 1977/78 and suspected Muslim extremists
 believed to have instigated or participated in illegal
 anti-Government activities during the elections or ensuing
 acts of violence. All opposition leaders, including moderate
 Muslim politicians, were released and all students including
 those found guilty and sentenced since September 1978
 have either been released unconditionally or freed on
 probation. Of those students previously detained, 35 cases
 have been taken to court. Of those whose trials have been
 completed, several received moderate sentences which are
 being appealed and which in any event may not result in
 further periods of detention. One has been found not
 guilty. According to knowledgeable official sources,
 30-40 suspected Muslim extremists are still being held.
 All are charged with participating in bank robberies and
 murders or throwing molotov cocktails during the 1978
 session of the People's Consultative Assembly. According
 to these same sources, 50-60 other suspects are under house
 or city arrest pending court testimony.
 There are reports that former Fretilin members may be
 held in East Timor.
 Under existing Indonesian criminal law procedures, the
 police have the right to detain and investigate people
 for twenty days. The law also authorizes prosecutors to
 detain people for thirty days and the court can authorize
 extension of this detention every 30 days for a period up
 to one year. Critics contend that detentions by security
 organs often do not conform to these rules.
 In September, 1979, the Government presented Parliament
 with a new draft law on criminal procedures which is
 expected to standardize detention and courtroom procedures
 for the first time since Independence.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 For general civil, criminal and some political offenses,
 the accused are entitled to public trial. Many convicted
 defendents, particularly political ones, claim that their
 trials were weighted by Government influence in favor of
 the prosecutor. However, there have been citable exceptions
 such as the recent acquital of a student for insulting the
 President.
 
 
 453
 Security authorities have the option of holding individuals
 or turning them over to the Attorney General for trial.
 Civil-ians are not being tried by military courts.
 Indonesia's judicial system is complex and operates under
 many constraints. Legal institutions are tremendously
 understaffed and overburdened. The Judiciary is not
 constitutionally independent as judges and prosecutors
 serve as civil servants responsible to the Ministry of
 Justice. Proceedings are based on old Dutch law,
 traditional law (adat) and to some extent Islamic law.
 The applicable law on any given case is thus often unclear.
 This year, however, the Government introduced in Parliament
 a draft law on criminal procedures which is designed to
 provide a new framework of Indonesian jurisprudence.
 Over the past year, it has become common practice for
 suspects and detainees to be provided in most cases with
 legal counsel, although there is no obligatory right to
 counsel under current law except in instances of capital
 offenses. The Indonesian Bar Association advocates
 enhancement of civil and humanitarian rights and has
 facilitated the establishment of legal aid societies
 in most major cities. These societies are permitted to
 advertise publicly. Most literate and even inadequately
 educated persons should be able to draw upon available
 help and services. Farmers, for example, have increasingly
 sought legal aid in land disputes involving government and
 local land owners. There are only 500 attorneys registered
 with the Bar (in a population of 140 million). Anyone with
 a college degree, however, can serve as a defense attorney.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is not inherent in Indonesian custom
 and practice, although individual concerns of privacy
 prevail among certain ethnic groups. While judicial warrants
 are required, except in cases of action by security agents,
 it is difficult to ascertain the degree to which they are
 followed.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Indoneqia's development policy emphasizes economic growth
 with social equity. Priority is given to job creation,
 agricultural production, population control, and efforts
 to meet basic economic needs particularly for the rural
 poor. By contrast, Indonesian leaders in the immediate
 post-independence period emphasized non-productive showcase
 projects. Since 1974, real economic growth has averaged
 about 7.6% annually. Current per capita income has been
 raised to about $300 in 1978.
 Population pressures and insufficient employment oppor-
 tunities are probably the greatest constraints on the
 ability of the economy to satisfy basic needs and Lnprove
 income distribution. Indonesia has a very ambitious and
 effective family planning program which has lowered birth
 rates and reduced population growth projections. However,
 the need to create jobs for about 1.5 million new job
 seekers each year seriously compromises the economy's
 ability to improve living standards for the rural poor.
 
 
 Economic development efforts in recent years have, therefore,
 stressed agriculture and food production. Agricultural
 output has increased by about 3.8% annually during the past
 decade, one of the best agricultural performances of any
 major developing country. But as a result of rising con-
 sumption, Indonesia has become a large food importer,
 particularly of rice, despite the Government's goal to
 achieve rice self-sufficiency. Structural changes aimed
 at rational marketing, more productive types of rice, farm
 credits and better fertilizers have significantly raised
 rice productivity. During the past two years, the govern-
 ment has increasingly stressed non-rice production, parti-
 cularly in areas not suited to rice cultivation. Food pro-
 duction thus remains one of Indonesia's priority needs.
 The material well-being of the bulk of the population,
 including the lowest income groups, has improved since the
 early 1970's. However, wide income disparities remain and
 studies by both government and private experts point to the
 need to increase incomes of the rural and urban poor.
 The present Five-Year Plan for economic development
 (1979-1984), places high priority on creation of employ-
 ment and more equitable income distribution. Devaluation
 of the rupiah just before the plan went into effect was
 undertaken to stimulate labor intensive industries and
 agricultural exports. The government is also expanding
 programs to employ rural workers in infrastructure construc-
 tion in the poorest areas.
 Literacy has increased from about 60% of the population
 in 1971 to an estimated 74% in 1978. In higher education
 the trend is to increase agricultural/rural studies and,
 especially, to train mid-level technicians.
 Extremely limited availability of qualified medical per-
 sonnel and health facilities contribute to slow progress
 in improving health conditions. However, the number of
 regional health centers, maternal child health centers
 and poly-clinics throughout the country has been increasing
 and the percentage of health centers staffed with at least
 one physician has increased from 20% in 1973 to about 50%
 in 1977. About 500 new physicians are being assigned to
 rural areas annually.
 Shelter in tropical Indonesia is less a problem than in
 temperate climates. As rural income increases, the trad-
 itional straw and bamboo construction is giving way to brick
 and tile housing.
 Corruption is an endemic problem and has diverted an indeter-
 minate amount of resources from meeting basic human needs.
 As a result of an anti-corruption campaign begun in 1977,
 a number of senior officials, both military and civilian,
 have been sentenced to prison terms. The Minister of
 Defense and Security has approved measures designed to
 ensure proper use of military funds and resources and to
 curtail luxurious living at top military levels. He has
 also stressed that soldiers who disobey the law will be
 prosecuted.
 Although no reliable figures are available, it appears
 that many thousands of East Timorese have died of hunger
 and warfare since 1975, and this subject has been a matter
 of international concern. Some of the poorest economic
 conditions in Indonesia and a recent, drought-induced crop
 failure have also contributed to the current plight of the
 population. Some 200,000 East Timorese now receive supple-
 
 
 455
 mental food and medical care through a joint program
 supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross,
 the Indonesian Red Cross and Catholic Relief Services.
 The Ihdonesian Government is providing additional resources
 both to support the relief effort and to assist in the
 economic development of the province.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Religion and Assembly
 Article 28 of Indonesia's 1945 Constitution states that
 freedom of association and assembly, of expressing thoughts
 orally and in writing, shall be prescribed by statute.
 Religious freedom is more specifically guaranteed in Article
 29, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution which says that the
 State shall guarantee freedom to every resident to adhere
 to his religion.
 In practice, there exists in Indonesia a delicate balance
 of restraint exercised on the one hand by the Government
 through subdued policy implementation, and, on the other,
 by the self-discipline of the citizenry. This process
 is carried out in an environment where the propriety of
 actions for communal benefit is tacitly understood.
 However, those in the forefront of activism occasionally
 test the limits of acceptability. The limits are then
 altered. When confrontations arise, priority is given
 to defusing the situation, frequently through ambiguous
 compromise.
 Limits on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are
 imposed both by government policy and self-imposed public
 restraint. Nevertheless, opposition can be expressed.
 In September 1979, for example, students in the Bandung
 Institute of Technology staged peaceful processions and
 orderly on-campus rallies protesting the sentencing of a
 popular student leader. The police monitored the demon-
 strations but did not interfere.
 When periodically subjected to restrictions or suspensions
 (the last time in January 1978), the press gradually re-
 expands the scope of its coverage with the tacit approval
 of the Government. During 1979, the press generally
 operated with increasing openness, reporting national
 and regional problems directly and indirectly. One small
 circulation magazine had its license revoked after it
 published attacks- on certain Government officials and
 ethnic Chinese businessmen.
 Indonesia is a secular state and its Constitution provides
 for religious tolerance. However, traditional tensions
 between Indonesia's predominantly Muslim community and
 other religious sects occasionally resurface. The Govern-
 ment seeks to resolve the issue in various ways including
 prohibiting the prosslytizing of one religion in ix area
 where inhabitants already adhere to another.
 b. Freedom .f Movement Within the Counzry, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Exit pervits are required of persons leaving the country,
 but they are obtainable without difficulty (except for a
 few political figures) upon presentation of identification
 papers and fee payment. The Government requires a permit
 to change residence, primarily to control the further
 movement of population from the rural areas into the
 already overcrowded cities. Permits reportedly are not
 
 
 456
 difficult to obtain for persons able to prove that they have
 employment in the city. Former detainees are free to travel
 domestically, but are required to notify authorities of
 travel outside their home areas.
 Amnesty International has charged that the GOI has forced
 some released PKI detainees into resettlement camps in the
 provinces of West and East Kalimantan and South and Southeast
 Sulawesi, all isolated areas where verification is difficult.
 Some sources also state that certain Buru Island ex-prisoners
 have not been voluntary settlers in the Savana Jaya trans-
 migration zone on Buru. Indonesia denies that any PKI
 detainees have been forcibly resettled; it insists that
 their going to transmigration areas is strictly voluntary
 as indicated by the fact that only 660 persons have chosen
 to do so. The Government of Indonesia states that there
 were only 92 "Buru settlers" as of December 8, 1979.
 Buru Island is expected to be open to the public during
 1980.
 Similar charges of "forced resettlement" have been made
 concerning East Timor. In view of serious food shortages
 and the lack of adequate infrastructure, there appears no
 short-term alternative to the emergency relief and care
 of large numbers of Timorese in resettlement centers.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Indonesia has.a form of limited representative government
 dominated by the military. All adult citizens, except
 prisoners and members of the armed forces, are enfranchised.
 Indonesians tend to vote along religious and social group
 lines. Elections for Parliament are held every five years
 with the next election scheduled for 1982. The President is
 elected by people's representatives in a special sitting
 every five years with the next set for 1983. In 1973, the
 nine opposition parties then in existence were required to
 amalgamate into the two political parties presently allowed,
 one representing Muslim interests and the other composed of
 nationalist and Christian groups. A third and preeminent
 political force is the Government-sponsored GOLKAR which
 won the 1971 election with 64% of the vote and the 1977
 election with 61%. Dissenters claim it has an unfair
 advantage.
 Outside Parliamentary activities, political groups are
 inactive between elections primarily because they are not
 permitted to organize or campaign at the grass roots level.
 Prior to parliamentary elections, all three political groups
 campaign for prescribed periods, have media access and hold
 meetings. Government restrictions in the 1977 election
 limited the freedom of all three political groupings to
 criticize each other and government policy. The Communist
 Party, which was the largest single party in the early
 1960's, is Banned as is the Muslim Masjumi party, which
 supported regional rebellions in tha late 1950's.
 Leaders of the former 2asjumi party are not allowed
 to run for office.
 Many among Indonesia's approximately four million Chinese
 experience discrLimination by both government officials and
 the public who resent the very strong Chinese role in the
 economy. Ethnic Chinese have for many centuries been the
 target of communal violence during economic shortages and
 breakdowns in public order. The present Government has in
 recent years taken firm measures to prevent such occur-
 rences. Bans exist on Chinese language materials from
 abroad, recruitment into the military is limited (but also
 
 
 457
 seldom sought by ethnic Chinese) and "extra" fees are
 charged for services. There are approximately one million
 ethnic Chinese alien residents who still maintain citizen-
 ship ties to the PRC and 90,000 stateless with vague ..
 alliances to Taiwan. Time consuming and expensive appli-
 cation procedures make it difficult, if not impossible, for
 many to become naturalized. The Covernment is reportedly
 planning to introduce new procedures for speeding up the
 citizenship process for ethnic Chinese. Despite discrimination,
 the average income of ethnic Chinese greatly exceeds the
 national average.
 Although Indonesian women traditionally are important
 income earners for their families and modern legislation
 guarantees equal treatment, they are still not fully
 represented in the decision-making structure or the modern-
 ization process. No woman has held a full Cabinet portfolio
 since 1966. Although well represented in the professions
 (academia, judicial and medical), they hold no governorships,
 ambassadorships, or top offices in the national and local
 assemblies or national and provincial development planning
 bodies. At the rural level, women are losing traditional
 economic pursuits, but are not being included in adopting
 the modern techniques. while Indonesia has some of the most
 comprehensive labor legislation in the world to protect
 female wage earners, women do not receive equal pay for
 equal work, partly because there is no minimum wage law
 and also because women are restricted from holding certain
 jobs in industry. Crimes against women occur, particularly
 among the poor, but they tend to be dealt with privately
 among families rather than through aid societies or the
 courts.
 Trade union rights are protected by law, and union activity
 is encouraged by the Government. All employers with 25 or
 more employees must recognize and negotiate with local
 unions upon the demand of the employees. The most recent
 statement on recognition of unions was made in a March 28,
 1978, Ministry of Manpower, Transmigration and Cooperative
 regulation which reiterated policies begun in 1976 that
 require companies to consult with workers and post written
 company regulations covering labor matters. If the workers
 wish to have union representation, the company must recog-
 nize the union and convert the company regulation into a
 collective labor agreement arrived at through negotiations.
 Currently 636 collective labor agreements covering about
 2,000 plants or enterprises exist, compared to about 30
 agreements in 1975. In cases of disputes in labor relations,
 the Government can mediate or the parties can take the case
 to a labor court. Strikes are legal when all other remedies
 have failed, but the Government seeks to prevent a labor-
 management conflict from reaching that point. Spontaneous
 strikes occur over wage increases during a period of rapid
 inflation. Government mediation in recent cases has forced
 employers to recognize and negotiate with local unions.
 Government employees are not permitted to join unions.
 Instead, a Government Employees Association, with branches
 in most government'offices, represents Government employees.
 Strikes are forbidden in essential industries.
 The National Trade Union Federation is one of the few
 significant mass national organizations in Indonesia.
 While many union officials are affiliated with political
 organizations, the Federation strives to avoid the frag-
 mentation that existed in earlier workers' movements in
 Indonesia when party-affiliated local unions and company
 
 
 458
 unions dissipated the workers' collective strength and often
 ignored the workers' real economic interests. A law enabling
 workers to "check off" dues to the union has been in effect
 since February 1977 in order to give unions and union
 leaders financial independence. The system is not yet
 widely practiced, and union leaders usually devote only
 part-time to union activities.
 Laws to protect other rights of workers are enforced
 strictly in the area of job security. Government permission
 is usually required before an employee can be dismissed and
 severance pay is required.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Illegal Violations of Human Rights
 Following an interruption in 1976-77, the Indonesian
 Government now permits and cooperates with visit to
 prisons and detention centers by ICRC inspection teams.
 Foreign diplomats were invited to ceremonies marking the
 release of former PKI detainees. They were able to inter-
 view those released, together with members of the domestic
 and fozeign press. In recent years, Amnesty International
 representatives have been refused access to Indonesia
 because of the Government's disagreement with Amnesty
 reports.
 The Indonesian Government in 1979 invited the ICRC and
 Catholic Relief Services to begin relief efforts in East
 Timor. Both organizations have staff on the island
 and are carrying out humanitarian relief programs in
 cooperation with nine international agencies and seven
 foreign governments, including the United States.
 The Government is also expanding access by Western
 journalists, members of the diplomatic corps (including
 the American Ambassador and USAID officials), and Members
 of Congress.
 United Nations resolutions have been adopted in recent years
 expressing deep concern over the situation in East Timor and
 reaffirming the right of the people of East Timor to self-
 determination. The United States Government opposed these
 resolutions in 1977, 1978 and 1979 because it did not
 believe they would contribute to the goal of improving
 the welfare of the people of East Timor.
