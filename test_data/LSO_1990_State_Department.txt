 LESOTHO
 A six-member Military Council, led by Major General J. M.
 Lekhanya, has ruled Lesotho since seizing power in a coup
 d'etat in 1986. Although the Military Council was firmly in
 control of the State, it formally conferred all legislative
 and executive power on Moshoeshoe II, the previously powerless
 King of Lesotho. Forced out by the Military Council in
 February, the King left Lesotho in March for exile in London.
 In November the Military Council deposed King Moshoeshoe and
 installed Crown Prince Mohato, henceforth known as Letsie III,
 as constitutional Monarch and Head of State. Lekhanya and
 Moshoeshoe had disagreed over the terms of the King's return
 from exile.
 The Military Council rules by-decree, while a predominantely
 civilian Council of Ministers administers the day-to-day
 operations of government. While the military regime continued
 the 1986 ban on partisan political activity in 1990, it
 announced plans to restore constitutional rule, which was
 abolished in 1970 by former Prime Minister Jonathan, by 199.
 It convoked a National Constituent Assembly in June, composed
 of a broad cross section of national and local leaders.-
 including military officers, to revise the 1966 independence
 Constitution. At- the end of L990, the Assembly had retained
 or amended half of the 1966 Constitution, wi-th a- goal of
 mid-March 1991 set to complete the revisions.
 The Royal Lesotho Defense Force (RLDF) of about 2,000 troops
 is responsible for internal and border security. The RLDF is
 assisted by a p0lice force of roughly equal size. Members of
 both forces occasionally beat or otherwise mistreat detainees.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on its sole neighbor for
 trade, finance, employment, and access to the outside world.
 Approximately 60 percent of the adult male labor force is
 employed in South Africa's mines, and remittances from workers
 (more than $230 million in 1988) are a critical factor in
 financing imports.
 Human rights in Lesotho in 1990 remained circumscribed. Major
 concerns included: provisions for lengthy detention,
 restrictions on freedom of speech, assembly, and the right of
 citizens to change their government through democratic means,
 and severe restrictions on women's rights. At year's end, it
 was too early to tell how the Government's reform program
 would be implemented and what effect it would have on the
 observance of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Following a judicial inquiry starting in November 1989, the
 Government in 1990 brought to trial two members of the
 military, including a former member of the ruling Military
 Council, for complicity in the brutal 1986 murders of former
 Ministers of Information and Foreign Affairs, Desmond Sixishe
 and Vincent Makhele, and their wives. The trial took place in
 
 
 184
 LESOTHO
 open session in the High Court of Maseru and featured graphic
 testimony by a survivor of the killings and by accomplices in
 the murders (see Section l.e.). At year's end, the
 prosecution and defense had rested their cases and made final
 arguments. The presiding judge expects to deliver his
 judgment by March 1991.
 Amnesty International (AI) has continued to press for
 inquiries into the suspicious 1988 deaths, while in custody,
 of Samuel Hlapo, a hijacker, and Mazizi Maqokesa, a South
 African exiled member of the African National Congress, but no
 inquests were held in 1990.
 Some excesses by law enforcement agencies continued to occur
 in 1990, including the fatal shooting in August by a policeman
 of a student mistakenly believed to have been involved in a
 demonstration. The policeman has been charged and will be
 tried in the High Court. There are unconfirmed but reliable
 reports that other youths have been fatally shot by policemen
 without adequate justification. No charges are known to have
 been brought in those instances.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically related disappearances in
 1990, nor were there any further instances of reported
 abductions by South African authorities in Lesotho, as
 occurred in previous years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In 1990 there were continuing reports of police brutality,
 including beatings of detainees. Police reportedly struck the
 mother of the student shot and killed by a policeman when she
 ran to his aid (see Section l.a.). However, there were fewer
 such reports since the ending of the State of Emergency (SOE)
 in August 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In civil and criminal cases, persons arrested or detained have
 the right to immediate consideration of habeas corpus appeals
 as well as the right to legal and medical counsel. The 1981
 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as amended in 1984,
 makes provision for the granting of bail. Under the Act, the
 High Court is the only judicial body empowered to grant bail
 in cases of armed robbery or suspected homicide.
 In political cases, the Internal Security (general) Act (ISA)
 of 1984 applies. This Act provides for so-called
 investigative detention without charge or trial for up to 42
 days (the first 14 days on order of the police; the second 14
 days on order of the police commissioner; and the final 14
 days on order of the Minister of Defense and Internal
 Security). Detainees may be held up to 14 days. During the
 second stage of the detention, ministerially appointed
 "advisers" (all of whom have been government employees to
 date) report on the health of the detainee, investigate
 whether the detainee has been involved in subversive
 activities, and advise the Minister of Defense and Internal
 Security whether there is a need for continued detention.
 Detainees under the Act may make representation about their
 own treatment only through the adviser. The Act also allows
 for detention of witnesses in security cases.
 
 
 LESOTHO
 In addition, a 1986 amendment to the ISA allows the Minister
 of Defense and Internal Security (currently the Chairman of
 the Military Council) to "restrict" a person who, in the
 opinion of the police commissioner, is conducting himself in a
 manner prejudicial to public order, security, administration
 of justice, or obedience to the law or lawful authority. The
 Government retains the power to restrict the movements of such
 a person to a certain location and to certain hours of the day
 and may prohibit his association or communication with other
 persons, but it was not used in 1990.
 The Government's general amnesty for exiled Basotho
 politicians remained in effect. Following his return to
 Lesotho in February 1989, Ntsu Mokhehle, the leader of the
 Basutoland Congress Party, took the seat offered to him in
 June 1990 in the Constituent Assembly. Other opposition
 political leaders also took seats in the Assembly and
 participated. actively in debates there.
 Following a dispute with the Military Council in February over
 the exercise of executive and legislative authority (the King
 refused to dismiss four ministers, King Moshoeshoe II left
 Lesotho for exile in London. While in exile, he continued to
 criticize in writings and interviews the Government, leading
 the Attorney General to issue- a legal opinion that the
 Government had grounds-under the Office- of the King-Order cf
 1970 to declare- that the King had abdicated the throne-
 Subsequent negotiations between General Lekhanya and the King
 proved unsuccessful, and in November the Military Council
 deposed the King and installed Crown Prince Mohato. as King
 Letsie III, constitutional Monarch and Head of State.
 In the long power struggle between the King and the Military
 Council, three Military Council members were sacked including
 Colonel Sekhobe Letsie. He is one of the defendants on trial
 for the murder of two former cabinet ministers and their wives..
 e. Denial of Fair Public'Trial
 The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal, the High Court,
 magistrate courts, and customary or traditional courts, which
 exist largely in rural areas to administer customary law.
 Court decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities
 and are generally free of interference by the executive.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel and public trials.
 The courts have acted to limit infringements of law on
 numerous occasions in past years, e.g., the April 1R88
 annulment of the SOE on procedural grounds (but which the
 Government quickly reinstituted).
 Under the system of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there
 is no trial by jury. Criminal trials are normally adjudicated
 by a single High Court judge who presides with two assessors,
 who serve in an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges
 normally hear cases alone. The High Court also provides
 procedural and substantive advice and guidance on matters of
 legal procedure to military tribunals; however, it does not
 participate in arriving at judgments. Military tribunals have
 jurisdiction only over military cases.
 A judicial inquest is initiated by the Attorney General on the
 authority of the Judicial Inquest Proclamation Number 32 of
 1954. He initiated such an inquiry in November 1989 into the
 1986 slayings of the two ministers and their wives. The two
 military men charged with these murders were being tried
 
 
 186
 LESOTHO
 before a high court during the latter half of 1990. The case
 was heard in open court by the Chief Justice (who rules on
 matters of law), accompanied by two civilian assessors (who
 will rule with him on matters of fact). Public attendance was
 high throughout the trial, which was conducted fairly and in
 accordance with Roman-Dutch judicial procedure. A decision is
 expected in March 1991. Either defendant can appeal a
 conviction to the Court of Appeals. The Director of Public
 Prosecutions can appeal an acquittal but only on a point of
 law.
 There were no known political prisoners in Lesotho at the end
 of 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1990 there were far fewer reports of violations of
 individual privacy by state authorities compared to the period
 the SOE was in effect. The ISA provides police with wide
 powers to stop and search persons and vehicles and to enter
 homes and other places for similar purposes without a
 warrant. Correspondence appears to be monitored occasionally
 by government officials.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of
 expression but subordinates this freedom to the needs of
 national security. Following the 1986 coup, a formal ban on
 politics was announced with stringent restrictions on freedom
 of speech and political assembly. In particular, Government
 Order No. 4 of 1986 prohibits persons and groups from making
 political speeches and from publishing or distributing
 political party materials. Despite the ban on organized
 political party activity, members of Lesotho's seven
 registered political parties participated actively in debates
 on a wide range of political issues in the Constituent
 Assembly. The Chairman of the Military Council made clear
 that political leaders were free to discuss Assembly matters
 outside the Chamber, providing they did not do so on a
 partisan basis; in fact, such discussions rarely criticized
 government policies directly but were primarily focused on the
 constitutional issues. Debate in the Constituent Assembly was
 frequently lively and was often critical of the Government;
 daily reports were broadcast on the radio, and most weekly
 papers carried a summary of the discussions.
 The Government controls the official media (one radio station,
 a half-hour daily newscast on a local television channel, and
 two weekly newspapers) and ensures that they faithfully
 reflect government views. Although criticism of the King was
 disseminated through these media, the Government rarely uses
 them to attack its partisan critics. Opposition viewpoints
 were routinely expressed in 1990 in two Sesotho-language
 weekly newspapers published by the Roman Catholic Church and
 the Lesotho Evangelical Church and two independent
 English-language weeklies. In August two government
 journalists were fired, purportedly for asking questions of a
 U.S. Information Service-sponsored visitor about the
 Government's management of foreign assistance to Lesotho.
 
 
 187
 LESOTHO
 Academic freedom is generally respected, although there have
 been complaints from some professors and students about
 restrictions on their ability to discuss academic and
 political issues. Student representatives openly criticized
 the Government and called for greater political freedoms
 during graduation ceremonies in September; no reprisals were
 known to have taken place.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Government's ban on "politics" was not
 interpreted to require the dissolution of existing political
 parties, but the ban does preclude political gatherings and
 rallies. Meetings of the appointed Constituent Assembly in
 1990 were open to the public. Nonpolitical organizations and
 professional groups are freely formed, even encouraged, and
 are allowed to hold public and regular meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open
 religious practice is permitted and encouraged. Christianity
 is the dominant faith of the majority of Basotho, and Roman
 Catholicism has the most adherents, although leas than half
 the population. There is a significant Protestant minority
 composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the Angli(ai.
 Church, and a number of other smal.er denominations.
 Conversion is permitted, and there is no apparent social or
 political benefit or stigma attached to belonging to any
 particular church. There are no bars to missionary activity
 or work by foreign clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the
 country an& across national boundaries.  There were instance-T
 in recent years, however, in t.hich the Government restricted-
 passports for political reasons, but none occurred in, 199a-
 The Government places no obstacles in the way of its own
 citizens who wish to emigrate.
 In the first few months of 1990, the number of refugees
 entering Lesotho increased significantly, surpassing the 1989
 total of 56 by the beginning of May. The majority were South
 African, Pan African Congress-affiliated youth from Ciskei.
 Consistent with past practice, the Government permitted them
 to stay pending onward ,travel to a third country. There are
 currently about 250 registered refugees who have been granted
 asylum in Lesotho, the majority unaffiliated South Africans.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Lesotho currently do not have the freedom to
 change their government. However, in 1990 the military
 Government announced that it intends to hand over power to a
 democratically elected government by the middle of 1992. It
 convened a National Constituent Assembly (NCA) in June to
 revise the independence Constitution of 1966, and plans a
 series of town meetings ("pitsos") in the spring of 1991 to
 discern public opinion before the NCA votes on the final
 text. At the end of 1990, plans called for Lesotho to remain
 a kingdom, under a constitutional monarch, with multiple
 parties, and an independent judiciary.

 LESOTHO
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not been responsive on human rights issues,
 particularly when the call for outside investigation emanated
 from the domestic political opposition. There are no internal
 human rights organizations, either official or
 nongovernmental, although church and other groups occasionally
 address human rights issues. The Transformation Resource
 Center, a social development center which is an ecumenical
 associate member of the Christian Council of Lesotho, was
 searched in early December by uniformed and plainclothes
 policemen with a vague search warrant. Over 50 videotapes,
 cassettes, and documents were temporarily removed from the
 premises. Reports of alleged human rights abuses are
 sometimes carried in the local press, particularly the
 Center's monthly newsletter, church newspapers, and Lesotho's
 major independent weekly.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most citizens of Lesotho speak a common language and share
 common historical and cultural traditions. Asians (primarily
 ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are
 active in the country's commercial life. In 1987 the
 Government formulated a policy aimed at "localization': of
 Lesotho's commercial retail trade, and, under the Trading
 Enterprise Order, called on foreign owners to enter into joint
 ventures with Basotho nationals. Equity transfers would
 entail compensation. To date, the localization order has not
 been strictly enforced, due largely to difficulties in
 identifying local entrepreneurs to take over foreign-owned
 businesses and in financing such takeovers, and to concern
 over foreign reaction.
 Although the question was briefly debated in the Constituent
 Assembly in 1990, the Government has still not seriously
 addressed the issue of women's rights. In Lesotho these
 rights are severely limited by both law and custom, including
 in the area of property, inheritance, and contracts, but women
 do have the legal and customary right to make a will and sue
 for divorce. Under Lesotho's customary law, a married woman
 is considered a minor during the lifetime of her husband, with
 all of the legal limitations that this status implies. She
 cannot enter into any legally binding contract, whether for
 employment, commerce, or education, without her husband's
 consent. A married woman has no standing in court and cannot
 sue or be sued without her husband's permission.
 Despite their second-class status, women in Lesotho
 traditionally have been the stabilizing force in the home and
 in the agricultural sector, given the absence of over 100,000
 Basotho men who work in South Africa. More female than male
 children complete primary and secondary schools.
 Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs, but, as
 statistics are not available, the extent of the problem is not
 known. In Basotho tradition a wife may return to her
 maidenhome" if physically abused by her husband; in common
 law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as assault
 under the 1981 Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act. A 1976
 High Court case successfully reversed a Roman-Dutch legal
 tradition which recognized a husband's right to chastise his
 
 
 189
 LESOTHO
 wife at will. While the Government has made some attempts to
 improve the economic prospects of women, very little direct
 action has been taken to improve their subordinate status in
 society. Women's rights organizations are beginning to be
 formed, including a partnership of women lawyers which has
 expressed interest in handling such cases. Female
 circumcision is not practiced.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to join or form unions without prior
 government authorization. Roughly 60 percent of Lesotho's
 active male labor force between the ages of 20 and 44 works in
 the Republic of South Africa, mainly in gold and coal mines.
 At least 70 percent of the remainder is engaged in traditional
 agriculture The rest is employed mainly by the Government
 and in small industries and enterprises in Lesotho. A
 majority of Basotho minework-ers are. members of the South
 African National Union of Mineworkers CNUn). Because the NlUM-
 is an extraterritorial worker organization, it is not
 permitted to engage in union aqtivities in Lesotho.
 There are two trade union federations in LesothQ, the Lesotho
 Congress of Free Trade Unions (LCFTUY and the Lesotho-
 Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU)- The much larger LCFT.-
 encompasses 24 affiliated indeperxdent trade unions-; the LFTU
 has 4. Like its predecessor, the current Government supports
 the formation of a single, umbrella trade union center, and it
 has been trying since 198& to arrange a merger between
 Lesotha's two competing federations.
 The Government believes that the size of Lesotho's work force
 does not warrant the more than 30 existing labor unions and
 would lite to see these consolidated. Those favoring a merger
 argue that it would eliminate competition-among unions in
 their negotiations with employers and enhance the bargaining-
 power of the work force. There areo, however, deep
 philosophical, political, and ideological differences between
 the two federations, reflecting the historical differences of
 the two political parties with which they are affiliated. As
 the federations were unable to reach agreement in 1990, the
 Government is still considering legislation tQ compel the
 desired merger.
 While a legal right to strike exists for workers in
 nonessential services, in practice the procedure for calling a
 strike is so lengthy and cumbersome that it discourages legal
 strike actions and accounts for the prevalence of wildcat
 strikes. The 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act
 enumerates lengthy procedures which must be followed before a
 strike is called. The last general strike was in 1961;
 although a general strike was called in September 1990, it was
 not effective. There were several wildcat strikes in 1990
 against both foreign and domestic companies, mostly over wages
 and conditions of work. Usually, wildcat strikes have been of
 short duration and ended in compromise, often with the
 Government stepping in to bring the parties to an agreement.
 In 1989 a new union was formed to represent construction
 workers for the $2 billion Lesotho Highlands Water Project.
 In 1990 these workers again struck the construction firms
 building infrastructure for the Project. The workers were
 protesting differential wage and working conditions and the
 
 
 LESOTHO
 employment of large numbers of South African workers. The
 action turned violent and resulted in serious injury to two
 workers when they resisted arrest by police. An illegal
 demonstration by union members took place 2 days later in
 Maseru; the Government permitted the march, and the Military
 Council Chairman received a petition from two of the marchers.
 The LCFTU is a member of the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordination Council, the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, and the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The LFTU has fewer international affiliations but is
 becoming more active internationally. The Government imposes
 no obstacles to international affiliations or foreign travel
 for labor union-related purposes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. These rights were established in the
 1964 Trade Union and Trade Disputes Act and in the 1967
 Employment Act, as amended in 1977. There is also an unfair
 labor practices tribunal whose mandate is to investigate
 unfair labor practices and charges of antiunion
 discrimination, and generally to safeguard worker rights. A
 government-appointed labor commission is charged with, inter
 alia, monitoring wage and working conditions and accepting,
 reviewing, and investigating worker complaints.
 In 1989, following extensive local tripartite consultations,
 the Government gave preliminary approval to a draft labor
 code, developed in consultation with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), which would bring the country's labor laws
 into full conformity with ILO standards for collective
 bargaining and greatly simplify the right to strike. Since
 then, however, the Government has delayed bringing this text
 into law, and no progress toward implementation was made in
 1990.
 Lesotho has several industrial estates grouping together
 companies, mostly textile and apparel firms, engaged in
 manufacturing for export. There are no prohibitions against
 organized labor in these industrial zones, and labor laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced and is prohibited
 by the 1987 Employment Act.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment in commercial or
 industrial enterprises is 14. In practice, however, children
 under 14 are employed in family-owned businesses. There are
 prohibitions against the employment of minors in commercial,
 industrial, or nonfamily enterprises involving hazardous or
 dangerous working conditions. Basotho minors under 18 years
 may not be recruited for employment outside of Lesotho.
 Enforcement of these laws by inspectors of the Ministry of
 Employment, Social Welfare and Pensions is lax.
 In Lesotho's traditional society, life and working conditions
 for the country's young "herdboys" tend to be much more
 rigorous and demanding than conditions in the modern sector.
 Their quasi-pastoral life, however, is considered a
 
 
 LESOTHO
 prerequisite to manhood and is a fundamental feature of
 Basotho life, tradition, and culture, beyond the reach of
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Wages in Lesotho are extremely low. The Government, through
 the mechanism of a tripartite wages advisory board, again
 raised minimum wage rates in 1990 for various types of work.
 These ranged from $&I a month for light unskilled labor to
 about $103 per month for semiskilled jobs. These amounts are
 sufficient for a minimum decent standard of living. Most wage
 earners supplement their monthly income through subsistence
 agriculture and/or remittances from relatives employed in
 South Africa. Many employers in Lesotho now pay more than
 minimum wages in an effort to attract and retain motivated
 employees-
 Lesotho's 1967 Employment Act spells out basic worker rights,
 including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest peri6d of at least
 24V hours, 11 to 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for
 public holidays. Employers are required to- provide adequate
 light, ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees, and
 to install and maintairr machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. In practice, these. regulations are generally followed
 only within the wage economy and are enforcel by inspectors
 from the Department of Labor of the Ministry of Employment,
 Social Welfare and Pensions-.
 In collaboration with the ILO, the Government began a 3-year
 project in 1990 to upgrade its nationa-l occupational and
 health safety standards. This is a regional project which
 also includes Botswana and Swaziland.
