 MADAGASCAR
 The Democratic Republic of Madagascar, the fourth largest
 island in the world, is governed by a president and a
 parliament (National Popular Assembly), both elected by direct
 universal suffrage. The President selects the members of the
 Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), the highest policymaking
 body. President Didier Ratsiraka, in power since 1975, has
 broad constitutional powers, and his position is further
 strengthened by the influential role of his political party,
 the Vanguard of the Malagasy Revolution (AREMA), which holds
 an overwhelming majority in the Nationa. Popular Assembly.
 Prior to "December 1989, only the eight parties making up the
 National Front for the Defense of the Revolution were
 permitted to engage in political activity. The Front,
 established in 1976 by the Malagasy Constitution, was
 concelved as a unifying framework--a form of single confederal
 party--for building socialism and protecting the "Socialist
 Revolution" in Madagascar while allowing for party diversity.
 The political orientation of the eight parties in the National
 Front ranges from moderate and pro-Western to radical and
 pro-Soviet- The President and his party gained major
 victories in'bitter 1989 elections, which resulted in further
 sharp divisions between party leaders-of the Front and called
 into question the future of this unusual institution. As a
 result on December 20 the National Assembly amended the
 Constitution to remove the Front's special status.
 The Malagasy internal security system is composed of the urban
 police force and the National Gendarmerie, the latter having
 jurisdiction in the provinces. On occasion, the National
 People's Army is also used for internal security purposes.
 Agriculture dominates the Malagasy economy, employing some 85
 percent of the population and providing about 80 percent of
 the country's export earnings. Since 1982 the Government,
 with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, began
 to introduce a 16ng-term austerity reform program, inter alia,
 to stimulate declining agricultural production in basic
 commodities, especially ride. Despite'some progress, economic
 growth (1.8 percent in 1988) has not kept pace with population
 growth (3 percent), real incomes have declined, and
 unemployment remainshigh, especially among youth (60 percent
 of the population is under age 25). As a result, the
 Government's reform program became a major issue in the 1989
 presidential and parliamentary elections.
 Although a wide range of fundamental liberties and individual
 rights are called for by the Constitution, there continued to
 be human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and
 mistreatment of prisoners, significant restrictions on
 freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, and questions as to
 the ability of citizens to change their government through
 free and fair elections. However, in February the President
 did suspend censorship of the media. While there were
 numerous charges of voting irregularities following the hotly
 contested presidential race, which was won by the incumbent
 President with 63 percent of the vote, these elections
 probably were less subject to manipulation than earlier ones
 due to the monitoring role played by several independent
 organizations. Still, there were large demonstrations against
 the outcome, which resulted in violent clashes with police.
 Officially, 5 persons died, 70 were wounded, and 64 people
 arrested. In 1989 the Government scaled back its rural
 security campaign against bandits after extensive charges
 emerged in 1988 of summary executions by security forces.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been recurring rumors of politically motivated
 killings in recent years, but little evidence to substantiate
 them. During a press conference in August 1989, the President
 stated that there had been a bomb attempt on his life and that
 there had been a plot to kill Monja Jaona, an agiag opposition
 leader, and cast blame on the President. However, there was
 no known followup investigation of these charges.
 In 1988 military and police forces undertook a major campaign
 to eradicate the well-armed and burgeoning cattle rustling and
 banditry endemic to the southern areas of Madagascar,
 resulting in on-the-spot executions of captured bandits. In
 July 198e, Inteiior Minister Ampy Portos announced that 205
 bandits had been killed in government-directed security
 operations. A number of human rights groups, such as Amnesty
 International (AI), criticized the summary execution of
 bandits by the security forces, but there appeared to be no
 major domestic opposition to the government policy of taking
 forceful actions against the bandits. However, in 1989 the
 Government sharply reduced the scope of these operations,
 although reports of banditry increased at the end of 1989. A
 1989 trial brought to the surface allegations of military
 involvement in cattle rustling operations and connected arms
 trafficking (see Section I.e.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearance. However, press reports in August 1989 raised
 questions about the whereabouts of a university student leader
 arrested in June and detained at the prison of Tsiafahy.
 Reportedly, he opposed a proposed Government reform plan for
 the university. The student, Cyrille Rasambozafy, may have
 escaped in a major prison break at Tsiafahy in July. The
 student's parents claim that they have not heard from him
 since his arrest and fear he may still be held by the
 authorities. The Government has not responded in any way
 regarding the missing student.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 While there were no documented cases of physical torture
 occurring in Madagascar, some organizations in the security
 apparatus, notably the state secret police, have a reputation
 for ruthless methods. There have also been credible reports
 that the armed forces used torture in the Government's
 campaign against outlaw bandits in Madagascar's southwest.
 Malagasy prisons are increasingly inhumane in terms of living
 conditions. Some prisoners are not fed regularly, hygiene is
 totally lacking, and medical care is not provided. As a
 result, prisoners suffer a range of medical problems from
 malnourishment and infections to malaria and tuberculosis.
 The death toll rises significantly among prisoners during the
 cold winter months. The Minister of Justice has appealed for
 foreign assistance to ameliorate these cohditions by making
 prisons self-supporting agricultural and small industrial
 units.

 MADAGASCAR
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In a normal criminal case, the accused must be charged or
 released within 3 days after arrest. Generally, defendants in
 ordinary criminal cases are charged formally within the
 specified time frame and, upon being charged, are allowed to
 obtain an attorney. Counsel is readily available, and
 court-appointed counsel is provided for indigents.
 Under Malagasy law, persons suspected of activity against the
 State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to
 indefinite extension if considered necessary by the
 Governmert. In particular, the Government has held detainees
 in security cases for extended periods, as with 37 kung fu
 adherents .held from 1985 until their trial and eventual
 release in 1988. (In 1984-85, these martial arts enthusiasts
 -had been involved in street fighting with a paramilitary youth
 jgroup and the army..)' Also, certain defendants involved in
 rcoup--plotting cases have been h9ld in pretrial detention for
 periods ranging'-from 20 months to over 5 years.
 . Since the release of the kung fu defendantm; there has been no
 evidence of other arbitrary political detentions. The
 Government briefly detained a number of persons after massive
 demonstrations held in April to protest the presidential
 electoral outcome and government economic policies.
 Exile has not been used as a means of control in the recent
 past.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malagasy Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary, and in practice the judiciary seems to function in
 most cases without outside influence from the executive. The
 judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for civil
 and criminal cases carrying limi-ed fines and sentences; a
 court of appeals which includes a criminal court for cases
 bearing sentences of 5 years or more, and a Supreme Court.
 The judiciary also has a number of special courts designed to
 handle specific kinds of cases under the jurisdiction of the
 -higher courts. A Constitutional High Court, with a totally
 separate and autonomous status, may review the
 constitutionality of laws, decrees, and ordinances and ensures
 the legality of elections.
 A Military Court has jurisdiction over all cases involving
 national security. The definition of national :security is
 largely a matter of interpretation by the authorities but
 includes acts constituting a threat to the nation and its
 political leaders, invasion by foreign forces, and riots that
 could lead to an overthrow of the Government. In exceptional
 cases, civilians may be tried in the Military Court if they
 are charged with having broken military laws.
 Military courts, like civilian courts, provide for an appeals
 process. Furthermore, military courts are presided over by a
 civilian magistrate. The rank of'the four military officers
 comprising the court is determined by the rank of the accused.
 In 1989 two bandits accused of the mass-murder of 11 persons
 for the proceeds from a cattle sale were tried and sentenced
 to death by a military court. While the death penalty is
 
 
 196
 MADAGASCAR
 legal in Madagascar, it has not been carried out since 1947.
 The particular viciousness of this crime and the popular
 outrage it evoked may result in these death sentences being
 carried out. The trial, known as the "keliberano affair,"
 also brought to the surface allegations of military
 involvement in cattle rustling operations and connected arms
 trafficking. The presiding judge called for an investigation
 and a hearing on these charges. On November 15 the court of
 Fianarantsoa rendered light sentences of 6 months to a year
 for those involved in supplying the weapons used in the
 keliberano killings.
 There are currently no known political prisoners in Madagascar.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not generally intervene in nonpolitical aspects
 of the lives ofthe people. The home is traditionally
 inviolable under Malagasy law. However in December 1989,
 Article 42 of the Constitution was amended to permit
 authorities to enter the home in cases of persons caught in
 the act or where the occupants explicitly consent to a
 search. In their suppression of cattle rustlers and bandits
 the military have entered some homes without court orders and
 ransacked them.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms remain significantly restricted despite the
 loosening of press censorship. Private citizens who criticize
 government officials or policies must choose their words
 carefully; direct criticism of the President Dr the "Socialist
 Revolution" is not tolerated.
 The broadcast media are under state control and provide
 positive coverage of the Government's activities. While the
 opposition received some coverage in the presidential and
 legislative elections of 1989, many observers felt that it was
 dwarfed by the nightly reports on the activities of the
 President and his AREMA Party.
 In past years, the Ministry of Interior has reviewed and
 censored the content of newspapers prior to printing. On
 February 19, 1989, the President suspended.censorship
 restrictions on the print media, and journalists have
 cautiously been testing their newfound freedom. To become
 permanent, this suspension still requires passage of a law by
 the National Assembly. Thus, there is a moratorium on
 censorship, and the President's ability to restore controls at
 a moment's notice continues to moderate press criticism and
 comment of Government policies. The press, in contrast to
 television and radio, did give broad coverage to the election
 campaigns and related demonstrations.
 In 1988 the Government allowed previously barred journalists
 from a foreign newspaper to visit Madagascar, and it lifted an
 8-year-old ban on the Paris-based weekly Jeune Afrique. There
 is one government-owned newspaper and two major independent
 dailies. Several other dailies and weeklies are published by
 party groups and independent publishers, including the
 outspoken and candid Catholic newspaper, Lakroa.
 
 
 197
 MADAGASCAR
 Academic freedom is restricted by a constitutional prohibition
 on any public lectures or teachings which condemn Madagascar's
 Charter of the Socialist Revolution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights .of assembly and association are restricted.
 Permits.are required to hold public meetings and can be denied
 by the Government if officials believe that the meeting poses
 a threat to the State or endangers national security. Those
 denied a permit can appeal these decisions before the
 administrative chamber of the Supreme Court. Persons and
 groups belonging to parties of the National Front are
 permitted to organize and assemble. Nevertheless, since
 political activity by groups outside the National Front was
 prohibited, dissenting political opinion has been limited. In
 1988 the Government banned an organization affiliated with the
 Catholic Church (the CEADAM) from holding a national political
 debate on the s.tate and future of the nation.
 Madagascar's campuses continue to copstitute a major source of
 instability for the Government. The range of problems runs �
 from inadequate finances and logistics to overcrowding, ethnic
 tensions, and squatters. While the widespread student unrest
 which took place 1h 1987 has not recurred, the University of
 Antananarivo campus becamethe site for popular demonstrations
 against President Ratsiraka's reelection in April 1989.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unionsL'see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government is secular, and there is no official religion.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religious
 affiliation, and people are free to follow the faith of their
 choice. Over half of the population is Christian, with the
 remainder followingtraditional Malagasy religious beliefs or
 other faiths. Missionaries and clergy are generally permitted
 to operate freely.
 During the visit of Pope John Paul II to Madagascar in late
 April, several days of violent political demonstrations,
 protesting the presidential election results, were suspended
 by the opposition to ensure a peaceful visit.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Officially there is no restriction on travel within the
 country. However, since May 1988, the start of the campaign
 to eradicate cattle rustling, villagers in the southwest
 reportedly must get permission to leave their villages. For
 all Malagasy, official approval must be obtained for trips
 outside the country. Foreign travel is impeded by the
 difficulty of obtaining foreign currency. The Malagasy franc
 is not convertible abroad, and the Government limits the
 amount of hard currency that can be obtained for foreign
 travel. There is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government was called
 into question by widespread allegations of fraud in the
 
 
 198
 MADAGASCAR
 presidential elections. Moreover, the electorate's choice had
 been constrained by the nature of the political system since,
 prior to December 20, 1989, the only political parties allowed
 to operate had to be members of the National Front. The
 situation is, however, expected to change when new
 implementing decrees are elaborated to define political
 activity outside the Front (see below). The electoral process
 provides the voters a chance to choose among candidates
 expressing differing views in local and regional elections, as
 well as in the parliamentary and presidential campaigns. The
 137 members of the National Popular Assembly are elected by
 universal suffrage for 5-year terms. The President is elected
 to a 7-year term. The President's party has total political
 control of the apparatus of government. This is partly due to
 political apathy and a sense of defeatism as expressed in
 increasing voter absenteeism which reached over 50 percent in
 .the last round of local elections. The President controls all
 major policy decisions. Most legislation is initiated by the
 executive branch.
 On March 12, 1989, some 4.7 million Malagasy went to the polls
 to choose from among four presidential candidates. According
 to the official results, pronounced a month later by the
 Constitutional High Court, President Ratsiraka won a third
 consecutive 7-year term with an absolute majority of 63
 percent of the votes cast. There was widespread
 dissatisfaction with this outcome. Opposition leaders claimed
 fraud and organized rallies protesting the election results.
 Violent demonstrations erupted and claimed four or five
 lives. The election results were subsequently contested in
 the Constitutional High Court, which sustained voter
 irregularity appeals in 43 cases of the several hundred
 brought before it. Most of the challenges were denied on
 technical grounds (e.g., improper filing procedures). The May
 28 legislative elections reinforced the President's hand as
 his AREMA Party consolidated its already preponderant hold on
 the Assembly with a 120-seat victory. The legislative
 elections were peaceful. However, due to widespread voter
 dissatisfaction as evidenced in the earlier presidential
 elections, there was a low voter turnout. In September local
 government elections were marked by an even lower voter
 turnout and led to further AREMA party consolidation.
 On December 20, 1989, the National Assembly amended the
 Constitution. It rescinded Articles 9 and 29 concerning the
 Front which results in this institution no longer being an
 official institution of the Malagasy Government but rather a
 simple alliance of parties which support the President and his
 Socialist policies. New parties may also now apply to join
 the Front. Furthermore, an amendment to Article 8 allows for
 opposition parties to exist outside the Front. However,
 opposition parties must not have as their objective the
 undermining of the unity of the nation or as their platform a
 separatist ethnic, tribal, or religious character. Moreover,
 a revised Article 16 states that opposition parties cannot
 oppose Malagasy socialism by illegal or violent means.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not officially cooperated with groups,
 either externally or internally based, wishing to investigate
 alleged human rights violations end has denied visas to AI
 representatives. In 1989 the President ruled out the
 
 
 suggestion that international observers be present at the
 polls on March 12, saying that.the Malagasy are quite'capable
 of managing their own electoral affairs. Originally, the
 Union of Mqlagasy Opposition in Exile (based in Paris) made a
 public call in 1980 for the presidential elections to-be
 overseen by U.N. observers.
 Human rights organizations are considered to be political
 groups under Malagasy law and must therefore be sponsored by
 one of the parties belonging to the National Front. Under
 these circumstances, only one human rights organization is
 currently operating in Madagascar: The Malagasy National
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights which was founded in
 1988 and is affiliated with the VITM Party, one of the smaller
 parties. Some of its members are also on the National
 Committee for Election Observation which monitored
 electioneering in 1989.
 The Christian, churches in the country have taken the lead in'
 advocating huma rightsand play an important supplementary
 role in-toonitoring human rights concerns. The Christian
 Council of Churches in Madagasca; .(FFKM) is a major
 organization in this regard. In February 1988, the FFKM
 monitored the celebrated kung-fu trial to assure that due
 process was provided to the 245 accused. It also provided
 lodging and food for the defendants. In 1989 this
 organization provided a monitoring role, where possible, in
 the presidential and legislative elections. It also
 publicized and condemned those irregularities which it
 witnessed.
 Madagascar is a member of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Madagascar is -nhtabited~by an estimated 10.3 million people of
 both Malayo-Polynesian and African origin. While there
 appears to be no customary practice of -institutional or
 systematic discrimination on the -basis of ethnic grouping in
 Madagascar, a serious outbreak of violence and plunder of
 Indo-Pakistani-owned property occurred across Madagascar in
 March 1987. This prosperous community, estimated at some
 24,000 persons of Indo-Pakistani origin and referred to
 locally as "karana," is primarily engaged in commerce. While
 no Indo-Pakistanis died in these riots, several looters were
 killed, many were wounded, and property damage was great. The
 simultaneous outbreak of these riots in cities across the
 island and the relative absence of damage outside the
 Indo-Paki-stani community -gave rise to some speculation that
 these incidents had been carefully coordinated and organized
 by the Government. The Chinese and French communities also
 have experienced some resentment from the Malagasy, mainly
 because of their success in commerce.
 Women have traditionally played a prominent role in the
 business and economic life of the country, with many of them
 managing or owning business concerns or filling management
 positions in state industries. Education at all levels is
 open to women. However, women in rural areas and among the
 urban poor face a greater degree of hardship. In addition to
 the responsibilities associated with raising a family, the
 realities of subsistence agriculture force these women to
 engage in farm labor and related activities.
 
 
 200
 M MADAGASCAR
 While women are not discriminated against in the workplace,
 discrimination does exist in marriage and property rights. In
 the case of divorce or the death of the husband, the wife
 inherits only one-third of their joint wealth. On the other
 hand, the wife receives a pension if her husband dies, but the
 reverse is not true. Women's rights groups do not exist, but
 groups of professional women and women within the political
 parties are working to change these aspects of family law. On
 December 12, 1988, Madagascar became a signatory of the U.N.
 Charter on Eliminating Discrimination Towards Women.
 According to various sources, including magistrates,
 journalists, and women doctors, violence against women, such
 as wife beating, is not widespread, and neither the Government
 nor party womens' organizations have addressed this issue
 specifically. The society frowns on marital confrontation.
 Married couples generally prefer to avoid divorce and, if
 necessary, to live separate lives under one roof. In very few
 divorce cases is there an allegation of physical abuse that
 could be construed as wife beating. In the rare cases where
 this condition is detected, police and legal authorities do
 intervene. However, there is no law dealing specifically with
 violence against women. Female circumcision is not practiced
 in Madagascar.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Malagasy have the right to establish and join labor
 unions. However, the labor force of 4.9 million is mostly
 agrarian (85 percent), and unionized labor accounts for less
 than 5 percent of the total. Seven of the national labor
 organizations in existence are affiliated with the eight
 political parties within the National Front for the Defense of
 the Revolution. Two independent unions in 1979 signed a
 protocol of agreement with the dominant political union
 belonging to the President's party, pledging support for the
 Malagasy "Socialist Revolution." The primary focus of the
 unions is party politics, and they are usually active only
 during election campaigns. Overall, labor unions play an
 insignificant role in national life.
 Public servants may not form independent trade unions but may
 join "Malagasy Revolutionary Organizations" (ORM's) under the
 supervision of the Government. Under the Charter of Socialist
 Undertakings of 1978 workers' committees are established, but
 preferential access to these is extended to the members of
 trade unions belonging to one of the ORM's of the National
 Front for the Defense of the Revolution. In 1989 the
 Committee of Experts of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) asked the Government to take appropriate measures to
 ensure that public servants can establish organizations
 without prior authorization or other restrictions. It also
 asked the Government to introduce legislation explicitly
 guaranteeing the trade union rights of seafarers.
 Workers have the right to strike, but in reality, strikes in
 Madagascar are a rarity because of the severe unemployment
 problem and the politicization of the labor federations.
 However, there are occasional wildcat strikes. In these, the
 Government generally sides with management for the restoration
 of order. The Labor Code, which covers all workers except
 civil servants and merchant marine qmployees, prescribes an
 arbitration procedure which must be followed in
 
 
 201
 MADAGASCAR
 labor/management disputes. Should this procedure not lead to
 a settlement, workers individually, or as represented by a
 union, may call a strike.
 In 1989 the SECES, a labor union comprised of university
 professors and researchers, went on a major strike over its
 dissatisfaction with general working conditions at the
 nation's six universities. It used the withholding of
 examination results from students as leverage in its dealings
 with Ministry of Higher Education officials. On August 26, a
 communique issued by the SECES explained that the freeze on
 examination results had been lifted because some of its
 demands had been met.
 Several of the unions are members of the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions or of the World Confederation
 of Labor. One union, the Confederation of Malagasy Workers,
 has links with the International Confederatibn of Free Trade
 Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Union activity is governed by the Malagasy Labor Code of May
 18, 1975, which guarantees free unions and the right to
 bargain collectively. Article 4 of the Labor Code formally
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. According to Article 132 of the Labor
 Code, collective bargaining may be undertaken between
 management and labor at either party's behest. When there is
 failure to reach agreement, the Ministry of Labor convenes a
 nonconciliation committee which attempts to resolve
 differences. If this process fails, the committee refers the
 matter to the chairman of the First Circuit Court for final
 arbitration.
 There are no export processing zones in Madagascar, although
 legislation providing for such zones was approved by the
 National Popular Assembly at the end of 1989.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is explicitly prohibited by Article 2 of the
 Malagasy Labor Code. There is no forced or compulsory labor
 in Madagascar within the definition set forth by the ILO.
 Madagascar is a signatory to ILO Convention 29 prohibiting
 forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Malagasy Labor Code describes a child as any person,
 regardless of gender, under the age of 18. The minimum age
 for employment is 14, but the use of child labor is prohibited
 in those areas where there is apparent and imminent danger.
 The Government enforces these child labor laws in the small
 wage sector through the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and
 Social Law. However, in the large subsistence agricultural
 sector many young children work with their parents on family
 farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in the urban areas
 many children earn a living as parking attendants, newspaper
 vendors, etc.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Malagasy Labor Code and its enforcing legislation describe
 the working conditions for employees. Malagasy law
 
 
 202
 MADAGASCAR
 distinguishes between agricultural and nonagricultural work.
 There is a 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service
 industries. There are also provisions for holiday pay, sick
 and maternity leave, and insurance. There are several minimum
 wage rates in Madagascar according to categories of work. The
 lowest (for unskilled workers) is approximately $20 per month
 and is inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living.
 Accordingly, most workers must supplement their incomes
 through subsistence agriculture or reliance on the extended
 family structure.
 The Labor Code has rules concerning building safety, machinery
 and moving engines, operational safety, and sanitation
 standards. It appears that, in practice, the rules and
 regulations of the Code are adhered to by employers and are
 enforced by the authorities. Labor inspectors from the
 Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Law carry out
 regular visits to industrial work sites. Violations of
 safety, sanitary, operational, and other Work Code laws are
 the subject of reports by these inspectors. If the violations
 are not remedied within a specified time frame, the violators
 are legally charged and subject to various penalties.
 
 
 203
 Virtually every aspect of Malawi's first 25 years of
 independence--political, economic, and social--has been
 dominated by Dr. H. Kamuzu-Banda, who led the country to
 independence in 1964 and was proclaimed "Life President' in
 1970. The sole legal party isthe Malawi Congress Party
 (MCP), to whose Central Committee the Cabinet and Parliament
 are subordinate. Only candidates selected by the MCP and
 approved by the President are-allowed to run in parliamentary.
 elections, last heldin 1987. Constitutional amendments and
 laws passed by the Parliament mirror decisions already taken
 by the President and his close advisers.
 Military, police, and party security organs closely monitor a
 wide range of activities, particularly opposition to the
 Government.
 Malawi, a small, densely populated, landlocked country with
 few exploitable resources and a high population growth rate,
 possesses no significant mineral resources or industrial
 sector. It is heavily dependent on agriculture for export
 earnings and employment. Sound agricultural policies have
 produced a food surplus, despite an influx of 800,000 refugees
 in recent years, high transportation costs resulting from
 closure of the rail routes through Mozambique (owing primarily
 to the Mozambican civi  war), and earthquakes and floods in
 1989. Its fiscally sound policies have enabled it to qualify
 for special International Monetary Fund assfstance.
 Malawi~s human rights performance is the reverse of its
 economic achievements and its exemplary handling of one of the
 world's largest refugee feeding programs. -, In 1989 the
 observance of human rights deteriorated as a leading political
 dissident was murdered, and arbitrary detention continued to
 be used to suppress any sign of dissent. Other major abuses
 included: mistreatment of prisoners and life-threatening
 conditions in prisons; lack of fair trials; interference with
 privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of speech and press,
 assembly and association, and the right of citizens to change
 their government; and serious discrimination against
 northerners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Some human rights organizations claim that a journalist named
 Osborne Mkandawire died in prison in Novembar 1988. After
 extensive research, the U.S. Embassy was unable.to identify
 such a person, although a retired journalist named Mkandawire
 did die of natural causes in his nativp village. In another
 incident, Fred'Sikwese, a Ministry of External Affairs
 officer, was detained in February 1989, reportedly for
 espionage or embezzlement. He died the following month.
 Amnesty International (AI) alleges torture. Government
 sources claim natural causes but denied the family access to
 Sikwese's body.
