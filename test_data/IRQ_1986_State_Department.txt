 IRAQ
 Iraq is governed by the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) of
 Iraq through a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) which has
 both executive and legislative authority under the provisional
 Constitution of 1968. Saddam Hussein holds decisive power as
 President of the Republic, Chairman of the Council, and
 Secretary General of the Regional Command of the ABSP.
 Iraq contains many disparate groups, most notably Shi'a and
 Sunni Arab Muslims, Kurds, Turcomans, and various Christian
 sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans.
 In 1986 the war with Iran continued into its seventh year.
 Iran continues to reject Iraqi and international calls for a
 cease-fire. Tight domestic controls imposed by the Iraqi
 regime in the name of national security remain in effect,
 including a decree which prescribes the death penalty for
 anyone who damages the country's military, political, or
 economic position. Wartime travel restrictions, which prevent
 most Iraqis from departing the country, also remain in force.
 Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) in Iraq are estimated at
 approximately 12,000. Most are believed to be registered with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which
 visits the camps.
 The Government exerts a high level of control over the economy,
 which is dominated by the petroleum sector. The State owns all
 major industries, including petroleum and banking. However,
 the small private sector is important in some industries. The
 regime has been expanding the role of the private sector in
 the last few years, particularly in agriculture.
 The Ba'ath Party's ideological commitment to increased social,
 labor, and educational opportunities for women and to the
 protection of religious minorities continues to be translated
 into practical action. Iraq has continued to state its
 opposition to terrorism and has said that its support for the
 Palestinian cause does not signify that it condones terrorism.
 Political and individual rights are sharply limited in Iraq.
 The news media are subject to censorship. Antiregime activity
 is dealt with harshly, often by extralegal means employed by a
 large and feared internal security police force and the
 intelligence services.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Execution has been an established method for dealing with
 perceived political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa Party
 (fundamentalist Shi'a Muslim) and the Communist Party. In
 April 1986 Iraq confirmed to Amnesty International the
 execution of three persons: one, 17 years old, was a member
 of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the other two were
 members of the Kurdistan Socialist Party-Iraq. They were
 charged with committing acts of sabotage. There are confirmed
 reports of the execution without trial of three members of the
 Iraqi Assyrian community for nationalist political activity.
 Members of the political elite have also been executed as a
 result of factional conflict, although no such executions are
 
 
 1167
 IRAQ
 known to have occurred since 1982.
 In October 1986 the Iraqi Government announced that a high-
 ranking official in the Oil Ministry and six other people had
 been executed for corruption.
 In 1985 and 1986, the military conducted aerial attacks on
 Kurdish villages suspected of supporting Iranian military
 incursions into Iraq or harboring antigovernment guerrillas,
 resulting in unknown numbers of casualties. From time to time
 there have been reports of executions of military deserters.
 In the wake of Iran's February 1986 offensive around Faw, Iran
 renewed charges that Iraq used chemical weapons, allegations
 denied by Iraq. The State Department has repeatedly condemned
 Iraq's use of chemical weapons. Iraq is a party to the 1925
 Geneva Protocol banning use, but not production, of lethal and
 incapacitating chemical weapons. There are indications that
 Iraq continues to stockpile lethal agents.
 Iraq withdrew its support in 1983 from the Black June
 Organization led by Sabri Al-Banna, or "Abu Nidal." Iraq
 officially forswears terrorism, and the Iraqis themselves in
 recent years have been the victims of several terrorist acts
 supported by Syria and Iran.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that some suspects, particularly
 those detained by the security police for subversion, disappear
 following detention. It is difficult in such cases to
 ascertain whether the suspect was executed or died while
 incarcerated. In March 1986, Amnesty International published
 the names of 85 people who disappeared and are reported to
 have been executed between January 1985 and February 1986.
 Antigovernment Kurds in Northern Iraq occasionally kidnap
 foreign workers and businessmen. Ransom demands have included
 demands for money, a halt to Western economic cooperation with
 Iraq, and support for the release of prisoners in Iraq.
 Victims generally have been released following negotiations
 involving overseas Kurdish representatives, the victims'
 employers, and Iraqi security organizations.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes stiff
 punishment for it, and the Government rejects charges that it
 practices torture. Nevertheless, reliable reports make clear
 that both physical and psychological torture are used by the
 authorities, especially the security police. Given the rigid
 chain of command within the Government and security services,
 it is unlikely that torture could be practiced without the
 authorization of senior officials.
 According to former prisoners, persons detained by the security
 police for political or security-related matters are frequently
 tortured and mistreated. Treatment is reported to be worst
 immediately following arrest and during the period of
 interrogation and investigation, which can last for months.
 Torture and brutal treatment are not limited to political
 cases. Security-related offenses include such routine
 criminal matters as currency violations.
 
 
 1168
 IRAQ
 The security forces' methods of torture, often to extract
 confessions or information about the suspect and his
 colleagues, reportedly include beatings with fists and rubber
 truncheons, electrical shocks to the genitals and other parts
 of the body, and the extraction of fingernails and toenails.
 There were reports in March 1986 of ethnic-Assyrian Iraqi
 soldiers being tortured and executed for desertion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and legal code guarantee the rights of
 citizens and place checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search. These guarantees
 are generally respected in criminal cases but have little
 weight in political or national security cases. Security
 police not only make arbitrary arrests but also secretly
 detain suspects, whose fate sometimes has become known only
 after execution. -Charges have included espionage, treason,
 and conspiracy against Iraq or the party and revolution, often
 in collaboration with unnamed foreign foes.
 In the past, Iraq expelled large numbers of Iranians and
 Iraqis of supposed Iranian descent. These deportations have
 ceased; however, those remaining often live under the fear of
 deportation or incarceration.
 Iranian military deserters and civilians who fled to Iraq
 during the war have been detained and sometimes mistreated.
 Most of these people reportedly came to Iraq, after long and
 hazardous journeys through Kurdistan, in response to Iraqi
 propaganda promising good treatment and easy access to third
 countries. In response to the decrease in such Iraqi
 propaganda, the numbers of new arrivals at refugee camps have
 lessened. There have been frequent allegations that some have
 been shot or beaten with rubber hoses and metal cables. Some
 Iranian refugees reportedly have been coerced to collaborate
 with Iraqi propaganda despite the danger to family members in
 Iran. When, after many months, these emigres are designated
 "political refugees," their treatment improves and outside
 organizations gain access to them.
 In recent years Amnesty International has reported the
 imprisonment or detention of large numbers of Kurds. Many
 have been removed to resettlement camps. Further, Amnesty
 International alleged in March 1986 that Iraqi authorities
 arrested approximately 300 children in the Kurdish town of
 Sulaimaniya in late 1985 in retaliation for their parents'
 antigovernment activities or to force their cooperation with
 the central authorities.
 The Da'wa Party, a violent dissident Shi'ite Group, is still
 proscribed, and its members are subject to incarceration and
 execution, as are members of other parties believed to be
 cooperating with Iran.
 There is no indication that Iraq uses forced labor. Apart
 from the expulsion of thousands of residents of Iranian
 descent in 1980 and earlier, exile is not resorted to as a
 means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal, and religious courts are open.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel. A lawyer is provided if a
 
 
 1169
 IRAQ
 defendant cannot afford one. Charges and evidence are
 available for review. Appellate courts hear cases not under
 the jurisdiction of the revolutionary courts. The
 revolutionary courts, which usually hold closed trials, deal
 with espionage, treason, smuggling, and drug trafficking. The
 right of defense in such courts reportedly is severely
 restricted.
 The "special courts" constituted by the Revolutionary Command
 Council for specific incidents, such as the reported conspiracy
 against the regime in 1979, are also closed. These special
 tribunals are apparently exempt from constitutional safeguards
 of defendants' rights. The right of defense is proscribed;
 defendants are held incommunicado, and confessions extracted
 by torture are used against defendants. Appeals can be taken
 only to the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council.
 However, the availability of this appeal may be questioned,
 since there are reports that executions take place shortly
 after trial.
 Political dissidence in Iraq is taken by the authorities to
 encompass a wide range of activities and, in an environment
 where no public acknowledgement is made of arrest or
 imprisonment, it is extremely difficult to gauge the number of
 political prisoners. Amnesty International received reports
 of "several hundred people" being detained for political
 reasons in 1984 and has continued to receive such reports
 through 1986.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. Warrants are not
 required for the arrest of security suspects. Although most
 arrests occur outside the home, there have been reports of
 forced entry and arrest by the security police, particularly
 of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa Party.
 In late 1985, Iraqi government forces reportedly conducted
 large-scale searches of homes in at least one city in a
 predominantly Kurdish area and detained a number of people.
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of
 telephones, which many Iraqis believe to be a common
 practice. Likewise, all mail is believed subject to review by
 censors. Government security services and the Ba'ath Party
 are generally assumed to maintain pervasive networks of
 informers.
 Membership in the ruling Ba'ath Party is viewed as a key to
 advancement inside and outside the Government. Although the
 Ba'ath is an elitist party, recruitment can be aggressive.
 Some emigrants have claimed that they joined the party to
 avoid beatings or harassment or to enhance career prospects.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government views political dissent as a security threat,
 
 
 1170
 IRAQ
 and controls exercise of the freedoms of speech, press, and
 assembly. The Constitution prohibits "any act aimed at
 undermining the national unity of the people, provoking
 racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or violating gains
 and achievements of the country." Nonetheless, the use of
 minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish, an official
 language, is used in schools and media in Kurdish areas.
 The Government owns and operates the press, radio, and
 television. The media do not criticize the Government and
 news reporting is strongly biased. Opposition viewpoints are
 not heard. Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and Western
 newspapers are not sold. Foreign visitors' newspapers,
 magazines, and cassettes can be confiscated at the airport.
 To control the dissemination of political leaflets,
 typewriters and photocopying machines must be registered.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are organized only under the auspices of the
 Government or Ba'ath Party. Association for nonreligious
 purposes and demonstrations without government approval have
 met severe repression. Professional organizations are subject
 to control by the Ba'ath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 Union workers do not represent a significant part of the total
 work force, which is comprised mostly of agricultural workers,
 shopkeepers, and government employees. Industrial workers,
 the most unionized, are only a small portion of the work force.
 Workers are organized in the Federation of Trade Unions under
 the control of the Ba'ath Party Central Labor Bureau. Unions
 may operate only under officially approved guidelines.
 Elections are held for union executive councils, which in turn
 select officers from among the council membership. Nominees
 are mainly party members. The right to bargain collectively
 is not recognized. Workers legally have the right to strike
 after providing notice to the Labor Ministry, but no strikes
 have been reported since 1968. The unions initiate
 grievances, but a primary union function is to indoctrinate
 members with Ba'athist ideology. Union membership is a
 prerequisite for employment in some sectors.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. Many
 non-Muslims, principally Jews and Christians, left Iraq under
 previous regimes. Since its rise to power in 1968, the
 Ba'athist Government has enforced tolerance of religious
 diversity, seeking to submerge religious differences in the
 promotion of secular nationalism.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and Religious
 Affairs the authority to promulgate laws and regulations
 governing places of worship, appointment of clergy, religious
 literature, and participation in religious councils and
 meetings. However, while the Government has assumed much
 greater authority in Islamic religious affairs since 1981, the
 law has not been invoked against Iraq's Christian sects.
 Religious leaders operate under close government supervision.
 Muslim religious leaders are considered government employees
 and receive their salaries through the Government. The
 Government administers the principal Muslim shrines and
 mosques and has increased allotments to refurbish and maintain
 them in an apparent attempt to win support from the devout.
 
 
 1171
 IRAQ
 Over 500,000 Christians constitute nearly 4 percent of the
 population. Their freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 churches have been constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. The Jewish community is believed to have
 decreased from 150,000 following World War II to about 400.
 It was severely persecuted in the past, but there is no
 evidence of recent persecution. The last known synagogue in
 Baghdad is reportedly still functioning.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off-limits. Civilian travel in the war zone
 is restricted. Curfews are in effect where Kurdish insurgents
 have been active. There are police checkpoints on highways
 and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and foreigners travel
 freely in nonrestricted areas. Foreign diplomats must obtain
 Foreign Ministry permits for travel outside of Baghdad, which
 are usually granted when requested sufficiently in advance.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who have remained in the
 country for more than 2 weeks must obtain exit permission.
 Travel has been even further limited since September 1986 when
 severe restrictions on currency exchange were imposed. Because
 of the war's drain on the economy, permission to travel abroad
 is restricted to a few categories of Iraqis, including
 officials, government-approved students, and persons needing
 medical treatment. (While permission for medical treatment
 abroad may be granted, permission to transfer hard currency
 abroad to pay for it usually is not.) The Iraqi Government
 seeks to limit the countries an Iraqi traveler may visit and,
 should the traveler visit a nonauthorized country, a small
 fine may be levied upon his return. Iraqis who have residences
 abroad may depart the country provided they originally had left
 before the war began. In general, a married woman must have
 the permission of her husband to travel abroad. The Government
 can require a prospective traveler to post a substantial bond
 to assure return. According to officials of the Higher
 Education Ministry, although Iraqi students abroad should get
 permission before accepting foreign scholarships or grants,
 they would not be punished upon return to Iraq for failure to
 have done so. If students on government scholarships abroad
 do not return, their families must repay the costs of the
 education.
 There is no specific ban on emigration nor special restrictions
 for members of minority groups; however, emigration is
 discouraged. Prospective emigrants have had travel permission
 delayed and have been harassed. Many emigrants leave behind
 substantial property because of the difficulty of exporting
 assets. Currency exchange violations are considered national
 security offenses, and penalties can be severe.
 Alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for
 at least 3 years are required to become naturalized or leave
 Iraq. Many people, including several Americans, have thus
 
 
 1172
 IRAQ
 been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and are therefore
 subject to the present travel restrictions. In March 1984, a
 resolution by the Revolutionary Command Council reduced the
 residency period before naturalization to 1 year for the
 spouses of Iraqis employed at government offices. The Iraqi
 spouse faces penalties for noncompliance, including loss of
 job, a fine of approximately $10,000, and repayment of the
 costs of education.
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special
 programs to encourage the repatriation of qualified
 professionals. Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a document
 permitting them to enter and exit Iraq without a visa. Former
 Iraqis can more easily obtain visitors' visas than other
 aliens, who generally must have an official sponsor.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin are permitted to return,
 including many individuals who were admitted to other countries
 as refugees. A number of such people, especially Assyrian
 Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They are free
 to come and go, within the limits of the present travel
 restrictions, since they are not considered to have violated
 Iraqi laws. However, those who emigrated only after the
 beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, including several U.S.
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart Iraq
 after returning.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The elitist Ba'ath Party, dominated by the President and the
 Party's Regional Command, rules Iraq. The Party reportedly
 has some 1.5 million adherents, representing about 10 percent
 of the population. However, only some 50,000 "active" or full
 members, less than 0.33 percent of the population, participate
 influentially in party activities. There are two other legal
 political parties, both Kurdish. They and the Ba'ath Party
 constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National Front,
 essentially a vehicle of support for the Government. The two
 non-Ba'ath parties carry on only limited activity. Members of
 the military or security services may engage in political
 activities only within the Ba'ath Party. Association with the
 party is not required for appointment to senior government
 positions or military ranks or election to the National
 Assembly, but normally is necessary to attain political
 influence. Opposition groups, including various Kurdish
 groups and splinter parties, are severely repressed. The
 Communist Party was removed from the National Front and
 declared illegal in 1979. In 1982 the Government amnestied
 Iraqi Communists both in Iraq and abroad, but the number
 released is unknown.
 The outlawed, Iranian-supported Da'wa (Islamic Call) Party has
 been a major target of persecution. It has claimed violent
 acts against the Government in Iraq and abroad, and was
 implicated in the December 1983 truck bombing of the U.S.
 Embassy and other U.S., French, and Kuwaiti targets in Kuwait.
 General elections were last held for the 250-seat National
 Assembly in 1984. The Government screened all the candidates
 for consonance with Ba'ath party ideology. Though in theory
 possessing a wide range of official duties, the Assembly
 exercises little real authority. Local elections were held in
 the Kurdish autonomous region in August 1986.
 
 
 1173
 IRAQ
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iraq denies charges that it violates human rights. The
 Government acknowledges Amnesty International's accusations
 and in a letter to Amnesty International in July 1985
 confirmed approximately two-thirds of the executions Amnesty
 International said took place in February and March 1985. The
 Iraqi Government contends, however, that these were not
 political executions but executions carried out for crimes
 against national security. In the past it has offered to
 investigate allegations of torture if the victims, interviewed
 outside Iraq, returned. None is known to have done so.
 There is no government office or official charged with
 investigating human rights and coordinating with other
 governments and international organizations on human rights.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation
 based in Iraq has made regular visits to Iranian prisoners of
 war (POWs) since 1980 and has assisted in Iraq's unilateral
 repatriation of some of them. Iraq has received the ICRC
 President and other delegates several times to discuss the
 treatment of POWs and the protection of civilians in the
 Iran-Iraq war. Reports still circulate of sporadic outbursts
 of violence against POWs in the camps. Unlike in previous
 years, the ICRC, in its most recent annual report published in
 October 1986, no longer states that its representatives have
 been denied access to some prisoners. The Iraqis apparently
 on occasion retard ICRC efforts to register new POWs as a
 means of pressuring Iran to permit access to and registration
 of Iraqi POWs.
 Since February 1984, Iraq has cooperated with the ICRC in
 efforts to resettle Iranian civilian refugees in third
 countries. A total of 350 such refugees had departed Iraq or
 were accepted as refugees by other countries as of November
 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Ba'ath Party has been committed to the equality of the
 sexes, and a series of laws since it came to power in 1968 has
 steadily improved the status of women. Such laws have
 protected women from exploitation in the workplace; granted
 subsidized maternity leave; permitted women to join the
 regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; and equalized
 women's rights on divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage,
 and election to the National Assembly. In the 1970's, the
 Government imposed legal penalties on families that opposed
 sending their women to literacy schools, and on men who were
 seen harassing women.
 The percentage of female students among students in elementary
 schools climbed from 37.4 percent in 1977-78 to 46.4 percent
 in 1982-3. Secondary school female enrollment went from 29.2
 to 34.5 percent in the same period. About 32 percent of the
 students at universities and technical institutes are female.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. The war has
 accelerated the Government's drive to elevate the status of
 women, and some Iraqis believe that it has permanently broken
 
 
 1174
 IRAQ
 cultural barriers to the acceptance of women in traditional
 male roles. Women have become increasingly visible as
 architects, construction engineers, oil engineers, air traffic
 controllers, factory and farm managers, and Air Force pilots.
 Some 40,000 women reportedly were volunteers in the Popular
 Army in 1982.
 The General Federation of Iraqi Women (GFIW) was established
 in 1969, the regime's first year in power, to promote the
 Government's policies towards women. Membership in the GFIW
 does not require affiliation with the Ba'ath Party. The GFIW
 organizes conferences on women's issues, establishes training
 courses for women, implements programs to eradicate illiteracy,
 undertakes civilian war relief activities, and administers
 nurseries. It drew up a 4-year plan (1983-86) to encourage
 women to work outside the home and has opened four employment
 offices in Baghdad for women graduates.
 The Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 historically have been eccnomically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged. The Government has a declared policy to raise
 their living standards and equalize opportunities for economic
 and professional advancement. In recent years, the Government
 and party have promoted Shi'a into prominent positions, and
 the economic and social status of the Shi'a has improved
 markedly. Nevertheless, the Government maintains a close
 watch against Iranian attempts to exploit dissatisfaction
 among Iraqi Shi'a, who share the same branch of Islam
 prevalent in Iran.
 Although Christians sometimes allege discrimination in
 education and jobs, adherence to their religion has not
 prevented many from obtaining wealth and professional
 advancement. The Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister,
 a Chaldean Christian, has represented Iraq at meetings of the
 foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic
 Conference. Other Christians hold important official and
 private positions.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin bear special
 identification, often precluding desirable employment or
 impeding advancement. Many "Iranian" families have been in
 Iraq for generations. Some say their forebears were not from
 Iran but claimed Iranian nationality to evade Ottoman military
 conscription.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Children are frequently encouraged to work as necessary to
 support the family, an acceptable social practice in the
 Middle East. The employment of children is forbidden in
 state-run enterprises or other than small-scale family
 enterprises. The urban work week is 6 days a week, 6 to 7
 hours a day for government workers; on Friday all but private
 vendors are closed. Wages are set by the Government for
 public secto. workers (i.e., the bulk of the employed) and do
 not adhere to any fixed per hour or per day rate; salaries are
 generally deemed low but adequate. Wages in the small private
 sector are set solely by supply and demand. Occupational
 safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises and
 inspectors make irregular visits to private establishments;
 enforcement varies widely.
