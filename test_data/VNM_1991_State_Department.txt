 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) remains a Communist
 one-party state ruled by the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP)
 through a 13-member Politburo and a Communist Party Central
 Committee nominally elected by a party congress held, in recent
 times, about every 5 years. The Seventh Party Congress in June
 elected 146 members to the'Central Committee. Government
 policies, carried out under the Council of Ministers, reflect
 guidelines-if not specific directives--laid down by the
 Politburo. More southerners were selected for key positions in
 the party and Government in an apparent effort to mitigate
 tension resulting from historically derived cultural and
 political differences between southern Vietnamese and a
 predominantly northern leadership.
 The security apparatus consists of civil and military elements
 under the control of the Government and the VCP. Police and
 other security personnel continue to be responsible for
 numerous human rights abuses, including severe physical
 mistreatment of detainees and prisoners, either while
 undergoing interrogation or while confined in the penal system.
 The ecbnomy, predominantly agricultural, was undermined by
 years of doctrinaire socialism and isolation. Increasing
 efforts to liberalize trade and effect other reforms have led
 to a resurgence in rice production and commercial activity but
 have not been able to compensate for recent sharp cutbacks in
 Soviet assistance or to restore A decaying infrastructure.
 The Government's campaign against dissenters, begun in the
 spring of 1990, continued throughout 1991, particularly in the
 period leading to the party congress at the end of June. As
 part of a protracted security crackdown, intellectuals, clergy,
 journalists, and some foreigners were arrested and detained.
 Arbitrary detentions, torture, and mistreatment of detainees
 continued. Restrictions also continued on access to persons in
 reeducation camps by outside independent observers, although in
 December it was reported that the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) would be allowed to visit the reeducation
 camps. Other human rights problems included severe
 restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly,
 association, movement, worker rights, and the right of citizens
 to change their government. In addition, the Government
 continued a program that over the years has resettled hundreds
 of thousands of people--some forcibly--into "New Economic
 Zones" (NEZ's). On the other hand, it remains easier to travel
 abroad and inside the country than was the case a few years
 ago. People talk much more freely with foreigners, and there
 is an increasing separation between the party and the State.
 Finally, some prominent political prisoners and some detainees
 who had been in reeducation camps since 1975 were released in
 the latter part of 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Statistics on the number of deaths of political prisoners are
 not available. In 1991 there were no known executions of
 political prisoners or politically motivated extrajudicial
 killings. According to credible reports, however, prisoners
 have in the past died of exhaustion, physical abuse,
 
 
 1027
 VIETNAM
 malnutrition, lack of medical care, and other effects of
 conditions in prisons and reeducation camps.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no documented incidents of political abductions by
 government security organizations or by antigovernment forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the law prohibits physical abuse and recently released
 reeducation camp detainees report that camp conditions have
 been relaxed since 1989, there continue to be credible,
 consistent reports from refugees and asylum seekers about
 police brutality against suspects undergoing investigation and
 about the severity of conditions for those confined in
 prisons. These reports indicate that beatings or ill-treatment
 are still a feature of police investigations and a means of
 punishment in prisons, despite legal safeguards.
 Thai fishermen released from Vietnamese prisons during the year
 testified that they suffered from severe malnutrition and
 reported that they had to eat rats and snakes to survive. They
 said punishment included isolation in a dark cell, beating, and
 withholding of food. One Vietnamese prisoner confined with the
 Thai was reportedly starved to death after trying to escape.
 In general, detainees face substandard nutrition, poor or
 nonexistent medical care, and severe and often arbitrary
 punishment for minor infractions of camp rules.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Throughout 1991, particularly in the period prior to the Party
 Congress in late June, Vietnam continued arbitrarily to arrest
 and imprison people in contravention of its own Constitution.
 The 1989 Criminal Procedure Code provides for various rights
 for detainees: time limits on pretrial detention, the right of
 a lawyer to be present during interrogation, prohibitions on
 nighttime interrogations; the right of the accused to be
 informed of charges against him or her; a ban on coercion or
 corporal punishment; and the presumption of innocence.
 Amendments to the Code in 1989 and 1990 provide further
 safeguards, stipulating periods of detention that may be
 imposed by various authorities and providing for approvalof
 detention by a monitoring body called the People's Organ of
 Control.
 These safeguards are frequently ignored by the authorities.
 Credible reports indicate that detainees continue to be held
 for indefinite periods without formal charges, with authorities
 using old administrative procedures in contravention of the new
 legislation. The retention of these administrative procedures
 and recourse to them instead of to the newer legislation appear
 to be a deliberate government policy.
 During 1991 the Government continued its campaign against
 suspected opponents of the regime. Specifically, it continued
 its efforts to implement Party Directive 135, promulgated in
 August 1990, which called for the arrest of those who incite
 opposition'to the Government and advocate political pluralism.
 At least several foreigners were arrested or deported for
 associating with Vietnamese deemed politically untrustworthy.
 Targets of Directive 135 appear to include politically active
 
 
 1028
 VIETNAM
 intellectuals, clergy, journalists, artists, and student
 leaders.
 Legislation designed ostensibly to prevent inordinate delay in
 pressing charges is often, if not routinely, ignored. For
 example, 3 Vietnamese (Doan Thanh Liem, Do Ngoc Liem, Nguyen
 Van Tan) listed in last years report among persons arrested
 for nonviolent political activity during 1990, were detained
 for over a year before being charged. They had been arrested
 in early 1990 in connection with the arrest of an American
 businessman detained for investigation of alleged "spying"
 activities. Credible reports indicate that Catholic priests
 Chan Tin and Nguyen Ngoc Lan, detainees mentioned in last
 year's report, remain under house arrest and internal exile.
 The charges against the two priests included "the crime of
 anti-Socialist propaganda."
 Credible reports also indicate Le Van Tien, 70 years old and
 with a serious heart condition, was arrested, along with a
 number of associates, in Ho Chi Minh City on December 20,
 1990. This occurred on the eve of his legal emigration to the
 United States, after having just been released from 13 years'
 detention in labor camps. Tien was secretly charged with
 maintaining overseas contacts for the purpose of conducting
 espionage for the United States. In late 1991 the human rights
 activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que was sentenced to 20 years'
 imprisonment, and his associate Nguyen Van Thuon was given a
 10-year sentence.
 Duong Thu Huong, a well-known author, was arrested in Hanoi on
 April 14 on charges of sending abroad documents detrimental to
 state security. On March 30 the police also arrested a friend
 of Huong's, an American citizen of Vietnamese origin, charged
 with bringing in and attempting to take out documents
 detrimental to state security. The latter was released and
 expelled on May 31, and Huong was released in late November.
 Several other prominent prisoners of conscience, including the
 long-held poet Nguyen Chi Thien and novelist Doan Quoc Sy, were
 reportedly released in late 1991. After 1 1/2 years of no
 progress in efforts to obtain their release, 15 former South
 Vietnamese officials or officers were reported released in
 September; it is estimated that a little over 100 are still
 detained in reeducation centers without charge or trial since
 1975. In December Vietnam announced it would release all of
 these reeducation center detainess in the next several months.
 A credible report on Vietnam mentioned that there are about 70
 political prisoners in addition to the detainees left from the
 1975 era. However, no official statistics are available for
 the number of detainees held for antigovernment activities.
 Moreover, persons can be detained without charges being filed,
 and trials and sentences are sometimes secret.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control, although
 over the years the Government has resettled hundreds of
 thousands of people--some forcibly--to NEZ's (see Section 1.f.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Vietnamese court system consists of local people's courts,
 military tribunals, and the Supreme Court. The latter may
 review cases from either of the lower courts. Either the
 National Assembly or Council has the authority to establish
 special tribunals, which may be superior to the Supreme Court.
 In addition, local mass organizations are empowered to deal
 
 
 1029
 VIETNAM
 with minor breaches of law or disputes. Although technically
 judges in all regular courts are elected, candidates are
 selected by the party organization. Article 131 of the
 Constitution provides for the "independence" of judges and
 jurors. However, this is negated at all levels by an electoral
 system that is closely controlled by the VCP and a selection
 process that puts a premium on political reliability.
 The Penal Code consists of the Criminal Code and a Criminal
 Procedures'Code which was amended in 1990. Vietnam has a
 long-established body of family law, but lacks civil law codes.
 There is virtually no evidence that legislative improvements
 made in 1990 have been implemented. The shortage of competent
 publie'defenders alone would probably preclude most defendants
 from receiving legal assistance while they are being
 investigated and tried. Public defenders are provided at state
 expense, but during 1991 there were'no indications that any
 measures had been undertaken to upgrade their poor quality.
 Torture and coercion to elicit confessions make fair trials
 virtually impossible, and secret trials are still being held
 for some-political prisoners.
 During the past few years, reeducation sentences have been
 frequently imposed by administrative procedure without benefit
 of due process or judicial review. In addition, such sentences
 are imposed on persons sentenced for peaceful expression of
 their views. The SRV criminalizes certain forms of peaceful
 expression, including for example, "anti-Socialist propaganda."
 Over the years people have been sentenced to long prison terms
 for such "crimes."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1991 the Government continued to operate a nationwide system
 of surveillance and control through household registration and
 party-appointed block wardens who use informants'to keep track
 of individual activities. The system appears to be somewhat
 less intrusive in the south. In general, reports suggest that
 the system is unevenly implemented throughout the country and
 that local caprice is a significant factor. In urban areas, in
 both. north and south, many people enter into casual,
 nonpolitical relationships with foreigners and even invite
 foreign guests into their homes. Some Vietnamese are quite
 outspoken in criticism of their political and economic
 situation. While such events may come under surveillance and
 the Vietnamese host may be questioned later by the public
 security police, unless antiregime activity is suspected, they
 appear to cause no problem. Urban dwellers appear to be
 increasingly relaxed about sending mail overseas.
 It appears that the Government is combining tightened
 surveillance designed in part to intimidate potential critics
 with some.relaxation vis-a-vis the general population.
 Therefore, although censorship of mail and the confiscation of
 packages continued throughout 1991, it appears to have been on
 a quite selective basis.
 The party pressures people to belong to one or more mass
 organizations, which exist for villages., city districts,
 school, work (trade union), youth, and women. These
 organizations disseminate party propaganda, support
 party-sanctioned activities, and play a watchdog role but have
 
 
 1030
 VIETNAM
 become increasingly ineffectual. Membership in the VCP remains
 a great aid to advancement in the state sector.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, but
 in practice such freedoms are severely limited. The Government
 owns and operates broadcast media and does not permit the
 airing of opposing views, although it has broadcast reports of
 debates during National Assembly meetings. Party organs and
 the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports, and Tourism
 control all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well
 as all cultural exhibitions.
 During 1991 the party continued to tolerate (and at times
 invite) criticism concerning the performance of the party or of
 persons deemed to be corrupt or incompetent. However,
 criticism of the legitimacy of the VCP or its exclusive role is
 not tolerated. Short of clearly proscribed writing, (e.g.,
 advocacy of a multiparty system), the limits of criticism are
 not clear; some ideas may be expressed in internal party
 meetings (e.g., party plenums) and in internally circulated
 documents but not publicly.
 Other criticism may be expressed publicly within an established
 forum, such as a National Assembly proceeding broadcast over a
 Radio Hanoi radio station, but not privately to news
 correspondents. For example, the Eighth Party Plenum in March
 1990 stripped Tran Xuan Bach, a strong advocate of reform, of
 his membership in the Politburo, the Secretariat, and the
 Communist Party, ostensibly for "breaches" of "party
 discipline" rather than the substance of his remarks. Bui Tin,
 a retired colonel with many years of outstanding war service
 for Hanoi, while still a party member and Deputy Editor of the
 Nhan Dan newspaper, the Voice of the Central Committee,
 traveled to Paris and launched a strong critique of the party
 leadership and its policies. He was stripped of his party
 membership and fired from the newspaper. In contrast, Phan
 Dinh Dieu, a critic who used party channels to advocate reform,
 was allowed to travel abroad in 1991.
 The Government does not use prior censorship to control the
 media, but guidance from party watchdogs is pervasive, and
 national security legislation is sufficiently broad to
 accomplish effective self-censorship in the media. A system of
 informants also chills free speech to a considerable extent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly is restricted in law and practice.
 Persons wishing to gather in a group are required to apply for
 a permit which is issued or denied by local authorities, often
 arbitrarily. According to refugees, in some localities
 citizens must obtain permission for gatherings of over three
 people. Demonstrations are sometimes, but not usually,
 forcibly suppressed. Nongovernmental organizations are
 permitted, but they may meet only for approved and narrowly
 defined objectives. Opposition political parties or
 organizations are not permitted.
 
 
 1031
 
 VIETNAM
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the dominant religion in the country. According to
 some estimates nearly three-fourths of the population of 66
 million are Buddhists. The Government has claimed, however,
 that only 6 million Vietnamese are practicing Buddhists. The
 Vatican believes that some 6 million Vietnamese are Catholic.
 A much smaller number are Protestant.
 Adherence to a religion is not permitted for party members.
 During the past few years, visitors to Vietnam have reported
 that attendance at religious services seemed to be growing.
 These impressions, however, are derived from large urban
 centers. While restrictions on religious organizations are
 heavy, they vary widely by locality. This is also true of
 church attendance.
 Freedom of worship is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with the proviso that no one may use religious adherence or
 belief to violate state laws and policies. The Government,
 concerned that religious groups might become competing centers
 of influence within the society, has consistently attempted to
 divide and control religious groups, in part by establishing
 government-controlled policymaking bodies such as the Catholic
 Patriotic Association.
 The Government has attempted to prevent the growth of religious
 groups by inhibiting the publication of religious materials and
 the training of new clergy through rigid screening of all
 applicants. The Government exercises approval authority on the
 content of speeches and sermons by clergy, but reports continue
 to indicate that approval is generally granted as long as the
 content cannot be construed to challenge the-legitimacy of
 Vietnam's one-party system.
 The Government has regularly detained and arrested religious
 figures of all faiths on political grounds and restricted their
 activities. Charges of "possessing and disseminating
 counterrevolutionary propaganda," "fomenting unrest," or
 "anti-Socialist propaganda," have been- leveled against Buddhist.
 monks and nuns and Catholic, Protestant, and other religious
 leaders. A number of Catholic and Buddhist clergy arrested
 soon after the Communist victory remained in prison throughout
 1991. One priest, Le Thanh Que, was released in late 1991
 after 10 years' imprisonment.
 Almost all leading Buddhist monks from the pre-Communist
 victory period who are still living in Vietnam are either in
 prison or under house arrest. Many religious leaders remain
 under house arrest, are prohibited from conducting services,
 are denied family registration and ration cards, or are
 otherwise harassed and impeded in their attempts to conduct
 their ministries. There have been a number of recent arrests,
 including of Protestant clergy and lay Buddhist notables. For
 example, Protestant pastors Dinh Thien Tu and Tran Dinh Ai were
 arrested in 1991. Both had extensive contacts with foreign
 groups. Several Protestant pastors who had been incarcerated
 for long periods after 1975 were released in 1990 and 1991 and
 allowed to depart Vietnam.
 Vietnam has expanded its dialog with the Vatican. In late 1990
 two new bishops for Vietnam were named apparently without
 government interference, and for the first time the Government
 allowed the bishops' conference to make their obligatory 5-year
 visit to see the Pope. Also, the Government now permits.
 
 
 1032
 VIETNAM
 Catholic seminarians to be admitted to seminaries every 3 years
 instead of 6. However, the Government still places sharp
 limits on the recruitment, training, ordination, and assignment
 of new seminarians, priests, monks, and nuns. The selection of
 both students and teachers is subject to government veto, and
 there are continuing difficulties in obtaining teaching
 materials and in expanding religious training facilities. Some
 religious leaders believe that the Government's goal is to
 weaken the churches asa social force by denying them personnel
 and the ability to move their people around the country. There
 are for example, only 15 priests in Haiphong to serve over
 150,000 Catholics, and no religious women have been allowed to
 establish convents or novitiates there.
 Most property of religious institutions remains under
 government control, including temples, churches, convents,
 seminaries, former religious schools, libraries, and
 orphanages. Sharp restrictions are exercised on the use,
 repair, or extension of those facilities that are returned.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 During 1991 the Government continued the trend of recent years
 of allowing freer movement within the country for most
 citizens. Vietnamese are required to obtain permission to
 change their residence, but most reports concur that this has
 not been difficult during the past few years.
 The Government generally continued its requirement that
 foreigners travel in supervised groups rather than
 independently. Private travel abroad is authorized for
 education, tourism, medical treatment, and visits to close
 relatives. Such travel is restricted to 3 months, except
 travel for education or medical treatment. Violators of this
 limitation faced being barred from further travel for 3 to 5
 years.
 The Government continued its program of relocating people into
 sparsely populated NEZ's. During 1991 Vietnam reported serious
 failings in this policy but said the policy would continue.
 The state-run radio said that more than 2 million people have
 been moved from their homes in cities or crowded areas in the
 past 8 years, but only a quarter of them have substantially
 improved their living standards. The report admitted that many
 of the NEZ's were unfinished or short of basic facilities.
 While the Government's professed rationale for relocating
 people to NEZ's is to reduce urban crowding, exploit
 little-used land, and thereby help develop the economy, refugee
 and other reports claim that the Government also uses NEZ's as
 a means of social control.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for family
 reunification and for Amerasian Vietnamese and their close
 family members. In January 1990 the first departures of former
 reeducation camp detainees and their families began pursuant to
 a U.S.-SRV agreement in July 1989 to permit such emigration.
 By the end of September 1991, some 31,000 former reeducation
 camp inmates and their families had departed since the
 agreement was signed. The Orderly Departure Program greatly
 expanded in 1991. Total departures in all aspects of that
 program, including Amerasians, former reeducation detainees,
 and family unification cases, reached some 63,000 in fiscal
 year 1991.
 
 
 1033
 VIETNAM
 Vietnamese who emigrate are generally free to return. The
 Vietnamese Government regards overseas Vietnamese both as a
 valuable potential source of foreign exchange and expertise and
 as a potential security threat. Thus, the Government generally
 granted visas to overseas Vietnamese and encouraged them to
 visit Vietnam whether they emigrated legally or had been
 granted permanent resettlement after illegal departures from
 Vietnam. At the same time the Public Security Police keep an
 eye on them, especially those who come under suspicion as a
 result of their actions or associations. During the year some
 overseas Vietnamese were arrested, detained, and deported for
 activities deemed to be subversive, as described in Section
 1.d. above.
 In 1988 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
 increase acceptance of voluntary repatriates, provided there
 was financial assistance. This agreement included a commitment
 by Vietnam to waive prosecution and punitive measures for
 persons who departed the country illegally and who return under
 the UNHCR Voluntary Repatriation Program. Vietnam also agreed
 to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees by followup visits.
 In 1989 Vietnam joined 56 countries in the adoption of the
 Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) at the International
 Conference on Indochinese Refugees in Geneva. Under the CPA,
 Vietnam agreed to encourage volunteers to return from
 first-asylum camps in the region. By the end of 199i, over
 15,000 asylum seekers, most of them from Hong Kong, had
 returned voluntarily to Vietnam. The UNHCR's monitoring
 program has entailed visits to some 12 to 13 percent of
 returnees in the south and about 45 percent of those in the
 north, as well as visits to local authorities. The visits have
 found no instances of returnees being abused or harassed. The
 Government appears to be actively accelerating the integration
 of returnees by quick issuance of their family registration
 document and rapid enrollment of school-age children.
 Although the total rate of clandestine departures fell in 1991,
 arrivals in Hong Kong increased significantly. -During 1989,
 76,239 Vietnamese arrived in first-asylum camps in southeast
 Asia and Hong Kong. During 1990 some 31,723 Vietnamese boat
 people arrived in first-asylum camps. As of September 1991,
 the figure was 22,452. For first-asylum countries other than
 Hong Kong, total arrivals up to September 1991 were only 2,780.
 In 1991 the Government continued to arrest and try people for
 organizing illegal departures under "crimes against the state"
 statutes. Penalties range as high as 20 years in prison.
 While seeking-to discourage and inhibit clandestine departures,
 the Government continued efforts to encourage people who
 desired to depart Vietnam to apply for-orderly departure.
 Although the source of- refugees itself, Vietnam has also been
 the country of first asylum for- 15-20,000 Cambodian refugees
 (mainly ethnic Chinese) who fled to Vietnam since 1975. These
 refugees are cared for by the UNHCR in well-organized camps.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All
 authority and political power is vested in the VCP. Political
 opposition is not tolerated, and there are no other political
 parties.
 
 
 1034
 VIETNAM
 The Politburo of the Central Committee of the VCP is the
 supreme decisionmaking body in the nation. The Central
 Committee oversees day-to-day implementation of its
 directives. Debate and criticism is limited to certain aspects
 of individual, state, or party performance determined by the
 party itself. No challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party
 state is permitted, and it is off limits as a topic for debate.
 Citizens elect members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the
 chief legislative body, but still constrained by party
 guidance. The increasingly active Assembly debated a new draft
 constitution that is scheduled for ratification in 1992. The
 draft would strengthen the role of the Assembly and recognize
 economic reforms under way but would still maintain the
 supremacy of the party. Although all candidates are approved
 by party front groups, they are not required to be party
 members themselves, and multiple candidates contest some
 seats. The law provides for equal participation in politics by
 women and minority groups, but in practice minority groups and
 especially women are underrepresented.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam does not permit private human rights organizations to
 form or operate in Vietnam. Moreover, it prohibits private
 citizens from contacting international human rights
 organizations. Since 1989, however, the Vietnamese Red Cross
 has been permitted expanded cooperation with the American Red
 Cross in assisting persons seeking missing relatives, including
 those in reeducation centers.
 The Government carries on some dialog with human rights
 organizations. Some visits by human rights organizations are
 permitted, but the Government has limited their access to the
 penal system and its inmates. In December it was reported that
 the ICRC would be allowed to visit political prisoners in
 reeducation camps. During earlier visits by the ICRC and
 Amnesty International, access was very limited, and visitors
 reported being shown only model camps.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Many citizens face discrimination in employment, education, and
 social services, or are subject to relocation in NEZ's, based
 on family background or political views. Family members of
 former South Vietnamese government and military officials and
 people affiliated with anti-Communist associations or religious
 sects have been systematically discriminated against. People
 released from reeducation camps face considerable
 discrimination in education, housing, and employment, according
 to refugees. They do not regain their citizenship rights until
 I year after leaving the camps, if then. While their children
 sometimes are allowed to enter the university, they still face
 discrimination within the university system.
 Gradual assimilation and co-option appear to be the
 Government's long-term strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has created special schools in the Hanoi area for
 the education and indoctrination of minorities to be the "eyes
 and ears of the party" among their own people. Highland
 minorities in central Vietnam are subject to repression if
 suspected of ties with resistance groups. Officially
 
 
 -1035
 VIETNAM
 programmed resettlement of ethnic Vietnamese into the highlands
 is designed in part to increase government control over
 minority groups. On the more positive side, the Government is
 trying to narrow the gap in the standard of living between
 highlanders and lowland ethnic Vietnamese.
 Priority in social services is given to families of party
 members and families of soldiers who fought for the
 Government. Testing standards of university entrance
 examinations are reportedly lower for children of party
 officials. Arbitrarily high standards are set to keep the
 children of suspect background out of a university. Study
 abroad is also restricted to politically acceptable persons.
 In general, women do not appear to face discrimination in
 employment. Problems faced by women competing with men for
 higher status positions are generally a function of attitudes
 deeply ingrained in traditional Vietnamese society. Such
 problems persist in spite of government efforts to mold popular
 attitudes to conform with the Constitution, legislation, and
 regulations mandating equal treatment before the law in
 virtually all respects. Article 63 of the 1980 Constitution
 provides that women and men receive equal pay for equal work,
 and a large body of legislation and regulations is devoted to
 the protection of women's rights in marriage as well as in the
 workplace. Government statistics indicate that approximately
 50 percent of the primary school students are girls and that
 women represent about 39 percent of university students. The
 Government has claimed that women hold 46 percent of the senior
 posts in government and that 22 percent of the National
 Assembly membership are women. The most senior leadership,
 however, is predominately male, as can be seen, for example, in
 the all-male Politburo and Council of Ministers.
 There, are no statistics available on the frequency of violence
 against women within the home. In 1987 then-Chairman of the
 Council of Ministers Do Muoi issued a degree banning spouse
 beating.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vietnamese workers are not free to form or join unibns of their
 own choosing. Arl workers automatically become members of the
 "union" in their workplace,-and dues are deducted from their
 pay. These groups are organized by the Government and belong
 to the government-controlled Confederation of Vietnamese
 Workers. Strikes are considered unpatriotic and officially
 forbidden; none are known to have taken place in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Vietnamese workers do not have the right to organize unions of
 their own choosing or to bargain collectively. The Chairman of
 the Confederation of Vietnamese Workers is empowered by the
 legislation to attend conferences of the Council of Ministers
 and raise issues on behalf of labor that cannot be resolved at
 lower levels.
 I c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is permitted by the Constitution, which states
 in Article 58 that "people fit for work must work as provided
 by law." Refugees report that every Vietnamese is required by
 
 
 1036
 VIETNAM
 law to contribute 15 days of work per year to the State or pay
 a fee. In addition, unemployed persons, especially unemployed
 young people, are compelled to work in exchange for small wages
 and food. A number of government projects have used forced
 labor provided by reeducation camp prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to existing regulations inherited from the former
 French colonial administration, the minimum age for workers in
 Vietnam is 17. There is no reliable information concerning the
 enforcement of these regulations, nor are any statistics
 available on the number of child workers in Vietnam. Refugees
 report that children under 15 are exempt from compulsory labor
 requirements.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government inherited from the former French colonial
 administration a system of cegulations pertaining to working
 conditions, including a minimum wage; a maximum workday of 8
 hours, 6 days per week; and safety standards. However, except
 for some safety standards and workers covered by Ho Chi Minh
 Labor Regulations or employed by foreign enterprises, these
 regulations have not been updated since 1975, nor are existing
 standards enforced universally.
 Such safety standards as exist are developed jointly by the
 Ministry of Labor and worker organizations at individual
 workplaces. Enforcement of the standards has been uneven.
 Labor union legislation promulgated in July 1990 stipulates
 that if the union sees a life-threatening situation in the
 workplace, it may request that management correct the problem
 immediately and that a cessation of work, if necessary, be
 authorized. It further stipulates that the union has the right
 to participate in investigations of industrial accidents and to
 request that the Government or a court fix the responsibility
 for an accident. Wages are generally low in Vietnam,
 inadequate to provide the vast majority of workers and their
 families a decent living. Moreover, they frequently are paid
 late, sometimes by as much as several months. According to
 reports from refugees, nearly all workers experience delayed
 paydays in their workplace. Observers agree that doctors,
 nurses, and teachers are most often the victims of delayed
 paydays. Possibly as a result, many are reportedly leaving
 these professions, and there is a chronic shortage of
 teachers.
