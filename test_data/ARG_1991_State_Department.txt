 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal, constitutional democracy with a
 president elected through an electoral college for a single
 6-year term, a bicameral legislature, and an independent
 judiciary. Traditionally, the executive is the dominant
 branch. Since the end of military rule in 1983, there have
 been two national presidential elections and several midterm
 elections for Congress and provincial governorships. In May
 1989, the voters elected Justicialist (Peronist) Party
 candidate Carlos Menem as the nation's President. The
 inauguration of Menem on July 8, 1989, marked the first
 constitutional turnover of the presidency from one
 democratically elected president to another from an opposing
 party since 1916. Midterm elections for provincial governors
 and the Chamber of Deputies took place in 1991. Candidates in
 recent elections have represented the political spectrum from
 conservative to far left.
 The President is the constitutional Commander in Chief, while a
 civilian Defense Minister oversees the armed forces. The
 federal police report to the Interior Minister; provincial
 police are organized under provincial constitutions and report
 to locally elected provincial governors. However, past
 military uprisings, President Menem's unpopular 1990 pardon of
 former military Junta members convicted of human rights abuses,
 and intimidation of judges in certain cases indicate continuing
 problems in the area of military submission to civilian
 authority.
 Argentina, one of South America's wealthiest countries, has a
 mixed agricultural and industrial economy. Agricultural
 exports, particularly grain, represent the major source of
 foreign exchange earnings. To reverse a long-term economic
 decline that culminated in the hyperinflation of 1989, the
 Menem administration has undertaken an ambitious economic
 reform program to reduce and rationalize the public sector,
 open the economy, and stabilize financial markets. These
 reforms have been supported actively by the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Inter-American
 Development Bank. The Government continued to be in arrears on
 its external debt, which totals over $50 billion; however,
 partial payments were resumed in 1990.
 Argentines enjoy a wide range of constitutionally protected
 freedoms and individual rights. However, during 1991 there
 were incidents of torture and extrajudicial killing by police,
 intimidation of judges and other officials by rightist and
 leftist groups, including some members of the security forces,
 and continued discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 killings carried out by government forces in 1991. There were,
 however, several cases of killings or attacks which attained a
 high degree of notoriety because of strongly political
 overtones. In April the case of the National Administrator of
 the Customs Service, retired General Rodolfo Echegoyen, who
 allegedly committed suicide in late 1990, was reopened amid
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 allegations that he was killed because he was investigating
 high-level corruption, including money laundering, in the
 Customs Service. In May a controversial film director,
 Fernando Solanas, was wounded by masked assailants in Buenos
 Aires. The assdult, which was condemned by the Government,
 occurred just a day after Solanas had reaffirmed in court a
 magazine article charging President Menem with corruption and
 electofar fraud.
 Police were indicted in several cases in which their use of
 excessive force or of weapons resulted in unlawful killing.
 Some observers believe that police often use deadly forte
 without sufficient cause. In November a policeman in Buenos
 Aires killed a motorist after the latter reportedly refused to
 pay a bribe. The responsible officer was suspended, and the
 case was under investigation at year's end.
 Fifteen policemen in Cordoba were arrested in June for
 torturing to death a man suspected of being a drug trafficker.
 A student arrested during a rock concert in Buenos Aires in May
 died, allegedly from a beating administered by police while he
 and others were beinq transferred to the police station. On a
 judge's order, the officers involved were detained on minor
 charges. The student's family has initiated a civil suit
 againstthe police, which remains before the courts. In Bahia
 Blanca, in December 1990, a teenaged girl was allegedly raped
 and killed by several policemen.
 In September 1990, a young woman named Maria Soledad )Morales
 was raped and murdered in Catamarca province, unlehing a
 sordid scandal that had not yet subsided by the e , of 1991.
 The failure of then-Governor Ramon Saadi, Vhose family has
 dominate& Catamarca provincial politics, to pursue the case
 vigorously led to widespread charges of a coverup. Mass
 demonstrations and marches to protest the local government's'
 failure to bring the murderers to justice gave the case
 national exposure at a time when former Governor Saadi was
 running for reelection  In April President Menem named'a
 federal administrator to run the province's affairs until-the
 election of a successor in regularly scheduled provincial
 elections late in 1991. A federal investigation into the
 Morales case revealed serious irregulari-ties in all three
 branches of the provincial government. The police apparently
 tried to cover up the crime, in which the prime suspect is the
 son of a Peronist congressional deputy and Saadi ally.' The
 province's police chief has been accusedof malfeasance, the
 autopsy was improperly performed, and high-level police and
 court officials have resigned. The suspect was still in jail
 at year's end, pending the outcome of an ongoing investigation.
 Government officials an& private persons were the'objects of
 threats and intimidation in 1991, probably by members of the
 military or rightist supporters. Judicial investigations into
 allegations of abuse of authority or corruption are sometimes
 hindered by violence against judge and. other judicial
 authorities. There were several instances in which judges
 were the victims of threats, bombings, shootings, and other
 attempts at intimidation. A member of the Buenos Aires federal
 appeals court, Jorge Casanovas, hearing the case against
 military officers who staged an unsuccessful mutiny in December
 1990, received threatening anonymous telephone calls. 'His
 apartment was fired upon in June, and three human skulls
 inscribed with the names of his children were sent to him in
 July. Other judges on the appeals court, which at the same
 
 
 480
 ARGENTINA
 time was considering an extradition request for a narcotics
 trafficker, received similar anonymous calls. Judges hearing
 the money laundering case against President Menem's
 sister-in-law were also threatefted. In July three journalists
 received menacing anonymous letters from a group calling itself
 the Peronist Moralizing Command. The Mothers of the Plaza de
 Mayo, a group formed to demand an accounting of the thousands
 who disappeared during military rule, also received anonymous
 telephone threats, and their Buenos Aires office was
 vandalized. The Government enhanced police protection for the
 judges and conducted a routine investigation of the threats,
 but no arrests had been made by year's end. A senior Ministry
 of Interior official denied the existence of "parapolice"
 groups but admitted that some police officials might be
 involved in instances of intimidation.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed disappearances directly attributable to
 the police or armed forces in 1991.
 However, in late November and early December federal police,
 acting in cooperation with judicial authorities under the
 direct guidance of the Interior Minister, arrested a dozen
 active duty and retired federal police officers and charged
 them with a series of kidnapings for ransom of prominent
 Argentines, most of whom were Jewish. Some of those believed
 to have been kidnaped by this band have never reappeared and
 are presumed dead. The gang had apparently been in operation
 for more than a decade, originating during the military regime
 of 1976-83. Three of those arrested were high ranking, active
 duty police officers. Large amounts of ransom monies were
 recovered, and police were continuing their investigation and
 seeking suspected accomplices at year's end. There is no
 indication that any of the abductions were politically
 motivated.
 There were several other cases of prominent Argentines being
 kidnaped by what are thought to be nonpolitical, criminal
 groups seeking to extort large sums of money from their
 families. In August the governor of Cordoba province accused
 the police and judicial authorities in neighboring provinces of
 protecting the kidnapers of three prominent Cordoba residents.
 The charge was denied as a "political maneuver" related to the
 impending elections. In June a court in Mar del Plata
 sentenced a retired navy officer to 3 years in prison for the
 1976 kidnaping of a teacher.
 Judicial proceedings in the complex, highly emotional efforts
 to ascertain the whereabouts and identity of children of those
 who were "disappeared" by the security forces during the
 1976-1983 military dictatorship appear to have stalled.
 Disciplinary proceedings brought against two prosecutors in
 1989 who were investigating these cases were still pending at
 year's end. The Government has done little to support the
 investigation and resolution of these cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the criminal code
 provides penalties for torture which are similar to those for
 homicide, 8 to 25 years in prison. However, police brutality
 is a continuing and serious problem, and prosecutions are
 
 
 481
 ARGENTINA
 rare. During 1991 there were several cases in which police
 officers were either charged or sentenced to prison for torture
 or other abuses. In one incident, a 17-year-old youth was shot
 by police on the top floor of an abandoned highrise building
 bordering the presidential residence in suburban Buenos Aires.
 Police procedures in the case were under review at year's end.
 Reacting to the widespread publicity generated by cases of
 police violence and by the arrest--and subsequent release--of a
 police subcommissioner charged with torturing detainees to
 extract confessions (see the 1990 country report), the
 Government made limited efforts to prevent or control police
 brutality. In January the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission of the Organization of American States called on the
 Government to provide monetary compensation to a man arrested
 and tortured by the armed forces in 1975.
 Prisons are overcrowded, with poor medical facilities and a
 reported inadequacy of food. In one instance, inmates with
 acquired immodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were confined in a
 prison hospital were manacled to their beds to prevent them
 from escaping or spreading the infection. Following extensive
 media coverage of the case, prison officials discontinued the
 practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed penal code containin4 explicit
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. Arrests require probable cause or a
 judicial order, and the law provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. These legal limits.
 on police power are not always respected in practice. Holding
 suspects for several days is common. Most instances of torture
 or abuse of prisoners tend to occur during this early period of
 detention. In September a bill became law which limits, to 10
 hours the time that police may hold detainees for investigation
 before charging or releasing them and grants prisoners the
 right of communication. In July the Buenos Aires Appeals Court
 ruled that police must immediately inform a judge when anyone
 under 18 years old is arrested.
 Involuntary exile is not permitted or practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Argentina's judicial system is generally fair and independent,.
 albeit often slow and cumbersome. 'The Constitution and penal
 code provide for trials before judges and appellate review of
 all judicial rulings, including those of military courts.
 Federal Courts interpret constitutional protection against
 "arbitrary" trial procedures to permit wide-ranging review of
 criminal prosecutions. Army officers sentenced by a military
 court for their participation in the December 1990 military
 revolt had their sentences reviewed, and in some instances
 reduced, by the Buenos. Aires Federal Appeals Court in August
 1991. The Government subsequently asked that the sentencing be
 reviewed again. As in most civil law countries, trial by jury
 does not exist. Judges render verdicts on the basis of written
 evidence. The police have legal authority to adjudicate
 misdemeanor cases, which are often decided by senior police
 officials. The legal system provides public defenders for
 indigents, but caseloads exceed the system's capacity to
 provide tnem in all cases. Delays and overcrowded court
 
 
 482
 ARGENTINA
 dockets continue to impede the legal process. / A continuing
 dispute between the judiciary and the executive over the
 salaries of employees of the judiciary has resulted in wildcat
 strikes and work-to-rule measuret by court employees. These
 actions further slowed the judicial process.
 On November 29, both houses of Congress passed legislation that
 significantly enhanced the ability the victims of human rights
 abuse and their family members to file claims against members
 of the armed forces for mistreatment dating from the 1976-83
 military regime. The legislation also improved the chances
 that victims and their families might receive monetary
 compensation. Human rights groups remain skeptical about how
 effectively the legislation will be enforced.
 The right to bail is provided by law and observed in practice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is constitutional protection against unreasonable search
 and seizure, and the State generally does not intrude
 arbitrarily into the private lives of persons. However, there
 continue to be credible reports that security agencies_ tap
 telephones of political personalities and human rights
 organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Argentina enjoys an essentially free and vigorous press. The
 national debate on press and media freedom, led by the National
 Editors and Publishers Association (ADEPA), intensified in
 1991. ADEPA's president noted in April that press freedom had
 increased despite the media's aggressive campaign to uncover
 official fraud and corruption. Nevertheless, ADEPA and the
 media continued to report and denounce anonymous threats and
 attacks against journalists, such as bombings. The Government
 joined in these condemnations. ADEPA and the media also
 reproached the Government for actions that threatened the
 media, such as closing down magazines, forcing journalists to
 reveal sources, imposing a value-added tax on magazines and
 newspapers, and illegally searching two newspaper offices in
 Cordoba to locate documents related to the Morales murder case
 (see Section l.a.) and a story on official corruption. In 1991
 several bills were introduced in Congress to strengthen press
 freedoms, especially the right of a journalist to refuse to
 reveal sources. At year's end none of these initiatives had
 yet been enacted into law.'
 b. .Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. In 1991 major political parties, the labor movement,
 human rights organizations, ethnic communities, and other
 groups were able to hold mass rallies without interference.
 The only exception was a ban on the use of the swastika and the
 term "National Socialist" by a neo-Nazi group.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion.
 Missionaries for any religion are permitted to enter Argentina
 
 
 483
 ARGENTINA
 and proselytize, and the non-Catholic population is growing.
 Argentina's Jewish community, Latin America's largest at an
 estimated 300,000, practices its religion without legal
 restriction.
 Nevertheless, 1991 saw the emergence of a neo-Nazi organization
 and overt expressions of anti-Semitism. More than 100 graves
 in the Jewish cemetery at Berazategui in Buenos Aires province
 were desecrated and destroyed on the night of April 28.
 Subsequently, two known neo-Nazis were arrested and charged
 with the crime. One, Horacio Carrondi, had been a member of
 the army intelligence service until 1986. Judges investigating
 the Berazategui desecration received telephone threats, and.
 anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi graffiti were painted on cemetery and
 court house walls. In the wake of the profanation, a federal
 judge prohibited an Argentine neo-Nazi organization called the
 Nationalist Workers Party from displaying a swastika. The
 court order was defied. In May a synagogue in San Salvador,
 Entre Rios province, was attacked and partially destroyed.
 President Menem strongly condemned these incidents.
 In September the Government sent to Congress a new law
 governing religious communities. The bill reaffirms
 universally accepted religious freedoms, eliminates the
 obligation of non-Catholic groups to register with the State,
 and extends to non-Catholic groups that choose not to register
 such benefits as military exemptions for ministers and
 seminarians and the opportunity to teach religion in public
 schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 International and internal travel as well as emigration are
 unrestricted. Refugees are not forced to return to-countries
 from which-they have fled. In July six Iraqi Kurds.and an
 Iranian, stowaways on a freighter, requested and were granted
 political asylum in Argentina. In April the Government
 announced that it was studying the possibility of an amnesty
 for some 150,000 illegal residents, similar to an amnesty
 grant-ed in 1984 to 156,768 persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to, Change Their Government
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held several national
 elections to choose federal, provincial, and local officials-.
 These elections were generally free, fair, and democratic, with
 universal suffrage. Some allegations of fraud were made in a
 few provinces. The Justicialist (Peronist) Party currently
 controls the executive and, in an alliance with smaller
 parties, the legislative branches of government. Politicel
 parties from a wide ideological spectrum are represented in
 Congress as a result of the 1987, 1989, and 1991 elections, and
 even more parties hold office in individual provinces.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates fully with international human rights
 organizations, which enjoy unrestricted access in Argentina.
 Domestic human rights organizations operate openly, despite
 occasional and anonymous threats and harassment.
 
 
 484
 ARGENTINA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination.based on sex, race, religion,
 language, and social status. However, Argentine women must
 contend with bias rooted in the sociocultural traditions of the
 country and face de facto discrimination in certain job areas.
 In November the Congress approved and President Menem signed a
 measure that would require political parties to designate women
 for at least 30 percent of the positions on their slates for
 national office. Women's organizations strongly and
 vociferously supported this measure, but experienced
 politicians have expressed doubts about how the Government can
 effectively implement and enforce this law.
 Violence against women is not approved by society or the
 Government, but such abuse, including domestic violence such as
 spouse beating, does exist. According to various groups
 representing women, there is a continuing increase in the
 number of abuse cases being brought to their attention and
 before the courts. They credit this to greater public
 awareness of this problem and to the increased socioeconomic
 problems affecting many Argentine families. Still, reliable
 statistics on the problem of physical abuse of women are
 scarce. Sexual harassment is also being given greater
 attention. In November a male official of the actors' union
 was expelled for sexual harassment. Informed observers state
 that more women are coming forward to denounce various types of
 harassment and abuse encountered at home and on the job.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Movement, which represents about one-third of the
 national work force, is an important independent economic and
 political force. Trade unions are independent of the
 Government. The vast majority of union leaders are-allied to
 the ruling Justicialist Party and are active in the Peronist
 movement. There is, however, a great deal of internal division
 and rivalry within the Peronist General Labor Confederation
 (CGT), based on personality, ideological differences, and
 opposition to the Administration's economic policies. These
 divisions, and the success of President Menem's free market
 economic reforms, have weakened the political power of labor
 unions.
 The right of association was enhanced by legislation passed in
 1987 and 1988 which restored some laws and rights suspended by
 previous military governments, but segments of these laws have
 been criticized as restricting the ability of rival union
 organizations to organize and bargain collectively. An
 administration-sponsored labor reform package presented to
 Congress in September would eliminate many of these
 restrictions on organization and collective bargaining. Trade
 unions are free to associate with international organizations,
 and many Argentine unions are affiliated with, and active in,
 international trade union groups. The Government actively
 cooperated with the International Labor Organization (ILO) in
 investigating complaints by Argentine and international trade
 union groups concerning possible violations of worker rights in
 collective bargaining, job security, freedom of association,
 conciliation, and the right to strike.
 
 
 485
 ARGENTINA
 Unions have the right to strike, subject to compulsory
 conciliation and arbitration by the Labor Ministry. Workers
 have the right to receive their salaries while on strike until
 the Labor Ministry orders compulsory conciliation. Strikes by
 employees of state-owned enterprises dominated 'the strike scene
 in 1991. Most of them were triggered by the Government's
 administrative reorganization plan that is designed to reduce
 the size and cost of the public sector, modernize
 administrative procedures, and privatize outmoded state
 enterprises. In September the Government announced the
 possibility of declaring all politically motivated strikes
 illegal, a step which would give it the right to dismiss
 striking employees.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law, labor and management have a binding collective
 bargaining process which sets wage levels on an industrywide
 basis. The State's involvement in this process is limited to
 ratifying the agreements, which provides them with legal
 status. The Government directly sets wages for civil servants
 and employees of state-owned enterprises, generally following
 consultations with. the unions. As part of a broadly based
 labor reform package, the Administration announced in 1991 its
 intentiod to introduce draft legislation that would change the
 rules under which unions organize and elect their leadership
 and change the operation of the collective bargaining mechanism
 as well. Although specifics had not been made public by year's
 end, the announced intent of the reform legislation is to free
 unions from the monolithic political and economic control of
 old-line leaders and introduce more democratic practices.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law, and
 well-developed mechanisms are in place and functioning to
 resolve complaints. Some provinces provide rights and
 obligations beyond those provided under federal law.
 There are no officially designated export processing zones in
 Argentina. Federal labor law and regulation applies uniformly
 throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition. of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under 14 years of age, except within the
 family, is prohibited. Minors aged L4 and 1& may work in
 restricted types of employment but not more than'6 hours a day
 or 35 hours a week. The same law applies to minors 16 to 18
 years of age, although competent authorities may allow
 exceptions. Violators are tried before the appropriate
 courts. Enforcement of child labor laws has lessened as the
 economic situation has led many families to have as many
 members employed as possible.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The official minimum monthly wage in Argentina, which was
 increased in March 1991 and then remained constant until year's
 end, was insufficient to provide a decent standard of living
 for workers and their families.
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of worker rights.
 
 
 486
 ARGENTINA
 The maximum workday is 8 hours; the workweek is 48 hours.
 Premiums must be paid for work beyond these limits. Rules
 governing vacations and occupational health and safety are
 comparable to those in Western industrialized nations and are
 enforced by the Government and labor unions in the formal
 economy. There is, however, a large informal economy which
 employs an'undetermined number of people, including children.
 This sector is difficult to police, and employers often are
 able to deny basic rights and benefits to employees because
 employees fear losing their jobs if they report Labor Code
 violations to the authorities.
