 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Article 14 of the
 Japanese constitution states, "all of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in polit-
 ical, economic or social relations because of race, creed,
 sex, social status or family origin." The human rights
 guaranteed by the constitution are secured by a just and
 efficient legal system, which includes a civil liberties
 bureau within the ministry-of justice and approximately
 11,00Q civil liberties commissioners throughout the country
 who are charged with promoting wider recognition of and
 greater respect for human rights.
 Japan's advanced industrial free market economy is second to
 the United States in terms of GNP, and its distribution of
 income is among the most egalitarian in the world.
 Japan has evolved a unique culture embodying elements of
 both East and West. Buddhism and Confucianism continue to
 have a basic and pervasive influence on Japanese thought and
 social institutions. There is complete freedom of religion
 in Japan, and most religions tend to be eclectic and non-
 exclusive. Buddhism and Shinto remain the two major reli-
 gions. Other religions flourish, including 122 Christian
 denominations. Missionaries are welcomed and receive special
 visa status.
 Japan, whose highly competitive education system provides
 for nine years of free, compulsory schooling, has one of the
 world's highest literacy rates.
 Japan has designated the week ending on December 10 of each
 year "Human Rights Week." During that period the government
 carries out a large-scale educational campaign supplementing
 regular day-to-day activities to increase public awareness
 of human rights. In 1979, the themes for Human Rights Week
 were "mutual respect for human rights," "stop discrimination
 against outcast communities" and "improve the status of
 women."
 In July 1980, Japan signed the United Nations Convention on
 the Elimination of all Forms of Discriminations against
 Women. Changes in Japanese laws to comply with that con-
 vention are expected to be completed within five years, at
 which time the diet (parliament) is expected to ratify the
 convention. As one example, the Justice Ministry announced
 in September that it had begun work to revise the Japanese
 Nationality Act to permit children to derive citizenship
 from either parent. At present, citizenship is derived only
 through the father.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by law and there are no known
 instances of torture committed in Japan.
 
 
 616
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by article 3 of the constitution and
 respected in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known cases in Japan in which people have been
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine deten-
 tion by police or security forces, or by elements whose
 activities are condoned by the government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by articles 31, 33 and 34 of the constitution and respected
 in practice. Japanese law provides for a writ of habeas
 corpus. Individuals cannot be arrested without charge and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate that
 sufficient evidence exists to detain the accused before
 trial. Length of time before a suspect is brought to trial
 depends on the nature of the crime but rarely exceeds two
 months. The average is one to two months. Preventive
 detention does not exist in Japan. No political prisoners
 are held in Japan.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 37 of the constitution guarantees the right to a
 speedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal in all
 criminal cases, and this right is respected in practice.
 The defendant is made aware of charges upon arrest, guaran-
 teed a public trial by independent civilian courts with
 defense counsel and the right to cross examination. Defense
 counsels have free and private access to defendants without
 harassment by government authorities, and have the right of
 access to evidence before the trial after a formal indictment
 has been made. Defendants also are protected from self-
 incrimination and the application of ex post facto laws.
 A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial
 court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by
 law, appeal to a high court as the reviewing court. The
 prosecution may also appeal a judgment of the trial court,
 which it finds too lenient or too severe, or a judgment
 pronouncing the defendant not guilty. The reviewing court
 examines the written record of trial court proceedings and
 considers the written and oral arguments of both-the defense
 attorney and the public prosecutor. The court may, or
 sometimes must, hear additional evidence in order to make a
 decision.
 After reviewing the trial court's decision with respect to
 both its factual and legal conclusions, the court renders a
 written decision and opinion, which either reverses or
 affirms the decision of the trial court. The court may
 affirm the trial court's decision by dismissing the appeal.
 When the reviewing court reverses the original decision, it
 may remand the case to the original or another trial court
 of first instance, or it may make a decision of its own. In
 
 
 617
 the latter case no penalty heavier than that imposed by the
 original sentence shall be pronounced, if the appeal was
 made by the defendant only.
 If a case has been remanded to a new court of first in-
 stance, that court will conduct a new trial and render a new
 decision. However, since the decision of the reviewing
 court binds the trial court to which the case has been
 remanded, the trial court cannot render a decision incon-
 sistent with the decision of the reviewing court. A decision
 of a reviewing court reversing or affirming a decision may
 be appealed to the Supreme Court, if the judgment of the
 high court is alleged to violate the principles of the
 constitution or to be inconsistent with precedents estab-
 lished by the Supreme Court. A decision of the Supreme
 Court or that of a high court from which no appeal is made
 is the final disposition of a case.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under article 35 of the constitution, each search or seizure
 shall be made upon separate warrant issued by a competent
 judicial officer. There are no known cases in Japan in
 which authorities have entered homes without first obtaining
 a legal warrant. The standards for issuing such warrants
 are adequate to guard against arbitrary searches.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 Employment and Education.
 Basic human needs in Japan are provided for primarily by the
 social infrastructure that has grown apace with Japan's free
 industrialized economy. Good quality food, shelter, health
 care and education are widely available, with the government
 generally acting as the provider of last resort for the
 needy. Welfare standards also are maintained by the efforts
 of the private sector, buttressed by an advanced social
 security system, for the Japanese employer traditionally
 assumes a paternal responsibility for the welfare of employees
 and their families. Employment, under reasonable conditions
 of work and at adequate rates of remuneration, is the norm.
 Japan's distribution of income is among the most egalitarian
 in the world, according to United Nations' studies.
 The Japanese economy is one of the most dynamic and fastest
 growing economies among the major industrialized nations.
 Real GNP growth is expected to be near five percent in 1980.
 Per capita GNP was $8,728 at the end of 1979, and average
 monthly income of wage-earning households was $1,567, up 7
 percent from the previous year. Japan has experienced
 relative price stability, with consumer prices increasing
 only 3.8 percent in 1978 and 3.1 percent in 1979. A higher
 rate of inflation is anticipated for 1980, although the rate
 of increase still is expected to be less than that of most
 other industrial nations. Health and safety conditions in
 Japanese industry are among the best in the industrialized
 world.
 The standard of living in Japan has risen rapidly during the
 past decade; it is now among the highest in the world. This
 improvement has benefitted all Japanese.
 
 
 618
 As of the end of 1979, Japan's population was approximately
 116 million, a density of 312 people per square kilometer.
 The present growth rate is 0.8 percent per year. The infant
 mortality of nine per 1000 births is the lowest in the
 world, while average life spans of 78 for women and 73 for
 men are the highest. As these statistics indicate, the
 health care provided By some 143,000 doctors and implemented
 through an extensive national health insurance program is
 excellent and readily available.
 Education in Japan is of high quality and is available to
 all. Nine years of schooling are compulsory. The resultant
 literacy rate is over 99 percent. Entrance into secondary
 schools and universities is by competitive examination,
 which is open on a non-discriminatory basis.
 By law, all Japanese have the right to own property, and
 ownership of private property is widespread. However,
 career and other single women have found it difficult to
 obtain financing for the purchase of real property. As a
 means of overcoming this barrier, beginning in 1981, the
 government will make low-cost public housing loans available
 to single women over 35 years of age.
 In Japan's expanding economy, employment opportunities at
 just, and equitable wages are generally available to quali-
 fied applicants. Training programs to assist those lacking
 qualifications or in need of retraining are integral parts
 of Japanese government-run adult education and manpower
 programs. Japanese workers have the right to organize,
 bargain collectively and, in the private sector, to strike
 in support of their demands. Under the twin pressures of an
 expanding economy and an independent trade union movement,
 employers are constrained to offer adequately paid employment
 under reasonable working conditions to retain a skilled,
 loyal workforce.
 Japan has traditionally been a male-oriented society. However,
 in accordance with Article 14 of the constitution, over the
 past thirty years the government has adopted various legis-
 lative measures to accord women the same legal status as
 men. The role of women in political and economic life is
 indeed on the increase. Such discrimination as occurs is
 the result of prejudice formed by centuries of social condi-
 tioning to a male-dominated society rather than of present
 laws and regulations.
 Discrimination against women occurs most frequently in em-
 ployment. Female employment is expected to be interrupted
 by marriage and childrearing. Occupations and skills which
 depend on continuity of employment find relatively fewer
 female applicants and openings." Although the principle of
 equal pay for equal work is accepted practice in Japan, the
 type of work which 80 percent of women workers perform
 (clerical, sales, services or machine operation) is at the
 lower end of the wage scale. The average female worker
 earns approximately three-fifths the annual wage of the
 average male employee. Protective legislation, which generally
 prohibits the employment of women at night or in certain
 occupations considered dangerous or harmful, further restricts
 the access of women to certain well-paying jobs. Since many
 women interrupt their careers for family reasons, the Japanese
 
 
 619
 wage system, in which wages generally reflect seniority and
 age, further serves to increase the difference between male
 and female earnings.
 The government is cognizant of the problems faced by women
 in employment and has instituted numerous programs for
 assisting women to attain greater equality. An expert group
 on equality of the sexes was established by the Ministry of
 Labor in December 1979. This group, along with the Women's
 and Young Workers' Bureau and the Tripartite Advisory Commi-
 ttee on women's and young workers' problems (both in the
 Ministry of Labory has been charged with identifying exist-
 ing areas of employment discrimination and with proposing
 legislative and administrative measures for achieving
 equality of opportunity and treatment in employment. The
 Women's and Young Workers' Bureau also provides counseling
 and vocational training services and allowances to women
 experiencing difficulties in entering or re-entering the
 labor market.
 The 1979 Ministry of Labor report on the status of women in
 Japan notes that social customs and prejudices still confront
 women with manifold problems. The report adds that these
 problems will be solved only step by step and that persistent
 efforts to this end are being made.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by articles 20 and 21 of the
 constitution and respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens have the right to travel freely, both within Japan
 and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Japan is a highly homogeneous and densely populated country
 which lacks a significant immigrant tradition. These factors,
 according to Japanese authorities, coupled with its unique
 culture and difficult language, present imposing barriers to
 the absorption of non-Japanese. Accordingly, Japan pursues
 a refugee and asylum policy which places emphasis on financial
 assistance to refugees. For Indochinese refugees that
 assistance amounted to 90 million dollars in 1979 and is
 expected to amount to 100 million dollars in 1980. The
 government has set an immediate target of 1,000 Indochinese
 refugees and displaced persons to be resettled permanently
 in Japan. It also makes it a rule to approve the resettlement
 in Japan of Indochinese who had come to Japan as students or
 under other status before the spring of 1975. To date 466
 Indochinese refugees have been permanently resettled in
 Japan. Furthermore, since 1975 the government has accepted
 over 4000 refugees rescued at sea and provided them with
 accommodation facilities while awaiting resettlement else-
 where. Apart from measures for the resettlement of refugees,
 in June the government decided to grant permission to enter
 Japan to those Vietnamese who reside in Vietnam and desire
 to join their families residing lawfully in Japan.
 
 
 620
 c. Freedom To Participate in the Political Process
 All adult citizens share the right to vote, and this right
 is enjoyed in practice. Vote is by secret ballot. Political
 interest groups can organize and engage in nonviolent political
 activity regardless of their political hue. Six opposition
 parties are active, ranging from a communist party to a
 moderate conservative party. Elections are honest and open,
 and they are perceived as reflecting the public will. Well-
 organized labor unions play an active role, not only in
 bringing workers' economic benefits but also in insuring
 participation by workers in the political process. Japanese
 law grants unions the right to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively, lobby, and make political campaign contribu-
 tions. Public corporation employees are not accorded the
 right to strike, however. The collective bargaining rights
 of government employees are limited: members of the armed
 forces, police officers and firefighters are not permitted
 to organize.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Two reports by non-governmental organizations regarding
 alleged violations of human rights in Japan were published
 in late 1979.
 The first was an article published by the Geneva-based
 International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) in its December
 1979 review. The article briefly reviewed the human rights
 situation in Japan in light of Japan's ratification of the
 international covenants on economic, social and cultural
 rights and on civil and political rights, particularly with
 regard to women, outcast communities and aliens. The article
 concluded that discrimination against those groups is largely
 social in nature and not legal, the result of customs and
 states of mind, and observed that discrimination of this
 kind is not peculiar to Japan. It pointed out steps the
 government has taken to alleviate such discrimination and
 stated that the greatly improved status of women is perhaps
 one of Japan's most important human rights achievements.
 The second report concerning alleged violations of human
 rights in Japan was presented to the United Nations commission
 on Human Rights in October 1979 by the Association Fighting
 for the Acquisition of the Human Rights of Koreans in Japan
 (referred to hereinafter as the Association). The report
 notes the following allegations with regard to Koreans
 residing in Japan:
 --Koreans without permanent residence permits are
 subject to deportation if they are sentenced to one year in
 prison or if they receive welfare. Those with permanent
 residence permits are subject to deportation if sentenced to
 eight years in prison.
 --They do not have the right to participate in the
 political process in Japan.
 --They are discriminated against in the area of employ-
 ment.
 
 
 621
 --They are denied certain social security and economic
 assistance benefits.
 --Public housing is unavailable to them in many cities.
 A spokesman for the Association stated that the government
 had responded to its representations by promising that:
 --Public housing would be opened to aliens;
 --Public loan funds for housing would be made available
 to aliens;
 --The ministry of finance would consider "historical
 background" in its response to Koreans who apply for small
 business loans.
 In fact, the GOJ announced early this year that, as of April
 1, 1980, it would extend small business loans through the
 housing loan corporation to qualified foreign residents in
 Japan. In practice, these would mainly be Koreans.
 The International Commission of Jurists report also mentioned
 the Koreans' complaint that aliens who have received substan-
 tial prison sentences are subject to deportation, but pointed
 out that most goverments claim the right to expel aliens
 they consider undesirable.
 The government's position is that while it is committed to
 protecting the human rights of aliens in Japan, it is not
 obliged to offer them thp privileges which accompany citizen-
 ship. Thus, while aliens have a limited right to participate
 in political activites, they do not have the right to vote,
 nor do they have the right to public service employment.
 Its distinction between human rights for aliens and privi-
 leges accompanying citizenship notwithstanding, the govern-
 ment recently has taken steps, such as those noted above,
 to accommodate aliens' requests for access to economic
 assistance programs. In addition, the education minister-
 announced in July that he would press for passage of an
 alien professors employment bill which would allow aliens to
 be employed as tenured professors at public universities.
 The ministry of foreign affairs is pressing for legislation
 which would allow aliens to be covered under the national
 pension plan law. With regard to allegations of discrimination
 against aliens in employment practices in the private sector,
 a Korean, who reportedly was dismissed from a company when
 his origins became known, was reinstated following a recent
 court ruling based on the labor standards law and the civil
 code.
 The following organizations in Japan concern themselves with
 human rights:
 --The Asian Human Rights Center
 --Japan Civil Liberties Union
 --Association To Protect the Human Rights for North
 Koreans in Japan
 
 
 622
 --Association To Protect the Human Rights for Foreigners
 in Japan
 --Assocation Fighting for Acquisition of Human Rights
 for Koreans in Japan
 --The Human Rights Center for 7oreigners in Japan
 --The Group Concerned with International Marriage
 --International Commission of Jurists
 --Research Institute for the Liberation of Buraku
 --The Japanese Women's Council
 Japan is a member of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees Executive Board and the UNESCO Executive Board.
 Its contributions to these organizations in Japanese fiscal
 year 1980 were $50 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
 Japan does not participate in any regional human rights
 organizations.
