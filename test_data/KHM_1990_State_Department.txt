 CAMBODIA
 The regime in Phnom Penh--which calls itself the State of
 Cambodia (SOC) but is widely known by its former name, the
 People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK)--is headed by Party
 Secretary General and Council of State Chairman Heng Samrin,
 National Assembly President Chea Sim, and Council of Ministers
 Chairman Hun Sen. The regime was installed by the Vietnamese
 army after it drove the Communist Khmer Rouge government from
 Phnom Penh in 1979. Although Vietnam withdrew the bulk of its
 forces from Cambodia in 1989, Hanoi continues to exert
 considerable influence over the Phnom Penh regime's policies.
 Between 1975 and-1979, when the Khmer Rouge held power in
 Cambodia. it compiled one of the worst records of human rights
 violations in history as a result of a thorough and brutal
 attempt at restructuring Cambodian society. More than 1
 million people, out of a total population of 7 million, were
 killed or died under the Khmer Rouge's murderous reign.
 The current Phnom Penh regime is not recognized by the
 majority of the international community- Under the 1989 Phnom
 Penh Constitution, power is wielded by the Communist
 Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) as the "sole
 leader of the entire Cambodian society." The KPRP's control
 over Cambodia is challenged by the National Government of
 Cambodia (NGC), formerly known as the Coalition Government of
 Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK). This resistance coalition is
 composed of the Communist Khmer Rouge and two non-Communist
 groups; it occupied Cambodia's seat at the United Nations
 until September, when it relinquished the seat in principle to
 the newly formed Supreme National Council. The forces of the
 three, resistance groups have each been waging war against the
 Phnom Penh regime from enclaves in western and northern
 Cambodia and areas along the Thai-Cambodian border.
 China has exerted considerable influence over the resistance
 coalition and has been the major source of assistance to the
 Khmer Rouge, which now calls itself the Party of Democratic
 Kampuchea. The Khmer Rouge has the largest fighting force in
 the resistance coalition, with between 30,000 and 40,000 men
 under arms.
 The Non-Communist Resistance (NCR) is made up of two groups.
 The first is the National United Front for an Independent,
 Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), whose
 de facto leader is Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia's former King and
 head of state. FUNCINPEC's military force is the National
 Army of Independent Cambodia (ANKIY, previously known as the
 Sihanoukist National Army (ANS).
 The other NCR group is the Khmer People's National Liberation
 Front (KPNLF), formed in 1979. Its political leader is former
 Prime Minister Son Sann. The KPNLF armed forces are commanded
 by General Sak Sutsakhan and operate independently of the
 KPNLF political leadership.
 Major efforts continued during 1990 to end the Camlbodian
 conflict through negotiations. In August the five permanent
 members of the U.N. Security Council (Perm Five) agreed to a
 framework for a "comprehensive settlement" to the conflict.
 This framework included the outline of an enhanced U.N. role
 in the interim administrative and military arrangements to be
 put in place before elections are held under U.N. auspices and
 stressed the importance of human rights and international
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 guarantees in a settlement. It also called for creation of a
 Supreme National Council (SNC) as the "embodiment of the
 independence, sovereignty, and unity of Cambodia" until a new
 government is formed after elections.
 This framework was accepted in September by the Cambodian
 factions, which also agreed to establish an SNC based on this
 approach. In December, the Co-Chairmen of the Paris
 International Conference on Cambodia (PICC) invited the SNC's
 12 members to meet in Paris to review the draft of an overall
 settlement document developed from the Perm Five framework.
 SNC support for the draft document would allow the PICC to
 reconvene, possibly in early 1991, to reach agreement on a
 comprehensive settlement agreement.
 Cambodia's economic system came under considerable strain in
 1990. Despite continued growth of the private sector, the
 country experienced severe shortages of goods. Agricultural
 production was below normal as well, due to drought in some
 parts of Cambodia and flooding elsewhere. Visitors to Phnom
 Penh reported that these conditions, combined with reported
 reductions in assistance by Eastern European countries and the
 Soviet Union, resulted in a broad downturn in the economy and
 severe inflation. Serious corruption by officials of the
 Phnom Penh regime continued to be reported.
 Reliable reports from travelers to Cambodia and Cambodians who
 have left the country indicate that widespread and serious
 human rights violations continued in 1990 in areas under the
 control of the Phnom Penh regime, despite evidence of
 improvement in some areas. As in previous years, accurate
 information on the regime's human rights record is scarce.
 Serious human rights violations by the Khmer Rouge continued
 to be reported during 1990. Khmer Rouge forces attacked
 trains inside Cambodia, killing military and civilian
 passengers. The Khmer Rouge also moved most of its civilian
 population living in "hidden camps" in Thailand back into
 Cambodia without international supervision. At the same time,
 reports of brutal treatment by the Khmer Rouge in its "hidden
 camps" and inside Cambodia dropped during the year. There
 were also reports of Khmer Rouge distributions of food and
 clothing within Cambodia in an attempt to win the "hearts and
 minds" of the population. The Khmer Rouge top leadership from
 1975-79 remains in place, however, and there continue to be
 reliable reports that these leaders retain their ultimate goal
 of regaining power in Cambodia, by force if necessary.
 There were also credible reports of some human rights abuses
 by both non-Communist groups during 1990. As in previous
 years, lack of discipline in the KPNLF ranks resulted in acts
 of banditry against some Thai villagers and Cambodians in the
 border area and inside Cambodia. Some ANKI and KPNLF troops
 were responsible for acts of violence against civilians living
 in the three non-Communist displaced persons camps in Thailand
 of Site B, Site 2, and Sok Sann. Respect for human rights by
 residents of displaced persons camps of all three resistance
 factions continued to improve, however, thanks to U.N.
 training of Khmer police, the presence of U.N. security
 liaison officers, and the expansion of the justice and court
 systems, programs begun under U.N. auspices in 1989.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While there have been reports of political killing by the
 Phnom Penh regime in recent years, Cambodians who left the
 country in 1990 reported no such killings.
 During 1990 there were fewer reports of political killings by
 the Khmer Rouge than has been the case in previous years.
 Asia Watch, a U.S.-based human rights group, reported that the
 Khmer Rouge killed a Phnom Penh official in Kompong Speu
 province in May. Residents of the district capital of Stoung
 in Kompong Thom Province reported that Khmer Rouge troops
 killed regime officials when they seized the town in June.
 Civilians continue to be killed during attacks by the Khmer
 Rouge on towns, trains, and lines of communication. Survivors
 of a July 15 attack on a train in Kompong Chhnang reported
 that the Khmer Rouge first robbed and then killed over 50
 passengers, including soldiers, regime employees, and other
 civilians. Unconfirmed reports, however, attributed at least
 one train attack to deserters from the Phnom Penh regime's
 forces rather than to the Khmer Rouge as originally thought.
 Banditry is a growing problem in Cambodia.
 Increasing numbers of Khmer Rouge defectors reported, however,
 that the Khmer Rouge largely avoided extrajudicial killings in
 an effort to win popular support. According to these
 defectors, the Khmer Rouge leadership implemented this policy
 in both their "hidden camps"--those not open to international
 inspection--and in areas of Cambodia under Khmer Rouge control
 or influence. Unlike in previous years, defectors said that
 residents attempting to leave Khmer Rouge "hidden" camps
 without permission would not be shot.
 The non-Communist factions were not generally accused of
 extrajudicial killings during 1990. An ANKI commander did
 kill a resident of the FUNCINPEC Site B camp accused of
 stealing money.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearances in Cambodia continued during 1990.
 As in 1989, many of these cases involved conscription into the
 Phnom Penh armed forces. Khmer Rouge defectors reported
 during 1990 that Khmer Rouge soldiers, rather than killing
 Phnom Penh regime and village officials, abducted them for
 "reeducation." Defectors from the Pailin area also reported
 that the Khmer Rouge sometimes abducted gem miners, forcing
 them to serve as porters for Khmer Rouge units. (See Section
 2.d. for a discussion of the disappearance/movement of Khmer
 Rouge "hidden camp" populations back to Cambodia.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Article 35 of the 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution specifically
 prohibits the use of coercion or physical abuse against
 prisoners. In past years, physical torture by regime
 authorities has been reported both in rural areas and in Phnom
 Penh at facilities under the control of both the Ministry of
 Interior (and its subordinate civil police forces) and the
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 armed forces. Beginning in 1989, however, a few prisoners who
 escaped or were released from regime prisons reported that the
 regime had reduced its use of torture. Reports of torture
 persisted in 1990, however. A man suspected of spying for the
 resistance told Asia Watch that he was beaten 10 to 20 times a
 day for 9 days while being interrogated by prison officials.
 He said his head was also held under dripping water. One
 deserter from the regime's military forces, an aide to a
 senior military officer, said he personally witnessed the
 torture in a Phnom Penh prison of persons suspected of
 belonging to the resistance. According to this former
 soldier, regime interrogators shackled these suspects, dunked
 their heads under water, and shocked them with cattle prods in
 an effort to obtain information or confessions.
 All former Phnom Penh regime prisoners, whether political or
 criminal, report being beaten at some stage during their
 confinement. As in previous years, some detainees report
 being held incommunicado in small and completely lightless
 solitary confinement cells that are poorly ventilated and
 unsanitary. They are constantly immobilized by shackles on
 both legs; sometimes they also are handcuffed. Former
 prisoners reported in previous years that prison officials
 withhold food, water, and medical attention from detainees as
 part of their interrogations. There are no indications that
 this situation changed in 1990. There are no known cases of
 any officials being prosecuted by the Phnom Penh regime for
 torture or other mistreatment of prisoners.
 Reports of conditions inside regime prisons are sparse. The
 Interior Ministry refused Asia Watch's request in May to visit
 two prisons in Phnom Penh and speak confidentially to
 prisoners about conditions. In Septembe., however, Phnom Penh
 announced that it had agreed to an International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) request dating from 1981 for access to
 the regime's prisons. No such visits had taken place by
 year's end.
 There were significant improvements in the conditions of jails
 run by the three resistance factions in the displaced persons
 camps in Thailand. This was due primarily to training and
 monitoring of prison wardens by the United Nations as part of
 the institution of a legal justice system. There were
 reliable reports, however, that at locations outside these
 camps soldiers from the ANKI and KPNLF beat with sticks people
 suspected of spying for Phnom Penh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Phnom Penh Constitution forbids unlawful "accusation,
 arrest, detention, or imprisonment." However, the virtual
 absence of legal process under the Phnom Penh regime remains,
 though Asia Watch reported that the regime "appears to be
 making a sincere effort to establish at least the structure of
 a legal system." Regime authorities often detain,
 interrogate, and jail common criminals and resistance
 sympathizers for extended periods without formal charges.
 This seems to be the rule rather than the exception. In May,
 according to credible reports, at least 15 and as many as 40
 regime officials who advocated political reforms were
 arrested. Some of these officials, including at least one
 minister, were reportedly detained for trying to publish the
 manifesto of a new political group espousing democratic
 ideals. Phnom Penh radio broadcasts accused the officials of
 betraying "the party and the nation's historic tasks."
 
 
 837
 CAMBODIA
 A major obstacle to reducing the arbitrariness of the Phnom
 Penh legal system is the role of the Interior Ministry.
 According to Asia Watch, the Interior Ministry remains "a
 fiefdom unto itself, able to incarcerate at will and to
 continue the abusive practices reported in the past, without
 review by the branches of government ordinarily charged with
 upholding the law." Among its other extrajudicial powers, the
 Interior Ministry has authority to overturn all court rulings
 and controls the regime's prison system.
 In each displaced persons camp in Thailand, the United Nations
 has worked closely with Khmer administrators to implement a
 judicial system, incorporating both traditional Khmer and
 Western legal procedures and codes. Under this system, a
 judicial committee presides over trials open to the public,
 and the accused has the right to address the court and the
 right to legal counsel.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution recognizes the presumption of
 innocence and provides for a lawyer at every trial, if the
 defendant requests one. In addition, the Constitution says
 that "all stages of court proceedings shall be heard in
 public. Nevertheless, cases may be held in secret if provided
 for by law."
 In past years, political prisoners held by the Phnom Penh
 regime were regularly denied fair trials. The situation does
 not appear to have changed. Former prisoners reported in 1990
 that the role of the regime's court system-appeared to be
 limited to determining a suspect's sentence, not deciding
 whether the suspect was innocent or guilty. The regime has
 used trials for propaganda or public intimidation. There are
 few procedural rights for defendants. Defendants have been
 required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all the
 questions and answers to be presented in court, even in cases
 where the interrogators have a-lready decided to release them;
 if these defendants satisfactorily recited their testimony as
 rehearsed, they were released. Other reports indicated that
 prisoners who had been arrested by regime authorities for
 alleged cooperation with the resistance were incarcerated, not
 as a result of judicial proceedings, but rather because they
 confessed to their crimes under interrogation. There are no
 indications that these procedures changed in 1990.
 AI estimated in 1989 that there were thousands of political
 prisoners held by the Phnom Penh regime. This estimate did
 not include so-called misled people restricted by the regime
 for reeducation. In-1990 AI issued a report noting Phnom
 Penh's June 1989 announcement that 534 political prisoners had
 been released since December 1987. AI said those freed "had
 apparently all been held without charge or trial or after
 unfair political trials." Regulations of the regime provide
 for the arrest and "reeducation" of "any person carrying out
 propaganda campaigns to sabotage internal unity and
 Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam solidarity." Such "reeducation" means
 indefinite detention to force a change in political values.
 Cambodians who left the country during 1990 reported that the
 regime still operates reeducation centers for political
 prisoners in various parts of the country. Imprisonment as a
 form of extortion is also reportedly practiced.
 
 
 838
 CAMBODIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Phnom Penh regime authorities search whenever and wherever
 they wish and maintain extensive surveillance operations.
 Cambodians who departed the country in 1990 reported that the
 regime continues to maintain networks of informers who report
 to the secret police. Visitors to Cambodia reported that
 regime militia and soldiers regularly extort money from
 travelers along the roads. The Phnom Penh regime also opens
 and censors mail. In addition, the regime has required, since
 July 1990, that Cambodians wishing to marry foreigners or
 overseas Khmer must obtain permission from the regime's
 Council of Ministers.
 The Khmer Rouge continued to maintain strict control over the
 social activity of those under its control. Khmer Rouge
 defectors reported in 1990 that the Khmer Rouge still strongly
 discourages its members and civilians under its control from
 marrying. Those who do not obtain permission before marriage
 can be punished. Many Khmer Rouge defectors, however,
 reported in 1990 a relaxation of some restrictions. For
 example, Khmer Rouge civilians who moved into Cambodia in 1990
 reported that obtaining permission to seek medical treatment
 in a U.N.-assisted camp in Thailand is relatively easy.
 Although the Khmer Rouge became more relaxed about contacts
 between its populations and foreigners, visitors to Site K
 note that camp leaders there still seem reluctant to allow
 foreigners private access to camp residents.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Troops from all factions, but especially those from the Phnom
 Penh forces, shelled targets indiscriminately during 1990,
 causing civilian casualties. In the continuing struggle with
 the KPNLF over Route 69, regime forces heavily shelled and
 rocketed Svay Chek and the surrounding areas using heavy
 artillery and multiple rocket launchers, virtually destroying
 the town. There were regular, credible reports of banditry
 along the border by KPNLF troops against Thai and Cambodian
 residents, some of whom died in these attacks.
 In past years, some villages close to the Thai-Cambodian
 border, especially those near known infiltration points, were
 relocated by the Phnom Penh regime. During 1990 the regime
 also relocated several thousand persons living far from the
 border in Kompong Speu, moving them away from areas under the
 influence of the Khmer Rouge. Although some of these
 villagers were moved to protect them from fighting, others
 reportedly were forced to leave their homes to ensure that
 they could not assist the resistance. By year's end, as many
 as 150,000 people within Cambodia had been moved by the regime
 to relocation camps or had fled there because of increased
 military activity. Cambodian refugees reported that
 conditions in relocation camps were often primitive, without
 clean water or sanitation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is severely restricted. The press
 and radio in Cambodia are wholly controlled by the Phnom Penh
 regime   The regime reserves the right to deny publication of
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 material that does not "express reality properly." Criticism
 of the regime is not generally tolerated, though some persons
 leaving Cambodia in 1990 reported seeing in Phnom Penh some
 underground leaflets critical of the regime. In May dozens of
 regime officials were reportedly arrested for attempting to
 publish a manifesto of a nascent opposition party. The editor
 of the leading newspaper was removed from his position,
 apparently for his association with this group. Possession of
 foreign books and periodicals can result in arrest, but it is
 doubtful that such regulations are strictly enforced.
 In some parts of the country, people who repeatedly listen to
 foreign radio broadcasts after being warned not to do so are
 detained without charge for a day or two. In other areas,
 however, people may listen to the radio freely. The Phnom
 Penh regime attempts to control what types of movies the
 population sees, but widespread smuggling of video tapes has
 made movie censorship virtually impossible. During 1990 the
 regime denied visas to several foreign reporters and asked
 another to leave the country, apparently because they had
 written articles critical of the regime.
 Freedom of speech in camps and areas controlled by the
 resistance varies considerably. In the U.N.-assisted camps of
 Site 2 (KPNLF) and Site 8 (Khmer Rouge), residents often speak
 their minds freely. However, credible sources report that
 residents of Sok Sann (KPNLF) and Site B (FUNCINPEC) have
 little freedom to criticize their leaders. The same is true
 for residents of Khmer Rouge "hidden camps" now located inside
 Cambodia. Residents of U.N.-assisted camps, including those
 run by the Khmer Rouge, have access to a wide range of foreign
 publications. They also may listen to the radio or watch
 television freely. Unlike in past years, Khmer Rouge
 defectors from "hidden" camps reported in 1990 that residents
 of most of these camps may now listen to foreign radio
 broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Phnom Penh regime are
 those created to support the regime, such as those for
 farmers, women, and youth, which are usually headed by ranking
 party or regime officials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Article 6 of the 1989 Phnom Penh Constitution makes Buddhism
 the state religion of Cambodia. The regime also announced in
 May 1989 that all men were free to enter the monkhood,
 provided the ordination was approved by the regime and carried
 out by designated senior monks. However, the Buddhist
 hierarchy is controlled by the Phnom Penh authorities, and the
 curriculum of temple schools is set by the Ministry of
 Education, which also provides the teachers. Interviews with
 Cambodians who left the country in 1990 indicate that, in most
 parts of the country, there is now considerable freedom to
 practice Buddhism and enter the monkhood. Reports persist,
 though there are fewer than in earlier years, that men in some
 areas are discouraged from entering the monkhood and sometimes
 have to pay bribes to obtain the necessary permission. The
 regime authorities still attempt to use the Buddhist hierarchy
 as one of a number of organizations for "mass mobilization" to
 implement party policies. Increasingly in 1990, the regime
 media widely publicized the appearances by senior Phnom Penh
 
 
 840
 CAMBODIA
 leaders at Buddhist ceremonies, which they often used to make
 political speeches.
 Unlike in previous years, the Phnom Penh regime allowed
 Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in Phnom Penh to
 meet and hold services. Muslims continue to be able to
 practice their religion.
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge actively sought
 to exterminate religion. Defectors from "hidden" Khmer Rouge
 camps continue to report that practicing Buddhism is
 discouraged in those camps. However, a temple and monks are
 present in the U.N.-assisted Khmer Rouge Site 8 camp. During
 1990 residents of the Khmer Rouge Site K camp requested that a
 temple be built at the camp, and camp leaders at Au Trao, the
 most recent Khmer Rouge camp to receive U.N. assistance, have
 asked that monks be trained for that camp. Christianity and
 Islam were ruthlessly suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when they
 controlled Cambodia and are not known to have been revived in
 Khmer Rouge-controlled areas. Residents of all camps
 affiliated with the non-Communist factions are free to
 practice any religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Despite attempts by the Phnom Penh regime to control all
 travel within areas under its authority through systems of
 neighborhood surveillance, family registration, and
 identification documents, there is a growing ability to travel
 within Cambodia. Recent arrivals in Thailand from Cambodia
 report that traders and other Cambodians can, either through
 bribing officials at checkpoints or avoiding the checkpoints
 entirely, move around the country without great difficulty.
 Permission is required to travel abroad. Such permission is
 rarely granted except for those going on official government
 business or those able to pay bribes, reportedly as high as
 $5,000 per person. Other Khmer seeking to leave the country
 flee to the Thai border either to escape the conflict or in
 the hope they can enter U.N.-supported refugee camps in
 Thailand. Regime and resistance soldiers often extort money
 from those fleeing Cambodia before permitting them to cross
 into Thailand. The Phnom Penh regime routinely imprisons
 those caught attempting to flee, as well as those believed to
 be returning from border encampments affiliated with the
 resistance.
 Most of the several hundred thousand Cambodian refugees who
 fled to Thailand before 1980 have been approved for
 resettlement and have departed for Western countries.
 However, over 12,600 Cambodians accorded refugee status but
 rejected for resettlement by third countries--generally
 because of close contacts with the Khmer Rouge regime before
 1979--remain at the Khao-i-dang holding center in Thailand.
 An additional 292,000 Cambodians--generally those who have
 fled since 1980--are in other camps on the Thai-Cambodian
 border. They have not been accorded legal refugee status and
 are considered "dispLaced persons" who will eventually return
 home when security conditions permit. They are generally not
 eligible for resettlement in third countries. The Phnom Penh
 regime has agreed in principle to accept returning displaced
 persons from camps in Thailand. During 1990, 56 displaced
 persons were voluntarily repatriated from Thailand.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 Virtually the entire population of the Khmer Rouge "hidden
 camps," estimated at between 60,000 and 100,000 persons, moved
 into Cambodia from Thailand during 1990. Although some
 residents of these camps later said they returned to Cambodia
 voluntarily, it seems clear that Khmer Rouge leaders did not
 provide camp residents with any other option. Residents of
 the U.N.-assisted Khmer Rouge camp of Borai also moved into
 Cambodia when the camp closed in January. Borai's camp
 leaders blocked U.N. efforts to give camp residents an
 opportunity to move instead to the U.N.-assisted Site K camp,
 although many later made their way to Site K or to the KPNLF
 Sok Sann camp.
 Residents of some U.N.-assisted camps were able to leave their
 camps relatively easily during 1990. Residents of the KPNLF
 Site 2 camp often crossed the border to and from Cambodia
 during 1990.
 Residents of the three U.N.-assisted Khmer Rouge camps were
 able to depart their camps- to farm (Site 8 and Au Trao) or to
 mine for gems (Site K). Many Khmer Rouge "hidden camp"
 residents now in Cambodia frequently visit relatives in
 U.N.-assisted'camps in Thailand, but they report that not all
 people under Khmer Rouge control are permitted to do so.
 Residents of the FUNCINPEC Site B camp and the KPNLF Sok Sann
 camp were generally not allowed to leave those camps.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Cambodian people do not enjoy the right to change their
 government through democratic means. The Kampuchean People's
 Revolutionary Party (KPRP) controls political life in the
 areas of the country governed by the Vietnamese-installed
 Phnom Penh regime and allows no competitors. In May the
 regime arrested up to 40 people, including several
 high-ranking regime officials attempting to form a new-
 political party.
 The only national election in the area controlled by the Phnom
 Penh regime did not allow genuine political participation, but
 rather was staged by the regime to attempt to demonstrate
 legitimacy and to underscore the relative status of leaders by
 varying reported percentages of the "vote." Although National
 Assembly members were supposed to serve terms of 4 years, no
 election has been held since the original election in 1981.
 The regime announced in 1989 that an election would take place
 before the end of the year, but none was held.
 In 1989 Nong Chan (part of Site 2) held an election for
 section leaders. In 1990 the Khmer Rouge Site 8 camp held an
 election for camp section leaders and education committee
 members. The ANKI Site B camp also held elections for
 education committee members. No other resistance camps held
 elections during 1990.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the
 
 
 842
 CAMBODIA
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the Khmer Rouge record of atrocities.
 In previous years, the Phnom Penh regime refused to allow
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, though the
 regime did permit a brief visit to Cambodia in August 1989 by
 the Cambodia Documentation Commission. In 1990, however, the
 regime allowed Asia Watch to study some aspects of the human
 rights situation in Cambodia, though the regime refused its
 requests to visit prisoners. After persistent requests, Phnom
 Penh agreed in September to permit the ICRC to visit prisoners
 held by the regime. No ICRC visits to prisoners had taken
 place by year's end. The regime has local Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups within
 regime-controlled areas have a role in the protection of human
 rights.
 All U.N.-assisted camps affiliated with the resistance allow
 education in human rights issues as well as investigations of
 human rights complaints. The Khmer Rouge do not permit
 investigations of human rights issues in areas under their
 control, except in U.N.-assisted camps.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Directives issued by the Phnom Penh regime in 1982 seemed to
 accord a privileged status to Vietnamese immigrants as
 compared with Cambodian residents, and there have been reports
 of Vietnamese taking advantage of their privileged status to
 force Cambodians from desirable jobs or land. Cambodians
 arriving at the border in 1988 frequently reported that
 Vietnamese in the cities continued to supplant Cambodian
 merchants, and this privileged status appeared to be backed by
 the Phnom Penh authorities. Reports from border travelers
 indicate that many Vietnamese moved into Cambodia to join
 other returning residents who had been expelled during the
 Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge periods. Most are traders or
 fishermen, but a large group of Vietnamese farmers have
 settled on rich marshland in Takeo province.
 In 1989, however, with the announced departure of Vietnamese
 troops from Cambodia, many Vietnamese merchants and settlers
 began to leave Cambodia for Vietnam, apparently believing that
 the Phnom Penh regime would not protect them. This trend
 appears to have slowed in 1990, though information is sparse.
 The resistance repeatedly claimed in 1990 that there are more.
 than I million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and has
 insisted that they must all depart the country before a peace
 settlement can be reached. There are no independent, verified
 data on the number of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia.
 There is no specific information available on discrimination
 of other types, including violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in Cambodia do not enjoy the right of association.
 Organized labor is totally under the Phnom Penh regime's
 control, and industries have organized branches of the
 'Kampuchean Federation of Trade Unions" (KFTU), which is an
 official mass organization headed by a Communist Party
 
 
 843
 CAMBODIA
 Politburo member. As far as can be determined, there is no
 right to strike.
 Cambodia became a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1969 but has ratified neither ILO
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association nor Convention 98 on
 collective bargaining. The Phnom Penh regime has not supplied
 any information on ratified or unratified conventions to the
 ILO nor attended ILO conferences for a number of years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no right to collective bargaining in Cambodia. Wage
 scales for the few industrial and regime workers are set by
 Phnom Penh. The KFTU claims to have successfully demanded pay
 increases and subsidies on nine basic commodities in 1983 from
 the Phnom Penh regime. The regime has not established any
 economic incentive zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Cambodia has ratified five ILO conventions, including one on
 forced labor.- However, forced labor by the Phnom Penh regime
 is common, although not primarily as a sanction or means of
 racial, social, or other discrimination. Although the use of
 forced labor appeared to decrease in 1989 and 1990, the regime
 still conscripted thousands of laborers to clear brush, cut
 timber, and build roads.
 The decrease in the number of forced laborers since early 19&9
 appeared to result from the institution of a nationwide
 military draft. In 1990, as in 1989, there were many reports
 of young men being taken forcibly from their farms, schools
 and from movie and video halls and sent directly to the front,
 with minimal or no training. This mass conscription policy
 resulted in many of those drafted fleeing to Thailand.
 The Khmer Rouge also requires labor from all persons under its
 control, including women, children, and the handicapped.
 Defectors continued to report in 1990 that Khmer Rouge leaders
 forced some people to carry supplies and ammunition into the
 interior of Cambodia in support of military operations, though
 these defectors insisted that most porters worked
 voluntarily. The Khmer Rouge's increasing reliance on trucks
 in 1990 to transport supplies may have reduced its use of
 porters.
 There were also reports during 1990 that the ANKI used
 children from Site B as porters and that the KPNLF forced
 residents of Sok Sann to carry supplies for its troops as well.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Phnom Penh regime has no known minimum age for the
 employment of children. Children are regularly employed as
 soon as they are physically able to perform the tasks
 required, either in agriculture or industry. The resistance
 forces have been reported to employ children as porters.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No attention appears to have been given by Phnom Penh
 authorities to ensuring acceptable conditions of work, and
 there is little information on this subject. The wage scales
 set by the regime are universally regarded as insufficient,

 forcing employees to supplement their wages in other ways.
 The KFTU claimed in December 1989 that the average worker
 earned at that time approximately $6 monthly, excluding
 government subsidies. Workers in certain state enterprises,
 such as rubber plantations, were said to earn as much as $20
 per month at that time.
