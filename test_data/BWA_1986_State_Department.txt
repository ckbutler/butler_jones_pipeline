BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy with free elections, an
 independent judiciary, a small police force, and a well-
 disciplined army subservient to civilian authority. Under the
 Constitution, executive power is vested in the President,
 chosen in a national election for a 5-year term, most recently
 in 1984. The President, currently Quett K.J. Masire, selects
 the Cabinet from the National Assembly. One party continues to
 dominate the country's politics: the Botswana Democratic
 Party (BDP) has held a majority in the National Assembly since
 independence and at the end of 1986 controlled 30 of 34
 elective seats.
 Botswana encourages private enterprise and free trade. All
 citizens, including those whites who accepted Botswana
 citizenship, are free to participate in the economic and
 political life of the country. Exploitation of the country's
 mineral resources has stimulated economic development, and per
 capita gross domestic product increased from $69 in 1966 to
 $950 in 1986. Despite this progress, about 75 percent of the
 population is dependent on subsistence agriculture and live in
 rural areas.
 Botswana's human rights record generally remains good.
 Citizens receive equal protection under the law; domestic
 political violence is unknown; public debate, including that
 in the press, is lively; and several women hold positions of
 importance in the public and private sector. However, Botswana
 suffered increasing pressure from neighboring South Africa in
 1986, which resulted in the Gaborone Government adopting a
 strong National Security Act, greatly enhancing the powers of
 the Attorney General and the police force in national security
 cases. As of August, 110 people had been arrested under this
 Act.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government has never been accused of involvement in
 political killings. There is no guerrilla or insurgency
 activity directed against the Government. However, South
 Africa's May 19 commando raid killed one person, and a June 14
 shooting incident (on the anniversary of South Africa's first
 raid on Gaborone) killed another, for which Botswana officially
 blamed the South African Government. No summary executions
 have occurred in Botswana.
 b. Disappearance
 The Constitution provides for the protection of personal
 liberty. However, the new National Security Act grants the
 Government the authority to hold detainees incommunicado on
 security grounds. Botswana's Chief of Police has lessened the
 full impact of this law by periodically stating publicly how
 many people have been arrested in connection with security
 matters. Most of those arrested have been South Africans who
 were temporarily detained for attempting to bring guns or
 contraband into Botswana without a permit. There was no
 evidence that this law led to the disappearance of any
 detainees.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of improper treatment by the police of
 criminals or criminal suspects during 1986. Prison conditions
 allow for adequate diet, health care, and visits from family
 members. Jails in Botswana can be crowded and inmates who have
 no relatives to see to their needs may encounter difficulty in
 arranging for maintenance. Flogging is permitted for
 infractions of prison rules and is mandatory punishment for
 rape, attempted rape, armed robbery, burglary, housebreaking,
 and related offenses. Traditional tribal courts presided over
 by a chief, where jurisdiction is limited to minor offenses,
 may also sentence individuals to be flogged.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 The Botswana Constitution contains a provision protecting
 citizens from arbitrary arrests. This provision still applies
 despite the passage of the new National Security Act.
 Preventive detention is illegal, and habeas corpus exists both
 in law and practice. Police are required to bring a suspect
 before a magistrate for charging within 48 hours of his arrest.
 There is a functioning system of bail, and defendants have
 access to lawyers,of their own choosing. In security cases,
 the suspect must be arraigned within 96 hours of his arrest.
 In nonsecurity cases, suspects must be released after 48 hours
 unless the magistrate issues a warrant of detention which is
 valid for 14 days. Every 14 days the police must appear
 before the magistrate and show they are making progress in the
 case. -To date there have been no known abuses of this system.
 Forced labor is illegal in Botswana and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trail is provided by law and honored
 in practice; trials involving national security, however, may
 be closed to the public. Defendants are entitled to counsel;
 consultation between defendants and counsel may be held in
 private. There are clearly defined appeal procedures. The
 judiciary is independent of the executive and the military and
 consists of a High Court, Court of Appeals, magistrate courts,
 and customary courts. The High Court has ruled that there
 exists the right against self-incrimination in the courts.
 Moreover, silence cannot be construed as guilt, and the burden
 of proof remains with the prosecution except in security
 matters. Since no case has yet been tried under the National
 Security Act, legal practice under its provisions is not yet
 clear. There are no political prisoners in Botswana.
 Botswana created a customary court of appeal in 1986,
 permitting cases tried in the traditional court system (which
 exists alongside the magistrate's courts) the right to appeal
 judgments in familial and property cases. About 100 cases were
 heard in this court during its first 6 months of existence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in practice.
 A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required for an
 official to enter a private residence, except in cases of
 suspected diamond theft, drug trafficking, or national security
 matters. There were no reported instances in which this
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 authority was used for diamond or drug related cases in 1986,
 and the Government did not state whether the powers of search
 contained in the new National Security Act were used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. The government-
 owned newspaper and radio continue to report statements by all
 opposition parties. Three independent weekly newspapers
 publish articles on a wider range of views than the government-
 owned media. Reporting on several sensitive political issues
 during 1986 demonstrated that the independent press has
 continued to evolve. This development, along with an effective
 judiciary and a functioning democratic political system,
 combine to insure freedom of speech and of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in
 Botswana, exemplified by the kgotla, a communal gathering
 similar to a New England town meeting in which citizens freely
 question leaders and voice opinions on local politics. Kgotla
 meetings are used regularly by political candidates and
 members of Parliament, including Ministers, to explain their
 programs to the people. Large gatherings require local police
 approval, which is routinely given. Demonstrations are
 permitted so long as order is maintained. Organizers are
 required to submit a detailed plan for any demonstration and
 are personally responsible for ensuring that the plan is
 followed.
 Unions have the right to organize, to bargain collectively,
 and to strike after exhausting established procedures, which
 require that the Government be invited to arbitrate the
 dispute. In practice, strikes are very rare and the wildcat
 strike in the banking sector in late 1986 was quickly settled.
 Unions have chafed under government regulations which prohibit
 financial contributions to unions from outside Botswana and
 require that all union leaders continue to work full-time in
 the trade their union represents, thus preventing employment
 of paid, full-time union organizers. Unions are important in
 the country's largest industries (mining-related) but have not
 yet developed a base in other sectors of the economy.
 Completely independent of government control or party
 affiliation, unions in Botswana actively represent their
 members. Unions associate freely with international
 organizations, and members attend international conferences.
 The Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU) is affiliated
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 is also a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordination
 Council (SATUCC).
 In March 1986, the Government canceled the residence permit of
 the Malawian Executive Secretary of SATUCC. The organization
 relocated its headquarters outside Botswana. While the
 Government gave no reason for its action, critics of its labor
 policy claim the expulsion was designed to limit foreign labor
 assistance to Botswana's trade unions as part of a policy of
 restraining organized labor.

 BOTSWANA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Open practice of religion is permitted and encouraged. There
 is no state religion. While most residents identify
 themselves with Christian sects, active groups of Muslims,
 Hindus, Baha'is, and others practice their faiths freely.
 Religious affiliation is neither an advantage nor disadvantage
 politically or socially. Religious conversion is permitted,
 and missionaries are allowed to enter the country and
 proselytize. Foreign clergy are also permitted to enter
 Botswana and to serve expatriate congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions on
 emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel are
 unrestricted and passports are easily obtained. Refugees
 documented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) are generally required to live in the settlement at
 Dukwe in northern Botswana where conditions are relatively
 good, due mainly to contributions of international donor
 organizations. Refugees may be authorized to live elsewhere
 for reasons such as employment or schooling. As with other
 foreigners in Botswana, refugees are not permitted to accept
 jobs which could be filled by a local citizen. Due to
 allegations from some neighboring countries that refugees are
 using Botswana as a sanctuary in which to pursue activities
 against the governments of their respective home countries,
 Botswana has declared that Dukwe residents found outside the
 camp without permission will be considered to have abandoned
 refugee status and will be repatriated as a deterrent to
 questionable activities by other refugees.
 In June 1986, Botswana's Minister of Presidential Affairs and
 Public Administration P.H.K. Kedikilwe (who holds the
 portfolio for refugee matters) reiterated Botswana's
 determination to continue to accept refugees despite the
 pressure by South Africa to cease. The Minister stated that
 Botswana would increase the screening of refugee applicants to
 make sure that the applicants have no ties to the African
 National Congress (ANC) or the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC).
 Over 600 Zimbabwean refugees voluntarily returned home from
 Botswana during 1986. However, Botswana involuntarily
 repatriated one Zimbabwean, Makhatini Guduza, in February. In
 explaining this repatriation, Presidential Affairs Minister
 Kedikilwe stated that Botswana had "irrefutable evidence
 indicating Guduza's direct involvement in hostile activities
 against the Government of Zimbabwe," which he claimed
 constituted a violation of Guduza's status as a refugee.
 Kedikilwe added that Botswana had sought a country of second
 asylum for Guduza without success.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Botswana is ruled by a government genuinely elected by its
 people. In the 1984 national election (the fifth since
 Botswana became independent), an estimated 70 percent of the
 eligible voters registered, and 86 percent of the registered
 voters actually cast their ballots. In 1986 Botswana held an
 important by-election in which an opposition party candidate
 won by a sizable majority despite a hard-fought campaign by
 the country's ruling party.

 BOTSWANA
 There are five parties in Botswana, three of which are
 represented in the country's National Assembly. Opposition
 parties now control three city councils in the country,
 including 6aborone, Jwaneng, and Francistown. However, one
 party, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), continues to
 dominate the country's politics, having held a majority in the
 National Assembly since independence in 1966.
 The political rights of women and minority groups are generally
 observed. For example, there are two female members of
 Parliament, one the Minister of External Affairs, the other
 the executive secretary of the majority party. Several
 members of minority ethnic groups are also represented in the
 National Assembly; one white member of Parliament is also a
 cabinet minister, and the Speaker of the National Assembly is
 white. Several cabinet ministers are of Kalanga or Bakgaligadi
 descent.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana cooperates with international agencies concerned with
 human rights, most notably the UNHCR which maintains offices
 within Botswana. There are no Botswana-based organizations
 set up to observe, report, or contest human rights violations.
 The Government consistently has responded promptly and
 forthrightly to inquiries on the human rights situation in
 Botswana but usually refrains from public comment on alleged
 human rights violations in neighboring countries. However,
 Botswana condemns apartheid and advocates positive
 socioeconomic development in South Africa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While 95 percent of the population is made up of the Batswana
 tribe, there are eight subgroups, and ethnic differences do
 exist in Botswana, though they play a marginal role in the
 country's politics. Only the approximately 50,000 Basarwa or
 Bushmen remain generally unrepresented in government. Because
 the Basarwa live primarily in remote, rural areas and have
 little contact with the population centers of Botswana, the
 Basarwa remain relatively unaffected by government educational
 and economic assistance programs and, consequently, have
 participated only marginally in the country's political life.
 The Government does not oppress or deny them rights, and they
 have full rights of suffrage.
 Women hold approximately 24 percent of the paid jobs in
 Botswana. An estimated 41 percent of central government
 employees are women, many of them, as noted, in high-level
 positions. While there is little overt discrimination,
 statistics suggest that social custom elevates the perquisites
 and privileges of men above those of women. Some 40 percent
 of rural households are headed by women. Generally speaking,
 women's economic opportunities--access to capital, labor,
 draft animals, seeds for farming--are significantly worse than
 those of men. Women may choose between civil marriage, in
 which all property is held in common, or customary marriage,
 which recognizes individual property brought to a marriage.
 Most women are not aware of the implications of these
 alternatives, however. Often a married woman is unable to
 obtain a bank loan without the signature of her husband, and
 likewise an unmarried woman must obtain the signature of her
 
 
 23
 BOTSWANA
 father. The Government has assisted in the publication of a
 women's rights handbook, and has established preference points
 for women seeking government-sponsored development loans.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Botswana law prevents the employment of children 12 years and
 younger by anyone except members of the child's immediate
 family. No juvenile under the age of 15 can be employed in
 industry, and only those over 16 can be employed in night work.
 No person 16 or younger is permitted to work in hazardous
 jobs, including mining. Women are not permitted to work at
 night (except on an emergency basis in agricultural work) and
 are not permitted to work as miners. Moreover, Botswana law
 protects young people from recruiters for jobs outside the
 country. The law also provides for minimum working standards,
 including job safety, maximum working hours per week, and a
 minimum wage. For some jobs during certain seasons, Botswana
 law permits a workweek longer than 48 hours (such as in
 agriculture during the harvest season).
