 ITALY
 Italy has been a democratic republic since June 2, 1946,
 when the monarchy was abolished by popular referendum.
 The Constitution provides for a bicameral parliament
 (proportional representation), a separate judiciary and
 an executive branch composed of a cabinet headed by a
 prime minister. The President of the Republic, elected
 by Parliament for a single seven year term, nominates
 the Prime Minister and is empowered to dissolve Parliament.
 Since 1976, the country has had a Christian Democrat
 minority government supported in Parliament by most of
 the other parties. Italian law fully guarantees the
 integrity of the person, freedom from cruel or inhuman
 punishment, arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and the
 right to a fair public trial. Civil rights and political
 liberties continue to be respected despite the provoca-
 tion of continuing terrorism which has led to the killing
 and wounding of Italian citizens in the past few years.
 Administrative reforms designed to make security forces
 more effective have been implemented with full respect
 for Italian law. The Italian Government has an excellent
 record in supporting human rights throughout the world.
 For instance, it has expressed strong indignation over
 the treatment of Soviet dissidents and has been actively
 supportive of Jewish emigration from the USSR. It has
 evenhandedly condemned human rights violations in Chile,
 Argentina, Africa and the Arab territories occupied by
 Israel.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence of any such practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of any such practice.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Reale Law, which was passed in 1975 in reaction to
 a rising level of terrorism and confirmed by a public
 referendum in June 1978, establishes broad powers of
 arrest and imprisonment. Specifically, the law contains
 provisions on: limitation of granting provisional liberty
 on bail; refusal to free prisoners even when the maximum
 term for the crime with which they are charged has elapsed
 before a trial has begun; detention of suspects even in
 cases where a crime is not in progress; search without
 warrant in cases of exceptional need; prohibition of dis-
 guise or attempts to make physical identification difficult;
 seizure of arms; prohibition of attempts to reconstruct
 "the Fascist Party;" authorization of use of arms by
 police; increased penalties for accomplices in crimes
 against persons and property and for receiving stolen goods;
 prohibition of unauthorized meetings; special surveillance
 and obligatory residence; and expulsion of non-Italian
 citizens.
 An April 1977 decree law repealed earlier legislation which
 provided for automatic provisional release of prisoners
 whose pre-trial detention exceeded four years. The 1977
 Law allows pre-trial detention to exceed four years in
 those cases where the defense has "deliberately obstructed"
 the course of justice. Like the Reale Law, the 1977 Decree
 was intended to strengthen the Government's hand against
 terrorism. It was prompted specifically by a sustained
 terrorist campaign of murder and intimidation against sitting
 or prospective judges and juries. The Department of State
 knows of no cases in which the Government has employed
 these or any other laws for the purposes of unreasonable
 arrest, detention or imprisonment.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed; Although there can be
 lengthy administrative delays caused by crowded dockets,
 shortage of government legal staff and elaborate appellate
 procedures, the Government has gone to extraordinary lengths
 to provide orderly public trials and full legal guarantees
 to accused terrorists and to dissidents.
 
 
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is no evidence of such practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Italy has an extensive system of social welfare benefits
 and pensions covering old age, retirement, health, edu-
 cation and unemployment.
 There is widespread national agreement that the systems
 involved are in bad need of overhaul and improved manage-
 ment but no consensus exists on how to effect reform.
 Huge operating deficits have been difficult to eliminate
 in the face of resistance from political parties, other
 interest groups such as labor, and the recipient class.
 Student militancy and party inactivity have helped make
 much-needed university reform impossible. In general, the
 problems today reflect the shaping of public policy over
 the years more by short-term needs of political parties
 than by concern for fair and effective distribution of
 public resources.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are fully in effect. The only legal
 restraints are those on violence to life, property or
 civil rights for avowedly political purposes. Certain
 of these freedoms, such as free speech and assembly,
 are occasionally undermined by the intimidating actions
 of extremist groups, most often of the left.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In reaction to more than 20 years of fascist rule between
 
 
 473
 the World Wars, Italian governments have been scrupulous
 in defense of the fundamental rights and freedoms of
 individuals and groups. Trade unions are strong and free
 to pursue their objectives as they see best. The rights
 of women, who enjoy full economic rights, have been given
 progressively greater legal expression over the years.
 The most recent example is abortion legislation, passed
 in 1977, although cultural and religious resistance to
 its full implementation persists. In some areas, notably
 the rural south, there remains a tendency to cast women
 into traditional roles and limit their freedom of action
 accordingly.
 4. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No such investigations have been sought with regard to
 the human rights situation in Italy.
 
 
 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy under a consti-
 tutional monarchy. Many of Luxembourg's leaders still
 bear the psychological scars of incarceration during
 the Nazi occupation and are zealous to ensure that
 human rights are scrupulously respected.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in prac-
 tice.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Luxembourg enjoys a per capita income of about $6,500,
 making it one of the most affluent countries in Europe.
 The Government seeks to ensure that these benefits are
 distributed equitably throughout the economy. Luxem-
 bourg pursues a liberal wage and social benefit policy
 and wages, benefits and pensions are indexed in a
 generalized system with almost immediate trigger
 points. The 1979 budget continues the governing coa-
 lition's efforts to improve social conditions by
 creating more jobs, increasing family assistance and
 aiding the handicapped. Luxembourg has one of the
 lowest value-added tax levels in Europe and one of the
 highest levels of graduated direct taxes. There is a
 relative absence of class distinction and a common
 education system serving all economic levels.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of domestic and foreign travel and of
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. Legislative power isvested in an assembly
 elected by universal suffrage. Labor is free to
 organize and the labor movement is well developed.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The question of outside investigation of the human
 rights situation in Luxembourg has not arisen.
