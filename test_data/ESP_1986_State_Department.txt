 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch. The fundamental rights of speech, assembly, press,
 religion, movement, and participation in the political process
 are guaranteed in the Constitution of 1978. These rights
 extend to all and are respected in practice. At all levels of
 government, elections must be held every 4 years. Voter
 participation is high in these free and open elections.
 The Spanish economy is mixed, with primary reliance on private
 initiative and market mechanisms. Although the economy is
 healthy, Spain currently has a high degree of unemployment,
 due in part to the Government's efforts to control inflation
 and reduce budget deficits. Women, youth, and minorities are
 disproportionately affected by the unemployment.
 Human rights enjoy great respect in Spain. Charges of abuse
 of human rights most often occur in connection with political
 terrorism. Although it is government policy to reduce and
 eliminate antiterrorist violence, some law enforcement
 officers have been found guilty of mistreatment of presumed
 terrorists. In addition, the antiterrorist law has been
 criticized for not providing basic legal rights during the
 first 10 days of detention.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to the Minister of the Interior, in the first 7
 months of 1986, there were 179 terrorist actions in Spain,
 killing 34 persons and wounding 100. Most of the terrorism
 was either claimed by or attributable to the Basque separatist
 group ETA-M (Basque Fatherland and Freedom Group). While the
 numbers themselves do not indicate an increase in terrorist
 activity, the public perception is that the situation is
 worsening. Recent attacks attributable to ETA-M have killed
 or wounded more civilians because of the increased use of car
 bombs. There have also been relatively more attacks in
 Madrid, although the bulk of ETA-M actions still occur in the
 Basque provinces. Terrorist activity by foreign groups
 included a bomb attack against the El Al airline at the Madrid
 airport. An alleged member of the Palestinian terrorist group
 Abu Musa was arrested in connection with this incident.
 The final coroner's report on the 1985 case of alleged ETA
 activist Mikel Zabalza supported the police version of the
 incident--that Zabalza accidentally drowned in the Bidasoa
 River while attempting to escape from police custody, No one
 has been arrested and convicted in this case, and the case has
 been closed.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no claims that police or government security forces
 have carried out secret arrests or kidnapings. The Basque
 separatist group ETA-M engaged in one kidnaping for ransom in
 1986.

 SPAIN
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government security forces have been accused, and in some
 cases convicted, of mistreating prisoners, chiefly in
 terrorism-related cases. According to the Ministry of
 Interior, 376 persons were arrested under the antiterrorist
 law in the first 9 months of 1986. Of this number, 161 were
 prosecuted. The majority of those arrested under the
 antiterrorist law filed complaints of police brutality,
 including torture. In the first 9 months of 1986, 811 such
 complaints were made. The Government asserts that a detainee
 under the antiterrorist law routinely lodges a complaint of
 police brutality or torture whether or not there is cause.
 For the first time, a detainee who complained of police
 brutality was sentenced in 1986 to 6 months' imprisonment for
 a false denunciation. The sentence is under appeal.
 Nevertheless, there is evidence that police brutality and/or
 torture occurs, especially in connection with the
 antiterrorist law. Early in 1986, the courts sentenced some
 39 members of security forces for mistreatment of prisoners
 arrested under the antiterrorist law, many of the cases going
 back a number of years. There are presently two cases of
 alleged police brutality which involve police lieutenants.
 Also, a case has been brought against a high-ranking Interior
 Ministry official for his alleged coverup of police brutality
 when he was Chief of Police in the Basque city of Bilbao. In
 addition, the Provincial Court of Madrid has asked the Supreme
 Court to inquire into the responsibility of the Interior
 Minister for the application of the antiterrorist law to a
 common criminal called "El Nani" in 1983. "El Nani"
 disappeared during the period of incommunicado detention. In
 August and September 1986, the Government refused a court
 order for 90 members of the Guardia Civil to appear in
 connection with charges of police brutality. The Government
 claimed that public identification in the Basque country
 raises serious problems of security for the persons
 concerned. Critics charge that failure to obey the court
 order is an obstruction of justice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 In general, people are free from arbitrary arrest and
 detention. Many criticize the antiterrorist law, however, for
 providing a period of incommunicado detention which lends
 itself to police brutality and torture. A detainee under the
 antiterrorist law must be brought to the court's attention
 during the first 72 hours of detention, but the court has
 discretion to extend the period prior to arraignment for
 another 7 days. A person detained under the antiterrorist law
 has to be informed of his rights and the reason for arrest.
 The detainee may not choose his own lawyer; instead, one is
 provided to him from the private (and independent) association
 of lawyers. There is no provision for an independent medical
 examination. The Government contends that allowing the
 detainee to choose his own attorney or doctor might enable him
 to communicate with accomplices outside. The appointed
 attorney formally advises the detainee of his rights,
 including the right to remain silent, and is present during
 his interrogation. However, he may not consult with the
 detainee until the interrogation is completed.
 There is no exile or forced labor in Spain.

 SPAIN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is observed in practice. The law provides for
 an expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. Defendants
 may always appeal to the next highest court, and up to the
 Council of Europe in cases concerning human rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Privacy of home and correspondence is protected by the
 Constitution. Under the Criminal Code, government authorities
 must obtain court approval before searching private property,
 wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the
 Minister of Interior to act prior to obtaining court approval
 "in cases of emergency." However, there have been no
 complaints that the Minister has abused this discretion.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government scrupulously observes the guarantee of free
 speech and press provided in the Constitution. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely expressed in speech and through the
 media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. About 14 percent of the
 Spanish work force is unionized. Trade unions are not
 subjected to official harassment. They freely maintain ties
 with recognized international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have the freedom to travel in and outside the
 country. The Government restricts neither emigration nor
 repatriation. A law controlling the residence of aliens, of
 which there are some 700,000, is under constitutional
 challenge. One of the most frequent criticisms of this law is
 that it permits the detention of an alien, often for long
 periods, until his expulsion. After a series of
 demonstrations by non-Spanish (primarily Moslem) residents in
 the North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla, the Government
 has agreed to help resolve outstanding problems and has
 appointed a representative as special advisor to the Minister
 of the Interior. The non-Spanish Moslems continue to object,
 nevertheless, that the law on residence of aliens
 discriminates against them and that it is being applied in an
 uneven manner.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in
 which all citizens over the age of 18 have the right to
 participate. Opposition groups exist openly and take
 active part in the political process. Free and actively
 contested elections to the national Parliament, as well as to
 several regional parliaments, were held in 1986.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains good relations with international
 human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as with
 national groups, such as the Spanish Human Rights
 Association. The Foreign Ministry, through an Office of Human
 Rights Affairs, takes an active interest in human rights
 issues internationally.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Education and economic and social services are generally
 available to all without discrimination of any kind.
 Spain's Constitution guarantees women the same rights as men.
 In practice, however, there is evidence of discrimination in
 terms of employment and advancement. In addition, many
 Spanish women accept traditional limitations on opportunity.
 Because of this, the Women's Institute, a part of the Ministry
 of Culture, has as one of its major goals the education of
 women regarding their options. To this end, the Women's
 Institute, during the past year, has instituted training
 courses for women and is developing a pilot program to help
 housewives reenter the work force. The Women's Institute also
 has planned for 1987 a series of television advertisements
 which will make women aware of the range of job options open
 to them. Another area in which the Women's Institute has
 effected a great advance is that of battered women. In
 addition to the shelters which it has established for
 counselling, the Women's Institute has worked closely with the
 police to create special sections operated by female police
 officers within police stations in order to give women
 confidence to present complaints of abuse or rape.
 Gypsies are a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 Spanish population. They sometimes suffer discrimination in
 housing, schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms exist by which
 they can seek redress, for example, from discrimination by an
 employer. As a practical matter, however, Gypsies do not
 normally seek such redress. Gypsies still suffer from
 occasional violence, in which racism may be one element. In
 the village of Martos in Andalucia, some 200 townspeople
 burned 30 Gypsy homes on July 12, 1986. The Government is
 committed to securing equal rights and treatment for Gypsies.
 To that end, the Government has appointed a representative of
 the Gypsy community as special advisor to the Minister of
 Interior.

 SPAIN
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Workers in general have substantial well-defined rights. A
 40-hour week was established by law in 1983, Spanish workers
 also enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid
 vacation. A minimum wage tied to the cost of living is
 provided by law. Children under 16 years of age may not be
 employed. Working and health conditions are generally good.
 Workers in the underground economy, estimated to be as high as
 25 percent in some areas, do not have the same protections and
 benefits as those in the open economy.
