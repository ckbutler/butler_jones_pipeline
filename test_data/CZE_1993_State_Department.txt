 CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic came into existence on January 1, 1993, when the constituent
 republics of Czechoslovakia became independent following the dissolution of the
 Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. The victorious parties in the June 1992 Czecho-
 slovak elections negotiated arrangements for the split during the latter half of 1992.
 The new Czech Constitution was ratified on December 16 of that year.
 The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy. The coalition Government is
 led by the Civic Democratic Party, a conservative secular free market-oriented party
 whose leader, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, is the architect of the country's eco-
 nomic reform. The Czech Republic adopted the democratic civil structures created
 in the 3 years following the 1989 revolution in Czechoslovakia. Vaclav Havel, Presi-
 dent of the Czech Republic, is an internationally recognized advocate of human
 rights and social justice.
 Thc Ministry of the Interior oversees intelligence and police matters. The security
 structures are currently in flux, as the Government redefines the tasks and reduces
 the number (currently four) of intelligence agencies. Two of these agencies, the In-
 telligence Service of the General Staff and the Military Counterintelligence Service
 are integrated into the Ministry of Defense. The External Intelligence and Informa-
 tion Service is an integral part of the Ministry of the Interior. Parliament supervises
 the Internal Security and Information Service, which is independent of ministry con-
 trol. During 1993, the press criticized this latter agency, casting doubts on the com-
 petence and loyalty of its leadership and focusing especially on purported organiza-
 tional and managerial shortcomings.
 Economic reforms continued to transform the Czech Republic in 1993, although
 the split from the Slovak Republic had a short-term negative effect, primarily in the
 
 
 850
 volume of trade. Privatization of small enterprises was completed, but some of the
 most difficult challenges in restructuring large industrial firms remained. By the
 end of 1993, the private sector contributed approximately 45 percent of gross domes-
 tic product, up from less than 5 percent in 1989. The Government followed firm
 macroeconomic policies, resulting in a stable currency and a budget surplus. During
 1993, the economic decline that had been a result of the transformation to a market
 economy bottomed out, and analysts foresaw slow but steady growth with continued
 low unemployment in the years ahead.
 A number of independent human rights monitoring groups, as well as the Govern-
 ment, conducted studies of human rights issues, including the situation of the Roma
 (Gypsy) minority. Human rights abuses identified by these institutions--as well as
 by the press-included discrimination against the Rlma minority; perceived attacks
 on press freedom; and the continued presence in Czech law of screening require-
 ments aimed at those accused of collaborating with the pre-1989 Communist re-
 gime. Questions about women's rights, including violence against women, are still
 relegated to the margins of social and political debate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or extrajudicial killings
 were known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions, disappearances, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no evidence of any such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Czech Republic assumed Czechoslo-
 vak laws governing arrest and related rights. Courts issue arrest warrants. Persons
 may be held without charge for 24 hours, during which time the arrestee has the
 right to consult with counsel. There was no evidence of any incommunicado deten-
 tion or protective detention. A person charged with a crime has the right to appear
 before a judge for arraignment. At arraignment, if charges are formalized, the judge
 determines whether custody is necessary pending trial. Pretrial custody may not ex-
 ceed 1 year and in such cases monthly appearances before a judge are required.
 Counsel and family visits are available. These guidelines are followed in practice.
 There is no exile in law or in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system consists of district, regional, and
 high courts. A Supreme Court, the highest court of appeal, was established early
 in 1993. In addition, a Constitutional Court, which rules separately on the constitu-
 tionality of legislation, was created early in the year and began deliberations in De-
 cember. Military courts, which have jurisdiction over police, intelligence, and mili-
 tary matters, were abolished at the end of 1993, and their functions were taken over
 by the civil courts.
 The judiciary is impartial and independent. Justice Ministry officials and press
 observers noted that the shortage of qualified judges (a problem under the Czecho-
 slovak Federation) is slowly being overcome.
 Persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair and open public trials.
 They have the right to be informed of the charges against them and of their legal
 rights, to retain and consult with counsel, and to present a defense. If a defendant
 cannot afford a lawyer, the State provides one. Defendants enjoy the presumption
 of innocence and have the right to refuse to testify against themselves. Defendants
 may appeal any judgments against them. These rights are observed in practice.
 The Czech    Republic adopted, with   some modifications, the    1991 federal
 "lustration" law, and the Czech Parliament retained the commission created in 1992
 to enforce its provisions. The law bars many former Communist party officials,
 members of the People's Militia, and secret police collaborators from holding a wide
 range of elective, nominative, and appointive offices, including appointive positions
 in state-owned companies academe and the media for a period of 5 years.
 Late in 1992, the Czechoslovak Federal Constitutional Court eliminated the so-
 called Category C list (those listed as collaborators but who in fact may only have
 been intelligence targets). The Czech Republic accepted this federal ruling in 1993.
 Although the screening law is still on the books, it is rarely used. Many observers--
 including Communist party members and human rights monitors--consider the law
 a dead letter, though parliamentarians still claim that it can limit careers and affect
 the structure of public office. One Communist party official asserted that the most
 significant result of the screening legislation at present is that it hurts the inter-
 national image of the Czech Republic.
 
 
 851
 The screening process was criticized because it was based on the records of the
 Communist secret police, records many suspected were incomplete or unreliable.
 There is no judicial mechanism for appeal of screening decisions, though the Interior
 Ministry retained an internal board of appeals to review those decisions. The screen-
 ing law was criticized, both domestically and internationally (it was cited in reports
 by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council
 of Europe) as a violation of human rights principles prohibiting discrimination in
 employment and condemning collective guilt. Foreign ministry officials claim that
 in 1993 bth the CSCE and the Council of Europe informed them that neither orga-
 nization viewed lustration as a serious human rights problem in the Czech Republic.
 Similarly, labor ministry officials note that in 1993 the International Labor Organi-
 zation did not renew its previous criticism of hstration with the advent of the new
 Czech State.
 In a July law, Parliament defined the pre-1989 Communist regime as criminal
 and expressly lifted the statute of limitations for crimes committed by the Com-
 munist Party of Czechoslovakia during its 40-year rule. The law was criticized by
 human rights activists for adopting the principle of collective guilt. In late Novem-
 ber, Parliament passed a new Criminal Code containing provisions forbidding defa-
 mation of the State and the Presidency. The Constitutional Court in December
 upheld both these controversial laws. There were no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Elec-
 tronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a
 court order. The Government complied with this requirement. In September the
 press reported that listening devices had been found in the Justice Minister's office.
 There were no reports of arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Czech law provides for freedom of speech and
 press. Individuals may, and do, speak out on political and other issues and freely
 criticize the Government and public figures. A wide variety of newspapers, maga-
 zines, and journals continued to be published in 1993. As an illustration, Prague,
 with a population of 1.25 million, is home to at least a dozen dailies with national
 distribution, as well as a variety of entertainment and special interest newspapers.
 Some newspapers are associated with the interests of political parties, but even
 most of these were sufficiently independent to criticize their main ideological backer
 on occasion. The print media enjoyed the right to publish without censorship or fear
 of government persecution, though the ruling Civic Democratic Party in public state-
 ments often criticized what it called the immaturity and lack of ethical behavior
 among print journalists.
 The electronic media are independent. Some television channels are privately
 owned. A parliamentary commission has broad oversight and power to approve or
 reject candidates for the independent Television and Radio Council. The Council has
 responsibility for policymaking in television and radio as well as granting licenses.
 Since January 1993, under the media law the Television and Radio Council granted
 1 television icense, more than 10 radio licenses, and over 30 television cable li-
 censes.
 The Civic Democratic Party was critical of the electronic media as well. In Janu-
 ary party figures criticized a decision by the Television and Radio Council to award
 a broadcast license to the Cet-21 firm for a Czech television channel. Some Civic
 Democrats had apparently hoped another bidder would win the contract and pro-
 tested the decision. This lack of distinction between public and private interest was
 apparent in the stated desire of Prime Minister Klaus to acquire a government sta-
 tion so that the Government "has enough space to explain to the people what it
 deems necessary to explain."
 Despite criticism from the Prime Minister and members of his party, the media,
 both print and electronic, continued to express a wide variety of views on most topi-
 cal issues. There was no official censorship.
 Universities have the authority to decide their internal affairs, including peda-
 gogic and academic orientation and internal structure. Academic freedom is pro-
 vided for by law, though the same law forbids activities by established political par-
 ties at the university.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Czech law provides for the
 right of persons to assemble peacefully. Permits for some public demonstrations are
 required by law but are rarely refused. Police generally do not interfere with sponta-
 neous peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lack a permit. Such police be-
 havior is perhaps due to sensitivity about the actions of police against peaceful as-
 semblies in the not-too-distant Communist past.
 
 
 852
 The right of persons to associate freely and to form political parties and move-
 ments is also protected by law and respected in practice. Organizations, associa-
 tions, foundations, and political parties are required to register with local officials
 or at the Interior Ministry, but there is no evidence that this registration is coercive.
 The Communist Party is represented in Parliament and in local government and
 continues to own considerable assets throughout the Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Czech Republic enjoys religious freedom. There is no
 official religion, and no religion is banned or discouraged by law. The Government
 has not yet resolved the problem of the restitution of church property though the
 issue has been the subject of considerable debate inside the ruling coalition, which
 includes two Christian Democratic parties. Claims for the restitution of Jewish
 property are still outstanding as well, but a law has been drafted that would grant
 the Jewish community some property previously owned by Jews, not as a precedent
 for restitution, but as a gift from the State.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Czech Republic has no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel,
 emigration, and repatriation. Passports are readily available to all wishing to travel
 abroad. Czechs who emigrated during the period of Communist rule frequently re-
 turn to visit, or even to settle, and are able to regain Czech citizenship if they wish,
 though to do so they must relinquish claim to any foreign citizenship. Citizenship
 is not revoked for political reasons. A few localities have issued ordinances requiring
 nonresidents to prove that they have a place to live, a job, and no criminal record.
 These ordinances, specifically aimed at minorities (Roma or Asian) in the towns of
 Jirkov, Dubi, and Brandys nad Labem, have received extensive press coverage and
 criticism from human rights groups (see Section 5).
 Refugees and asylum seekers are treated according to international norms. With
 the exception of over 2,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia, most migrants
 used the Czech Republic as a transit route toward the West. (The number of mi-
 grants crossing Czech territory en route to Germany peaked at midyear and fell
 drastically after the implementation of a new asylum law in Germany in July.)
 Those granted refugee status are given permission to reside in the Czech Republic
 for 5 years, followed by a formal review whereby they may obtain permanent resi-
 dence. A lengthy procedure to apply for naturalization is also open to them. Non-
 governmental organizations work closely with Interior Ministry officials to ease ref-
 ugees' transition into Czech society. In practice, however, m-st potential refugees
 choose to apply for permanent settlement elsewhere.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens of the Czech Republic have the right to change their government by
 democratic means. Citizens over the age of 18 are eligible to vote in republicwide
 and local elections. Voting is carried out by secret ballot. Opposition groups, includ-
 In  political parties, function openly and participate without hindrance in the politi-
 cal process.
 The ruling four-party right-of-center coalition was formed in June 1992, at the
 time of the last election in Czechoslovakia. There are also a number of left-of-center
 opposition parties and one party of the radical right. The Czech Constitution man-
 dates elections at least every 4 years to the Parliament, based on proportional rep-
 resentation within eight large electoral districts. There is a 5-percent threshold for
 parties to enter the Parliament. The Constitution also calls for an upper house of
 Parliament, the Senate, which in 1993 had yet to be constituted; the first senatorial
 election should take place in 1994, although legislation defining its procedures re-
 mains to be adopted. The President, who is elected by the Parliament, serves a 5-
 year term. The President has limited constitutional powers but may use a suspen-
 sive veto to return legislation to Parliament, which has the right to override the
 President's veto.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics. Women appear to participate less in the public sphere, both in the work force
 and in public office since the overthrow of the Communist regime. Relatively few
 women hold high public office in the Czech Republic, though women serve as may-
 ors and parliamentary deputies.
 The two significant minorities--Rma and Slovaks-are not represented as such
 in Czech politics. The government- sponsored Council on National Minorities, which
 has representatives from all minority groups, plans to release a comprehensive mi-
 nority polc paper early in 1994. No minority leader holds significant elective office
 at the republic or local level. Slovaks, of whom there are an estimated 300,000, are
 primarily "Czechoslovaks" who elected to live in the Czech Republic after the split,
 
 
 853
 and who for the most part define their interests in the context of Czech politics, not
 along ethnic lines. Many serve in high positions in the civil service.
 Not all the estimated 200,000 Roma have integrated into Czech society, and the
 party that represented their interests immediately following the demise of com-
 munism, the Roma Civic Initiative, is in disarray. Other local Roma political
 groupings have not gained republicwide prominence. The political culture of the
 Czech Republic generally defines Rma as outsiders, and the Roma themselves have
 been unable to unite behind a program or set of ideals that would allow them to
 represent their interests in the democratic structures of the country (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigat ion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Czech Republic encourages the activities of domestic and international
 human rights organzations. The Presidency of former dissident and human rights
 monitor Vaclav Havel serves as a powerful moral magnet for these groups, which
 work without government interference or difficulty. Czech officials generally cooper-
 ate with official and unofficial visits by foreign human rights monitors or human
 rights officials representing countries or multilateral organizations. A study of
 human rights in the Czech Republic by the CSCE concluded there were no signifi-
 cant violations of international human rights standards, and a Council of Europe
 report determined that there were no human rights obstacles to Czech admission
 to the Council.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination. Health
 care, education, retirement, and other social services generally are provided without
 regard to race, sex, religion, disability, or social status. In practice, rma sometimes
 face discrimination in such areas as educational opportunity.
 Women.-Women are equal under the law and receive pay equal to that of male
 colleagues for the same job, though the median wages for women in 1993 lagged sig-
 nificantly behind those of men. In the Czech economy, women appear to be con-
 centrated in professions in which the median salary is generally low  medicine
 teaching, white-collar clerical jobs. Women enjoy equal property, inheritance, and
 other legal rights with men. Public debate about violence towards women remains
 nearly nonexistent, despite the efforts of a handful of women's groups to bring this
 and other issues to the attention of the public. Police and human rights grous
 sometimes link violence toward women with economic hardship and excessive dri-
 ing but without any hard facts. Justice officials claim that laws against violence are
 effectively enforced, and human rights groups do not contradict them.
 A more public issue-and one that has gained considerable attention in the
 press--is the growth of prostitution, which has beome inreasingly visible. For the
 most part, prostitutes are in business for themselves, but underground elements,
 often also involved in smuggling and petty crine, oerce some women into prostitu-
 tion. The law does not explicitly protect prostitutes against trafficking and sexual
 exploitation.
 Children.--Government expenditure on children's welfare is adequate. Children
 g enerally receive sufficient health care, ompulsory education, and basic nutrition.
 Sme Roma children do not receive these benefits, hut this is less the result of gov-
 ernnment policy than of cultural differences and instances of social prejudice. Child
 abuse as a social problem began to receive attention in the press in 1993.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-By far the most significant minority in the
 Czech Republic is the Roma population, estimated at about 200,000. Roma live
 throughout the country but are concentrated in the industrisl towns of northern Bo-
 hiemia, where many of them were settled more than 40years ago in the homes of
 Sudeten Germans transferred to the West. They suffer disproportionally from pov-
 erty, crime, and disease. Efforts by foundations and by persons in the education and
 health fields to improve their living conditions, especially the conditions of Rma
 children, have had only minimal impact. Efforts by lcal leaders to mobilize local
 Roma communities, especially in the north, generally have failed.
 Roma suffer from serious popular prejudice in the Czech Republic. Rsms leaders
 claim that Roma are discriminated against in employment, housing, and everyday
 life. A significant example was the passage late in 1992 of decrees in the town of
 Jirkov (northern Bohemia), which assessed fines against those who had not gained
 prior permission from the owner to live in an apartment and gave the town council
 the right to evict apartment oncupants without a court order, if the council deter-
 minedthey were in violation of hygienic rules and local regulations. Furthermore,
 the decree required those who could not prove they belonged in a residence to leave
 
 
 854
 town. The town council openly admitted the ordinance was aimed at dealing with
 the overcrowding of apartments by Roma. The district prosecutor in the Jirkov area
 said that the ordinance violated  Rpublic law and should be rescinded. They were
 in fact ruled invalid by the courts but not explicitly rescinded by the municipality.
 These decrees were followed later in the year by similar proclamations in the towns
 of Dubi and, closer to Prague, Brandys nad Labem. In Brandys, local officials told
 the press that the decrees were aimed at regulating the influx of Asian immigrants
 who illegally occupied local housing.
 Another celebrated incident took place in March at the Miss Czech Republic beau-
 ty pageant, at which one aspirant for the crown described her goal as ridding her
 (North Bohemian) town of dark-skinned people. Such attitudes were encouraged by
 the rightwing SPR-RPC (Republican) Party, which offered an expensive sports car
 to the authorities of any city hall who rid their town of Roma. In some instances,
 fi     has occurred, and, in at least four cases, an ethnic Czech or Roa has been
 ki ed. Newspapers reports often link such violence with skinhead provocations.
 Such was certmnly the case in incidents in Plzen and Pisek in the fall, in each of
 which a young Roms died as a result of skinhead violence. There are credible re-
 ports that police ignore or condone incidents of violence against the Rama, although
 the Government has denounced such violence.
 Rma protest the Czech Republic's citizenship law, which prevents persons who
 have had a criminal conviction in the last 5 years from gaing citizenship. The
 central issue, as in moat issues affecting Rms, is cultural: ethnic Czechs see 5
 years as reasonable, Rma see it as punitive. Rams comprise a disproportionate per-
 cntage of those arrested, charged, and convicted of criminal offenses. Rama leaders
 protest that this provision of the law is designed to discriminate against Rams. The
 Czech Government in 1993 established a Commission on Minorities, which is widely
 regarded as ineffective in dealing with problems facing the Rams. he Government
 is not overtly e an msalthough domestic policies tend to neglect the seriousness
 of the Roma issue. In a well-known incident, one high official, Prosecutor General
 Jiri Setina, publicly criticized Rma. (stina lost his job later in the year for reasons
 unrelated to his statements about the Rms.)
 Religious Minorites.-The Jewish community in the Czech Republic numbers a
 few thousand. Legal charges of slander and infringement of the rihts of others,
 brought against the editor of the openly anti-somitic magazine Politsa, which
 ceased publication late in 1992, are still pending in a local oravian court. In No-
 vember a Brno man was sentenced to prson for extortion and scaremongering for
 telephone threats against Jewish citizens and community buildings. There was little
 additional evidence of public anti-Semitism, and the leaders of the Jewish commu-
 nit enjoyed close relations with government officials and other political leaders.
 eolgwith Disabiities.-A heretofore generous  vernment policy of support for
 the disabled is being reduced for financial reasons.g adard for rceiving disability
 pensions are reportedly applied more strictly to Rams than to other citizens, though
 anecdotal evidence suggests that in the past a higher percentage of the Rmam quali-
 fied for disability payments than of the population at large. The Government has
 not plaed a high priority on the issue of ensuring access or the disabled, nor has
 discrimination against the disabled been the subject of significant policy or public
 debate.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Czech Republic preserved legislation passed by
 the Czechoslovak Parliament between 1990 and 1992 guaranteeing workers the
 right to form and join unions of their own choosing without prior authorization.
 Trade union leaders protested a law drafted by the Government that would have
 forbidden civil service workers from joining unions, claiming that such a law vio-
 lated not only International Labor Organization (ILO) statutes but the Czech Con-
 stitution as well. At year's end, the draft law had not yet been debated in Par-
 liament. More than 60  rcent of the work force is unionized, though the number
 of workers who are memers of labor organizations continued to fall steadily.
 Most workers are members of unions affiliated with the Czech-Moravian Chamber
 of Trade Unions (CMKOS), which took over the central union role held by the Czech
 and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS) following the dissolution of the
 federation. CMKOS is a democratically oriented, republicwide umbrella organization
 for unions not affiliated with political parties.
 CSKOS continued to represent some elements of Czech (and Slovak) trade union
 interests, especially in contacts with international organizations, until it was dis-
 banded in November. Some small independent trade unions outside of CMKOS also
 exist, including one principally led by former Communist trade union officials and
 one based on Christian union principles.
 
 
 Workers have the right to strike, except for those in specific professions whose
 role in public order or public safety is deemed crucial: judges, prosecutors, members
 of the armed forces and the police, air traffic controllers, nuclear power station
 workers, workers with nuclear materials, and oil or gas pipeline workers. The law
 also places some limitation on the right to strike of firefighting and rescue workers,
 telecommunications workers, and health workers. The law requires that labor dis-
 putes be subject first to mediation and that strikes take place only after mediation
 efforts fail. Strikes were almost unheard of in 1993. In one instance, CSKOS and
 CMKOS leaders alleged that the Government sought to intimidate subway workers
 who threatened to strike by publishing their names in the press. The issues over
 which the strike was to occur were settled before it could take place. Railway work-
 ers threatened a major strike in December over government rollbacks of traditional
 union benefits. The strike was averted at the last minute by the Government's deci-
 sion to negotiate about these benefits.
 Czech unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate
 with and participate in international bodies. This freedom was fully exercised. The
 International Labor Organization's complaint against the Czechoslovak Federa-
 tion-that the lustration law (which prevents former leaders of the Communist re-
 gime from holding high public office) represented an instance of employment dis-
 crimination-was dropped in 1993 with the accession of the Czech Republic to the
 ILO, according to Labor Ministry officials.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law guarantees collective
 bargaining. The basic collective bargaining instrument in the Czech Republic is the
 law on collective bargaining. It is carried out in the tripartite system, a voluntary
 arrangement in which representatives of unions, government, and employers set the
 parameters of labor relations. At various times throughout the year, CMKOS point-
 ed to what it saw as Government violations of tripartite agreements. Union and
 Government leaders generally settled such disagreements by negotiation. Wages are
 set by free negotiation, though an upper limit was established by law in July, much
 to the consternation of some union leaders. Charges of antiunion discrimination may
 be filed in court. Labor Ministry officials were unable to say if court proceedings had
 led to reinstatement or other actions.
 The Czech Republic has one export processing zone. Its workers have and practice
 the same right to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Legislation inherited from the fed-
 eration, which enshrined elements of international human rights agreements, pro-
 hibited forced or compulsory labor. There was no evidence that such practices oc-
 curred.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code stipulates that
 children must be 15 years of age before they may work in the Czech Republic. Those
 who have completed courses at special schools (that is, schools for the severely dis-
 abled) may work at the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards. The established minimum wage provides an adequate standard of living for
 an individual worker and, when combined with allowances available to families with
 children, provides an adequate standard of living for a worker and a family. The
 minimum wage is roughly equal to $75 per month (thus around one-third of the av-
 erage monthly wage of $220). Major efforts at retraining, also carried out by district
 labor offices, seek to provide labor mobility for those at the lower end of the wage
 scale. Because positive trends in the economy in 1993 led to a tight job market, the
 enforcement of minimum wage standards was rarely an issue.
 The law mandates a standard workweek of 42/2 hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8V2-hour workday, as well as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime may not exceed 150 hours per year or 8 hours
 per week as standard practice. The Labor Ministry, responsible for enforcement of
 overtime regulations, said the phenomenal growth of the private sector, especially
 in small service enterprises, made it very difficult to assess overtime abuses.
 Government, unions, and employers have agreed to advance worker safety and
 health, but conditions in some sectors of heavy industry remained substandard, es-
 pecially in those sectors awaiting the process of privatization. Industrial accident
 rates are not unusually high. In contrast, the incidence of long-term health prob-
 lems in areas suffering from heavy industrial pollution is, in fact, unusually high
 by international standards. The Office of Labor Safety is responsible for enforcement
 of health and safety standards.
