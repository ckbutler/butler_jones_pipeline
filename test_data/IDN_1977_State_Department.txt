 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country
 dispersed across a 3,000 mile long archipelago, has
 developed considerable national unity in spite of a
 great diversity of ethnic, social and religious groups
 and severe economic difficulties. After achieving
 independence from the Dutch in 1945-48, Indonesia
 enjoyed a period of constitutional democracy which
 was gradually displaced in the latter Sukarno years
 by an increasingly authoritarian and repressive system.
 The 1965-66 upheavals, caused by the third unsuccess-
 ful attempt of the then 3.5 million member Indonesian
 Communist Party (PKI) to seize power by force, caused
 a reaction by Indonesian military and civilian elements
 which led to Sukarno's surrender of power to Suharto.
 Since then, Indonesia has had a form of limited demo-
 cracy under a military-backed government which emphasizes
 economic development (particularly agriculture) and
 public order. Of the three parliamentary elections
 held in Indonesia since independence, two have been
 conducted under the present government -- in 1971 and
 1977.
 The principal human rights problem in Indonesia
 continues to be the detention without trial of large
 numbers of persons believed by the government to have
 been associated with the 1965 Communist effort to
 seize power. On the occasion of its release of 2,500
 detainees in December, 1976, the Indonesian Government
 announced a three-year program to release or try the
 approximately 30,000 persons it said were still held.
 The December 1977 release of 10,000 prisoners was the
 first phase in this program. The Indonesian Government
 has recently agreed to a resumption of visits by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to
 prisons and detention centers beginning in January 1978.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is not used by the government as an instrument
 of policy, nor is it officially tolerated by the
 government. Amnesty International has stated that
 it continues to receive reports of torture during
 (234)
 
 
 235
 investigation. There have been some similar reports
 from other sources. The Department of State has not
 been able either to verify or disprove them. There
 is no evidence of systematic torture or police
 brutality.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 are also not used by the government as instruments
 of policy nor officially condoned, but cases of
 mistreatment by individual guards have probably
 occured. Some available evidence, including recent
 reports from foreign journalists and released prisoners,
 indicates that the general conditions of imprisonment
 have improved. However, other statements also indicate
 that some individual prison commanders and guards have
 at times mistreated prisoners. Conditions vary among
 different prisons. All face the general limitations
 of the country which id one of the poorest in the world.
 The Indonesian Covernment has reportedly on occasion
 transferred some prisoners from facilities about to be
 inspected by the ICRC. Agreement has recently been
 reached between the Indonesian Government and the ICRC
 for a resumption of unrestricted ICRC visits to prisons
 and detention centers in Indonesia beginning in January 1978.
 Questions have been raised concerning atrocities
 by Indonesian troops in East Timor in 1975 and 1976
 prior to the incorporation of East Timor into Indo-
 nesia. The Indonesian Government withdrew and
 disciplined offending units guilty of individual
 excesses, but most of the human losses in East Timor
 appear to have occurred prior to Indonesia's inter-
 vention.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1966, following the Communist. Party-instigated
 coup attempt of September 1965 and the subsequent
 outbreak of widespread civil strife, the Indonesian
 Government enacted an Emergency Powers Act. The act
 supplemented a 1963 anti-subversion law that permitted
 detention of suspects without charge for as long as
 one year. At least three hundred thousand persons
 were detained under the 1966 Emergency Powers Act on
 
 
 236
 suspicion of complicity in the attempted coup. Most
 have been freed over the intervening years, and a
 small number were tried before military courts.
 Approximately 20,000 are reported by the Government
 of Indonesia to remain in detention without, as far
 as the Department is aware, formal charges against
 them. Most of these are persons whom the Government
 believes to be hard-core cadres of the Indonesian
 Communist Party (PKI), which claimed 3.5 million
 members in 1965. The Indonesian Government stated in
 late 1977 that 236 of the detainees were persons
 arrested in 1977. The Department of State can neither
 verify nor disprove this figure. In January 1978
 the government arrested several hundred students, the
 great majority of whom were released after several
 days. Amnesty International in a report issued in
 October 1977, stated that it "calculates that there
 are certainly more than 55,000 prisoners held without
 trial in Indonesia, and the actual number of prisoners
 held without trial is probably about 100,000." While
 there may be a reasonable margin of error for the
 number of political prisoners, the Department of
 State has no evidence to support the much higher
 estimates. The government states that no persons
 released from detention have subsequently been re-
 arrested.
 The Indonesian Government announced in December 1976
 that it was releasing immediately 2,500 detainees and
 that all those detained in connection with the 1965 coup
 attempt would be released in phases (10,000 in 1977,
 another 10,000 in 1978, and the balance in 1979) or
 brought to trial before the end of 1979. President
 Suharto personally and publicly confirmed his govern-
 ment's commitment to the release plan in his annual
 state address delivered to the parliament on August 16,
 1977. The promised 1977 releases were carried out on
 December 20 in accordance with the government's
 announced plan.
 At that time, the Indonesian Government also announced
 the number of detainees to be released from each
 detention facility. Diplomatic observers invited to
 attend some of the release ceremonies report that
 those released, with whom they were permitted to talk
 freely, appeared to consider themselves genuinely free
 
 
 237
 and in almost all cases departed for their homes in
 the company of family members, friends or neighbors.
 Foreign newsmen witnessing the release ceremony on
 Buru Island reported that some prisoners released
 there questioned the permanency of their releases.
 In January 1977, the government announced the dis-
 covery of a radical Moslem underground movement
 called Komando Jihad (Holy War Command) which
 allegedly was working to unseat the government by
 unconstitutional means. A total of 783 alleged
 Komando Jihad members reportedly were subsequently
 arrested. Moslem leaders say that many of those
 detained were held for only a few days and then
 released. The government announced on June 7 that
 those clearly implicated in the Komando Jihad move-
 ment who had not already been released would be tried
 shortly. Exact information on the number not yt
 released or tried is not available, but a government
 announcement in early November 1977 indicated that
 at least 46 cases were being processed for trial.
 Also in 1977, the Indonesian Government, having earlier
 released all persons detained without trial in connec-
 tion with the so-called "Malari riots" of January 1974,
 released the last three persons convicted for their
 participation in the riots pending hearings on their
 appeals of those convictions.
 The government has also announced its intention to
 improve safeguards against arbitrary actions and is
 known to have taken measures against abuses by officials,
 including the disciplining, demotions or transfers of
 police personnel.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Indonesian law and judicial institutions are rooted
 in Dutch law, traditional law, and in some cases
 Islamic law. Indonesia contains.many ethnic groups,
 all of whom have strong authoritarian traditions.
 Statutes which permit long detention without trial and
 which restrict freedom of speech, of the press, and
 of movement within the country are ddeply ingrained
 in Indonesian history and tradition, although contrary
 to internationally recognized human rights. However,
 it is often difficult to define the law on a specific
 matter. The Indonesian court system is understaffed
 and overburdened.
 
 
 238
 Criminal trials, including those involving internal
 security charges, are public and they follow estab-
 lished procedural rules.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The concept of sanctity of the home has never been a
 part of Indonesian culture or legal traditions. The
 Department is aware of no legal prohibition against
 police search of the home without a warrant. On the
 other hand, the Department has seen no evidence of
 arbitrary behavior on the part of governmental
 officials in this area and no sign that it has ever
 been an issue in Indonesia.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 In Indonesia, the fulfillment of such needs is limited
 by the economy's ability to provide the necessary
 goods and services -- a goal which is always difficult
 to achieve in a poor country such as Indonesia.
 Education at the initial elementary grades has recently
 been made free; beyond that level it is available in
 many cases only to those who can afford to pay for it.
 Indonesian universities often establish ethnic quotas
 for admission of prospective students. Primary edu-
 cation has been extensively expanded and by the first
 half of the 1970's covered 65 to 70 percent of the
 primary school age population. Adult literacy also
 reached 60 percent by the early 1970's.
 For more than a decade the present Indonesian Govern-
 ment has given the highest priority to programs of
 economic development. With the support and advice
 of a multilateral aid consortium, Indonesia is
 currently in the second Five Year Plan of an ambi-
 tious developmental program. In recent years, the
 focus has been on the agricultural and food sectors.
 The great bulk of the people are dependent on the agri-
 cultural sector for their livelihood. Indonesia also
 has one of the most effective family planning programs
 in the world. However, continuing population pressure
 has led to a greater focus on labor intensive develop-
 ment projects to absorb unemployment.
 
 
 Ten years of partnership between an Indonesian civilian
 economic team and World Bank and IMF advisors, plus
 approximately $7.5 billion in foreign assistance, have,
 by most reckonings, significantly improved the lot of
 the average Indonesian. On the other hand, all of these
 efforts have not yet come close to overcoming the
 immense economic problems posed by Indonesia's popu-
 lation, size, infrastructure and personnel inadequacies.
 History and geography have also added a special burden
 with the great majority of the population crowded into
 Java while most of the potential resources are found
 in the isolated outer islands. The country remains
 one of the poorest in the world, with estimated per
 capita income of about $240 a year.
 There is no doubt that some resources are diverted from
 basic human needs through corruption. The seriousness
 and extent of this diversion are more difficult to
 estimate. There appears to be a stronger anti-corruption
 push at present than in past years. Senior civil
 servants have been recently sentenced to long prison
 terms for corruption. In the latter half of 1977,
 the government announced and began a new anti-corruption
 campaign, and investigations under this campaign have
 been directed against a number of very senior officials.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The rigorous suppression of the Indonesian press during
 the latter part of the Sukarno era was initially
 reversed by the present government. Between 1966 and
 1974, the Indonesian press enjoyed as.great a degree
 of freedom as existed anywhere in East Asia outside
 of Japan. Following the outbreak of severe riots in
 Jakarta in January 1974, however, a number of publi-
 cations were closed by the government. Since that
 time, the press has been less free to criticize the
 government or its senior leadership, although criti-
 cism of specific actions and policies of the government
 is accepted and there has been a general easing over
 time. In 1977, correspondents for both the Washinton
 Post and The New Yorker magazine judged Indonesia5s
 
 
 240
 press the freest in Southeast Asia. However, in
 January 1978, the publication of a number of leading
 Jakarta newspapers was suspended for reporting student
 activities which the government considered to be
 threats to public safety and order. At the time of
 this report, questions concerning the resumption of
 publication by these newspapers had not been resolved.
 The government is sensitive to criticism. A consider-
 able amount of freedom of expression exists. However,
 the government imposes limits when it perceives threats
 to the stability of society or issues of slander.
 Despite the large majority professing Islam as their
 religion, Indonesia is a secular state. There is no
 hinderance to the free exercise of religion by its
 citizens.
 The Communist Party is outlawed and only three political
 groups, basically organized around the main religious
 and political currents in the society, are permitted.
 No other unusual limitations apply to the freedom of
 association. Senior civil service officials are
 forbidden to join political parties and, under a
 proposed new law, ordinary civil servants would
 have to obtain permission from their superiors to do
 so. Freedom of assembly is limited to the extent that
 groups must obtain permission to hold meetings, and
 some large-scale demonstrations may be and have been
 prohibited, although others have been allowed.
 Conversely, Indonesians are not induced to attend
 mass rallies or engage in forced sloganeering.
 Indonesia has encouraged the development of trade
 unions within the framework of a government-sponsored
 federation. Trade unions must register with and be
 approved by the Ministry of Manpower, after which
 they are allowed to engage in collective bargaining
 and other normal functions. Strikes are forbidden
 in essential industries and subject to significant
 restrictions in others. Consequently, strikes are rare.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Largely to control the further movement of surplus
 population from the rural areas into the already
 
 
 241
 overcrowded cities, the government requires a permit to
 change residence. Such permits reportedly are not
 difficult to obtain for anyone able to prove he has a
 job. Exit permits are required for persons leaving
 the country, but they are usually obtainable without
 difficulty upon presentation of identification papers
 and the payment of a fee. The government on a few
 occasions in past years limited the foreign travel of
 selected political figures. The government has indi-
 cated that it will place some temporary residence
 restrictions on the detainees from the 1965 coup who
 were released in December 1977 or who will be released
 over the next several years. The 2,500 persons
 released in December 1976 were reportedly placed under
 a limited parole system during their first year following
 release, but observers in Indonesia report that this
 has not prevented them from obtaining and holding
 employment.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Indonesia currently has a form of limited democracy
 under a military-backed government.
 Parliamentary elections were held throughout Indonesia
 in 1971 and most recently in May 1977. Elected repre-
 sentative bodies also exist at the provincial and
 kabupaten (county) and city levels. Alladult citizens
 except prisoners and members of the Armed Forces may
 vote. Members of the Armed Forces may not stand for
 election. Current Indonesian law limits the number
 of political groups to three; each represents different
 historical and religious backgrounds, with the pro-
 government GOLKAR group preeminent.
 Parties are enjoined from attacking other parties,
 endangering national unity, dishonoring government
 officials or belittling government policies. These
 restrictions on the political process are enforced
 
 
 242
 
 by the government. Despite these parameters, campaigning
 by the rival groups in the May 1977 elections was
 intensive, spirited and involved virtually the entire
 electorate. While the government had greatly superior
 assets to influence voters and its party received a
 majority share of the vote, it actually lost seats to
 the main opposition group. According to a report'
 issued in July 1977 under authority of the House
 International Organizations Subcommittee, the activi-
 ties of the opposition political parties were restricted
 in rural areas. The Department of State believes
 that this was probably true to a degree.
 In accordance with the constitutionally-prescribed
 process, the President will be elected in 1978 by the
 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), a body consisting
 of all members of Parliament and an equal number of
 other members (the largest group is elected by pro-
 vincial legislatures and others are appointed).
 There is a highly developed system of decision-making
 in traditional Indonesian culture based on consultations
 and consensus rather than bloc voting. Parliament has
 an appreciable role in the decision-making process,
 participating in the consensus and on occasion forcing
 the government to modify its programs despite the
 government's legislative majority. There is wide-
 spread expectation that there will be increased
 criticism and the Parliament will be more effective
 under its new speaker, former Foreign Minister Adam
 Malik.
 Questions have been raised concerning the degree to
 which the right of self-determination has been met
 in East Timor. The Department of State accepts the
 incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia although
 it does not recognize that a valid act of self-deter-
 mination occurred. The main current interest is to
 encourage the Indonesian Government to undertake
 programs of assistance to the people in East Timor.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigatiors of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Indonesian Government permitted the ICRC to inspect
 prisons in 1971, 1974 and 1977. The ICRC withdrew its
 
 
 243
 inspection teams in early 1977 when misunderstandings
 between the two sides arose. In late 1977, however,
 the Indonesian Government undertook discussions with
 the ICRC concerning further inspections, and a resump-
 tion of ICRC inspections in Indonesia is scheduled to
 take place beginning in January 1978. In accordance
 with usual practice, the earlier inspection reports
 have not been released.
 The Indonesians have on occasion permitted other
 inspection visits to detention facilities on Buru
 Island and other locations. Recent visitors to Buru
 Island included an Indonesian newsman and a Dutch TV
 team which madea documentary on the subject. An
 Australian newsman visited a number of such facilities
 on Java and Kalimantan in October 1977. Representatives
 of foreign embassies in Jakarta were invited to attend
 several of the release ceremonies on December 20, 1977.
 Foreign and Indonesian newsmen also observed some of
 the release ceremonies, including those held on Buru
 Island. The Indonesian Government has stated that
 *diplomatic, press and ICRC representatives may have
 continuing access to persons who have been released
 from detention.
 Amnesty International released a major and critical
 report on Indonesia in October 1977, based largely on
 reports stated to be from sources within Indonesia.
 In recent years, Amnesty International representatives
 have been refused access to Indonesia by the government
 as a result of sharp disagreement over the accuracy
 of Amnesty International's reporting, especially in
 regard to the alleged number of political prisoners.
