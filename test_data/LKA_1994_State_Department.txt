 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a constitutional republic with an active multiparty system. In gen-
 erally free and fair elections in August, the People's Alliance (PA) coalition ended
 17 years of control of Parliament by the United National Party (UNP), and
 Chandrika Kumaratunga, the daughter of two former prime ministers, became
 Prime Minister.
 A conflict between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
 (LTTE), an organization fighting for a separate state for the country's Tamil minor-
 ity, continued into its eleventh year. However, the new Government initiated a dia-
 logue with the LTrE, the first since 1990.
 The Government controls all the security forces. The 50,000 member police force
 is responsible for internal security in most areas of the country, and the 80,000
 member army conducts the war against the LTTE insurgents. The Home Guards,
 a paramilitary force of some 1,000 members, provides security for Muslim and Sin-
 halese communities in or near the war zone. The Government also equips various
 Tamil militias opposed to the LTTE. The security forces committed significantly
 fewer human rights abuses in 1994, although some human rights violations still oc-
 curred.
 The economy is based on the export of tea, textiles, and rubber. Despite a costly
 social welfare system and a large fiscal deficit, the economy grew by 6.9 percent in
 1993, due in part to continued economic reform, the continued privatization of gov-
 ernment corporations, and increased foreign trade.
 The Government took important steps to improve its human rights practices.
 However, torture remains a serious abuse and is practiced by both government and
 LTI'E forces. Both sides used excessive force in their ongoing conflict. Many abuses
 were reported in LTTE-controlled areas, but there is little information available to
 verify them. Discrimination and violence against women and child prostitution con-
 tinue to be problems.
 In positive developments, political and extrajudicial killings and disappearances
 virtually ended in government-controlled areas. Three regional commissions were
 established to investigate disappearances. The Government began to prosecute cur-
 rent and past violators of human rights.
 The overall human rights performance of the military and the police improved sig-
 nificantly. The new Government lifted the Emergency Regulations in most parts of
 the island, a move that reestablished the authority of the judiciary and the right
 of individuals to a fair, public trial. In accordance with a commitment made to the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), the Government eliminated
 restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press, and association in the Emergency Reg-
 ulations remaining in force. Eighty percent of those held in long-term security force
 detention were released during the course of the year. The Prevention of Terrorism
 Act (PTA), which gives security forces wide powers of preventive and incommuni-
 cado detention, remained in effect though little used.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrjudicial Killing.-There were no known extrajudicial
 killings committed by the security forces or groups allied with the Government. Fore
 the second year there were no reprisal massacres against Tamil civilians by the se-
 curity forces. For the third consecutive year, there were no known killings by vigi-
 lante groups. However, there were 10 suspicious deaths, mostly involving detainees
 
 
 1260
 
 acting as informants for security forces who died during operational missions
 against the LTTE. There was insufficient information to determine responsibility for
 these deaths.
 At least 25 people were killed preceding the parliamentary elections in August.
 The violence was apparently caused by individuals and did not appear to be an or-
 ganized attempt by political parties to intimidate voters. The Government has pros-
 ecuted the alleged perpetrators. Among those arrested and charged for murder was
 a deputy minister in the new Government.
 During the presidential election campaign, a suicide bomber killed the United Na-
 tional Party's candidate Gainini Dissanayake and 58 other people. The LTE was
 the primary suspect in the bombing; however, at year's end, the Government's in-
 vestigating team had not assigned blame. Eight other persons were killed in inci-
 dents preceding the presidential election in November.
 The new Government sought to bring to justice the perpetrators of extrajudicial
 killings from previous years. It prosecuted suspects in several extrajudicial killings
 and brought charges against several members of the security forces and its own po-
 litical supporters.
 Reversing a much-criticized action taken in 1993, the new Government relocated
 the Mailanthani trial, in which 21 soldiers were accused of massacring 35 Tamil ci-
 vilians in 1992, to Batticaloa, a Tamil majority town. It formally indicted the sol-
 diers and scheduled their trials for 1995.
 Government forensic experts resumed their investigation of a mass grave at
 Sooriyakanda, containing an estimated 300 bodies. The Government also started to
 investigate newly discovered graves, including one at Ankumbura which may con-
 tain the bodies of 36 persons killed by the police in 1989.
 In October the Government indicted 4 police officers for the 1990 murders of 12
 civilians in Wavulkelle; the trial is scheduled for 1995. The Government also took
 legal action against several army personnel who attacked 80 villagers, killing one,
 in March in Batticaloa district.
 The new Government lifted the Emergency Regulations from most of the country,
 a move that made the concealment of extrajudicial killings and disappearances by
 government forces more difficult. However the Regulations remained in force in
 areas directly affected by the insurgency. in these areas, the Government revised
 the Regulations to require security forces to report the deaths of detainees to a mag-
 istrate, who in turn who is required to order a post mortem.
 The LTTE continued to commit extrajudicial killings. LTIE cadres killed a can-
 didate in local government elections in the Eastern Province and also killed several
 suspected government informants. In March, LTIE guerillas abducted and killed 22
 fishermen off the coast of Puttalam District and killed several more fishermen in
 the same area in August. In September the iTTE assassinated a leader of an anti-
 LiTE Tamil group in Batticaloa District, and are believed to have killed several op-
 ponents in the Jaffna District. In the past, the LTTE has killed university profes-
 sors, members of nonviolent Tamil opupositionparties, and human rights monitors.
 LTE violence was not restricted to Sri Lanka. In May LTTE agents killed
 Sabalingam Sabaratnam, an LTTE opponent, and four other Tamils in Paris.
 b. Disappearanwe.-There were 10 onfirmed disappearanes in 1994, compared to
 98 in 1993, 210 in 1992, and an average 15 a day in 1990. Those who disappeared
 in 1994 and in previous years are presumed dead. The disappearances involvedper-
 sons last seen in police custod;  occurred in the first ha  of the year. The Com-
 mander of the Army and the Inspector General of Police both issued directives con-
 demning the disappearances and stating that perpetrators would be called to ac-
 count. However, at year's end the Government had not identified or charged those
 responsible for the 1994 disappearances.
 The new Government started investigations into past disapparances. In Novem-
 ber it established three regional commissions to inquire into dappearances occur-
 ring after January 1, 1988. Meanwhile the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into
 the Involuntary Removal of Persons continued to work slowly on disappearances
 that occurred after January 1991. So far the Commission has completed work on
 only 70 of the 694 cases under its mandate. However, the number of complaints re-
 ceived by the Commission continued to decline. In 1994 the Commission received
 10 complaints, compared with 63 in 1993, 181 in 1992, and 725 in 1991.
 Also in November, Parliament enacted the Registration of Deaths Bill. This legis-
 lation allows the next-of-kin to apply to the district registrar of deaths for a death
 certificate of a relative reported missing and presumed to be dead, or who has not
 been heard from for more than a year.
 The new Government indicted 11 suspects, including an army brigadier general
 in the disappearance of 32 boys from the southern town of Embi ipitiya in 1989 and
 1990. The Government charged the suspects with abduction with intent to commit
 
 
 1261
 murder and conspiracy to abduct with intent to commit murder. However, at year's
 end the Government had taken no legal action in the Vantharamulle case, in which
 Army troops reportedly abducted 158 persons from a refugee camp in Batticaloa dis-
 trict in 1990. Observers maintain that there is credible evidence identifying the al-
 leged perpetrators.
 The Government continued to give the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) unhindered access to detention centers, police stations, and arm camps.
 This played a role in stopping disapparances attributable to the security forces, as
 did the work of the Human Rights Task Force (HRTF), aquasi-independent govern-
 ment body set up to register detainees held under the Emergency Regulations and
 the PTA and monitor their welfare.
 The LTTE was responsible for an undetermined number of civilian disappear-
 ances in the northeastern part of the island. Most of the 400 to 600 police officers
 captured by the LTTE in 1990 are believed to be dead, as are over 200 security force
 personnel captured at a battle in Pooneryn in 1993. The LTTE acknowledges hold-
 ing only 30 security force personnel.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Security forces continued to torture and mistreat detainees and other prisoners, par-
 ticularly during interrogation, although the number of torture reports was some-
 what lower than in previous years. Most victims were LTTE supporters or advocates
 of the Sinhalese Janatha Vimukhti Peramunk (JVP) a former Maoist party which
 led an insurgency in the southern part of the island. The Government suppressed
 that insurgency in 1988-89.
 Methods of torture included beatings, especially on the soles of the feet, suspen-
 sion by the wrists or feet in contorted positions, burning near drownings, placing
 of insecticide or gasoline-filled bags over the head, and forced positions, e.g., pro-
 longed standing. Detainees have reported broken bones and other serious injuries
 as a result of their mistreatment. Unlike in previous years, there were no reports
 of rape in detention.
 In January the Government acceded to the U.N. Convention Against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In November Par-
 liament enacted legislation making torture a punishable offense. The Government
 decided that henceforth police officers convicted of abuse would pay fines assessed
 by the courts. Formerly, the Government paid such fines.
 Torture victims may file a suit for compensation in the Supreme Court, which
 granted awards ranging from $200 to $2,000, and in some cases assessed fines
 against individual army or police personnel. Most cases, however, take a year or
 more to move through the courts. The Government has not yet developed effective
 mechanisms to prosecute and punish military and police personnel responsible for
 torture.
 The LTIE reportedly used torture on a routine basis. Because of the secretive na-
 ture of the LTTE, virtually no first-hand information is available regarding their
 use of torture.
 Prison conditions are generally poor and do not meet internationally recog..zed
 minimum standards because of overcrowding and the lack of sanitary facilities.
 However, the Government permitted representatives from the ICRC to visit more
 than 400 places of detention. Conditions are also believed to be poor in prisons oper-
 ated by the LTIE.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under ordinary law, authorities must in-
 form an arrested person of the reason for arrest and bring that person before a mag
 istrate within 24 hours. In practice, persons detained under ordinary law generay
 appear before a magistrate within a few days of arrest. The maitrate may author-
 ize bail or order continued pretrial detention for up to 3 mont  or longer. Except
 in limited areas of the northeast, security forces may no longer use the Emergency
 Regulations to detain suspects for prolonged periods without court approval.
 During the first half of the year, there were continued reports that security forces
 held people incommunicado at secret locations-a violation of amendments to the
 Emergency Regulations in 1993. However, human rights monitors believe that such
 detentions occurred infrequently and for periods of only a few days before the de-
 tainees were put into the normal detention system. After taking power, the new
 Government announced that it would close all secret detention facities. There were
 no reported detentions in secret locations after the announcement.
 After the Government lifted the Emergency Regulations, it began to process the
 backlog of cases: it arraigned suspected felons, dismissed charges for minor offenses,
 and released persons against whom there was no case. However, the Government
 continued to detain some individuals under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which
 permits detention without charge for up to 18 months.
 
 
 1262
 At year's end, the Government held an estimated 380 detainees, down from more
 than 2,000 in 1993. Many of these detainees were arrested during military oper-
 ations against the LTTE and are held in facilities operated by the army.
 The Government modified the Emergency Regulations which remained in force in
 the northeastern part of the island and in Colombo. The change shortened pretrial
 detention to a maximum of 4 consecutive 3-month periods. A magistrate must order
 further detention. Detainees may challenge their detention in court and sue the
 Government for violating their civil rights.
 Security forces continued to conduct mass arrests of young Tamil males-espe-
 cially after several terrorist bombings in Colombo in April--although such arrests
 were made less frequently than in 1993. Most detainees were released after identity
 checks lasting several hours to several days. The Government justifies the arrests
 on security grounds, but Tamils claim the arrests are a form of harassment.
 The Human Rights Task Force (HRTF), a quasi-governmental body established to
 register detainees, continued to investigate the legality of detention in cases referred
 to it by the Supreme Court and private citizens.
 There were unconfirmed reports that the LTTE detained more than 2,000 civil-
 ians in the northern part of the island. The LTTE did not permit the ICRC or any
 other humanitarian organization to visit its detainees-aside from 30 security force
 personnel and 10 fishermen incarcerated in Jaffna.
 In September the LTrE released 10 police officers detained since 1990 in response
 to peace overtures from the new Government. The LTTE holds a number of pris-
 oners of conscience, including the poet and women's rights advocate Thiagaradah
 Selvanithy (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government does not practice exile. There are no legal provisions allowing
 or prohibiting its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary is independent of executive branch
 influence. The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal,
 and the high courts. The Chef Justice and two Supreme Court judges comprise a
 Judicial Service Commission which appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court
 judges. Judges serve until mandatory retirement age, which is 65 for the Supreme
 Court and 62 for other judges.
 In criminal cases, defendants are tried in public by juries. They are informed of
 the charges and evidence against them, may be represented by the counsel of their
 choice, and have the right to appeal. The Government provides counsel for indigent
 persons tried on criminal charges in the high courts and the Court of Appeal, but
 not in other cases; private legal aid organizations assist some defendants.
 Under the Emergency Regulations, the authorities detained suspects for Iongperi-
 ods without providing them access to legal representation. However, after the lifting
 of the Emergency Regulations in most parts of the country, the normal judicial pro-
 cedures were restored and defendants in criminal cases were again accorded due
 process.
 To avoid possible intimidation, there are no jury trials in cases prosecuted under
 the seldom-invoked Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Defendants in PTA cases
 have less protection than those tried under ordinary laws. Confessions, which are
 otherwise inadmissible, are allowed in PTA cases, and most convictions rely heavily
 on confessions. In such cases, defendants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate
 that their confessions were obtained by coercion. Nevertheless, defendants in PTA
 cases have the right to appeal.
 In the past, the Government claimed that all persons detained under the Emer-
 gency Regulations and the PTA were suspected members of the LTIE or the JVP.
 There is insufficient information to determine whether these detainees were politi-
 cal prisoners or suspected terrorists. Nonetheless, the overall number of detainees
 held without charges declined significantly (see Section 1.d.).
 The LTTE has its own court system in Jaffna, composed of young judges with lit-
 tle or no legal training. The courts reportedly impose severe punishments. However,
 the courts have no basis in law, and essentially operate as extrajudicial agents of
 the LTTE, rather than a judiciary formed by a legal, sovereign government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual privacy
 and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain proper warrants for ar-
 rests and searches conducted under ordinary law.
 However, the security forces are not required to obtain warrants for searches con-
 ducted under the PTA (see Section i.e.). The Secretary of Defense is responsible for
 providing oversight for such searches. There is no judicial review or other means
 of redress for alleged illegal searches under the PTA.
 
 
 1263
 The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspond-
 ence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the
 LTIE-controlled areas and seize contraband.
 The LTIE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. In 1990 the LTIE evicted
 thousands of Muslim residents from their homes in the north. They currently live
 in refugee camps.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE continued but at a re-
 duced level from 1993. There were no reports of army massacres of Tamil civilians,
 such as the ones at Kokkadichcholai in 1991 and Mailanthani in 1992. However,
 the security forces killed as many as 150 civilians by the indiscriminate or excessive
 use of force. Over 250 were killed in 1993. The security forces killed at least 90 per-
 sons, and injured hundreds of others, in the periodic shelling of the LTlE-controed
 city of Jaffna. The LTIPE also used excessive force, killing an undetermined number
 of civilians.
 During the year, the Government took measures to address the problem of civilian
 casualties. The air force introduced new rules of engagement to reduce inadvertent
 deaths and injuries to civilians. The security forces also instituted human rights in-
 struction in its training courses.
 The Government detains very few captured LTTE cadres, as many of them them-
 selves with cyanide before capture. The LTTE claims that it kills security fore per-
 sonnel rather than take them prisoner. It admits to holding only 30 security force
 prisoners. The LTTE is believed to have killed many of the 600 to 800 police officers
 and security force personnel it captured in recent years.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of
 speech and expression but permits restrictions in the interests of national security.
 Such restrictions were eased by the termination of the Emergency Regulations in
 most parts of the country. Even in regions where the regulations are still enforced,
 the Government eliminated the stipulation for lengthy prison terms for "inciting
 feelings of disaffection, hatred or contempt of the president or the Government" or
 "creating discontent or disaffection among inhabitants."
 The Government controls the country,'s largest newspaper chain, a major tele-
 vision station, and the Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation. However, a variety of
 independent newspapers, journals, radio and television stations provide an
 unimpeded range of views and openly criticize the Government and political parties.
 The Government maintains a monopoly on the broadcast of local news, but networks
 may broadcast foreign-prduced international news without deleting stories concern-
 Jndor the former UNP Government, many journalists alleged that the Govern-
 ment sought to control the press by imiting the issuance of import licenses for
 newsprint and the placement of government advertising. However, journalists did
 not make such allegations after the new Government took office in August.
 Journalists and civil libertarians also complain that the Parliamentary Powers
 and Privileges Act stipulates an unlimited fine or up to 2 years' imprisonment for
 anyone who criticizes a member of Parliament. Although the Government did not
 invoke the law in 1993 or 1994, journalists and civil libertarians complain that the
 act is an unjustified infringement on freedom of the press.
 The LTTE does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly restricts the print
 and broadcast media in areas under its control, and has often killed those who criti-
 cize it. The LTTE has detained Thiagarajah Selvanithy for over three years, and has
 repressed the University Teachers for Human Rights, a human rights group for-
 merly based in the Jaffna peninsula.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom. It also removed restrictions
 on campus political activity with the lifting of the Emergency Regulations. The
 LTrE does not respect academic freedom, and has repressed and killed professors
 who criticize it.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government generally re-
 spects the constitutional freedoms of assembly and association. Although the Pre-
 vention of Terrorism Act may restrict such freedoms, the Government did not use
 the Act for that purpose in 1994. The Government routinely granted permits for
 demonstrations, including those held during the parliamentary and presidential
 elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official re-
 ligion, but also provides for the right for members of other faiths to practice their
 religions freely. Foreign clergy may work in Sri Lanka, but for more than 30 years,
 
 
 1264
 the Government has prohibited the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy. It permits
 those already in the country to remain.
 Evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the _population, have
 expressed concern that their efforts at proselytization are occasionally met with hos-
 tility and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work.
 They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such harassment;
 however, there is no evidence of this.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-The Constitution grants every citizen 'freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence" and "freedom to return to Sri Lank." The Government gen-
 erally respects the right to domestic and foreign travel. During the year, the Gov-
 ernment eased travel restrictions in the eastern part of the island because of the
 decline in insurgent activity. The termination of the Emergency Regulations also re-
 duced travel restrictions. However government security measures have the effect of
 restricting the movements of Tamils, especially young males.
 The LITE restricts the movement of Tanils in areas under its control. It levies
 a large "exit tax" from persons wishing to travel to areas under government control,
 requiring them to leave all of their property in escrow. In order to ensure that trav-
 elers return, the LTIE often grants permission to only one family member to travel
 at a time. The LTTE does not allow displaced persons living in areas under its con-
 trol to return to their homes in government-controlled areas.
 An estimated 558,000 citizens have been displaced by the insurgency. Most live
 in camps financed by the Government and non-governmental organizations (NGO's).
 An estimated 69,000 Tamil refugees live in camps in southern India. Another
 100,000 refugees have been integrated into the Tamil society of southern India. The
 Government allows the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to operate
 freely. UNHCR assisted in the repatriation of over 8,000 refugees from India.
 The Government does not permit the entry into the countr of refugees, nor does
 it aid those who manage to enter yet seek permanent residence elsewhere. There
 were no instances of forcible repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. Citizens exercised this
 right during parliamentary elections in August, when the PA ended the 17-year rule
 ofthe UNP, and during the presidential election in November, when PA presidential
 candidate Chandrika Kumaratunga won 62 percent of the vote (also see the Intro-
 duction). International election monitors judged the elections to be free and fair.
 However, the LTTE refused to allow elections in areas of the Jaffna district under
 its control. The UNP Government therefore restricted polling in this area to a few
 off shore islands. It denied the opportunity to vote to displaced persons in refugee
 camps outside Jaffna district.
 Nine of the 10 Jaffna seats were won by candidates from pro-UNP government
 Tamil groups, whose armed militias intimidated voters. Although the election was
 marred by 25 murders (see Section L.a.), the harassment of voters appeared equally
 divided among the parties and did not appear to be an official government or party
 policy. The harassment did not have any discernible affect on the election's outcome.
 The Commissioner of Elections recognizes 26 parties; 9 hold seats in the 225-
 member Parliament. The two most influential parties generally draw their support
 from the majority Sinhalese community. Historically, these two parties have alter-
 nated in power. There are some 29 Tamil and 20 Muslim members of Parliament.
 Although there are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics
 or government, the social mores in some communities limit women's activities out-
 side the home. In August voters elected a woman Prime Minister for the second
 time in Sri Lanka's history. In November, for the first time, a woman was elected
 president. Eleven women hold seats in the Parliament; one is a minister without
 portfolio; one is the Minister of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs; and
 four are deputy ministers.
 The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, number less than 1,000.
 There are no restrictions on their participation in politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several local human rights groups, including the Movement for Inter-
 racial Justice and Equality (MIRJE), the University Teachers for Human Rights,
 the Civil Rights Movement (CRM), and the Law and Society Trust (LST), which
 monitor civil and political liberties. The Government eliminated the Emergency Reg-
 
 
 1265
 ulations which had regulated the activities of local and foreign NGO's. The former
 Government did not respond to the NGOs' human rights inquiries and reports. How-
 ever, the new Government appears more receptive to such groups. For the consecu-
 tive second year, human rights monitors did not receive death threats.
 The Government made significant progress in implementing a 14-point "Program
 of Work" to which it voluntaurily committed itself during a meeting in February with
 the UNHRC (see the Introduction). The program, designed to raise human rights
 practices to an internationally acceptable standard, included, inter alia, the follow-
 ing; revision of the Emergency Regulations; pursuit of accountability; enactment of
 legislation to prohibit torture; implementation of the recommendations made by the
 United Nations Working Group on Disappearances; and continuation of efforts for
 a negotiated settlement to the LTIE insurgency.
 The Government invited international observers to monitor both the August par-
 liamentary election and November presidential election. There were no reports of in-
 terference with these groups.
 The Government continued to provide ICRC with virtually unrestricted access to
 detention facilities. At the Government's request, the ICRC supervised the delivery
 of food and medical supplies into the war zone and provided human rights training
 materials to the security forces.
 Several international groups provide humanitarian relief to those affected by the
 conflict in the northeast. The Government does not hinder their activities, aside
 from security concerns. Some of these groups conduct activities in LTrE-controlled
 areas.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. How-
 ever, issues related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and inheritance
 are adjudicated by the customary law of each ethnic or religious group. These legal
 practices often result in discrimination against women.
 The Constitution guarantees equal employment opportunities in the public sector,
 but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector
 where they are sometimes paid less than men for equal work. In 1993 the Govern-
 ment signed the International Charter on Women's Rights, but has not yet passed
 enabling legislation. Several NGO's promote women's rights.
 According to at least one NGO, spousal violence is a serious problem. There are
 no laws on spousal violence but the Government has established a National Com-
 mittee on Women which will recommend appropriate legislation. To date the Com-
 mittee has identified as grave problems sexual assault, rape, and other forms of vio-
 lence-particularly directed against female domestic servants. Most of its work con-
 cerns job discrimination because most women are unwilling to report physical and
 sexual abuse. Women's groups also report that the sympathies of police and judicial
 officials often lie with the accused male rather than the aggrieved female. However
 the Government has prosecuted numerous persons accused of sexual abuse and
 rape.
 Children.The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and rights of
 children, but is constrained by lack of resources. There is a significant problem of
 child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas. A government survey published in
 January concluded that there are approximately 2,000 active child prostitutes, but
 private groups claim the number is much higher. Most of these prostitutes are boys
 who sell themselves to foreign tourists.
 In May the Government initiated a campaign     ainst child abuse and exploi-
 tation. The Department of Education and several NGO's develoed a    ogram to
 educate the public about the dangers of child prostitution, includg  S. Agov-
 ernment-appointed committee submitted a report recommending legislation on child
 labor and prostitution, but at year's end no legislation had been introduced in Par-
 liament. NGO's attribute the problem of exploitation of children to the lack of law
 enforcement rather than inadequate legislation.
 There have been reports that rural children working as domestic servants in
 urban households have been abused by their employers. Some of these children have
 reportedly been starved, beaten, sexually abused, and forced into prostitution. The
 Government does not effectively enforce the laws designed to protect these children
 (see Section 6.c.)
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are approximately 1 million Tamils of
 comparatively recent Indian origin living in Sri Lanka. About 85,000 of these people
 do not qualify for either Indian or Sri Lankan citizenship and face discrimination,
 especially in the allocation of government funds for education. However, the Govern-
 ment has stated that none will be forced to depart the country.
 
 
 1266
 Tamils maintain that they have long been the victims of systematic discrimina-
 tion in university education, government employment, and in other matters con-
 trolled by the Government. However, in recent years there has been little evidence
 of overt discrimination in university enrollment or government employment.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religious differences is less com-
 mon than discrimination based on ethnic group or caste. In general, the members
 of the various faiths tend to be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. However,
 Evangelical Christians have been harassed for their attempts to convert Buddhists
 to Christianity (see Section 2.c.).
 In the northern part of the island, LTTE insuents expelled from their homes
 some 46000 Muslim inhabitants in 1990-virtually the entire Muslim population.
 The LTI E has expropriated Muslim homes, lands, and businesses, and threatened
 Muslim families with death if they attempt to return.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for people with disabilities. The World Health Organization es-
 timates that 7 percent of the population is disabled. Most disabled people who are
 unable to work are cared for by their families. The Department of Social Services
 runs eight vocational training schools for the physically and mentally disabled and
 sponsors a program of job training and job placement for graduates. The Govern-
 ment gives some financial support to nongovernmental organizations assisting the
 disabled, subsidizes prosthetic devices and other medical aids for the disabled,
 makes some purchases from disabled suppliers, and has registered 74 schools and
 training institutions for the disabled run by NGO's.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government respects the constitutional right of
 workers to establish labor unions. Any seven workers may establish a union, adopt
 a charter, elect leaders, and publicize their views. About 50 to 60 percent of the non-
 agricultural work force, which is about 25 to 30 percent of the total work force, is
 unionized. Most workers in large private firms are represented by unions, but those
 in small-scale agriculture and in small businesses do not belong to unions.
 Most large unions are affiliated with political parties and together play a promi-
 nent role in the political process. More than 30 labor unions have political affili-
 ations, but there are also a small number of unafliliated unions.
 Through September, the Department of Labor registered 210 new unions and can-
 celed the registration of 61 others. The Department of Labor is authorized by law
 to cancel the registration of any union which does not submit an annual report.
 That requirement is the only legal grounds for cancellation of registration.
 All workers, other than civil servants and workers in "essential" services, have
 the right to strike. By law, workers may also lodge complaints with the Commis-
 sioner of Labor, a labor tribunal or the Supreme Court to protect their rights. Under
 the Emergency Regulations, the Government controlled strikes by declaring some
 industries to be "essential." After the Government terminated the Emergency Regu-
 lations, it removed such industries from that category. However, the President re-
 tains the power to designate any industry as an essential service. The International
 Labor Organization (ILO) has pointed out to the Government that essential services
 should be limited to services where an interruption would endanger the life, per-
 sonal safety, or health of the population.
 Civil servants may collectively submit labor grievances to the Public Service Com-
 mission but have no legal grounds to strike. However, workers in the Post Office,
 Telecommunications Bureau, Electricity Board and Port Authority staged brief
 stikes and other work actions in 1993 and 1994. There were 246 strikes in 1994,
 75 in the agricultural sector and 171 in the industrial and other sectors.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers in nonessential sectors. Employers
 may dismiss workers only for indiscipline.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies and many of them have done
 SO.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to collective bargaining and it is widely practiced. In enterprises that do not have
 unions, work councils-composed of employees, employers, and often a public sector
 representative-are the forums for collective bargaining, thou  the councils are not
 mandatory outside the Export Processing Zones (EPZ'S) and Wo not have the power
 to negotiate binding contracts.
 The law does not require management to recognize unions, and in some cases, em-
 ployers have declined to recognize the unions in their factories. However, the law
 prohibits antiunion discrimination. Employers found guilty of such discrimination
 are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities, but have the right to
 transfer them to different locations.

 Workers in the EPZs have the same right to join unions as other workers. How-
 ever, employers in the EPZ's offer higher wages and better working conditions, thus
 discouraging union activity. In the place of unions, workers in the EPZ's are rep-
 resented by organizations known as Joint Consultative Councils (JCC's), which are
 chaired by the Government's Board of Investments (BOI) and consist of equal dele-
 gations from labor and management. During the second half of the year, workers
 in the EPZ's staged several strikes over wages, benefits, and worker rights. In some
 cases, they took hostages and violently confronted the police. The new Government
 mediated an end to the strikes. Management granted modest pay raises and the
 Government prosecuted the strikers who engaged in violence.
 In most instances, Wage Boards establish minimum wages and conditions of em-
 ployment, except in the EPs where wages and work conditions are set by the BOL
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. According to some reports, rural children are sometimes employed
 in debt bondage as domestic servants in urban households. The Government does
 not have sufficient resources to protect these children from such exploitation.
 The LTrE conscripts high-school age children for work as cooks, messengers, and
 clerks, and in some cases, pressed children into builiding fortifications.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In 1993 the Government raised
 the minimum age for employment to 15 years from 14 years. However, the law per-
 mits the employment of children below the age of 15 by their parents or guardians
 in limited agricultural work. It also permits employment in any school or institution
 for training purposes.
 Persons under 16 may not be employed in any public performance in which life
 or limb is endangered. Until recently, children under 14 years could be employed
 in the plantation industry, but in 1991 the Government prohibited such employment
 after it ratified ILO Convention 10.
 Children are not employed in the EPZ's, the garment industry, or any other ex-
 port industry. About 85 percent of the children-below the age of 16 attend school.
 The law provides that the employment of such persons is permitted for not more
 than I hour on any day before school.
 Despite legislation, some child labor still exists. Some children work in the infor-
 mal sectors, including the manufacture of coconut fiber products, fishing, wrapping
 tobacco, street trading, domestic service, and farming. Government inspections have
 been unable to eliminate these forms of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but some
 38 wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions according to sector and
 industry. Current minimum wage rates average $32 (1,550 rupees) a month in in-
 dustry and commerce; $30 (1,450 rupees) a month in the service industry; and $1.50
 (72 rupees) a day in agriculture. The minimum wage in the garment industry is $41
 (2,000 rupees) a month. The minimum wages are insufficient to support a worker
 and the standard family of five, but most families have more than one breadwinner.
 The Department of Labor effectively enforces the minimum wage law. Most per-
 manent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from working reg-
 ularly more than 45 hours per week (a 5 1/2 day work week). Such workers also
 receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and some 20 holi-
 days each year. Maternity leave is available for permanent and casual female work-
 ers. Employers must contribute 12 to 15 percent of a worker's wage to an employee's
 provident fund and 3 percent to an employees trust fund. Employers who fail to
 comply may be fined.
 Several laws protect the safety and health of industrial workers. The government
 provides nationwide programs on health and safety issues to increase worker aware-
 ness. However, the Department of Labor's small staff of inspectors is inadequate to
 enforce compliance with the laws. Workers have the statutory right to remove them-
 selves from situations that endanger their health, but many workers are unaware
 of, or indifferent to, health risks and fear they would lose their jobs if they removed
 themselves.
