 MAURITIUS
 The rule of law prevails in Mauritius under a British-
 oriented legal system with an independent judiciary.
 Education is free and available to all, as are social
 and health services. Political parties vie for votes
 openly and without much hindrance from the Government.
 The country's political and social system enables a
 free and highly partisan press to flourish.
 A few years ago the human rights situation in Mauritius
 was quite different. A state of emergency was declared
 at the end of 1971 after a series of strikes fomented
 by the Marxist political opposition had threatened to
 paralyze the economy. In the same period communal
 riots took place, caused in part by the deterioration
 in the political and economic situation. Under the
 emergency rules, press censorship was imposed, public
 meetings were banned and a small number of leading
 leftists, labor, and political agitators were arbitrar-
 ily arrested and detained for periods ranging up to
 eleven months. Although the state of emergency
 remained in effect until early 1978, by late 1976 it
 was no longer enforced. In December 1976, 22 political
 parties participated in free elections in which
 opposition parties won more seats than the govern-
 ing Labor Party, which remains in power as part of
 a coalition.
 The Government also promotes social and economic
 programs to improve the public welfare. Religious
 activities, medical care and the provision of basic
 foodstuffs are subsidized by the Government. Primary
 and secondary education is free, as is university
 education at the university. The Government frequently
 mandates cost-of-living wage increases for low and
 middle income workers.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 
 (123)
 
 
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited.
 The Department of State knows of no allegations of
 torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 These have not occurred in Mauritius since the country
 became independent in 1968.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests occurred in the early 1970s when the
 Government jailed opposition political and trade union
 leaders whom it accused of creating chaos and anarchy.
 This has not been done in the past five to six years.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system is modeled on that of Great
 Britain. Since the early 1970s its record of assuring
 fair public trials to all offenders has been excellent.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law, and
 respecterd in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fullfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government has actively sought to provide adequate
 health care, education, food and shelter to the people.
 Government expenditures for community and social services
 (including education, health, social security, housing
 and food subsidies) have increased during the past four
 years by 60 percent and now make up 52 percent of
 the annual budget.
 Health care at government hospitals and clinics is free
 for all who cannot pay. Given the small size of the
 country, all Mauritians have relatively easy access to a
 health facility. As a result of effective family
 planning institutions and government support for

 population limitation, the birth rate on this densely-
 populated island declined in sixteen years from 3.8
 percent to 2.6 percent in 1976. A concommitant
 reduction in population growth has occurred during the
 same period (from 2.7 to 1.7 percent), despite the
 fact that life expectancy has almost doubled during
 the past thirty years.
 At the beginning of 1977 free secondary education was
 made available to all Mauritians, along with training
 at the University of Mauritius.  (Previously, primary
 education and some secondary education was free).
 Virtually all Mauritian children attend school.
 The Government subsidizes the sale of rice and flour.
 Because food imports are a serious drain on the economy,
 the Government has tried to diversify agricultural
 production. The results have not been encouraging thus
 far. The Government is also attempting to address the
 serious housing shortage, prodded by opposition criticism
 but is limited by a lack of resources.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, press, religion and
 assembly is protected. The Public Order Act requires
 police permission for demonstrations and mass meetings.
 Early in 1978 several leading opposition figures were
 arrested and prosecuted for blocking a public thorough-
 fare during an unsanctioned demonstration. All but
 one were released after fourteen days in jail and
 later fined $50. The remaining detainee was sentenced
 to three months in prison for advocacy of killing
 policemen.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the
 country, foreign travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 126
 Political participation is open to all. However, the
 Government occasionally restricts activities of the
 Marxist party, which it considers subversive.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all
 types of political, business and social activities,
 and many hold high positions.
 Labor unions are free to organize and bargain collec-
 tively. The dock workers and the sugar workers have
 been particularly successful in obtaining pay increases
 and improved working conditions.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Department of State does not know of any requests
 by outside organizations to investigate the human
 rights situation in Mauritius.
