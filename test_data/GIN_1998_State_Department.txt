 GUINEA
 Guinea is a constitutional republic in which effective power is concentrated in a
 strong presidency. President Lansana Conte has ruled since 1984, when he led the
 only successful coup d'etat in the country's history, first as head of a military junta,
 and since 1994 as a civilian President elected in 1993 multiparty elections that the
 Government controlled from start to finish, and in which it denied the opposition
 any significant role. Guinea held its first multiparty legislative elections in 1995,
 delivering more than 60 percent of National Assembly seats to President Conte's
 Party of Unity and Progress (PUP). The PUP is one seat short of the number re-
 quired to amend the Constitution. Opposition leaders, some international observers,
 and segments of the citizenry voiced reservations of PUJP's considerable victories in
 both parliamentary and municipal elections. Although the PUP continues to domi-
 nate all three branches of government, opposition parties have on occasion per-
 suaded PUP members of Parliament, including the National Assembly leadership,
 to vote with the opposition on specific legislative matters. Conte won a second 5-
 year term in a December election that was marred by violence and civil unrest be-
 fore and after election day, widespread and diverse irregularities that tended to
 favor the incumbent, and the arrest and detention of major opposition candidates
 during the vote-counting process, but was nevertheless much more transparent and
 fair than the 1993 election. The Government continued to dominate the electoral
 process and did not create an independent electoral commission as initially de-
 manded by both opposition parties and ruling party dissidents; instead, it struck a
 compromise with the opposition and formed a High Council for Electoral Affairs,
 composed of representatives from many parties, but with authority limited to local
 vote counting and the transmission of results. A disproportionate number of public
 sector positions, including senior military and cabinet posts, are held by members
 of the President's ethnic group, the Soussou. The judiciary is subject to executive
 influence, particularly in politically sensitive cases.
 The gendarmerie and the national police share responsibility for internal security
 and sometimes play an oppressive role in the daily lives of citizens. Members of the
 elite presidential guard are, accountable to almost no one except the President.
 Members of the security forces frequently committed human rights abuses.,
 
 
 About 85 percent of the country's 7.1 million people engage in subsistence agri-
 culture. Annual recorded per capita gross domestic product was about $540 in 1997.
 More than 80 percent of export earnings come from mining, particularly bauxite,
 gold, and diamonds. Other exports include coffee and fruit. There has been modest
 economic growth in recent years, due in part to substantial assistance from inter-
 national financial institutions. However, growth continued to be hindered by wide-
 spread corruption and limited although increasing transparency in government; in
 particular, corruption at the port and customs offices hampers effective collection of
 non-mining receipts.
 The Government continued to circumscribe human rights and:its overall human
 rights record generally was poor. The Government's tight and sometimes partisan
 control of the 1998 electoral process, its refusal to create an independent electoral
 oversight mechanism, and its prohibition of nongovernmental broadcast media, call
 into serious doubt the ability of citizens to change the government. Major human
 rights abuses include: Extrajudicial killings; disappearances; use of torture by police
 and military personnel; police abuse of prisoners and detainees; occasional instances
 of vigilante justice by unidentified uniformed personnel; inhuman prison conditions
 and frequent deaths due to these conditions and lack of medical care; instances of
 arbitrary arrest and detention; governmental failure to ensure access by attorneys
 to clients in prison; the executive branch's influence over the judicial system and
 the electoral process; infringement on citizens' privacy; and restrictions on freedom
 of speech and the press. The private press criticized the Government, but met with
 a broad range of restrictions, including the arrest of journalists. The Government
 continued to own and to-operate as a monopoly the broadcast media including radio,
 the most important means of medium of mass communication. Other major human
 rights abuses included: Restrictions on freedom of assembly; societal discrimination
 and violence against women; and prostitution and genital mutilation of young girls;
 ethnic discrimination and interethnic violence; child labor, and vigilante actions by
 victims or others.
 During the year, the Ministry of Justice, the National Assembly and local non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) continued their attempts to educate the citi-
 zenry and officials about the judicial process and human rights. The Ministry of Na-
 tional Defense sponsored a series of seminars to teach the armed forces and gen-
 darmes about human rights. Since 1997 the International Committee of the Red
 Cross has trained Ministry of Security officials and customs officers in humanitarian
 law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces killed a number of
 persons during attempts to control rioting throughout the year. On February 2 and
 3, security forces clashed with residents of Conakry's :Ratoma section during a 2-
 day riot caused by the Government's destruction, without comp ensation, of illegally
 constructed houses and shops that left 100,000 persons homeless, mostly members
 of the Puhlar ethnic group (see Section 5). Riots broke out again on March 23 and
 24 when the demolition of houses in this commune resumed. Members of the secu-
 rity forces killed 8 civilians and injured 40 others, and 1 gendarme was killed and
 his body mutilated by protesters during 2 days of disturbances. Fifty-nine people
 were arrested following the riot, including 3 members of the National Assembly (see
 Sections 1.e. and 1.d.); their trial took place in June. Twenty-four of them, charged
 with inciting rebellion, destruction of public property, and withholding knowledge of
 criminal acts, were sentenced to 1-year prison terms and fined $150 (195,000 FG).
 Two religious leaders and the three members of the National Assembly were found
 guilty of inciting violence. The two religious leaders were sentenced to a 2-year pris-
 on term and fined $800 (1,040,000 FG). One of the legislators was sentenced to 2
 months, while the two other deputies were sentenced to 5 months in prison and
 fined $800 (1,040,000 FG).
 Government officials used excessive force and killed a number of persons both in
 suppressing opposition party political rallies before the December 14 presidential
 election and in suppressing antigovernment demonstrations, riots and interethnic
 violence in the wake of the election. On November 28, Jean Traore, subprefect of
 Banian in the southeastern region, shot and killed one man and wounded two other
 persons while attempting to disperse a gathering of supporters of the Rally of the
 Guinean People (RPG), an opposition party. Persons in the crowd then beat and
 killed Traore. Shortly after the election, members of the security forces reportedly
 shot and killed two RPG supporters in the largely pro-RPG town of Siguiri.
 
 
 In late December, a soldier posted at Camp Alpha Yaya near Conakry died of in-
 juries sustained in a beating ordered by his battalion commander, Panival Sama
 Bangoura, to punish him for having tried to vote outside the camp on December 14.
 A woman died of injuries inflicted by members of the security forces on December
 28, during their suppression of riots that broke out in Labe, the hometown of the
 soldier who had been beaten and killed, after his body was returned to that town
 (see Section 3). Bangoura was reprimanded, but was neither relieved of his com-
 mand nor otherwise punished.
 Security forces committed extrajudicial killings during the February 1996 mutiny.
 Between 30 and 50 persons, mostly civilian victims of stray gunfire, were killed by
 military forces and mutineers during the 2-day uprising. Numerous suspects were
 arrested by the Government and charged with murder, threatening state security,
 destruction of state property, and dereliction of duty. In June 1997, the Government
 activated a State Security Court to try the remaining 30 to 40 alleged mutiny ring-
 leaders still in prison awaiting trial (see Section I.e.). Trial proceedings began in
 March and finished in late August. All defendants were given a chance to present
 their responses to government charges and were sentenced in October (see Section
 I.e.).
 Deaths in custody due to inhuman prison conditions and inadequate medical
 treatment remained frequent (see Section 1.c.).
 Government authorities continued to block efforts by human rights groups and
 NGO's to investigate political killings that took place in the 1970's under then-presi-
 dent Sekou Toure andto protect victims' burial plots from urban encroachment. Two
 NGO's representing the victims of those who died in Camp Boiro, the Conakry pris-
 on where hundreds of political prisoners and members of the intelligentsia were de-
 tained or killed, held a memorial service in 1997 to call attention to their cause.
 A memorial to the victims is being erected at the site.
 On December 12, at the climax of the election campaign, between four and six
 persons reportedly were killed during interethnic violence in Conakry between mem-
 bers of President Conte's Soussou ethnic group and members of the Puhlar and (to
 a lesser extent) Malinke ethnic groups who supported opposition candidates (see
 Section 3).
 Sierra Leonean rebels killed a number of civilians and members of the security
 forces in cross-border raids in June and November. Guinean forces also claim to
 have killed 14 of the participants in a November raid.
 Many victims of crime fear that they may never receive justice because of judicial
 corruption and may resort to exacting their own form of retribution through vigi-
 lante violence. Some suspected criminals, notably thieves and rapists, are beaten to
 death or burned by their victims or others after being soaked with a flammable liq-
 uid. At least two such incidents occurred at the main market in Conakry in 1997.
 b. Disappearance.-Opposition leaders, local NGO's, and the independent press
 routinely report cases of politically motivated temporary disapearances that usu-
 ally ended with the eventual release of the prisoners who had been held by security
 forces.
 In the months after the February 1996 mutiny, hundreds of soldiers and civilians
 disappeared during neighborhood sweeps conducted by armed members of the secu-
 rity forces, who often were masked to hide their identities. Dozens of soldiers were
 interrogated ad transferred to judicial authorities for legal proceedings related to
 the mutiny. In August 1996, prosecutors released 63 detainees for lack of evidence;
 the others were sentenced in October (see Section i.e.). Baba Sarr, a relative of re-
 ported mutiny ringleader Major Gbago Zoumanigui, remains missing since his de-
 tention following the February 1996 mutiny.
 Sierra Leonean rebels reportedly abducted a number of civilian hostages during
 a cross-border raid in the Faranna district in November (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment; however, both civilian and military security forces often use tor-
 ture and beatings to extract confessions and employ other forms of brutality, includ-
 ing holding prisoners incommunicado without charges and under inhuman condi-
 tions. Local human rights organizations and former detainees stated that some pris-
 oners are bound and hung by their feet before being beaten. There were no reported
 judicial proceedings against officers suspected of committing abuses. Many citizens
 view the security forces as corrupt, ineffective, and even dangerous.
 Defendants in the Ratoma riots' trial reported neglect and torture during their de-
 tenton at their trial proceedings (see Section l.a.).
 Unidentified uniformed personnel acting as vigilantes used torture, beatings, un-
 sanitary conditions, and restrictions on food in secret prisons to obtain confessions
 from those suspected of involvement in the 1996 mutiny and any cases considered
 
 
 as "national security" (see Section 1.d.). Soldiers arrested for the 1996 mutiny re-
 ported being tortured at the Kassa prison by military personnel. According to the
 defendants, police temporarily transferred the soldiers from the Koundara prison to
 Kassa for interrogation and torture (see Section l.a.).
 Units of the armed forces that intervened in the fighting in Guinea-Bissau report-
 edly beat and harassed civilians.
 Prison conditions are inhuman and life threatening. Family members and friends
 are responsible for feeding prisoners. Guards often demanded bribes in exchange for
 letting food through to those incarcerated. Standards of sanitation remained poor,
 and there were several dozen deaths due to malnutrition and disease. A former in-
 mate held in the central prison in Conakry reported being housed with between 60
 and 80 prisoners in 1 cell, with 1 toilet and no beds. Prisoners reported threats,
 beatings, and harassment -by guards. There are credible reports from prisoners that
 female inmates are subject to harassment and sexual assault by guards.
 The Organisation Guineenne De Defense Des Droits De Lhomme Et Du Citoyen
 (OGDH) determined that prisoners in at least one major prison, located in
 N'Zerekore, suffered more from neglect and lack of resources than from mistreat-
 ment. According to the OGDH, the N Zerekore prison is a converted grain ware-
 house built in 1932 for 70 prisoners, but it currently houses 120. There is no elec-
 tricity or running water.
 The independent press, a local human rights organization, and a former prisoner
 report that inmates routinely are beaten and subjected to other forms of abuse at
 the prison in Koundara in northern Guinea. Although the Minister of Justice criti-
 cized inhuman prison conditions during televised visits to prison facilities in 1996,
 no concrete action has yet been taken to improve conditions. The Government per-
 mits prison visits by local humanitarian and religious organizations, which offer
 medical care and food for those in severe need. A former prisoner reported that
 without this assistance those who do not have families or friends would starve to
 death.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has sought but not ob-
 tained access to prisoners. However, as of year's end the ICRC was negotiating with
 the Government for satisfactory access to prisoners.
 In 1997 there were reports of sexual assaults by soldiers on refugees, and some
 soldiers demanded sex in exchange for entry into the country (see Sections 2.d. and
 5).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest remains a persistent
 threat despite procedural provisions in the Penal Code desigued to safeguard detain-
 ees. In practice administrative controls over the police are ineffective, and security
 forces rarely follow the Penal Code.
 The Penal Code requires that the Government issue a warrant before an arrest
 can be made and charge detainees before a magistrate within 72 hours. However,
 many detainees are incarcerated for longer periods before being charged. After being
 charged, the accused may be held until the conclusion of the case, including a period
 of appeal. Release on bail is at the discretion of the magistrate who has jurisdiction.
 The Constitution proscribes incommunicado detention. The law provides for access
 by attorneys to their clients, but authorities frequently do not respect this provision.
 Security forces arrested 59 persons following the Ratoma riots in March (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). The arrests occurred days after the riots and some distance from the site
 of the riot.
 On April 3, police arrested three National Assembly members, including Momary
 Camara and Mamary Famory Conde from the opposition party, Rally of the Guin-
 ean People (RPG), in Beyla after disbanding their political meeting. Police arrested
 them for holding an unauthorized meeting, then released them a few weeks later
 without any legal proceedings (see Section 2.b.).
 A spokesperson of the opposition RPG party claimed in an international radio
 interview that on November 15, at the start of the presidential campaign, the pre-
 fects of Mandiana, Kerouane, Macenta, and Nzerekore had arrested RPG supporters
 in those prefectures; and that some of those arrested were still in detention as of
 November 20. In another interview during the same radio broadcast, an Interior
 Ministry official stated that these allegations were false.
 On December 12, while suppressing interethnic violence in Conakry (see Section
 l.a.), members of the security forces arrested and detained Marcel Cros, a leader-
 of the minority PDA party and close advisor of Alpha Conde, leader of the RPG op-
 position party. Cros remained in detention at year's end.
 - On December 14, election day, security forces reportedly arrested 30 RPG poll
 watchers in Boffa and 80 poll watchers of the Union for Progress and Renewal
 (UPR) opposition party in Gaoual and Koundara prefectures. The opposition poll
 
 
 watchers, some of whom were accused of being mercenaries by the security force
 members who arrested them, were released the day after the election.
 On December 15, 1 day after the presidential election but 2 days before the Gov-
 ernment announced the results, members of the security forces arrested Alpha
 Conde, the presidential candidate of the RPG opposition party, at the town of Lola
 on the Liberian border, the Government had closed the border there since December
 9 as an election security measure. Conde was arrested for trying to leave the coun-
 try illegally. He had entered the country in early December, after an 18-month ab-
 sence, specifically in order to compete in the election. The Government detained
 Conde incommunicado until December 30, when it charged him with trying to leave
 the country illegally, resisting arrest, engaging in illegal foreign currency trans-
 actions, and training an armed force to overthrow the Government. Conde remained
 in detention at years end.
 The Government also briefly confined to their houses, during the tabulation of the
 election results, the other major opposition party presidential candidate Bah
 Mamadou of the Union for Progress and Renewal (UPR), and a minor-party presi-
 dential candidate, Jean-Marie Dore.
 On December 28, members of the security forces arrested and detained about 20
 persons during their suppression of rioting that occurred in the town of Labe follow-
 ing the return of the body of a solider from the town who had died of injuries suf-
 fered during a beating ordered by his commander to punish him for trying to vote
 outside the military camp where he was posted (see Sections L.a. and 3).
 Bar Association attorneys, the independent press, and government sources de-
 scribe a parallel system of justice run by unidentified uniformed personnel who con-
 duct midnight arrests, detain suspects, and use torture in secret prisons to obtain
 confessions before transferring detainees to prosecutors (see Section 1.c.).
 A member of a political opposition party, a soldier, a local human rights organiza-
 tion, and former prisoners all reported that the Government imprisons for political
 reasons persons considered a threat to state security at Kassa prison, allegedly lo-
 cated in a former French colonial structure on an island off the coast of Conakry.
 The Government denies the existence of the Kassa prison and states that prisoners
 identified as political detainees have been incarcerated for criminal acts and are lo-
 cated in other prisons. Foreign diplomats recently visited the military installation
 on Kassa island, where the armed forces plan to conduct joint training with ele-
 ments of foreign armed forces; saw nothing that resembled a prison or detention
 center.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the judiciary's inde-
 pendence; however, judicial authorities routinely defer to executive authorities and
 the executive branch in politically sensitive cases. Magistrates are civil servants
 with no assurance of tenure. Due to corruption and nepotism in the judiciary, rel-
 atives of influential members of the Government often are, in effect, above the law.
 In 1996 the Cabinet stated that it would pursue those who violate the law but avoid
 punishment due to judicial corruption, including the autonomous Presidential
 Guard; however, no action has been taken. Judges often do not act independently,
 and their verdicts are subject to outside interference. Influential persons often inter-
 vene on behalf of their relatives to prevent a negative judgment from being carried
 out.
 The Judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court, the court of final appeal. Since 1988 civilian courts have rendered all
 judgments involving civilians under the Penal Code. A military tribunal prepares
 and adjudicates charges against accused military personnel, to whom the Penal
 Code does not apply. The Government announced in 1996 the creation of a Dis-
 cipline Council for dealing with civil servants who abuse their positions as govern-
 ment employees, but as of year's end, the Council had not prosecuted any cases.
 In April gee National Assembly members of the opposition UNR party, including
 party leader Bah Mamadou, were tried, convicted and sentenced to several months
 in prison for allegedly inciting the Ratoma riots (see Sections l.a. and 5). Many ob-
 servers noted a lack of compelling evidence to support the charges.
 In 1997 Minister of Justice Maurice Zogbelemou Togba activated a special state
 security court to try alleged participants in the February 1996 military mutiny.
 Togba defended the Special Court's legality, citing statutes predating the 1992 Con-
 stitution. Members of political opposition parties and the independent press main-
 tained that the Court is unconstitutional, arguing that the Fundamental Law of
 1992 superseded related statutes. They also maintained that because the State pre-
 sents evidence as well as makes final judgment, the Court infringes on the pris-
 oners' due process rights. In October the special security court concluded its trials
 of the alleged mutineers. Of the 96 persons over whom the court exercised jurisdic-
 
 
 tion, 4 were never charged, 13 were released because the time they already had
 served in detention exceeded their sentences, 2 were released because of illness or
 immunity, 34 were acquitted, and 43 were sentenced to prison terms ranging from
 3 to 20 years. The 20-year sentences were given to members of the armed forces
 who had fled the country and who were tried in absentia.
 The judicial system is plagued by numerous problems, including a shortage of
 qualified lawyers and magistrates and an outdated and restrictive penal code. The
 Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the inde-
 pendence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the accused
 to counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. Although in principle the Gov-
 ernment is responsible for funding legal defense costs in serious criminal cases, in
 practice it rarely disburses these funds. The attorney for the defense frequently re-
 ceives no payment. The Government provided counsel for dozens of soldiers charged
 in connection with the February 1996 mutiny and the quasiindependent Bar Asso-
 ciation started a permanent legal defense fund.
 Defense lawyers for the soldiers incarcerated in connection with the 1996 mutiny
 complained that they had difficulty obtaining permission to meet with their clients,
 particularly after President Conte activated the Security Court in June 1997. They
 also reported that prison guards eavesdropped on their conversations and denied
 family visits to the detainees and that the Government reduced their clients' sala-
 ries by as much as 60 percent to pay for prison meals.
 Many citizens are wary of judicial corruption and prefer instead to rely on tradi-
 tional systems of justice at the village or urban neighborhood level. Litigants
 present their civil cases before a village chief, a neighborhood leader, or a council
 of wise men. The dividing line between the formal and informal justice systems is
 vague, and authorities may refer a case from the formal to the traditional system
 to ensure compliance by all parties. Similarly, if a case cannot be resolved to the
 satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the formal
 system for adjudication. The" traditional system discriminates against women in that
 evidence given by women carries less weight (see Section 5).
 Vigilante action by victims or others sometimes resulted in the beating to death
 of suspected criminals (see Section l.a.).
 At year's end, the Government held an unknown number of political prisoners.
 Such prisoners are individuals incarcerated for allegedly politically motivated acts,
 such as protests, meetings, and campaigns; but arrested and convicted under crimi-
 nal laws such as those applying to creating disorder, inciting violence, and corrup-
 tion. Some of these individuals consequently received disproportionately harsh pun-
 ishment due to their political affiliation. Members of political opposition parties and
 a local human rights organization state that dozens of persons are being detained
 or have disappeared for political reasons (see Sections 1.c- and 1.d.).
 The Government denies holding any political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants
 are required by law; however, police frequently ignore these procedures. Police and
 paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals. Private
 citizens frequently are detained at nighttime roadblocks set up by police and the
 military for purposes of security and extortion (see Section 2.d.).
 It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and telephone calls. Local
 businesses, including foreign companies, often complain of intimidation and harass-
 ment by public officials and authorities.
 In February and March, the Government forcibly demolished, without compensa-
 tion, a large number of illegally constructed dwellings in the Ratoma neighborhood
 of Conakry, leaving about 100,000 persons homeless. Security forces were used to
 overcome the residents' resistance to the demolitions (see Section L.a.).
 Sierra Leonian rebels burned homes, stole livestock and other goods, and took ci-
 vilian hostages, during cross-border raids in June and November (see Section l.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, subject to certain limitations; however, despite government statements in sup-
 port of free speech and a free press, the Government employs a broad range of re-
 strictions on these rights. The Government prohibits what it considers seditious talk
 or chants in public, has established defamation and slander as criminal offenses,
 and prohibits communications that personally insult the President, or incite vio-
 lence, discrimination, or hatred, or that disturb the public peace. Opposition mem-
 bers of the National Assembly arrested in connection with the Ratoma riots were
 detained and convicted under these laws.
 
 
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, Horoya, and operates the official
 television and radio (ORTG) stations. Reporters for the official press, who are gov-
 ernment employees, practice self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. Several
 younger broadcast journalists reported critically about the Government and posed
 critical questions at official press conferences.
 While the only daily newspaper (Horoya) is owned and operated by the State,
 there is a vocal private press that is critical of the President and the Government
 For example, the weekly satirical newspaper Le Lynx publishes front-page cartoons
 lampooning the President and senior government officials. Five private newspapers
 (Le Lynx, La Lance, L'Oeil, LIndependan , and L'Independant Plus) publish weekly
 in Conakry, and up to 10 other publications appear sporadically, although hampered
 by technical and financial difficulties. One newspaper, LEspoir, is a ted with
 the governing political party (PUP), and several other newspapers are ailated
 with opposition parties. Other newspapers offer news and criticism of both the Gov-
 ernment and the opposition.
 In 1997 President Conte replaced Minister of Information and Culture Michel
 Kamano. Kamano, a senior ranking cabinet minister, had been a vocal proponent
 of establishing independent radio.
 The Government occasionally detains journalists. Police arrested editor in chief
 Louis Celestin, and publisher Ousmane Camara, of the independent weekly news-
 paper L'Oeil on August 1, 1997 aftr the Minister of Justice filed a complaint accus-
 rg the two men of libel and publishing false information. The newspaper had rint-
 ed an article that criticized Justice Minister Togba and his attempts to ste the
 country's independent press. The journalists were released on August 11, 1997, with
 no formal charges filed. They were detained again on August 25, 1997, after the
 newspaper printed a follow-up story again criticizing the Justice Minister but subse-
 quently were released. In December 1997, police arrested and deported Celestin to
 Cote d'Ivoire on charges of incitement to violence and riot after he published an arti-
 cle on the conference of the coalition of opposition parties (CODEM) with the head-
 line, "Trhe Final Assault Soon." Authorities accused Celestin, an Ivorian national, of
 not having a work permit.
 Security forces also expelled Sierra Leonean journalist Foday Fofana in January
 after several months of detention on charges of spying and filing false reports.
 Fofana was working as a stringer for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
 On December 26, 1997, police illegally searched and seized production equipment
 from two private newspapers, Le Lynx and L'Idependent. Police returned the
 equipment 3 days later. The Minister of Security, Sekou Koureissy Conde, cited rea-
 sons of national security for the search and seizure. On January 1, L'Independent
 published an article on the public's reaction to the search and seizure with the title,
 'Koureissy, the public is indignant." Following the publication, the Minister of Secu-
 rity issued an arrest warrant for Aboubacar Conde, editor in chief of L'Independent.
 Police arrested Conde on March 6 and detined him without charges for 72 hours
 before releasing him.
 In March police arrested Salou Samb, the deputy executive editor in chief of the
 weekly independent newspaper L Independent. Authorities later expelled Samb to
 his native Senegal without explanation.
 The Government owns and operates all domestic broadcast media including radio,
 which serves as the most important means of informing the public. In 1996 the Gov-
 ernment temporarily authorized a domestic station to retransmit on FM wave-
 lengths promig broadcast by Africa Number One, a private radio station
 based in  aon. Te Government promised to issue the station a permanent license
 but did not do so, and the station is no longer broadcasting. Many citizens listen
 regularly to foreign-origin short-wave radio, and access to foreign television satellite
 broadcasts is growing. The Government does not restrict access to or distribution
 of foreign television programming via satellite or cable, although relatively few citi-
 zens can afford these services.
 The country has had full Internet access since 1997. At year's end, there were
 three domestic service providers, two strictly private and one affiliated with
 SOTELGUI, a private phone company that holds a monopoly on international phone
 lines. The Government did not restrict Internet access. Storefront operations offer-
 ing Internet access were common throughout downtown Conakry. However, a lack
 of reliable phone lines inhibited home Internet access, even for the few who could
 afford it.
 The state-ownedeedia are not impartial; they provide extensive and almost in-
 variably favorable coverage of the Government and ruling party, while providing lit-
 tle coverage of opposition party activities. The state-owned broadcast media monop-
 oly did not give opposition candidates equal coverage or allow them equal access
 during the 1998 presidential election campaign (see Section 3).

 Political tracts occasionally circulate in Conakry and other urban areas. Some
 tracts support the Government, while others specifically criticize senior officials.
 Foreign publications, some of which criticize the Government, often are available.
 The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research exercises limited con-
 trol over academic freedom through its influence on faculty hiring and control over
 the curriculum. In general teachers are not subject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law restricts freedom of
 assembly, and the Government exercises its power to thwart unwanted political ac-
 tivity. The Penal Code bans any meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or
 any gathering "whose nature threatens national unity." The Government requires
 notification 72 hourg prior to public gatherings, otherwise the events are considered
 illegal.
 The Government bans all street marches except funerals. The law allows local au-
 thorities to cancel a demonstration or meeting if they believe that it poses a threat
 to public order. They may hold event organizers criminally liable if violence or de-
 struction of property ensues.
 In March security forces used tear gas to disperse a meeting in Conakry that
 CODEM, the opposition party coalition, organized for its female members to coincide
 with International Women's Day. The Government contended that the meeting was
 not authorized.
 In April police arrested two opposition party members of the National Assembly
 in Beyla on charges of holding an unauthorized meeting (see Section 1.d.).
 Union organizers of a nationwide teacher strike in April 1997 reported being har-
 assed by youths whom they believed had been recruited by government officials (see
 Section 6.a.).
 On November 30, riot police used tear gas to disperse university students dem-
 onstrating in Conakry for changes in the educational system and reportedly arrested
 25 students.
 In November and December, during the presidential election campaign, ruling
 party supporters and government officials repeatedly attempted to prevent opposi-
 tion party meetings in the capital and several provincial towns (see Section l.a.).
 During the week following the presidential election, security forces in Conakry re-
 peatedly used force to break up demonstrations protesting the Government's con-
 duct of the election. Some of these demonstrations were already violent before secu-
 rity forces intervened; some were not.
 Freedom of association is protected by law, but there are cumbersome require-
 ments to obtain government recognition. Political parties must provide information
 on their founding members and produce internal statutes and political platforms
 consistent with the Constitution before the Government recognizes them. There are
 approximately 46 legally recognized political parties; deputies of 9 different parties
 are represented in the National Assembly.
 There were credible reports of harassment and oppression of the opposition RPG
 party (see Sections l.a. and 1.d.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 permits religious communities to govern themselves without state interference, and
 the Government generally respects these rights in practice. The quasi-governmental
 National Islamic League represents the country's Muslims, who make up 85 percent
 of the population. The League states that it supports peaceful coexistence with other
 religious denominations and actively attempts to facilitate dialog to eliminate ethnic
 and religious tensions. Although the Government and the National Islamic League
 have spoken out against the proliferation of Shi'ite fundamentalist sects, which they
 alleged were "generating confusion and deviation" within Guinean Islam, they have
 not restricted these groups. Foreign missionaries and church-affiliated relief agen-
 cies operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel freely within
 the country and to change their place of residence and work; however, authorities
 infringe on these rights in some respects. The Government requires all citizens to
 carry national identification cards, which they must present on demand at security
 checkpoints. Travelers face harassment by police and at military roadblocks, par-
 ticularly late at night. The private press and local NGO's reported that travelers
 often are pressured to pay bribes to allow passage. In 1997 President Conte an-
 nounced the shutdown of the infamous "Kilometer 36," a manned checkpoint on the
 only road leading from Conakry to the interior of the country. The checkpoint had
 been the scene of rampant corruption and harassment. The Government later rees-
 tablished the checkpoint, along with new ones, throughout the country following the
 May 1997 coup in neighboring Sierra Leone. Government officials state that the cor-
 
 
 195
 ruption is being perpetrated by a few rogue soldiers. However, abuse at official
 checkpoints is systematic.
 Although the Government permits foreign travel for its citizens, it retains the au-
 thority to limit it for political reasons.
 The Government kept its land border with Sierra Leone dosed throughout the
 year for security reasons related to the widespread violence in Sierra Leone since
 the May 1997 coup d'etat. From December 9 to December 20, the Government closed
 all land borders by decree as a security measure related to the presidential election.
 On December 15, authorities arrested opposition presidential candidate and Na-
 tional Assembly member Alpha Conde for trying to leave the country by crossing
 the closed border into Cote d Ivoire, near Liberia (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government cooperates fully with the UNHCR, the World Food Program,
 other humanitarian organizations, and donor countries to assist refugees. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum in accordance with United Nations and Organization
 of African Unity conventions. According to a 1998 census report, the Government
 rovided asylum to more than 550,000 refugees, primarily from Liberia and Sierra
 Leone. Refugees account for half or more of the populations of the forest region cit-
 ies of N'zerekore, Gueckedou, and Macenta. According to the UNHCR, more than
 200,000 Sierra Leoneans entered Guinea since January and are mostly in the forest
 region. With the Government's cooperation, the UNHCR implemented an emergency
 program for 1,800 Gujinean migrants who fled Guinea-Bisssau following the coup
 there in June and sought refuge in the northwestern part of the country.
 The Government has provided school buildings, access to local medical facilities,
 and land for farming to assist those designated as refugees. However, relief organi-
 zations report that some local authorities have demanded portions of donated fuel
 and food from delivery convoys. The security forces' closure of a rad in the forest
 region in June and July, in response to a cross-border raid by Sierra Leonean rebels,
 briefly prevented the UNHCR and NGO's from delivering supplies to refugees near
 the border.
 The Government generally has been hospitable toward refugees. Reports that po-
 lice and border patrol guards demanded bribes before allowing refugees into the
 country and that some border officers demanded sex from women who lacked money
 to pay bribes, have become rare, an improvement over previous recent years.
 International NGO's stated that refugees are subject to arbitrary arrests but that
 the harassment is not targeted specifically at refugees. The UNHCR reports that
 detainees, often held for having insufficient identification or being suspected rebels,
 are charged before a magistrate within 72 hours as required by law.
 UNHCR officials reported being denied access to refugees that security forces sus-
 pected of being rebels. Security forces arrested suspected rebels at the border as
 they tried to enter Guinea.
 There were no reports of the forcible return of persons with a valid claim to refu-
 gee status to a country where they feared persecution, although Guinean authorities
 in some instances turned suspected rebels over to the Government of Sierra Leone.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizes to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1990 Constitution provides for a popularly elected President and Na-
 tional Assembly, the ability of citizens effectively to exercise this prvision is re-
 stricted, The Government's tight and sometimes partisan control of the electoral
 process and lack of an independent electoral oversight mechanism call into serious
 doubt the ability of citizens peacefully to change the Government.
 Although the Government legalized opposition parties following widespread pro-
 democracy protests in 1991, the Government has continued to dominate the elec-
 toral process; General Conte has remained President, and his PUP party has re-
 tained a majority in the National Assembly. The Government controlled the first
 multiparty presidential election in 1993 from start to finish, denying the opposition
 any significant role. During both that election and the first multiparty legislative
 elections in 1995, obseerers from the International Commission of Jurists reported
 seeing no seals on the legislative ballots, tally envelopes lef open, and various
 means of intimidation used at some polling places. The African-American Institute
 stated that the National Electoral Commission-the supposed "moral guarantor of
 electoral fairness"-had only a marginal role.
 The country's second multiparty presidential election was held on December 14,
 after a campaign limited by the Constitution to the 30 days up to 2 days before the
 election. The Government continued to refuse to establish a national election com-
 mission independent of the Government, which opposition leaders demanded. In
 September the Government and the CODEM, an umbrella group of opposition par-
 ties formed in 1995, agreed to establish a Superior Council for Electoral Affairs
 
 
 (SCEA) and local vote counting commissions, composed of CODEM as well as gov-
 ernment and ruling party representatives, with authority over local vote counting
 and transmission of local results to Conakry. However, the Government retained ex-
 clusive control of all registration and election procedures up to and including the
 casting of votes, as well as of the national tabulation of election results.
 According to the Government's tabulation of results, General Conte was elected
 to a second 5-year term as President, receiving 56 percent of the 2.7 million votes
 cast, while Bah Mamadou of the UNR received 25 ercent and Alpha Conde of the
 RPG received 17 percent. Had no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a sec-
 ond election between the two leading candidates in the December 14 election would
 have been required by the Constitution.
 This election was much more transparent and fair than the 1993 presidential elec-
 tion. Observers from diverse organizations affiliated chiefly with developing coun-
 tries issued a statement that found no fault with the election-day vote-casting proc-
 ess. However, observers from European and other credible foreign organizations did
 not endorse that statement, which was issued before the election results were an-
 nounced and did not address the registration, campaigning, and vote-counting proc-
 esses.
 The presidential election was marred by violence and disruption of opposition
 campaigning before the polling, by civil unrest after the polling, by widespread and
 diverse irregularities that tended to favor the incumbent, and by the arrest and de-
 tention of major opposition candidates during the vote-counting process.
 There were credible reports that ruling party supporters and government officials
 repeatedly used force to prevent or disrupt opposition party meetings in Conakry
 and in several provincial towns during the campaign. In one such incident, a gov-
 ernment official shot and killed a man and wounded two other persons in a con-
 frontation at an RPG party meeting; he was then attacked and killed by the crowd
 (see Sections L.a. and 2.b.).
 A spokesperson for the opposition RPG party claimed that on November 15, at the
 start of the presidential campaign, the prefects of Mandiana, Kerouane, Macenta,
 and Nzerekore had arrested RPG supporters in those prefectures and that some of
 those arrested were still in detention as of November 20 (see Section 1.d.). On De-
 cember 12, members of the security forces arrested and detained Marcel Cros, a
 leader of the PDA, a minor opposition party associated with the RPG party (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 Violence between PUP and opposition party supporters was frequent and wide-
 spread during the election campaign. Serious interethnic violence with political
 overtones (see Section 5) occurred in Conakry. On December 11, large crowds with
 differing ethnic and political affiliations threw rocks at each other in the city center.
 On December 12, the violence intensified and between four and six persons were
 killed, following a large pro-Conte PUP rally at which foul water was served, and
 at which it was announced over the public address system that the water had been
 poisoned with acid. Mobs with different ethnic and political affiliatidns fought each
 other with sticks and rocks, and a pro-opposition mob looted a marketplace before
 being dispersed by the security forces. Sporadic violence persisted on December 13
 (see Section l.a.).
 Opposition candidates suffered from inferior access both to state election funds
 and to coverage by the state-monopolized domestic broadcast media, although the
 Government allotted each candidate an equal amount of television and radio broad-
 cast time each day throughout the campaign.
 On election day, international observers noted a shortage of ballots for opposition
 candidates in some pro-opposition districts of Conakry, but an abundance of ballots
 for President Conte even in pro-PUP districts. There were no charges of widespread,
 systematic obstruction of pollwatchers, but opposition pollwatchers were often ab-
 sent from heavily pro-Conte areas, and there were charges suggesting that selective
 obstruction of opposition pollwatchers was responsible for this. Opposition party offi-
 cials reportedly alleged that members of the security forces arrested and detained
 80 UNR pollwatchers and 30 RPG pollwatchers on election day (see Section 1.d.),
 thereby preventing them from watching the polls. The CODEM publicly alleged that
 the Government disclosed the locations of some polling places only to PUP support-
 ers, and recorded the votes of many persons who had registered but did not appear
 to vote as having been cast for President Conte. The CODEM reportedly also pub-
 licly alleged that in some districts opposition party poll watchers had been pre-
 vented from watching the polls and that the contents of some ballot boxes were
 counted, not at the polling station in the presence of poll watchers .from all parties,
 but in secret at military camps and customs posts to which the ballot boxes were
 taken by members of the Presidential Guard. The CODEM also alleged irregular-
 ities in voter registration, particularly in distribution of voter identification cards.
 
 
 Members of the armed forces were required to vote on the premises of the military
 installations to which they were posted and were subject to strong pressures to vote
 for General Conte. About 200 army soldiers assigned to Camp Alpha Yaya in
 Conakry tried to vote outside the camp in order to avoid this pressure. As punish-
 ment for this action, many of these soldiers were severely beaten by order of their
 battalion commander, Panival Sama Bangoura; one soldier died of injuries sustained
 in this-beating (see Section l.a.).
 The Government postponed the announcement of its tabulation of the election re-
 sults from December 16 to December 17. During the 3 days between the election
 and the Government's announcement of the results, bands of youths set fires and
 looted in Conakry, PUP and opposition supporters clashed violently in Mamou, and
 members of the security forces shot and killed two RPG supporters in Siguiri (see
 Section L.a.). On December 15, members of the security forces arrested RPG presi-
 dential candidate Alpha Conde for trying to leave the country by way of the closed
 land border with Cote d'Ivoire, near Liberia. The Government detained Conde in-
 conmnunicado until December 30, when it charged him in court with illegally trying
 to cross the border, resisting arrest, engaging in illegal foreign currency trans-
 actions, and training an armed force to overthrow the Government (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.d.). From December 17 until December 20, gendarmes posted outside the
 houses of two other presidential candidates, including UNR candidate Ba Mamadou,
 -confined the candidates to their residences.
 On December 28, antigovernment violence occurred in Labe, the hometown of the
 soldier who had been beaten and killed for trying to vote outside the army camp
 to which he was posted, after his body was returned to the town. A crowd burned
 the local office of the ruling PUP party and a vehicle belonging to the state-owned
 broadcast media monopoly and damaged a house owned by a PUP officer. In sup-
 pressing this violence, members of the security forces arrested about 20 persons and
 killed 1 woman (see Sections L.a. and 1.d.).
 Members of the PUP continued to hold 60 seats in the unicameral National As-
 sembly, one short of the supermajority required to amend the Constitution.
 The President continues to hold the power to appoint the governors, prefects and
 their deputies to administer regions and subregions respectively. Most of these offi-
 cials are members of the PUP or of parties allied with it. However, reorganization
 of these offices in August, did reflect a growing sense of accountability to the public
 by government officials regarding the performance of their official duties. The pre-
 fects and governors who retained their jobs or received promotions were those who
 had been rated as above average administrators by the Minister of the Interior in
 an April open letter in the private press. All the prefects and governors who lost
 their jobs had received an unsatisfactory rating.
 However, opposition party officials and the independent press continued to charge
 that the Government used public funds to build its electoral base within traditional
 opposition strongholds in anticipation of the 1998 presidential elections. Conte was
 also criticized by members of his own party for quashing the democratic process
 within the PUP during leadership elections at a party congress in 1997.
 During the April-May 1997 session of the National Assembly, a: majority of depu-
 ties again rejected the Minister of Territorial Administration's efforts to appoint,
 rather than elect, neighborhood councils, as he had attempted in 1996. No neighbor-
 hood council elections have been scheduled, and, as of the end of the year,- whether
 the presidents of these councils would be filled by appointment or election was still
 under debate. Local governments generally have limited autonomy. Although they
 have some financial resources with which to fund local programs, most of their
 funds are controlled by the central Government. However, local government staff
 members, such as deputy prefects, are hired and can be fired by local authorities
 and are not considered central Government employees.
 Women are underrepresented in the Government. In 1996'the President reduced
 the number of women who hold positions in the 23-member Cabinet from 4 mem-
 bers to 2. Women head the low profile ministries of Social Affairs and Youth, Sports,
 -and Civic Education. There are only 9 female.deputies in the 114-member National
 Assembly. There are few women at senior levels below minister and no women
 among senior military ranks. Women also -play a minor role in the leadership of the
 major political parties.
 The Cabinet and armed forces leadership include representatives of all major eth-
 nic groups. However, a disproportionate number of senior military officers are
 Soussou, the President's ethnic group. A somewhat but not grossly disproportionate
 number of civilian officials at or above the prefect level were also Soussous.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local NGO's primarily interested in human rights issues include: The Guinean
 Organization for the Defense of Human Rights; the Guinean Human Rights Associa-
 tion; the Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro; S.O.S. Burial Grounds; the Associa-
 tion of Victims of Repression; Humanitarian Assistance for Prisons; Defense of Pris-
 oners' Rights; Women Jurists for Human Rights; the Committee for the Defense of
 Civic Rights; and the Coordinating Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting
 Women's and Children's Health. Government officials are generally cooperative and
 responsive to their views. Various officials, however, have blocked private efforts to
 ,memorialize victims of the Sekou Toure regime that ruled Guinea from independ-
 ence until 1984.
 In June the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) conducted a semi-
 nar on human rights in conjunction with the Ministry of Security for members of
 the security forces and civil servants. A human rights office within the Ministry of
 Defense, International Humanitarian Rights (DIH), has conducted over 100 human
 rights seminars since 1994 to teach military personnel about human rights recog-
 nized by international and regional agreements.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed, but
 the Government does not enforce these provisions uniformly.
 Women.-Violence against women is common, although estimates differ as to the
 extent of the problem. Wife beating is a criminal offense and constitutes grounds
 for divorce under civil law. However, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Although the Government has made regular statements in the media against sex-
 ual harassment, women working in the formal sector in urban areas complain of fre-
 quent sexual harassment. There are credible reports from prisoners that female in-
 mates are subject to harassment and sexual assault by guards. The social stigma
 attached to rape prevents most victims from reporting it. The Government has not
 pursued vigorously criminal investigations of alleged sexual crimes.
 Refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone report that some soldiers demand sex in
 exchange for entry into Guinea. There are also reports of sexual assaults on refu-
 gees. No new information was available about the two male refugees who raped a
 female refugee in Yomou in 1997.
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and women, and the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Women's Promotion works to ensure such equality. How-
 ever, women face discrimination, particularly in rural areas where opportunities are
 limited by custom, the demands of child-rearing and subsistence farming. Women
 are not denied access to land, credit, or businesses, but inheritance laws also favor
 male heirs over females. Government officials acknowledge that polygyny is com-
 monly practiced, although it is prohibited by law. Divorce laws generally tend to
 favor men in awarding custody and dividing communal assets. Legal evidence given
 by women carries less weight than that given by men (see Section I.e.). The Govern-
 ment has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work, but in practice women
 receive less pay than men in most equally demanding jobs.
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth, and the Government allocates a
 significant percentage of the budget to primary education. The President appoints
 a cabinet minister to defend women's and children's rights and a Minister of Youth.
 The Government provides free, compulsory primary school education for 8 years. Ap-
 proximately 50.5 percent of all eligible students are enrolled in primary school, in-
 cluding 66 percent of eligible boys but only 35.5 percent of eligible girls. The Gov-
 ernment spent 25 percent of its national operating budget on education in 1997.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is nearly uni-
 versal. It is practiced in all regions and among all religious and ethnic groups. FGM
 is performed on girls and women between the ages of 4 and 70. FGM is illegal under
 the Penal Code, and senior officials and both the official and private press have spo-
 ken against the practice, but there have been no prosecutions for violations of the
 code. Exact figures on this procedure are difficult to establish due to its private na-
 ture. The Coordinating Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting Women's and
 Children's Health (CPTAFE) cite a recent decline in the percentage of females sub-
 jected to FGM, estimating the figure to be between 65 and 75 percent. Expert esti-
 mates vary between 65 and 90 percent. The lower figure, if accurate, would rep-
 resent a decline over recent years due to education of the population by woman's
 
 
 199
 rights groups about the health risks involved with the practice. However,
 infibulation, the most dangerous form of FGM, still is performed in the Forest re-
 gion. Despite diseases resulting from crude and unsanitary surgical instruments
 and deaths resulting from the practice, the tradition continues, seriously affecting
 women's lives. FGM also increases the risk of HIV infection since unsterilized in-
 struments are shared among participants.
 The Government has made efforts to educate health workers on the dangers of
 this procedure and supports the efforts of the CPTAFE, a local NGO dedicated to
 eradicating FGM and ritual scarring. The CPTAFE reports high rates of infant mor-
 tality and maternal mortality due to FGM.
 In March 1997, working in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the
 Government initiated a 20-year strategy to eradicate FGM.
 A growing number of men and women oppose the practice. Urban, educated fami-
 lies are opting increasingly to perform only a slight symbolic incision on a girl's
 genitals rather than the complete procedure. Those who perform FGM oppose its
 eradication since it is quite lucrative for them.
 The CPTAFE, in conjunction with the Government, local journalists, and inter-
 national NGO's, is also promoting an education campaign to discourage underage
 marriage. Although such marriages are prohibited by law, parents contract mar-
 riages for girls as young as 11years of age in the Forest region.
 Prostitution exists in the informal economic sector and employs girls as young as
 14 years of age. The Government does not take action even if prostitution of minors
 is brought to its attention and does not actively monitor child or adult prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no spcial constitutional provisions  or the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled, and few disabled per-
 sons work, although some develop opportunities in the informal sector.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's population is ethnically and
 regionally diverse. No single ethnic group constitutes a majority nationwide. The
 largest ethnic groups are the Puhlar, also called Peuhl or Fulani (about 40 percent
 of the population), the Malinke (about 30 percent), and the Soussou (about 20 per-
 cent). Each of these groups speaks a distinct primary language and is concentrated
 in a distinct region: The Soussou in lower Guinea, the Puhlar in middle Guinea, the
 Malinke in upper Guinea.
 While the Constitution and the Penal Code prohibit racial or ethnic discrimina-
 tion, ethnic identification is strong. Mutual suspicion affects relations across ethnic
 lines, in and out of government. Widespread societal ethnic discrimination by mem-
 bers of all major ethnic groups is evident in private sector hiring and buying pat-
 terns, in urban neighborhoods that tend to be ethnically segregated, and the relative
 paucity of interethnic marriage even in cities. Senior government levels and the
 hghest military ranks below the President include representatives of all three
 major ethnic groups, but the proportion of public sector positions occupied by
 Soussous, particularly at senior levels, is widely perceived as exceeding their share
 of the national population.
 The ruling PUP party, although generally supported by Soussous, has tran-
 scended ethnic boundaries more effectively than the major opposition parties, which
 have readily identifiable ethnic and regional bases; the UNR's main base is the
 Puhlar, while the RPG's main base is the Malinke. Soussou preeminence in the pub-
 lic sector and Malinke migration into the traditional homelands of smaller ethnic
 groups in the Forest region have been major sources of political tensions that have
 sometimes erupted into violence. In June President Conte fired the non-Soussou
 Secretary-General of Labor and Public Services as well as several non-Soussou di-
 rectors in his Department, replacing them with members of his ethnic group, the
 Soussou.
 The residents of Conakry's Ratoma neighborhood, where the Government razed
 100,000 houses without compensation in February and March, were mostly Publar.
 Both the Ratoma riots in February and March in protest of those demolitions (see
 Section l.a.) and the December 11-13 riots in Conakry (see Section 3) were largely
 incidents of interethnic violence between Soussous and Puhlar, even though the De-
 cember riots were also political violence between PUP and opposition party support-
 ers. The soldier beaten to death by order of his commander for having tried to vote
 outside his army post in the presidential election and many participants in the
 antigovernment violence that occurred in that soldier's hometown of Labe on Decem-
 ber 28, were members of the Puhlar ethnic group (see Sections L.a. and 3).
 Other incidents of ethnic violence have occurred in previous years, such as in
 March 1997, in the Forest region when members of the Malinke and Gerze ethnic
 Oups clashed following an alleged rape of a Gerze woman by a Malinke man.
 orkers for a humanitarian organization reported that ethnic tension persists be-
 
 
 tween the Malinke and Gerze ethnic groups in the Forest region due to the influx
 of Malinke into the area.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form independent labor unions and prohibits discrimination based on union affili-
 ation. Only an estimated 5 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union mem-
 bers are employees of the Government, national utilities (electric, water, and tele-
 phone companies), or foreign-controlled companies.
 The Labor Code states that all workers, except military and paramilitary person-
 nel, have the right to create and participate in organizations that defend and de-
 velop their individual and collective rights as workers. It requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 or more salaried workers.
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) was the sole trade union
 before the Labor Code was enacted. Although there are now other trade unions and
 labor confederations, the CNTG remains the largest confederation.
 The CNTG is funded indirectly by the State, although dissident members seek to
 increase the Confederation's freedom from government control. Independent unions
 and confederations have gained popularity, such as the Free Union of Teachers and
 Researchers of Guinea (SLECG), the Professional Union Federation for Education
 (FSPE), and the National Organization for Free Trade Unions of Guinea. Several
 dissident groups within the CNTG left the Confederation in 1996 citing corruption
 among its leadership. These groups joined with some independent unions to form
 the United Syndicates of Guinean Workers.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to strike. It prohibits strikes in sectors providing "essential services" (hos-
 pitals, radio and television, army, and police).
 A nationwide public-school teachers strike immobilized the education sector for
 2 weeks beginning in April 1997. Members of the SLECG and the FSPE reported
 harassment by the Government and its supporters, including the arrest of eight
 teachers, mob attacks on teachers' homes, cutting of phone lines, burning of tires
 in front of union headquarters by youths armed with rocks and clubs, threatening
 phone calls, and refusal by police to intervene. Union leaders ended the strike after
 President Conte promised to reinstate an 8 percent pay raise for all state employees.
 In August 1997 the teachers received an 8 percent salary increase; the same in-
 crease also was given to all other civil servants. Teachers also received the right
 to claim seniority benefits for any past training or internships.
 Unions may freely affiliate freely with international labor groups. The Govern-
 ment continues to designate the CNTG to represent workers in the International
 Labor Organization conference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize in the workplace and ne-
 gotiate with employers or employer organizations. The law protects the right to bar-
 gain collectively concerning wages and salaries without government interference.
 Work rules and work hours established by the employer are developed in consulta-
 tion with union delegates. The Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination. Union
 delegates represent individual and collective claims and grievances with manage-
 ment. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before management with a union representative present and, if
 necessary, to take the complaint to the Conakry Labor Court, which convenes week-
 ly to hear such cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice. The Labor
 Code specifically forbids forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government
 enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-According
 to the Labor Code, the minimum age for employment is 16 years. Apprentices may
 start to work at 14 years of age. However, many craft apprentices are as young as
 7 years of age. Workers and apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to
 work at night, for more than 12 consecutive hours, or on Sundays. The Labor Code
 also stipulates that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs must maintain a list
 of occupations in which women and youth under the age of 18 cannot be employed.
 In practice, enforcement by Ministry inspectors is limited to large firms in the mod-
 ern sector of the economy. A 1997 study by the Ministry of Planning stated that
 in rural areas, approximately 66 percent of children between the ages of 7 and 14
 were employed; the rate jumped to 91 percent in the 15 to 19 age group. In urban
 
 
 201
 areas, approximately 19 percent of children between the ages of 7 and 14 were em-
 ployed; the rate jumped to 50 percent for children between the ages of 15 and 19.
 Child labor in factories is not a prevalent problem because of the low level of manu-
 facturing. Working children are found mostly in the informal sector areas of subsist-
 ence farming, petty commerce, and small-scale mining.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohi-
 bition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code of 1988 provides for the estab-
 lishment by decree of a minimum hourly wage, but the Government has not done
 so. Prevailing wages were often inadequate to provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. There are also provisions in the Code for overtime and
 night wages, which are fixed percentages of the regular wage. Those with jobs in
 the private sector find salaries more commensurate with their needs. According to
 the Labor Code, regular work is not to exceed 10-hour days or 48-hour weeks, and
 there is to be a period of at least 24 consecutive hours of rest each week, usually
 Sunday. Every salaried worker has the legal right to an annual paid vacation, accu-
 mulated at the rate of at least 2 workdays per month of work. In practice the au-
 thorities enforce these rules only in the relatively small modem urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains provisions of a general nature regarding occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not elaborated a set of practical work-
 place health and safety standards. Moreover, it has not issued any of the ministerial
 orders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations and for certain
 methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspectors are em-
 powered to suspendwork immediately in situations hazardous to health. However,
 enforcement remained more a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors acknowledge
 that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with their small
 staff and meager budget.
 Under the Labor Code, workers have the right to refuse to work under unsafe con-
 ditions without penalty. Nevertheless, many workers fear retaliation should they
 refuse to work under unsafe conditions. Employees in high-risk professions, such as
 night guards, drivers, and police, have protested conditions.
