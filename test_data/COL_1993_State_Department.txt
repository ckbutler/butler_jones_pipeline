 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy long dominated by the Liberal
 and Conservative parties. The M-19 guerrilla movement, which became a legal po-
 litical party, Democratic Alliance M-19 (AD/M-19) in 1990, fielded a presidential
 candidate and several congressional candidates in 1993. A small Socialist party, Pa-
 triotic Union, also participates in national politics. The next national elections will
 be held in May 1994. Until August, the country was under a state of emergency de-
 clared by President Cesar Gaviria in late 1992. This allowed the President to issue
 decrees on public order matters normally requiring legislative action. During the fall
 session, Congress debated many of these decrees,with the participation of human
 rights groups, and incorporated some of their provisions into permanent legislation.
 Internal security is the primary responsibility of the Ministry of Defense, which
 in addition to the armed forces, includes the National Police (CNP). The Department
 of Administrative Security (DAS), which is responsible for national security intel-
 ligence, reports directly to the President. Elements of the police and the armed
 forces remained responsible for widespread human rights abuses.
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which the private sector has assumed an even
 more dominant role as a result of the economic liberalization program introduced
 by the Gaviria Government. Crude petroleum rivals coffee as the principal export.
 The privatization of selected public industries continued, with three banks and a
 number of smaller enterprises sold by the Government during the year. Narcotics
 traffickers continued to control extensive economic interests.

 Colombia's enrined democratic tradition has survived despite hig levels of in-
 ternal violence. For 8 months in 1993 and 35 of the past 42 years, the Government
 operated under states of emergency which gave the executive a wide range of pow-
 ers to issue decrees, some of which impinged on the basic rights of citizens, in order
 to deal with civil unrest associated with internal violence. Narcotics traffickers, left-
 ist guerrilla groups, and rightwing paramilitary groups-the last of which some-
 times act with the support or acquiescence of local or regional military or police
 units--committed the majority of human rights abuses. However, the army and po-
 lice appeared to be jointly responsible for almost as many violations as the combined
 nongovernmental groups.
 Narcotics traffickers frequently resorted to terror in attempts to intimidate the
 Government and the general population. They continued to disseminate false infor-
 mation about official human rights violations in an effort to undermine the Govern-
 ment's credibility. Narcotics traffickers and guerrillas cooperated extensively. The
 commander of the armed forces estimated that 60 percent of the revenue of the Rev-
 olutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in two provinces came from drug traf-
 ficking.
 Individual members and units of the police and army were responsible for exten-
 sive human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture
 and arbitrary detention. As acknowledged by the Attorney General and the National
 Human Rights Ombudsman, a major reason for the high level of abuse was the vir-
 tual impunity with which most took plae. Targets of abuse in rural and urban
 areas by the security forces included workers, politicians, labor organizers, human
 rights monitors, and most frequently, peasant farmers in guerrilla territory. Vio-
 lence and economic discrimination against women remained commonplace.
 The Government actively sought to improve its human rights record and effect re-
 form, passing a comprehensive police reform law establishing a civilian Police Com-
 missioner's Offie and a National Advisory Board. It remains to be seen whether
 these efforts will reduce police and military abuses. The Office of the Defender of
 the People remained underfunded, while the Procuraduria, an independent govern-
 ment watchdog agency, conducted some investigations and imposed sanctions on a
 few state agents implicated in human rights abuses. The armed forces initiated a
 human rights awareness campaign at the end of the year, creating a special office
 staffed by civilians to advise the joint chiefs of staff on human rights issues and
 to develop training materials and programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-The overall murder rate in Colombia
 increased for the second year in a row in 1993. Bogota's leading newspaper, El
 Tiempo, cited 15,000 murders attributed to all sources throughout the country in
 the first 6 months of 1993, as compared to 11,000 for the same period in 1992. Due
 to insufficient police and judicial resources to investigate and prosecute most
 killings and the frequently overlapping violent forces at work, it is often difficult to
 separate political from nonpolitical murders.
 The Center for Investigations and Popular Education (CINEP), Bogota's Jesuit-af-
 filiated human rights and social welfare research center, reported a total of 581 po-
 litically motivated murders for the period from January through September 1993,
 compared with 873 for all of 1992. Of these, 159 were attributed to members of the
 state security apparatus, 37 to paramilitary groups, 242 to the guerrillas, and 143
 to unknown perpetrators. According to the Andean Commission of Jurists (CAJSC),
 437 cases of politically motivated killings were reported between January and June
 1993, with another 755 killings presumed to have been politically motivated. CAJSC
 also stated that, during the full year, an average of 11 people per day were killed
 in politically motivated attacks, a figure almost identical to that of 1992. In Decem-
 ber a press report cited a figure of 649 political killings in Colombia for the year.
 The report also stated that the department of Antioquia had the highest incidence
 of this violence, with a total of 230 such killings.
 The armed forces continued to be responsible for extrajudicial killings, including
 one reported massacre. Lt. Colonel Luis Becerra was dismissed from the army and
 placed under investigation by the Attorney General for his alleged role in the Octo-
 ber 1 massacre of 13 unarmed peasants in Rio Frio by a paramilitary unit. Unit
 members also raped six women among the peasants before killing them, and there
 were signs of torture. An army unit under Becerra's command was reported to have
 placed weapons on the peasants and dressed them in guerrilla-style uniforms after
 the massacre. There were credible reports that Becerra was tied to the 1988 killings
 of 23 purported guerrillas who later turned out to be unarmed banana workers. The
 
 
 394
 Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights reported an increase in
 massacres over the past 12 years, citing 176 massacres with 857 victims in 1992.
 The report assigned responsibility for about 10 percent of the massacres during this
 12-year period to government forces.
 In April members of the 2nd Mobile Brigade allegedly tortured and executed high
 school teacher Parmencio Bonilla, cattleman Jairo Arguello, and laborer Roberto Al-
 varado in El Mordisco, Arauca department. According to witnesses, guerrillas am-
 bushed a military patrol shortly before these three were captured; area residents
 reported that none of the three had ties to the insurgents. There were credible re-
 r orts that the army executed two gu !rrillas who represented the Socialist Renewal
 urrent faction in negotiations with the Government and that the local authorities
 attempted to cover up this extrajudicial killing.
 The Procuraduria reported that five investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions committed by the military were completed between January and August, re-
 sulting in administrative sanctions against 14 service members. Charges against
 nine servicemen were dropped.
 Members of the CNP also committed extrajudicial killings. CINEP linked CNP
 agents to a total of 21 of these killings through September, noting that this number
 had dropped from 40 the previous year. In September the Procuraduria charged a
 police captain and five agents of the Criminal Investigative Unit (SIJIN) in Narino
 department for their participation in the summary execution of five people in
 Catatumbo in March 1992. The five, suspected of having attacked buses along the
 Pan American highway, were detained but never brought into custody or charged.
 The bodies of the victims showed signs of torture, and there was no indication that
 they were armed at the time of their detention. In March a 9-year-old girl was found
 strangled in a Bogota police station after having been sexually assaulted. In the
 wake of the crime, CNP Inspector General Humberto Maldonado and Operations Di-
 rector Nassim Diaz were dismissed, along with several other high-ranking officers.
 This incident was also cause for a rapid acceleration in drafting the police reform
 bill that was signed into law in August and galvanized public opinion as to the dire
 need for institutional reform of the CNP. The murdered child's father, himself a po-
 lice agent, was initially detained as a suspect but was later released. A continuing
 investigation had not produced any new developments by year's end.
 CINEP reported 118 incidents of "social cleansing" between January and Septem-
 ber throughout most major cities, which represented a slight decline from the pre-
 vious year. This activity involves attacks and killings, often by off-duty police, di-
 rected against groups deemed socially undesirable, i.e., prostitutes, homosexuals, in-
 digent street people and street children (see Section 5), drug addicts, and pan-
 handlers. Many of these victims were rural peasants forced to flee military and
 guerrilla violence in their native regions who migrated to the cities in search of im-
 proved economic opportunities. Merchant or vigilante citizens' groups ar alleged to
 sponsor the attacks; off-duty police agents or contract killers are the most frequently
 accused perpetrators of these murders. The October beating death of an indigent
 street poet in Bogota at the hands of police catalyzed public outcry, and a crowd
 of 3,000 turned his funeral into a peace march. Two policemen were in custody and
 under investigation for this killing.
 The Procuraduria reported that the Special Investigative Unit formed by the Pros-
 ecutor General's Office (Fiscalia) in 1992 to investigate these occurrences found one
 police officer and two agents linked to incidents but did not find sufficient evidence
 to suggest that there was official police complicity in organized attacks against a
 specific class of citizens. It determined that the three members of theCNP acted
 for personal motives; their cases were referred to the Attorney General's Office for
 Police Affairs, where they remained under investigation at year's end.
 The Bogota Human Rights Ombudsman associated with the National Office of the
 Defender of the People issued a report in September decrying the increased inci-
 dence of "social cleansing." The report very clearly accused elements of the police
 of tacit complicity in these cases and cited 12 murders as well as hundreds of lesser
 abuses, such as physical aggression and harassment by police or police-sponsored
 groups.
 The inquiry into the 1991 death of journalist Henry Rojas continued. A former
 Arauca mayor and an army colonel who had been exonerated in May were
 rearrested in September. The Procuraduria investigation was still pending at year's
 end.
 The Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board stepped up attacks against the
 military in the early fall during its "black September" campaign. In separate attacks
 against police and military convoys in Usme and Antioquia, FARC guerrillas killed
 13 policemen and 13 soldiers, respectively. Survivors of the two attacks reported
 that the guerrilla attackers first dynamited the convoys and then bayoneted or shot
 
 
 395
 the wounded at close range. Press and human rights sources reported that 264
 members of the police and armed forces died while on active duty during the year.
 Guerrillas were also responsible for many extrajudicial killings. Members of a dis-
 sident faction of the Army of Popular Liberation (EPL) assassinated a well-known,
 outspoken peace activist, Father Javier Cirujano, in May in San Jacinto, Bolivar.
 His accused killer, Ariel Contreras, was arrested by DAS agents in September.
 Other, less notable victims included those who refused to submit to extortion, those
 suspected of collaborating with the Government or military, and, in particular, those
 former guerrillas who deserted the subversive movements to reintegrate themselves
 with the noncombatant population under the Government's "reinsertion" plan. In
 September FARC members killed the parents of a soldier when they became lost
 on their way to visit him and stumbled into rebel territory.
 Nationwide, policemen continued to be murdered by drug traffickers, terrorists,
 guerrillas, and common criminals, although the number dropped significantly from
 the previous year. According to official police statistics, 177 police officials were
 killed from January through September, compared to 620 in 1992. Of these 177
 deaths, 36 were attributed to narcotics traffickers. In November National Liberation
 Army (ELN) guerrillas assassinated Colombian Senate Vice President Dario
 Londono in Medellin. He was chairing congressional debate on public order legisla-
 tion at the time. Following his murder, the ELN published several open letters that
 stated that other congressmen who supported the legislation would be targeted as
 well. Also in November, the body of Italian Honorary Consul Guisseppe Suarigia
 was discovered several months after he had been kidnaped by the FARC in
 Bucamaranga.
 In November alone, press reports estimated that upwards of 70 banana workers
 were killed in Uraba. Accounts indicate that the killings were most likely per-
 petrated by EPL guerrillas against "reinserted" former subversives. Two weeks later
 the FARO openly assassinated another 20 or so reinserted workers, arriving at the
 plantations in force with death lists in hand and executing the laborers in front of
 their fellow workers.
 Narcotics-related terrorism remained at a high level during the first several
 months of 1993 but tapered off during the second half of the year. Before govern-
 ment forces tracked him down and killed him on December 2, fugitive drug kingpin
 Pablo Escobar conducted a random bombing campaign in Medellin and Bogota, in-
 tended to force the Government to grant him favorable terms of surrender. The at-
 tacks culminated in April with the explosion of a powerful bomb in a fashionable
 Bogota neighborhood that left 11 dead and over 200 wounded. Escobar was also be-
 lieved to be responsible for ordering the deaths of over 140 policemen since his es-
 cape in July 1992. In October an EN bomb attack in central Bogota against a po-
 lice bus claimed the lives of 2 policemen and wounded 17 other police and civilian
 bystanders.
 A shadowy paramilitary group dedicated to the elimination of Pablo Escobar and
 his Medellin-based trafficking organization conducted a series of terrorist attacks,
 mostly aimed at Escobar's family and associates. The group, known as the "Pepes"
 and led by the well-known paramilitary chief Fidel Castano, conducted spectacular
 attacks on Escobar's properties and assets. Despite the group's public announcement
 in April that it would disband due to government opposition to its activities, killings
 of Escobar defense attorneys and associates continued. Two days before Escobar's
 death, the group announced it would resume its activities. It claimed responsibility
 for the killing of an Escobar relative on the same day that the drug kingpin was
 killed by the military.
 In general, paramilitary activity declined during the first part of the year but, ac-
 cording to press reports, began to resurface in the latter half of 1993. The national
 weekly, Cambio 16, reported the return of irregular armed militias sponsored by
 ranchers and often tacitly supported by regional armed forces in the conflict-ridden
 region of Uraba. Paramilitary groups, including associates of deceased paramilitary
 leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, were responsible for a series of killings, incidents
 of torture, and disappearances among rural peasants in the Yacopi area.
 b. Disappearance.-Security forces continued to be responsible for disappearances.
 The Procuraduria received 47 reports of disappearance alleged to have been per-
 petrated by the police or military between January and August that included 62
 total victims. Forty-two of these cases are still in the preliminary investigative
 stage,and three were dismissed. There were no sanctions administered during this
 period. One case under investigation was the April 19 disappearance of human
 rights activist Delio Vargas, last seen being forced into a vehicle driven by an army
 intelligence operative.
 Given the complexity of Colombia's internal order situation and the variety of
 agents, both state-sponsored and criminal, involved in this struggle, the line be-
 
 
 396
 tween political disappearance and kidnaping for profit is often unclear. Combining
 all sources, however, Colombia suffers from one of the world's highest rates of forced
 abductions. Disappearances attributed to the police and military came under in-
 creasing government scrutiny, and a bill was submitted to the Congress that would
 clearly define and codify forced disappearance as a crime distinct from kidnaping.
 The chairman of the congressional committee studying the bill indicated that there
 were 266 allegations of disappearances pending before the Organization of American
 States in 1993. According to CAJSC, of 98 reported disappearances in the first half
 of 1993, 34 percent were attributed to state security agents, 14 percent were associ-
 ated with paramilitary groups and 52 percent were perpetrated by unknown au-
 thors. CAJSC noted a drop in the figure for military participation from the previous
 year but a corresponding rise in the rate of paramilitary involvement with dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture is prohibited by law, incidents of police and military beatings and
 torture of detainees continued, especiallyin the period immediately following deten-
 tion and prior to long-term incarceration. CINEP recorded 13 cases of torture al-
 leged to have been perpetrated by security forces, down from 31 the previous year.
 The Procuraduria reported that a total of 42 cases of torture alleged to have been
 committed by members of the police and military were investigated between Janu-
 ary and August. Administrative sanctions were imposed on 7 police and 10 members
 of the armed services for incidents involving torture during that time. In August
 Gilberto Jurado, the Secretary of Public Works in Fortul, Arauca and a member of
 the Patriotic Union Party, was detained and beaten by memberso? the army's Reveiz
 Pizarro Battalion. His torturers denied him medicine he requires daily and submit-
 ted him to a mock execution. Jurado was saved by the intervention of the
 regionalhuman rights ombudsman who was able to secure his release and have him
 brought to a hospital. The specific motive for the attack is unclear; it is not known
 if any investigation is being conducted against the military perpetrators.
 The paramilitary groups that operate in the countryside routinely torture victims
 before killing them. i'orture is also a common guerrilla and narcotics terrorist prac-
 tice. Unresolved cases were reported throughout many departments in which decapi-
 tated bodies were found with the hands and feet severed to prevent identification
 of the victim.
 Overcrowding in Colombia's prisons is a serious problem that caused poor sani-
 tary and health conditions in many institutions and drew harsh criticism in Septem-
 ber from Prosecutor Attorney General Gustavo de Greiff. The prison system, de-
 signed to house some 27,000 people, stood at 110 percent of occupancy in 1993, with
 roughly 30,000 inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution includes several mecha-
 nisms designed to prevent illegal detentions. A detainee must be brought before a
 judge within 36 hours and has the right to seek, before any judge, a petition of ha-
 beas corpus that must be acted upon within 36 hours. Despite these legal protec-
 tions, instances of arbitrary detention occurred, although according to CINEP, there
 were far fewer cases reported in 1993 than the previous year. The Procuraduria in-
 vestigated cases involving alleged victims of arbitrary arrest or detention and levied
 administrative sanctions against members of the police and servicemen. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that it had made a significant
 advance in gaining access not only to prisons but to certain military and police pro-
 visional detention centers.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to due process is specifically provided
 for in the Constitution. The accused have the right to representation by counsel, but
 historically representation for indigents has been woefully inadequate. To address
 this situation, the Government's Office of the Defender of the People began a drive
 to establish an expanded public defender program. Due to a reluctance to grant bail,
 many detainees never come to trial; they simply remain in pretrial detention until
 they have been incarcerated for the time stipulated for the rmnimum sentence appli-
 cabile to the crimes they are alleged to have committed.
 The judiciary remained overburdened and stroggled to delineate its functions in
 the wake of the 1991 onstitutional changes. It is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches in theory and largely in practice. The judiciary has long been
 subject to intimidation when dealing with narcotics traffickingand paramilitar
 cases. Magistrates, judges, attorneys, and prosecutors were suborned, threatened,
 assassinated, or had family members killed in connection with certain cases. In an
 attempt to provide increased judicial protection and specialization in these cases, in
 1991 the Government established a special jurisdiction for narcotics, terrorism, and
 public corruption cases. There are five such "regional jurisdictions" in which anony-
 
 
 mous judges and prosecutors handle all major trials of narcotics terrorists. Law en-
 forcement agencies' investigative powers were strengthened under this system, and
 conviction rates rose dramatically. According to public opinion polls, Chief Prosecu-
 tor Gustavo de Greiff became the most respected public officialin the Government
 during this time.
 The regional jurisdiction system nonetheless gave rise to a series of due process
 concerns. The regional prosecutors were overwhelmed by staggering caseloads,
 which in turn led to long delays in issuing indictments. In August the Constitu-
 tional Court struck down a provision of the law by which the regional jurisdiction
 courts were able to suspend detainees' rights to provisional release and bail. Some
 5,000 drug and terrorist suspects stood to be released under provisions of the Crimi-
 nal Procedures Code. President Gaviria issued a last-minute state of emergency de-
 c ree which temporarily prevented the release. Acording to the Director or Prisons,
 some 10,000 detainees linked to special jurisdiction cases remained in prison with-
 out being indicted in 1993.
 fendants in the regional jurisdiction system lack important procedural rights
 contained in the Constitution. For instance, it is extremely difficult for a defense
 attorney openly to impeach an anonymous witness. Due to the anonymity of the
 judge and prosecutor, it is also qui  icult for a defense attorney to bring charges
 of malfeasance or corruption against either state official. The anonymit of the
 judges, prosecutors, an  key witnesses led many defense attorneys andhuman
 rights groups to accuse the courts of railroading suspects. A revision of the Criminal
 Procedures Code removed the restriction on defense teams copying documents used
 as evidence by the prosecution.
 Critics also charged that the special jurisdiction courts were used to try persons
 involved in nonterrorist activities but who commit a violent act that technically
 brings them within the scope of these courts. In one case, 13 telephone workers
 were detained for investigation by special jurisdiction courts on sabotage charges re-
 lated to an April 1992 national strike. After criticism by labor and human rights
 groups, the Fiscalia later decided to try them in ordinary criminal courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A judi-
 cial order is generally required for authorities to enter a private home, except in
 cases of hot pursuit. There were widespread violations of legal norms regarding
 searches in remote regions, but in urban areas the sanctity of the home was gen-
 erally respected. The Procuraduria did not receive any reports of illegal searches by
 state officials between January and September 1993. This might be explained par-
 tially by the fact that the Fiscalia was vigilant in requiring police to obtain search
 warrants, especially in high visibility cases such as the extensive manhunt for Pablo
 Escobar in Medellin.
 Telephone wiretaps and the interception of mail must be authorized by a judge.
 This protection extends to prisoners incarcerated in the penal system.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were no reports in 1993 that military aircraft targeted civilians in
 antiguerrilla operations. Human rights groups, nonetheless, continued to insist that
 civilian populations in known guerrilla territory were purposely targeted during
 military operations. The military denied this accusation and maintained that its op-
 erations did not deliberately target noncombatants, although they recognize that in-
 juries among the civilian population occurred.
 Mines laid by both the military and guerrilla forces in areas of conflict were re-
 spansible for maiming and killing hundreds of civilian noncombatants. The guerril-
 las continued their attacks on oil pipelines and power stations. CAJSC published
 two detailed reports on human rights abuses in Putumayo and the Magdaleno
 Medio region in which they reported that it is common practice for the army's mo-
 bile brigades to force civilians to wear camouflage uniforms and precede patrols in
 dangerous or mined areas.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These constitutionally protected rights are re-
 spected.
 The press regularly criticized the Government without recrimination. The pri-
 vately owned print media published a wide spectrum of political views, many of
 which take harsh antigovernment positions. Television frequencies and facilities are
 owned by the State which leases air time to private production companies. The Gov-
 ernment imposes some restrictions on the television coverage of terrorist activity,
 and reserves the rights to prohibit broadcast media from covering certain news
 events during states of emergency. Human rights groups charged that these restric-
 tions were unnecessary and restricted the exercise of free speech through the 8
 months of the year during which the state of emergency was in effect. Tutela,"
 
 
 398
 which is a judicial injunction or motion that can be brought before any judge seek-
 ing immediate redress for violations of basic constitutional rights, theoretically pro-
 vides all Colombians with a constitutional means to denounce perceived injustices
 freely. In a few instances, tutela has been employed against the press by persons
 who felt that they had been slandered. In general, however, the justice system and
 the administration have been attentive not to curtail free speech by means of un-
 justified recourse to tutela.
 During 1993 violence directed against journalists appeared to decline somewhat
 but did not disappear completely. In February the editor of a Cucuta newspaper,
 Eustorgio Colmenares, was murdered, allegedly by members of the ELN.
 Academic freedom in Colombia is generally accepted by the Government, and
 there exists a wide spectrum of political activity throughout the country's univer-
 sities. Teachers at the elementary and secondary levels in guerrilla-controlled terri-
 tory are often subject to threats and intimidation from local subversive operatives
 and are unable to resist guerrilla ropaganda campaigns.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoctation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 rights in practice. Public meetings and demonstrations are normally held without
 interference. Permission is required for demonstrations and is usually granted ex-
 cept when the Government concludes that there is imminent danger to public order.
 Any organization is free to associate with international groups in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete religious freedom
 and there is little religious discrimination in practice. In March the Constitutional
 Court declared unconstitutional portions of the 1973 Concordat with the Vatican,
 which requires Catholic religious training in public schools, and abolished this pro-
 vision. Mainline and evangelical Protestants constitute between 3 and 6 percent of
 the population. The Government permits proselytizing among the indigenous popu-
 lation, provided the Indians welcome it and are not induced to adopt changes that
 endanger their survival on traditional lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are constitutionally assured the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. In areas where military operations against guerrillas are under way,
 civilians were required to obtain safe-conduct passes from the military; guerrillas
 reportedly used similar means to restrict travel in areas under their control .
 Peasants were often forced to leave their farms due to military counterinsurgency
 operations, guerrilla and paramilitary conscriptions, and narcotics trafficking vio-
 lence. The nongovernmental U.S. Committee for Refugees reported that an esti-
 mated 300,000 Colombians could be considered internally displaced.
 Emigration is unrestricted, and expatriates may, by law, repatriate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right in regular elections that have historically been consid-
 ered fair and open.
 Presidential elections are held every 4 years. The Liberal and Conservative par-
 ties are the most competitive, with one or the other customarily winning the presi-
 dency. The President may serve only one term and may not be reelected. All citizens
 are enfranchised at age 18. Public employees are not permitted to participate in po-
 litical campaigns but, with the exception of the military, may vote. All parties oper-
 ate freely without government interfeence.
 There are no legal restrictions, and few de facto ones, on the participation of
 women or minorities in politics. There are 7 female senators and 13 female rep-
 resentatives serving in Congress and several top government officials, including the
 Foreign Minister and the Minister of Education, are women. Women also hold key
 positions in the judicial branch and the prosecutor general's office. Two seats in the
 102-seat Congress are reserved for representatives of the indigenous population, and
 a third indigenous citizen holds an at-large seat. There is growing self-awareness
 and political activism among the indigenous peoples of Colombia.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Center for Investigations and Popular Research (CINEP), the Andean Com-
 mission of Jurists, the Regional Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 (CREDHOS) the Intercongregational Commission for Justice and Peace, and the
 Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights are among the prominent
 human rights groups active in Colombia. These organizations maintain data banks
 on human rights and produce regular reports and publications showing the results
 of their investigations into human rights abuses. Often these reports are highly crit-
 
 
 399
 ical of the Government and denounce its lack of zeal in conducting official investiga-
 tions and disciplining implicated state agents.
 These and similar groups functioned unimpeded by official government inter-
 ference but were at times the victims of threats and intimidation by paramilitary
 Rups or individual members of the police or military. Some of the members of
 CREDHOS, for example, were forced to leave the country in 1992 following the mur-
 der of two of their associates; they returned to Colombia in 1993 but work under
 different names in a different city due to security considerfitions.
 The Procuraduria is charged with protecting citizens from abuses of human rights
 and investigating allegations of state complicity in cases of abuse or violation. The
 Defender of the eople has the constitutionally assigned duty to ensure the pro-
 motion and exercise of human rights, but this office is severely underfunded and not
 effective. The President has a Special Advisor for human rights issues who inves-
 tigates allegations of abuse and engages in the dissemination of human rights edu-
 cation and information.
 All three of these offices collaborate extensively with local and international
 human rights organizations. Government and nongovernmental organization (NGO)
 seminars and programs study the causes of violence and human rights violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution declares that "men and women have equal rights and
 opportunities. Women may not be subjected to any form of discrimination.' It also
 specifically requires authorities to "guarantee adequate and effective participation
 by women at the decisionmaking levels of public administration." Long before imple-
 mentation of the new Constitution, moreover, Colombian legislation had guaranteed
 women extensive rights.
 Despite these constitutional guarantees, discrimination against women still exists,
 especially in the rural sectors of the country. While legally entitled to remuneration
 equal to that of men, in practice women earn 30 to 40 percent less than their male
 counterparts. Women comprise 41 percent of the country's active economic popu-
 lation, but men dominate the top positions in government and private industry. As
 in past years, however, women continued to constitute a growing percentage of the
 university population, now almost equal to men, and increased their participation
 in a wide variety of traditionally male-dominated professions.
 According to Pro Mujer, a Bogota-based women s organization that assists victims
 of violence directed against women, statistics on sexual assault are incomplete and
 unreliable. Only a small percentage of rape cases are ever reported, and even fewer
 are brought to trial. The Government, through the Colombian Institute of Family
 Welfare and the Office of the Presidential Advisor on Women's, Family and Chil-
 dren's Issues, provides training and education programs in parenting skills, repro-
 ductive rights, and birth control, as well as vocational training for lower income
 mothers. Ntonetheless, penalties for abuse directed against women are often not
 commensurate with the gravity of the assault, and in the poorer urban and rural
 areas, both physical and economic discrimination against women is commonplace.
 Children.-Colombia has significant constitutional and legislative commitments to
 the protection of the rights ofchildren, but they are flawed in practice. A Children's
 Code sets forth principles for the protection of minors and establishes services to
 enforce those protections. The Constitution provides for the fundamental rights of
 children and states that the family, society, and the State are obligated to assist
 and protect children, to foster their development, and to assure the full exercise of
 their rights.
 The reality of children's rights is much bleaker. In September the Procuraduria
 issued a report showing that the incidence of violent physical abuse directed against
 children had risen dramatically within the past year. An average of four minors per
 day were killed by adults in Bogota alone. According to the Foundation for Andean
 Children, a Bogota-based group that caters to the needs of street children, a core
 group of approximately 200 children dwell in Bogota's sewer systems. Thousands of
 others live on the streets and resort to petty thievery to support themselves. Most
 of these children, known as the "disposable ones, are addicted to intoxicating
 inhalants. The Foundation reported, however, that the situation improved over the
 past 2 years due to international pressure, primarily from the European Parliament.
 There were no roundup killings of street children in 1993, although in August post-
 ers sponsored by illegal merchant groups appeared in downtown sections of Bogota
 threatening such children with their own funerals.
 Indigenous People.-There are approximately 80 distinct ethnic groups among the
 roughly 800,000 indigenous inhabitants of Colombia, who constitute 1.5 percent of
 the population. The Constitution gives special recognition to the fundamental rights
 
 
 400
 
 of indigenous people. Under its provisions, two senatorial seats are reserved exclu-
 sively for indigenous representation and a special criminal and civil jurisdiction,
 based upon traditional community laws, functions within Indian territories. The
 Ministry of the Interior through the Office of Indigenous Affairs, is responsible for
 protecting the territorial, cultural and self-determination rights of Indians. Ministry
 representatives are located in all regions and departments of Colombia and work
 with other governmental human and civil rights organizations to promote Indian in-
 terests and investigate violations of indigenous sovereignty.
 A Presidential decree issued in June regulated the creation of traditional Indian
 Authority Boards. These boards are entitled to handle national or local funds and
 are subject to fiscal control of the Comptroller General. The decree also gives these
 boards the right to administer their respective territories as municipal entities. In-
 digenous communities are free to educate their children in the traditional dialects
 and in the observance of cultural and religious customs. There is a small but grow-
 ing number of indigenous university students.
 Despite protective efforts by the Government, Indians often suffer at the hands
 of narcotics traffickers and guerrillas in their homelands. The Office of the Presi-
 dential Advisor for Human Rights, which has a special section dedicated to the pro-
 tection of indigenous rights, reported that attacks by the FARC on the Coyaima
 tribe in Tolima department were especially brutal, and included the burning of en-
 tire villages and the assassinations of Indian leaders. Press reports in November
 chronicled persistent attacks by the FARC on members of the former indigenous
 guerrilla group Quintin Lame that signed a reinsertion accord with the Government
 in 1991. in one such incident in November, FARC operatives executed Jorge Issac
 Vargas, a tribal leader of the Paletara Municipality in Cauca department, before a
 local crowd during an indigenous festival.
 National/Racil/Ethnic Minorities.-About 2 million blacks, primaly residing in
 the Choco department, form a racial minority in Colombia, andrepresent 4 percent
 of the general population. They are entitled to all constitutional rights and protec-
 tions but have traditionally suffered from unofficial economic discrimination. In an
 attempt to rectify the situation, the Government passed an Afro-Colombian Law
 which calls for increased government and private investment in Choco. The law also
 provides for greater self-determination at the local and regional levels among the
 black population. The police and military also took steps to increase recruitment of
 black officers from Choco, creating special training programs and academy scholar-
 ships for black applicants to the servces.
 People with Dsabiities.-The Constitution protects the fundamental social, eco-
 nomic, and cultural rights of the physically disabled. In 1988 Colombia became a
 party to the 159th Agreement on Professional Rehabilitation and the Employment
 of the Disabled, as adopted by the 1983 General Conference of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO). There is no legslation specifically mandating prvision
 of access for people with disabilities.
 In 1993 three separate bills were intrduced in Congress to further expand protec-
 tion for the physically and mentally disabled. The bills prposed hirin a greater
 percentage o emloyees among the ranks of the disabled; a 5-percent alation of
 the governmenta Institute of Family Welfare budget to proam  for disabled mi-
 nors; and a stipend equal to one-half the minimum wage to those handicapped indi-
 viduals who are unable to support themselves. The bills were still under discussion
 at year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to organize unions and strike
 is recognizedby law. The Labor Code provides for automatic legal reco   vitionof
 unions which have obtained 25 signatures from a workplace and penalties or inter-
 fering with workers' freedom of association. It also stipulates the iependence of
 labor organizations to determine internal rules, elect bfficials, and administer activi-
 ties, and forbids the dissolution of trade unions by administrative fiat. According to
 the latest data available (1992), 886,446 organized workers are members of 2,435
 different unions. These groups are free to establish international affiliations without
 government restrictions.
 The Constitution extends the right to strike to nonessential public employees and
 authorizes the Congress to enact implementing legislation. Before carrying out a
 legal strike, unions must negotiate directly with management and engage in concil-
 iation prcedures if no agreement results. By law, public employees must go to bind-
 ing arbitration if conciliation talks fail; in practice, public service unions decide by
 membership vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 Two I supervisory bodies criticized 10 prvisions of Colombian law in 1993, in-
 cluding: the supervision of the internal management and meetings of unions by gov-
 
 
 401
 ernment officials; the presence of officials at assemblies convened to vote on a strike
 call; the suspension of union officers who dissolve their unions; the requirement that
 contenders for trade union office must belong to the occupation in question; the pro-
 hibition of strikes in a very wide range of public services which are not necessarily
 essential; various restrictions on the right to strike and the power of the Minister
 of Labor and the President to intervene in disputes through compulsory arbitration;
 and the power to dismiss trade union officers involved in an unlawful strike.
 Throughout the year, there were various protests in major cities against an-
 nounced layoffs of government workers, the privatization of several government en-
 tities, and the government-backed social security reform bill. Two ILO technical ex-
 perts invited by the Government to provide advice on the social security bill, were
 withdrawn for security reasons in April. Workers' fear of violence from guerrillas
 and narcotics traffickers has reduced the number of participants in labor demonstra-
 tions. In September, after reports that guerrillas intended to use a nationwide strike
 to foment violence, trade unionists called off the strike and announced a march for
 peace instead.
 Organized labor suffers from a disproportionately high rate of violence from a va-
 riety of sources including the army and police, illegal paramilitary groups, guerril-
 las, and common criminals, and also as a result of internal union struggles. There
 have been some complaints of violence by authorities against trade unionists. These
 cases are currently under investigation by the Prosecutor General's office.
 Workers at the state-owned oil company went on strike in early 1993. During the
 negotiations, guerrillas killed an oil company executive and stepped up sabotage of
 oil pipelines. In retaliation for the arrest of a union leader charged with terrorism,
 guerrillas kidnaped two company employees who were later released unharmed.
 uring the year an unknown number of trade unionists were killed, particularly in
 the banana-rich region of Uraba. According to press reports, 70 banana workers
 were killed in November and December during an upsurge in violence that led the
 Government to station a military brigade permanently in the area. Jesus Guevara,
 vice president of the embattled Banana Workers Union, was killed on January 29
 by EPL dissident guerrillas who opposed his conciliatory stance with farm owners
 and his moderate political views. The Secretary General of the same union, Jose
 Oliverio Molina, was murdered in February by unknown assailants. In March ba-
 nana workers went on strike to protest the violence. The Government attempted to
 remedy the situation by providing increased financial aid and more security for that
 region. In April unknown gunmen killed another important labor leader, Jose
 Ignacio Vargas, president of a textile union in Medellin.
 Rural peasants have suffered from a rise in drug trafficker and guerrilla acquisi-
 tion of prime land in some sectors of the country, now totaling one-third of the best
 cattle land, according to a study by the Agrarian Reform Institute. Peasants living
 in these areas were victims of violence from the new landowners and guerrillas, who
 also forcibly recruit peasant youths. These same peasants were also subjected to
 human rig        aions by the military which perceives them as guerrilla sym-
 pathizers,.Many peasants were victims of open crossfire between guerrillas and the
 armed forces. An unknown number of peasant labor organizers were killed in 1993.
 The International Confederation of Fr  Trade Unions alleged numerous acts of
 intimidation, abduction, arbitrary arrest, summary justice, torture, and murder by
 the security services or paramilitary forces during 1992-93. These included the as-
 sassination of 45 trade unionists in Barrancabermeja; the murder of a gold miner
 from Segovia who had protested the detention of a union leader by the mlitary; the
 torture and hanging of the national leader of the agculral workers' union,
 FENSUAGRO, and the execution of another FENSUAGRO leader in Magangue by
 armed men believed to be security forces; the torture and hanging of two rural
 workers from Ovejas at Fusiliers Battalion headquarters; the murder of a rural
 trade unionist b the army's Nueva Granada Battalion; the death of a SINTRENAL
 union member from La Dorada, Caldas, following his arrest; and the abduction and
 torture of a labor leader from Valle del Cauca, reportedly by an army intelligence
 unit. It was not possible to confirm, either with the Ministry of Labor or NGO's,
 the complicity of state agents in these cases. It is also not clear that all of the vic-
 tims were trade unionists.
 The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association examined seven complaints con-
 taining allegations of threats against the life and security of trade unionists and the
 right to collective bargaining. Its Committee of Experts expressed concern about the
 serious climate of violence which made the exercise of freedom of association dif-
 ficult. The workers' bench of the ILO conference in June alleged that 94 percent of
 the 618 persons detained under the antiterrorist decree in 1992 belonged to trade
 unions, that more trade unionists were killed in Colombia in 1992 than in any other
 country, and that 800 had been killed since 1987. The workers also protested the
 
 
 arrest and conviction of trade union leaders for "obstruction of work* under section
 290 of the Penal Code.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and engage in collective bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. Unions
 were successful in organizing larger frms and public services, which include less
 than 8 percent of Colombians economically active population. High unemployment
 and weak union organization have limited workers' bargaining power in the private
 sector. Antiunion discrimination or the obstruction of union association is illegal;
 this prohibition is enforced by administrative labor inspections. It is unclear if these
 inspections are effective. A few companies have been fined, and some workers have
 used the courts to seek redress. The new Labor Code increased the fines for restrict-
 ing freedom of association. The use of strikebreakers is prohibited by law. However,
 the Single Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CUT) alleges that Act No. 50 of
 1990 undermines the right to organize by permitting the practice of short-term labor
 contracts and has cited several companies in which workers were dismissed because
 of trade union activity, which continue under examination by the ILO's Committee
 on Freedom of Association.
 The revised Labor Code eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes, and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 in an effort to resolve conflicts. Confederations and federations are empowered to
 assist their affiliates in collective bargaining.
 Colombian labor law also applies to the country's seven free trade zones (FI'Z's).
 There is no restriction against union organization in the FTZ's. Several public em-
 ployee unions have collective bargaining agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla,
 Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa Marta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is le-
 gally prohibited, and this prohibition is respected in practice. The Constitution spe-
 cifically forbids slavery or any treatment of human beings resembling servitude.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits the em-
 ployment of children in most jobs before the age of 14, and the Labor Code prohibits
 youths under the age of 18 from requesting employment permits. This provision is
 respected in larger enterprises and major cities. However, the extensive informal
 economy is effectively outside government control. A recent Ministry of Labor study
 reported that about 800,000 children between ages 12 and 17 work. There are also
 many younger children who work in the informal sector as street vendors, as well
 as children who work in substandard conditions in some small coal mines.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government annually sets a national min-
 imum wage which serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. The cur-
 rent level was set by the Government after the national labor council, a tripartite
 advisory board, failed to reach an agreement among government, labor, and private
 sector representatives in December 1992. It is consistent with the Government's
 anti-inflation policies but falls short of providing an adequate standard of living for
 a worker and family. Over one-quarter of the population earns less than the mini-
 mum wage, which is about $125 (98,700 pesos) per month.
 The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour workweek. The
 ILO reiterated its previous requests that the Government amend the Labor Code
 to conform with the Convention on the issue of weekly rest. Lax enforcement of
 labor laws is partly due to the small number of Labor Ministry inspectors and to
 fear on the part of unorganized workers that they will lose their jobs.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively regulated, but many such
 regulations are difficult to enforce for workers in the informal sector who are not
 covered by social insurance systems. The ILO recommended that the Labor Code be
 amended to ensure that all agricultural workers benefit from compensation for in-
 dustrial accidents. Employees have the right to ask for Ministry of Labor inspections
 in cases of suspected occupational hazards. According to the Ministry of Labor,
 workers have the right to withdraw from a hazardous situation without jeopardy to
 continued employment. However, Colombian workers suffered many industrial acci-
 dents during the year, many of them incapacitating, owing to a combination of low
 levels of public safety awareness, scant involvement by organized labor, and lax en-
 forcement by the Labor Ministry. Charges about improper working conditions in the
 cut flower export industry resurfaced during the year. Minister of Labor officials ad-
 mitted misuse of chemicals by the flower industry in the more remote areas of the
 country but claimed that the industry as whole followed proper procedures in the
 use of chemicals.
