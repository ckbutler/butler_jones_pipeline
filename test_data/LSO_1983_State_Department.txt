 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is nominally a constitutional monarchy but, in fact,
 almost all political power is held by Prime Minister Leabua
 Jonathan and his ruling Basotho National Party. Jonathan
 suspended the 1967 Constitution which provided for parliamen-
 tary democracy in 1970, when he declared the results of that
 year's elections null and void. Seats in the present National
 Assembly are all appointed, with a heavy majority going to
 members of Jonathan's Basotho National Party. Cabinet port-
 folios are generally reserved for members of the ruling party,
 although minor posts have been awarded to members of two opposi-
 tion parties. The Government asserts that traditional democra-
 tic practices are preserved through the holding of mass public
 meetings known as "Pitsos,* but dissent is rarely aired at
 these Government-orchestrated gatherings, The Government also
 emphasizes respect for the chieftancy system, hierarchically
 extending from village chiefs to district chiefs to the King,
 although this system plays a marginal role in the national
 decisionmaking process. The main function of the "Pitsos* and
 the chieftancy system is to elicit public support for decisions
 already made by Jonathan's Government.
 A sporadic armed insurgency waged against the Government by
 supporters of Basutoland Congress Party leader, Ntsu Mokhehle
 continued during 1983. The insurgents, known as the Lesotho
 Liberation Army, have mounted attacks on public buildings,
 military targets, Cabinet ministers, and other individuals
 associated with the Government and the ruling party. A car
 bomb which exploded in Maseru in August was alleged to have
 been an assassination attempt against Prime Minister Jonathan,
 although no one was hurt. Lesotho Liberation Army violence
 has been the Government's justification for keeping laws in
 force which give the Government wide latitude to deal with
 subversion or sabotage.
 The Government of Lesotho alleges that South Africa provides
 training, refuge, and support to the insurgents. South Africa
 claims, in reply, that Lesotho harbors members of the African
 National Congress, which conducts a sabotage campaign against
 targets in South Africa. A December 9, 1982, attack by the
 South African Defense Force against alleged African National
 Congress "safe houses" in Maseru resulted in the deaths of
 30 South African refugees and 12 Lesotho citizens. Relations
 between Lesotho and South Africa deteriorated in 1983, with
 South Africa restricting movement of some Lesotho citizens and
 refusing transit of arms shipments destined for landlocked
 Lesotho. A number of South African refugees have departed
 Lesotho for other African countries in response to South African
 pressure. A series of high-level meetings between the two sides
 held in 1983 seems to have resulted in some easing of tensions,
 but problems remain.
 Lesotho is a developing country which has an open, free market
 economy based primarily on subsistence agriculture. The economy
 is highly dependent on remittances by Lesotho citizens engaged
 in migrant labor in South Africa, amounting to 40 percent of
 Lesotho's gross national product. The Government is likewise
 dependent on revenue generated by the South African Customs
 Union, which accounts for 70 percent of government revenues.
 The United States and other Western donors continue to provide
 substantial aid in the form of agricultural commodities and
 training, road construction, rural health projects, and manpower
 
 
 190
 and personnel training and advisers. The economic situation
 worsened in 1983 primarily due to a major drought which plagued
 most of southern Africa.
 Although individual rights in Lesotho are circumscribed to a
 certain extent, the rights to life and liberty are not systema-
 tically violated and are protected by a strong, independent
 judiciary. Undisciplined and poorly trained police and military
 forces are probably the greatest threat to the integrity of the
 person. There have been unsubstantiated reports that a "death
 squad" operates within the Lesotho Paramilitary Force (the army),
 with the aim of eliminating political opponents of the regime.
 Freedom of speech, press, and association do not appear to be
 seriously threatened, although government requirements for
 permits to hold meetings and reports of harassment tend to
 dampen political opposition.
 In 1983, the National Assembly passed a bill guaranteeing many
 fundamental human rights. However, these rights continue to
 be limited by the 1982 Internal Security (General) Act, which
 provides, among other things, for temporary detention without
 charge and puts on the accused the burden of proof in sabotage
 cases. While the courts have not hesitated to rule against
 the Government in security cases, mistreatment of prisoners
 prior to their trial remains a problem, as it is also for
 those detained for purely criminal offenses.
 The short-term outlook remains a heightened security posture
 to counter insurgent violence, with the risks this situation
 creates for human rights within the country. Although the
 Government in 1983 repeatedly proclaimed its willingness to
 hold elections, suspended since 1970, the fact that no date
 has yet been set has contributed to a sense of popular frustra-
 tion and does not bode well for the prospects of national
 reconciliation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Violence attributed to the Lesotho Liberation Army, and the
 Government's reaction to it, were responsible for a number of
 deaths in 1983. While precise figures are not available, it is
 likely that several dozen people were killed in attacks by
 insurgents and counterattacks by the Lesotho security forces.
 The Lesotho Liberation Army's tactics include small-scale armed
 attacks against government officials or members of the ruling
 party, often in remote rural areas. The Lesotho Paramilitary
 Force has suffered casualties in these attacks.
 Individuals with suspected insurgent ties have been attacked by
 persons alleged to be members of the police, the army, or local
 police volunteer units. One man was seriously wounded and his
 son shot dead when alleged security force members came to his
 house demanding firearms. A member of the opposition Basotholand
 Congress Party was shot by three men identified by a witness as
 policemen who then attempted to disguise the murder as a road
 accident. A volunteer policeman was charged and convicted of
 
 
 191
 culpable homicide in this case and a possible civil action is
 pending. Another man was stopped while driving, kidnapped,
 severely beaten, and left for dead by men he later identified as
 members of the Lesotho Paramilitary Force.
 One person is known to have died in detention in 1983. Henry
 Masheane, an employee of a fuel depot which was blown up in
 February 1983, was reported by the police to have hanged himself
 with his belt shortly after his detention for questioning. An
 inquest into Masheane's death was scheduled but postponed and has
 not yet taken place. Another security detainee, Sophie
 Makhele, allegedly shot herself while in detention in September
 1982. At an inquest, the Magistrate found that the death was due
 to criminal negligence on the part of a policewoman who had left
 a pistol within reach of the detainee. The policewoman was
 later charged and acquitted.
 b. Disappearance
 while disappearances have been alleged in the past, none were
 reported during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by both police and military members continue to be
 reported, although they are difficult to document. Abuse
 generally takes place during the arrest and interrogation
 phases, and it is apparently not limited to cases related to
 national security, but extends to common criminals as well.
 Physical punishment is not ordinarily sanctioned or proscribed,
 although caning is legally permitted. Conditions in places of
 detention are extremely poor. Given the constraints on govern-
 ment spending, any improvement in detention facilities appears
 unlikely. Prisoners who can afford lawyers (and are thus more
 likely to file lawsuits charging abuses) usually receive better
 treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus applies to ordinary arrests and few prisoners
 are held outside legal norms. Habeas corpus does not apply to
 those detained under the Internal Security (General) Act of
 1982. This Act provides for preventive detention under an
 interim custody order of an initial period of 14 days, after
 which a detention order must be issued or the individual is
 released. The detention order is valid for 14 days and may be
 extended an additional 14 days, after which the detainee must
 be charged or released. If released, the individual may be
 redetained only for a different cause.
 The initial 14-day detention may be effected by any policeman;
 the second period of 14 days can be ordered only by the Commis-
 sioner of Police. The third period must be ordered by a Minis-
 ter. During the initial 14 days, access to the detainee requires
 police permission; during the second stage, ministerially
 appointed "advisers* are permitted access. Advisers so far
 
 
 192
 appointed have been district coordinators, magistrates, or
 government medical officers, all employees of the state.
 The function of the 'advisers" is to report on the health of the
 detainee, to investigate whether a detainee has been involved
 in subversive activities, and to advise the Minister on the need
 for the continued detention. Since they do not have access to
 attorneys, individuals under preventive detention may make
 representations on their treatment only through the "advisers."
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Lesotho is independent and has acted to limit
 police or military infringements of law and procedure on a
 number of occasions. Court decisions and rulings are respected
 and obeyed by the authorities. Civil suits alleging maltreatment
 are accepted and adjudicated. Verdicts of civil courts may be
 appealed to the high court. In military cases, decisions may be
 appealed to officers of higher rank, including to the Lesotho
 Paramilitary Force commander, but not to civilian courts.
 The Internal Security (General) Act of 1982 alters normal
 judicial procedures in a number of ways. The Act establishes
 a presumption of guilt for persons charged with subversion,
 sabotage, or related offenses against the state. The Act is
 also extraterritorial, giving the high court jurisdiction to try
 offenses which take place outside the country.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are not generally violated in Lesotho, although
 under the Internal Security (General) Act of 1982 the police are
 given wide powers to stop and search, and to enter homes or
 other places for a similar purpose without warrant. Forced
 entry of the home has been credibly alleged but is quite possibly
 the result of indiscipline rather than deliberate policy.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the 1967 Internal Security Act included safeguards
 for freedom of speech and association, the Internal Security
 (General) Act which came into effect in 1982 does not contain
 such safeguards. In practice, opposition viewpoints are freely
 expressed in two Sesotho-language weekly newspapers published
 by the Roman Catholic and the Evangelical Churches. In 1983,
 this criticism centered on the Government's continued failure to
 hold elections and its recognition of the People's Republic of
 China and the establishment of diplomatic relations with several
 Eastern bloc countries, including the Soviet Union. This
 criticism has been tolerated, but has been rebutted and attacked
 by government-owned Radio Lesotho (the only radio station in
 Lesotho) and in the government-published Lesotho Weekly. The
 Government has also strongly criticized articles and viewpoints
 in the South African media which are widely read and listened to
 in Lesotho.
 The leader of the opposition United Democratic Party, a former
 minister and appointed Member of Parliament who favors the
 establishment of diplomatic relations between Lesotho and South
 
 
 193
 Africa, was expelled from Parliament and permanently barred
 from addressing the assembly because of criticism of the
 Government which he had made during an interview on South
 African television. However, he continues to hold press
 conferences-at which he has criticized government policies and
 called for the resignation of Prime Minister Jonathan.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits continue to be required for public and private meetings.
 Groups wishing to hold political rallies or organized sessions
 sometimes encounter harassment, generally in the form of denial
 of permits or of investigatory arrests of persons attending.
 Members of the police can generally be expected to attend such
 gatherings.
 Freedom of association is respected in the trade union sphere.
 Two labor confederations exist and are negotiating a mergery a
 number of independent unions also exist. These unions have the
 right to organize, bargain collectively, and strike. Trade
 unionism in Lesotho has played a relatively minor role in the
 society, largely due to the small size of the manufacturing and
 retail sectors where employment opportunities are limited.
 Union, government, and employer representatives have participated
 in delegations to the International Labor Organization and other
 foreign and international trade union organizatons.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open religious
 practice is permitted. Christianity is the dominant faith,
 with the principal denomination being Roman Catholicism. There
 is a significant Protestant minority composed of the Lesotho
 Evangelical Church (Presbyterian), Anglican Church, and a wide
 variety of other denominations. Conversion is permitted, and
 there is no indication that members of a given religion are
 persecuted or discriminated against on that basis or gain any
 advantage over another.
 The Sesotho language newspapers of the Roman Catholic Church and
 the Lesotho Evangelical Church frequently criticize government
 policies. Although some of the Government's principal opponents
 have belonged to the Lesotho Evangelical Church, many government
 officials are likewise active in that faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country is free, although temporary police
 and military roadblocks are sometimes set up to counter insurgent
 activity. There is no legal restraint on emigration, but
 overseas travel is made more difficult by a sizable repatriation
 deposit required of passport applicants. Moreover, large numbers
 of Lesotho citizens perform migrant labor, taking advantage of
 employment activities available in the mining and other sectors
 of the South African economy. Several thousand political
 refugees and economic migrants from South Africa are resident
 in Lesotho. They are generally free to move about the country,
 although the Government imposes restrictions on the political
 activities of refugees as a condition of their entry. Govern-
 ment policy is to integrate South African refugees, insofar as
 
 
 194
 possible, into the mainstream of Lesotho society. A small
 number of South African refugees left Lesotho for other
 neighboring countries in late 1983, reportedly to avoid
 possible reprisal from South Africa.
 While a number of political exiles from Lesotho are resident
 in neighboring countries, notably Botswana and South Africa,
 repatriation is not discouraged, and a 1980 Amnesty Act allows
 political exiles to return after signing statements concerning
 any criminal acts they may have committed, but few have done so.
 Internal opposition leaders have called for the Government to
 assure the safe return of political exiles in conjunction with
 any future elections.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Prime Minister Jonathan and the leadership of his Basotho
 National Party have ruled Lesotho since they were freely
 elected in 1965. In 1970, when the results of the first
 post-independence elections seemed to be going against him,
 Jonathan declared the results null and void. He suspended the
 Constitution, and has ruled on that basis since then. While
 opposition parties are legal and active, they are weak and
 divided into quarreling factions.
 The lack of elections has made it difficult to estimate the
 level of popular support accorded to either the governing
 party or the opposition parties. The military wing of
 the Basotholand Congress Party, headed by Ntsu Mokhehle, is
 involved in an anti-Government insurgency. However, other
 known members of the party not under Mokhehle's control operate
 openly in Lesotho, but their public activities are restricted.
 The appointed Parliament includes token representatives of all
 opposition parties, but usually passes Government proposed laws
 without amendment or serious opposition. One of the two minor
 Cabinet ministers belonging to the opposition resigned in 1983
 and was replaced by a party loyalist. While there are no women
 Cabinet ministers, there are female Permanent Secretaries
 (Cabinet ministers' deputies) and Deputy Permanent Secretaries.
 The Government has often stated its intent to hold elections,
 but no date has yet been set. A bill, establishing a framework
 for elections, was passed by the National Assembly in 1983.
 Under existing law, the 150,000 plus Lesotho migrant workers in
 South Africa would not appear to be permitted to cast absentee
 ballots; this group reportedly provides substantial financial
 support for the opposition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In past years, representatives of Amnesty International who
 have visited Lesotho to investigate human rights conditions have
 met with government officials and been provided access to some
 security detainees who complained of abusive treatment. In
 general, the response of the Government to alleged human
 rights violations has been to attribute this to an excess of
 zeal or indiscipline by low-level police or military officials,
 
 
 195
 not sanctioned by government policy, and to point to the judicial
 remedies available in the courts. Amnesty International was
 also concerned about the use of detention without trial and
 the failure to investigate allegations of torture of detainees.
 Freedom House rates Lesotho *partly free" in 1983.
 Within Lesotho, the Institute of Southern African Studies
 at the National University of Lesotho maintains a human rights
 research program which studies human rights conditions and
 practices in Lesotho as well as in the neighboring countries
 of Botswana and Swaziland.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lesotho is one of the countries designated by the United Nations
 as "least developed," with a per capita gross national product
 of $538 in 1981. Over 40 percent of this amount was made up
 from remittances from immigrant workers in the Republic of South
 Africa.   About 90 percent of the country's imports and tourist
 traffic comes from South Africa. In addition, Lesotho is tied to
 South Africa through a Customs Union and an interchangeable
 currency. Customs Union receipts in recent years have averaged
 about 70 percent of the total Government revenues. These funds,
 coupled with donor support programs, have managed to prop up a
 shaky and apparently unstable fiscal program, at the price of
 South African domination over Lesotho's pricing and tariff
 policies. The ability to procure food from South Africa at
 lower costs than producing it at home has discouraged the
 development of Lesotho's agriculture sector. In addition, the
 potential of well-paying jobs, by Lesotho standards, has attracted
 the cream of the labor force to South Africa at the expense of
 local development. Only about 10 percent of the indigenous
 Lesotho labor force is employed outside traditional agriculture.
 Lesotho's economic plight is further complicated by its general
 lack of natural resources, its mountainous terrain (most of
 which lies between one and two miles high), and its generally
 low rainfall. However, development of water resources, including
 potential hydropower, appears the best long-range hope for
 economic development.
 The 1983 population was estimated to be 1,438,000, with an annual
 growth rate of 2.5 percent. Life expectancy was estimated to be
 51.1 years in 1980. The infant mortality rate was 104.3 per
 1,000 live births in 1983, down from 114.4 in 1981.
 Nutritional standards are adequate, with the ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption to nutritional requirements
 estimated in 1977 to be 95 percent. However, a reduction in
 food supplies due to the current drought has hit some areas hard,
 with reports of serious malnutrition among children in certain
 villages. In 1975, only 17 percent of the population was
 estimated to have access to safe water. Major efforts by both
 the Government and donors since then have greatly increased this
 percentage, although exact figures are not available.
 Lesotho has a long history of church-sponsored primary schools
 located throughout the country, which have contributed to a
 comparatively high adult literacy rate, estimated at 55 percent
 in 1979. (Refugees from South Africa account for this increased
 ratio beyond 100 percent.) Although a basic church-sponsored
 
 
 196
 education system is in place, both the Government and the
 churches lack the funds to standardize training, improve
 standards, and replace and develop needed facilites. Generally,
 the education provided is highly academic and provides little or
 no vocational training.
 There is no blatant sexual, racial, or religious discriminiation
 in Lesotho. All Basotho have fairly equal opportunity within
 the confines imposed by political reality. The role of women
 within Basotho society has traditionally been that of a stabiliz-
 ing force, due to the absence of hundreds of thousands of men
 working in South Africa. Whether their talents and abilities
 will be used to a fuller extent in years to come will depend on
 the progress Lesotho makes in providing education, health, and
 other social services to the rural areas where the overwhelming
 majority of those women live. The 1979 Land Act has generally
 improved land tenure conditions and increased opportunities to
 obtain building sites. However, all lands still remain under
 the title of the Kingdom, and local land committees have been
 given considerable power over allocating land outside urban
 areas.   It remains to be seen whether women's interests
 will be adequately protected under these arrangements.
