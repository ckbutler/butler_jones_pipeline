 LIBYA*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as a "popular democracy." In theory
 political power is vested in "the masses" with the guidance of
 the People's Congress and its executive arms, the People's
 Committees; in practice the country is ruled by a dictatorship
 under Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi. He is aided by
 extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees which operate at
 his behest.
 The governing principles of the society are expressed in Col.
 Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather than in the Constitution. He
 has created a political system borrowing from pan-Islamic and
 pan-Arab sources and purporting to establish a "third way"
 superior to both capitalism and communism. He has instigated
 the assassination of his enemies abroad, and he controls
 enemies at home in a variety of summary and judicial
 proceedings which are employed wherever popular resistance
 exists. Ethnic minorities, such as Berbers, are tightly
 controlled.
 Libya's security apparatus consists of several elite military
 units, including Col. Qadhafi's personal bodyguards. The
 Revolutionary Committees and People's Committees also have
 security functions, designed to protect (but also monitor) the
 populace. The result is multilayered, pervasive surveillance
 and control of individual activities. In 1988 Colonel Qadhafi,
 citing numerous abuses, stripped the Revolutionary Committees
 of some of their prerogatives over internal security.
 Libya has used its oil income to finance internal development
 (new schools, hospitals, roads), but much has been wasted and
 the decline in oil revenues has forced retrenchment.
 Significant parts of Libya's development, plans have been
 dropped, foreign exchange controls tightened, and imports
 restricted. The current economic difficulties have been
 exacerbated by the regime's expenditures for large quantities
 of weapons and on foreign military adventures, including
 Libyan aggression in Chad.
 Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking in Libya,
 except for minimal guarantees for minorities and women. There
 are no effective rights to peaceful association or assembly,
 freedom of speech, to express opposition to the Government in
 any form, to form trade unions, or to strike. There are no
 legal or judicial rights such as the right to be considered
 innocent until proven guilty, to a public or speedy trial, to
 be secure in one's home or person, or even to hold property.
 During 1988 Col. Qadhafi announced his support for policies
 aimed at remedying past widespread abuses of human rights in
 Libya. Some prisons were destroyed, some political prisoners
 were freed, and restrictions on travel out of the country were
 eased. In June a special session of the General People's
 Congress approved the "Great Green Document for Peace and
 Human Rights in the Era of the Masses," which identified a
 broad range of human rights which had not previously been

 since Libya's media is totally controlled, this report draws
 heavily on unofficial sources.

 LIBYA
 guaranteed or respected in Libya. Announced reforms were not
 implemented by appropriate legislation. It was not clear by
 the end of the year whether or how effectively the document's
 commitments would be implemented. Despite the regime's claims,
 some political prisoners remained incarcerated, although the
 actual number was difficult to determine. The regime's policy
 of "physical liquidation" of Libyan political opponents abroad
 was not in evidence during 1988, as the regime encouraged
 exiles to return to Libya.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the-integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 It is not known how many political killings were carried out
 in 1988.
 Amnesty International (AI) has expressed concern about the
 large number of offenses, including political offenses, which
 are punishable by death under Libyan law. For example, Law
 Number 71 of 1972 provides for the death penalty for anyone
 involved with any group activity based on any ideology opposed
 to the principles of the revolution. In early 1988, Col.
 Qadhafi publicly stated his support for the abolition of the
 death penalty, and he promised to commute all existing death
 sentences. However, the Great Green Document on Human Rights
 adopted by the General People's Congress merely identified the
 total abolition of the death penalty as an "aim of the
 society," and declared that the death penalty should be
 applied only in cases in which the accused poses a danger of
 corruption to the society. As late as February, AI charged
 that the Libyan Government was executing political opponents.
 It has urged that the existing Libyan death penalty and other
 legislation be reviewed in light of the Great Green Document
 on Human Rights.
 In 1980 the Government instituted a policy of assassinations
 of Libyan exiles and announced the formation of "suicide
 squads" to hunt down and kill Libyan dissidents abroad.
 Between March 1980 and June 1987, AI recorded at least 37
 attacks on Libyan opponents or presumed opponents living
 abroad, resulting in 25 deaths. During 1988, the regime
 invited exiles to return, promising they would not be in
 danger. Most refused to do so. There were no reports of
 assassination attempts against Libyan exiles during 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 It is not known how many persons disappeared in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 regularly beaten during interrogation. While Shari'a
 (Islamic) law is practiced in Libya, physical mutilation is
 not used as a form of punishment.
 The Great Green Document of Human Rights outlawed degrading
 punishment and ill-treatment of prisoners. In a speech on
 June 12, Col. Qadhafi announced that Libya would ratify the
 optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
 
 
 1420
 LIBYA
 Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. There is
 no clear evidence that these commitments have been effectively
 implemented.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many political prisoners are held in
 unofficial detention centers controlled by members of the
 Revolutionary Committees, where prolonged periods of
 incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to other
 would-be opponents of the regime. In cases of political
 opposition in particular, there are many reports of prisoners
 being held without trial for several years.. While undergoing
 interrogation, sometimes for periods of several months,
 prisoners are given no access to legal representation.
 Publicly acknowledging past abuses, Col. Qadhafi moved in 1988
 to curb the arbitrary power of the Revolutionary Committees to
 arrest and detain suspected opponents of the Government.
 There are as yet no clear results of this action, and it is
 not clear how effectively or permanently the abuses of the
 Revolutionary Committees will, in fact, be curbed.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were-then "no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Reports
 from a variety of sources, however, indicated that the prisons
 contained persons convicted of, or held for, political
 offenses, including large numbers of persons arrested in
 1984. Some, but not all, were released in March 1988. At the
 time, Col. Qadhafi justified the imprisonment of "fewer than
 100" individuals on political charges, claiming they were
 agents of foreign powers. Although he has claimed to be
 opposed to secret arrests, there is no evidence he has
 followed up with explicit orders or that the situation has
 improved in practice. During 1987 Libyan authorities did not
 respond to any of AI's communications about 77 prisoners
 arrested for political reasons. AI asserts that "most of
 them were convicted of membership of political organizations
 and sentenced to death or life imprisonment." In its 1988
 Report, covering 1987, AI noted that it had received reports
 that political prisoners in Libya were often held without
 trial or after having been acquitted or having served their
 sentences.
 Foreigners are not immune from arbitary arrest. In 1987 five
 foreigners who entered Libya on a disabled yacht were held
 incommunicado for several months before four of them were
 allowed to leave. The fifth was finally released in early
 1988.
 There are credible reports that some foreign workers in Libya
 have been forced into military training and military service
 on behalf of Libya or coerced into subversive activities
 against their own countries.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Col. Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or
 studying abroad to return to Libya. Libya does, however,
 engage in the arbitrary expulsion of noncitizens.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 LIBYA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civilians may be tried in regular courts, in less formal
 "people's courts," or by military or revolutionary courts,
 depending on the arbitrary decision of the security forces.
 Security forces have the power to judge persons guilty without
 trial, particularly "traitors to the people." Trials are also
 held in private or in the absence of the accused. Until 1988
 the traditional courts were bypassed to a significant extent
 by people's courts and revolutionary courts which sometimes
 conducted "show trials" on television, followed by public
 executions, which were also sometimes televised. These
 various trial systems provided few safeguards.
 The Great-Green Document on Human Rights assures every person
 the right to resort to court and the right to a fair and
 impartial trial, but it is not yet clear what impact this
 assurance will have on actual judicial practice.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Secretariat of Justice. The Union
 of Arab Lawyers, located in France, has expressed concern
 about the ability and freedom of attorneys to provide legal
 defense for political prisoners while serving as government
 employees. Libya claims that it "guarantees prisoners all
 necessary means of defense and safeguards of justice adequate
 to the principles contained in the Declaration of Human Rights"
 and provides for legal assistance "as soon as possible with
 respect to the exigencies of interrogation," but there are
 numerous reports that these rights are frequently denied.
 Alleged political offenses in the past often have been tried
 before ad hoc "revolutionary courts" rather than under the
 normal judicial procedure, with the opportunities to engage
 defense counsel severely restgicted. Moreover, a number of
 these trials have been held in secret. In 1988 the regime
 announced the abolition of all "extraordinary" courts,
 including those operated by the Revolutionary Committees. To
 date, this measure has not been fully implemented. It remains
 to be seen whether past abuses will be eliminated and whether
 new courts being established will conduct fair trials. There
 is no precise estimate of the number of political prisoners in
 Libya.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not respect the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home reportedly is often disregarded.
 Local and international telephone calls are routinely
 monitored. The informer network is very extensive, encouraged
 by both security agencies and Revolutionary Committees.
 Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime
 opponents can result in harassment or even persecution and
 detention by the authorities. Property can be seized and
 burned if it belongs to "enemies of the people" or those who
 "cooperate" with foreign powers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's Committee
 meetings and at the General People's Congress, but in general
 
 
 1422
 LIBYA
 freedom of speech is severely limited. This is especially
 true with regard to any criticism of Col. Qadhafi or his
 regime. Fear of being informed upon by elements of the
 Revolutionary Committees and an underlying climate of mistrust
 at all levels of society further inhibit freedom of speech.
 Freedom of speech and other basic civil and political rights
 are further restricted during internal security crises.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is
 a state-run daily newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000.
 Several smaller newspapers are run by the Revolutionary
 Committees and the Islamic Call Society. JANA, the official
 news agency, is the designated conduit for politically
 acceptable opinions. It is impossible to publish opinions
 contrary to government policy. Until mid-1988, foreign
 publications, if not banned outright, were severely censored.
 They now reportedly circulate sporadically in Tripoli.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is repressed unless it is government controlled
 and supportive of regime positions. The right of association
 is limited and granted only to institutions affiliated with
 the regime. Organizations such as independent trade unions
 and professional associations are viewed as unnecessary, since
 Col. Qadhafi has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between
 the revolution and its working forces."
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Some minority religions (e.g.
 Christianity) still are allowed to conduct services, but
 Islamic groups at variance with the state-sanctioned version
 are banned. In 1986 all Koranic schools allegedly were
 ordered closed to reduce the influence of the mosques and to
 integrate all children into the public system. In October
 1986, the regime arrested, as a threat to state security,
 members of an "enemies of God" or "godless" clique, nine of
 whom were publicly executed in February 1987. In an apparent
 effort to eliminate any alternative power bases, the regime
 has banned the once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious
 sect. Restrictions were placed on the operation of the
 organization's Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was
 appointed for Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored
 Islamic University was merged with the University of Libya.
 Services in Christian churches are attended by the foreign
 community. There is a resident Catholic bishop and a small
 number of priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to wear
 religious habits.
 Most members of the formerly sizable Jewish community have
 emigrated. Col. Qadhafi has stated that he is opposed to
 Zionism, not Judaism, and that Arab nations should welcome
 Arab Jews who wish to return to their countries of origin.
 Yet in a speech in June 1985, he cited the Prophet Muhammed as
 stating that Judaism and Islam cannot coexist in the land of
 the Arabs and, in September 1985, anti-Jewish broadcasts on
 Libyan radio called virulently for anti-Jewish violence in
 areas of Tunisia and Morocco within broadcast range.
 
 
 1423
 LIBYA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, internal freedom of
 movement is monitored but not usually restricted for Libyan
 citizens. Traditionally, exit permits have been required for
 travel abroad, and currency controls have also served to
 restrict travel. Restrictions on travel abroad were eased
 significantly in 1988. Passport and exit visa requirements
 were abolished for travel to neighboring Tunisia, for example,
 facilitating the travel of large numbers of Libyans to that
 country. Members of the Revolutionary Committees maintain
 surveillance of some Libyans while abroad. Under Libyan
 Islamic law, wives may not leave the country without their
 husbands' permission; children may not travel without their
 fathers' consent. The right of return of Libyan nationals is
 theoretically fully protected to include opponents of Col.
 Qadhafi, so long as they are prepared to "repent." However,
 this "right" often appears to be more of an obligation or
 threat. The regime often calls for students, many of whom are
 under government subsidy, and others working abroad to return
 on little or no notice and without regard to the impact on
 their studies or work. Libyans who study abroad are
 interrogated on'their return home.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government.
 Major government decisions are controjlled by Col. Qadhafi
 himself or by committees acting in his name. He appoints
 military officers and official functionaries down to junior
 levels. Power flows through a small circle of trusted
 associates, whose own authority depends implicitly on their
 proximity to him. Corruption in administration is a problem
 of major proportions, with adverse effects on the quality of
 government.
 Participation in elections is mandatory, and all candidates
 are cleared by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, election
 brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969) government, or
 people who have been attacked by the power of the revolution."
 Political parties and tribal or local groupings are prohibited.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in. Libya to monitor
 the Government's performance. In June a delegation from AI
 accepted an invitation from the regime to visit Libya. The
 delegation stressed the need for urgent review of the cases of
 remaining political prisoners. It also urged a review of
 existing death penalty and other- penal legislation in light of
 the Great Green Document on Human Rights, aimed at the
 application'of international human rights standards.
 In its 1988 Report, covering 1987, AI noted that it had
 received no reply from Libyan authorities to any of Al's
 communications about 77 political prisoners, some of whom were
 under death sentences or serving life sentences.
 
 
 1424
 LIBYA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent allegations of discrimination based on
 tribal status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Col.
 Qadhafi has often complained about the continued power of
 tribal and other groups, but he also utilizes them for
 political action when he sponsors proregime demonstrations.
 In past years, he sought unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers
 married only non-Berbers, presumably to diminish their tribal
 identity.
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society
 serve to restrict rights of certain groups, most notably
 women. Within the confines of Islam, Col. Qadhafi has led
 efforts to change the status of women and expand their access
 to educational and employment opportunities. Women currently
 receive basic military training and are subject to military
 draft, with some exceptions. The husband's permission is
 necessary for women or children to travel abroad. Female
 circumcision is still reportedly practiced among tribal groups
 in remote areas of the south. The regime is opposed to
 Islamic fundamentalism.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The official trade union organization, the General Federation
 of Producers' Trade Unions, which was created in 1972, is
 under government control and administered through the People's
 Committee system. Independent trade unions and professional
 associations are viewed as unnecessary, since Col. Qadhafi has
 vowed not to accept intermediaries between the revolution and
 its working forces. Although unions are guaranteed the right
 to "safeguard their interests," there is no right to strike,
 and no strikes, by Libyan workers, have been reported for
 years.
 With government financing, the official trade union
 organization plays a leading role in the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and exploits international trade
 union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts on behalf of
 the Government. Libya is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). It ratified ILO Convention 98 on the
 Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining in 1962 (under the
 previous regime), but it has not ratified Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining in Libya. The ILO's
 Committee of Experts has noted that the Libyan Labor Code lays
 down conditions for the validity of collective agreements
 which are contrary to provisions of ILO Convention 98
 requiring free and voluntary negotiation of collective
 agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There were no known reports of forced or compulsory labor as
 defined by ILO conventions. However, see Section l.d.
 
 
 1425
 LIBYA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 No information is available regarding employment of children
 in Libya. In general, there is no evidence that child labor
 is a problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Libya maintains a work force of around 1 million workers in a
 population of 3.7 million. Libyan labor law defines the
 rights and duties of workers, and such aspects as compensation,
 pension rights, minimum rest periods, and length of the
 workday.
 Libyan labor law does not apply to the 300,000 foreign workers
 in Libya, who do much of the blue-collar and technical work.
 Their permission to stay in the country extends only for the
 duration of the contracts under which they are employed.
 Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as
 changes in work rules and contracts, with little option but to
 accept or to depart the country, often without full
 compensation for work already performed. The conditions of
 their employment are subject to negotiation between the worker
 and the employdr. Foreign workers who are not under contract
 enjoy no protection. In 1988 a series of strikes by foreign
 workers, against their foreign employer, were suppressed by
 the Libyan military. The workers were arrested and expelled.
 During the 1988 session of the ILO, Libya was criticized for
 its failure for the past 17 years to submit reports of labor
 inspection, as required by the Convention on Labor Inspection
 (Convention No. 81, 1947). A government representative
 claimed that labor inspection in Libya was within the
 competence of the popular committees and that a technicel
 committee carried out regular inspections in factories.
