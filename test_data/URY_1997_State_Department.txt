 URUGUAY
 Uruguay is a constitutional republic with an elected president and a bicameral
 legislature. In November 1994, former President Julio Maria Sanguinetti won a nar-
 row election victory. He began his 5-year term in March 1995. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent.
 The Interior Ministry administers the country's police departments and the prison
 system and is responsible for domestic security and public safety. The police contin-
 ued to commit human rights abuses.
 The economy is a mixture of private and state enterprises and is heavily depend-
 ent on agricultural exports and agroindustry. The Government respects private
 property rights. The economy grew by 4.9 percent in 1996, with estimated growth
 of 5.0 percent for 1997. Annual per capita income was about $6,000 in 1996.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary generally provide effective means of dealing with individual instances
 of abuse. However, there were problems in some areas, principally continued police
 abuse and mistreatment of detainees, and poor prison conditions. Low pay and con-
 sequent lack of professionalism in police ranks continue to be a problem. Court
 cases sometimes last many years, resulting in lengthy preverdict detention. Other
 problems include violence against women and continued underrepresentation of
 women and the black minority in the upper ranks of government and business.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 The case of Eugenio Berrios, whose body was discovered at a beach resort in 1995,
 continued to be the subject of an unresolved judicial investigation. Berrios, a Chil-
 ean chemist, had disappeared from Chile in 1992 after he was called to testify con-
 cerning the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier.
 Berrios reportedly entered Uruguay illegally under protective military custody. He
 was last seen alive on November 15, 1992, when he showed up at a Canelones police
 station claiming that he had escaped from his captors. The police claimed that they
 returned Barrios to the custody of military officers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Repeated calls for investigations into past disappearances continued in 1997. As
 in 1996, a silent march in memory of the persons who had disappeared occurred in
 May with thousands of participants. The executive branch opposed a judicial action
 brought by a Senator (whose father was killed in Argentina in 1976) requesting an
 investigation of the alleged removal of bodies from a military site, on the grounds
 that the 1985 Amnesty Law, which was confirmed by a 1989 plebiscite, prohibited
 such an inquiry. A court of appeals overturned a lower court ruling in favor of such
 an inquiry.
 The Government also cited the Amnesty Law to reject a formal petition for an in-
 vestigation presented by relatives of persons who had disappeared. This group also
 brought its case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Although the
 Amnesty Law obliges the executive branch to investigate the cases of citizens who
 were detained and then disappeared under the military regime, all three adminis-
 trations sine the return to democracy have onsistently refusad to open official in-
 vestigations into their fate. The only exception was a cursory, nonpublic inquiry con-
 ducted by a military prosecutor that revealed nothing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners, but the police continued
 to commit abuses. Neither the Ministry of Interior nor human rights organizations
 
 
 have received credible accusations of torture of prisoners under the current adminis-
 tration.
 The judicial and parliamentary branches of government are responsible for inves-
 tigating specific allegations of abuse. An internal police investigative unit receives
 complaints from any person concerning possible noncriminal polce abuse of power,
 but it is understaffed and can issue only recommendations for disciplinary action.
 While the courts seldom convicted and punished law enforcement officials-for such
 abuse in the past, such prosecutions are occurring more frequently: For example,
 in September a judge sentenced 4 police officers to prison for their involvement in
 the August 1994 Filtro hospital demonstrations, in which police killed 1 person and
 injured 50. The court stated that the police had committed excesses an that their
 use of firearms was not justified. In a separate case, a court gave a conditionally
 suspended sentence of 18 months in prison to a police officer charged with unlaw-
 fully detaining and interrogating two minors.
 Police officers charged with less serious crimes may continue on active duty; those
 charged with more serious crimes are separated from active service until a court re-
 solves their cases. A Ministry of Interior study reported that 179 police officers had
 been investigated or convicted by a court and that 117 of these cases were directly
 linked to the exercise of their jobs. The 1995 Public Security Law requires a propor-
 tional use of force by the police and the use of weapons only as a last resort, in
 accordance with United Nations codes regarding the use of force.
 Conditions in prisons and juvenile detention facilities for the roughly 3,000 pris-
 oners remain poor but not fife threatening. In March a legislative human rights
 commission presented a report that criticized the "excessive use of force and abuse
 of authority' by prison guards and officials, and stated that sanitation and health
 standards in the prison system were "unacceptable." This report reflects the work
 of a previous commission that in June 1996 published a report to the government
 citing overcrowding, lack of staff training, corruption, and physical violence as prob-
 lems. A new facility with a capacity of 400 prisoners opened on December 8, and
 prisoners were transferred to it.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires the plice to
 have a written warrant issued by a judge before making an arrest. The only excep-
 tion is when the police apprehend the accused during commission of a crime. The
 Constitution also provides the accused with the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention and requires that the detaining authority explain the legal
 frounds for the detention. Police may hold a detainee incommunicado for 24 hours
 before presenting the case to a judge, at which time the detainee has the right to
 counsel. It is during this 24-hour period that police sometimes abuse prisoners, occa-
 sionally resulting in forced confessions.
 A 1980 law stipulates that police confessions obtained before a prisoner appears
 before a judge and attorney (without the police present) have no validity. Further,
 should a prisoner claim that he has been mistreated, by law the judge must inves-
 tiate the charge.
 If the detainee cannot afford a lawyer, the courts appoint a public defender. If the
 crime carries a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the accused person is confined
 during the judge's investigation of the charges unless the authorities agree to re-
 lease the person on bail. This seldom happens. As a result, approximately 90 per-
 cent of all persons incarcerated are awaiting a final decision in their case. Because
 of the slowness of the judicial process, the length of time prisoners spend in jail be-
 fore the judge issues a verdict may exceed the maximum sentence for their crime.
 Human rights groups claim that the uncertainty as to how long one will be impris-
 oned is a factor creating tension within the country's prisons.
 In December the legislature approved a bill to reform and modernize the Criminal
 Code. Among its provisions, the new law provides for more oral argument by pros-
 ecution and defense attorneys, and less investigative responsibility or judges, which
 is expected to accelerate the pace of criminal trials.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The Supreme Court heads the judiciary system and supervises the work of the
 lower courts. A parallel military court system operates under a Military Justice
 Code. Two military justices sit on the Supreme Court but participate only in cases
 involving the military. Military justice applies to civilians only during a state of war
 or insurrection.
 Trial proceedings are usually based on written arguments to the judge, which are
 not routinely made public. Only the prosecutor and defense attorney have access to
 all documents that form part of the written record. The courts introduced oral argu-
 
 
 663
 ment in 1990, but individual judges use it at their option. Most judges choose to
 retain the written method, a major factor slowing down the judicial process. There
 is no legal provision against self-incrimination, and judges may compel defendants
 to answer any question they pose. The defense attorney or prosecutor may appeal
 convictions to a higher court, which may acquit the person of the crime, confirm the
 conviction, or reduce or increase the sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy, and the Government generally re-
 spects constitutional provisions and safeguards in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the authorities may abridge these rights if persons are deemed
 to be inciting violence or "insulting the nation."
 All elements of the political spectrum freely express their viewpoints in both print
 and broadcast media. Montevideo alone has 8 daily newspapers and 6 important
 weeklies; there are also approximately 100 other weekly and a few daily newspapers
 throughout the country. Montevideo has one government-affiliated and three com-
 mercial television stations. There are about 110 radio stations and 20 television sta-
 tions in the country.
 A 1989 law stipulates that expression and communication of thoughts and opin-
 ions are free, within the limits contained in the Constitution, and it outlines meth-
 ods of responding to "inexact or aggravating information." The law calls for 3
 months' to 2 years' imprisonment for "knowingly divulging false news that causes
 a grave disturbance to the public peace or a grave prejudice to economic interests
 of the State" or for "insulting the nation, the State, or their powers." The authorities
 use this law intermittently to set and enforce certain limits on freedom of the press.
 In August a judge acquitted the director and the editor of a daily newspaper, who
 had been convicted in 1996 on charges of offending the honor of a head of state (the
 President of Paraguay) and sentenced to 2 years in prison. (The two were later con-
 ditionally released from jail.) The judge based his ruling, in part, on the fact that
 while the story had been critical and undoubtedly irritated the Paraguayan Presi-
 dent, its publication had not put relations between Paraguay and Uruguay "in dan-
 ger." An appellate court formally rejected the government prosecutor's appeal of this
 ruling, thereby closing the case.
 A June 1996 decree requires the Government's prior authorization for the duty
 free import of newsprint. The Inter-American Press Association urged the Govern-
 ment to repeal this decree, calling it a "serious threat to the preservation of freedom
 of the press," inasmuch as it stipulates prior government authorization and grants,
 in theory, the power to establish quotas. Since making the decree, however, the Gov-
 ernment has never refused the duty free privilege.
 The national university is autonomous, and the authorities generally respect aca-
 demic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government grants refugee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Conven-
 tion Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1961 Protocol. The Government
 grants asylum only for political crimes as set forth in the 1928 Treaty of Havana,
 the 1889 Treaty of Montevideo, and the 1954 Caracas Convention. The Government
 cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision
 of first asylum did not arise in 1997. There were no reports of forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared persecution.
 In December 1996, an appellate court decided not to extradite to Peru two mem-
 bers of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) and released them from
 custody. The two then applied to the UNHCR for refugee status. Their refugee ap-
 plications were suspended since both individuals later went into hiding and their
 current whereabouts are unknown.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their government. Uru-
 guay is a multiparty democracy with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18
 years of age or older, and there are no restrictions regarding race, sex, religion, or
 economic status. The Colorado party, the National (Blanc) party, the Brad Front
 coalition, and the New Space party are the four major political groupins.
 A constitutional reform approved by plebiscite in December 1996 did away with
 the old "law of lemas " by which a party could run multiple presidential and legisla-
 tive candidates for te same offices. The candidate receiving the most votes from
 the party receiving the most votes filled the presidency, and each party gained seats
 in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies according to the percentage of votes that
 it received. The reform limits parties to one candidate, determined by internal party
 primaries, per elected office. The top two presidential candidates face a runoffelec-
 tion if no one wins a first-round majority vote.
 Women and blacks face impediments to high-level participation in politics and
 employment in government. Only 1 of 12 cabinet ministers is a woman. In the legis-
 lature, 2 of 30 Senators and 9 of 99 Deputies are women. There are no minority
 representatives or cabinet officials.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the law prohibit discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
 or disability. Despite these provisions, discrimination against some groups exists.
 Women.-Violence against women continues to be a serious problem. There were
 more than 950 formal complaints of violent acts against women, reflecting both an
 increased public awareness of the problem as well as a growing change in attitude
 among women. The law provides for sentences of 6 months to 2 years in prison for
 a person found guilty of committing an act of violence or of making continuing
 threats to cause bodily injury to persons related emotionally or legally to the per-
 petrator. The Montevideo city hall has a hot line for victims of violence.
 The Government has established an office of assistance for victims of domestic vi-
 olence which trains police how to receive complaints of violence against women. A
 new directorate within the Ministry of Interior instituted a public awareness cam-
 paign about domestic violence and founded community assistance centers where
 abuse victims can receive counseling and referrals to government and private orga-
 nizations in their area that aid abused women.
 Women enjoy equality under the law but face discrimination stemming from tradi-
 tional attitudes and practices. The work force exhibits segregation by gender.
 Women, who make up almost one-half the work force, tend to be concentrated in
 lower paying jobs. However, one-half the students now entering universities are
 women. They often pursue professional careers but are underrepresented in tradi-
 tionally male-dominated professions. In February the Government approved official
 regulations to implement a 1989 law for equality in the workplace that had pre-
 viously gone unenforced. In 1997 the Air Force Academy became the first armed
 services academy to admit women. The Liceo Militar, a military-run secondary
 school that prepares officer-candidates for all the services, admitted 54 women in
 1997, for a total female enrollment of 115.
 A small institute in the Ministry of Education coordinates government programs
 for women. There are a number of active women's rights groups, and many of their
 activities in 1997 remained centered on followup to the platform of action of the
 1995 U.N. Conference on Women.
 Children.-The Government is generally committed to protecting children's rights
 and welfare. An institute in the Ministry of Interior oversees implementation of the
 Government's programs for children but receives only limited funding for programs.
 The Government regards the education and health of children as a top prority and
 believes it should do more to ensure free education and proper healt care or all
 children. Since 40 percent of children under the age of 5 live in 20 percent of the
 poorest homes, the Government is attempting to extend proper health and education
 to them with the help of the United Nations Children's Fund. The Government pro-
 vides free, compulsory primary education, and 95 percent of children complete this
 program.
 
 
 665
 There are no societal patterns of abuse of children. Minors under the age of 18
 are not subject to criminal trial, but receive special treatment with special judges
 and, when sentenced, stay in institutions run by the National Institute for Minors
 (INAME) for the period determined by the judge. The Government currently houses
 all its problem minors in INAME. The most controversial aspect of the 1995 Public
 Security Law would allow the Government to put minors with a record of violent
 crimes in adult prisons if INAME has no room in its own institutions. Even though
 the law stipulates that minors would occupy separate facilities within the prisons,
 human rights groups adamantly oppose this provision. As a result, INAME has de-
 cided-that it will not send minors to adult prisons.
 People With Disabilities.-The legislature passed a law covering the rights of the
 disabled in 1989. A national disabilities commission oversees implementation of the
 law. Although the law mandates accessibility only to new buildings or public serv-
 ices for people with disabilities, the Government is providing access to a number of
 existing buildings. The law reserves 4 percent of public sector jobs for the disabled.
 The country has a generally excellent mental health system and an interest in the
 rights of people with mentaldisabilities.
 Nrational/Racial/[Ethnic Minorities.-The country's black minority, estimated at 5
 percent of the population, continues to face societal discrimination. The Government
 lacks adequate statistics on blacks, which contributes to a lack of awareness that
 problems exist. The latest report (1993) put the number of black university grad-
 uates at 65, and black professionals at fewer than 50. Blacks are practically unrep-
 resented in the bureaucratitic  o ical, and academic sectors of society. They lack the
 social and political connections necessary for entry into these  nups. The Govern-
 ment is working with local minority organizations to address this problem and in-
 vited the leading black minority organization to help prepare an official report on
 racial discrimination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-.The Constitution states that laws should promote
 the organization of trade unions and the creation of arbitration bodies. In spite of
 this provision, there is almost no legislation concerning union activities. Unions tra-
 ditionally organize and operate free of government regulation. Civil servants, em-
 ployees of state-run enterprises, and private enterprise workers may join unions. An
 estimated 12 percent of the work force is unionized. Labor unions are independent
 of political party control but have traditionally associated more closely with the
 Broad Front, the leftist political coalition.
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, and there were numer-
 ous strikes during they ear. The Government may legally compel workers to work
 during a strike if they perform an essential service which, if interrupted, "could
 cause a grave prejudice or risk, provoking suffering to part or all of the society."
 There are mechanisms for resolving workers' complaints against employers, hut
 unions complain that these mechanisms are sometimes applied arbitrarily. The law
 generally prohibits discriminatory acts by employers, including arbitrary dismissals
 or union activity. Unions maintain that organizers are dismissed for other fab-
 ricated reasons, thus avoiding penalty under the law.
 There are no restrictions on the right of unions to form confederations or to affili-
 ate with international trade union groups; however, the one national confederation
 has chosen not to affiliate officially with any of the Worm federations. Some individ-
 ual unions are affiliated with international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining between
 companies and their unions determines a number of private sector salaries. The ex-
 ecutive branch, acting independently, determines public sector salaries. There are
 no laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination, but a 1993 executive decree estab-
 lished fines for employers engaging in antiunion activities. The law does not reire
 employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities. However, in cases of legal
 challenges by union activists, courts tend to impose indemnization levels that are
 higher than those normally p  yaid to dismissed workers.
 Union members continued to file claims of discrimination with the Ministry of
 Labor, which has a labor commission that investigates all claims. In some of the
 cases, employers agreed to reinstate workers, but other cases remained unresolved
 at year's end.
 All labor legislation fully covers workers employed in special exprt zones. There
 are no unions in any of these zones, but the few workers in these zones are not in
 traditionally organizable occupations. Because of the protected status given many of
 the companies in the free zones and the lack of union presence, occasionally compa-
 nies wil impl ement labor practices in violation of the law.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its existence. The law prohibits
 forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Child
 Labor Code protects children- the Ministry of Labor and Social Security is respon-
 sible for enforcing the laws. Illegal child labor is not a problem. The law prohibits
 forced or bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively. A total of 95 percent of children complete primary school education,
 which is compulsory and free of charge. By law children under 15 years of age are
 not allowed to work unless granted a special permit; this is enforced in practice.
 Children under the age of 18 may not perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work.
 Controls over salaries and hours for children are more strict than those or adults.
 Children over the age of 16 may sue in court for payment of wages, and children
 have the legal right to dispose of their own income. However, many children work
 as street vendors in the expanding informal sector or in the agrarian sector, which
 are generally less strictly regulated and where pay is lower.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces a
 legislated minimum monthly wage which is in effect in both the public and private
 sectors. The Ministry adjusts the minimum wage whenever it adjusts public sector
 wages. The minimum wage, which was about $95 (900 pesos) per month, functions
 more as an index for calculating wage rates than as a true measure of minimum
 subsistence levels, and it would not provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in industry and 44 hours in commerce, with
 a 36-hour break each week. The law stipulates that industrial workers receive over-
 time compensation for work in excess of 48 hours and that workers are entitled to
 20 days of paid vacation after a year of employment.
 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security enforces legislation regulating health
 and safety conditions in a generally effective manner. However, some of the regula-
 tions cover urban industrial workers more adequately than rural and agricultural
 workers. Workers have the right to remove themselves from what they consider haz-
 ardous or dangerous conditions.
