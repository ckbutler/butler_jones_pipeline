 MONACO
 Monaco is a constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign Prince plays a lead-
 ing role in governing the country. The Prince appoints the four-member Govern-
 ment, headed by a Minister of State chosen by the Prince from a list of candidates
 proposed by France. The other three members are Counselors for the Interior (who
 is usually French), for Public Works and Social Affairs, and for Finance and the
 Economy. Each is responsible to the Prince. Legislative power is shared between the
 Prince and the popularly elected 18-member National Council. There are in addition
 three consultative bodies, whose members are appointed by the Prince: The 7-mem-
 ber Crown Council; the 12-member Council of State; and the 30-member Economic
 Council, which includes representatives of employers and trade unions.
 In addition to the national police force, the 'Carabiniers du Prince" carry out se-
 curity functions. Both forces are controlled by government officials.
 The principal economic activities are services and banking, light manufacturing,
 and tourism.
 Individual human rights are provided for in the Constitution and respected in
 practice. The Constitution distinguishes between those rights that are guaranteed
 for all -esidents and those that apply only to the approximately 5,000 who hold
 Monegasque nationality. The latter enjoy free education, financial assistance in case
 of unempflYment or illness, and the right to vote and hold elective office. Women
 traditionally have played a less active role than men in public life, but this is chang-
 ing;, women currently hold both elective and appointive offices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 1045
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities respect this prohibi-
 tion. There were no reports of violations.
 Prison conditions meet or exceed minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution bars arbitrary arrest.
 Arrest warrants are required, except when the detainee is arrested while commit-
 ting an offense. The police must bring the detainee before a judge within 24 hours
 to be informed of the charges and of the detainee's rights under the law. Most de-
 tainees are released without bail, but the investigating magistrate may order deten-
 tion on grounds that the suspect might either flee or interfere with the investigation
 of the case. The magistrate may extend the initial 2-month detention for additional
 2-month periods indefinitely. Detainees have the right to counsel, at public expense
 if necessary. The magistrate may permit family members to see the detainee.
 The Government does not forcibly exile its own nationals. However, it does some-
 times expel to France non-Monegasque nationals who are in violation of residency
 laws or who have committed minor offenses, such as disorderly conduct.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the 1962 Constitution, the Prince delegated
 his *udicial powers to an independent judiciary. The law provides for fair, public
 tria, and the authorities respect these provisions. The defendant has the right to
 be present and the right to counsel, at public expense if necessary. As under French
 law, a three-judge tribunal considers the evidence collected by the investigating
 magistrate and hears the arguments made by the prosecuting and defense attor-
 neys. The defendant enjoys a presumption of innocence and the right of appeal.
 There were no reports of poitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the individual's right of privacy in personal and family life,
 at home, and in correspondence, and the Government respects these rights in prac-
 tice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of expression is guaranteed. The
 Monegasque Penal Code, however prohibits public denunciations of the ruling fam-
 ily. Several periodicals are published. Foreign newspapers and magazines circulate
 freely, including French journals that specifically cover news in the Principality.
 Foreign radio and television are received without restriction. Stations that broadcast
 from the Principality operate in accordance with French and Italian regulations.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the rights of peaceful assembly and association. Outdoor meetings require
 police authorization, which is not withheld for political or arbitrary reasons. Formal
 associations must be registered and authorized by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism is the state religion. The law pro-
 vides for the free practice of all religions, and the Government respects this right
 in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Residents move freely within the country and across its open borders
 with France. Monegasque nationals enjoy the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 They can be deprived of their nationality only for specified acts, including natu-
 ralization in a foreign state. Only the Prince can grant or restore Monegasque na-
 tionality, but he is obliged by the Constitution to consult the Crown Council on each
 case before deciding.
 The Government implements the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees. In light of its bilateral arrangements with France, Monaco does
 not grant political asylum or refugee status unless the request also meets French
 criteria for such cases. The number of cases is very small. There were no reports
 of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1962 Constitution cannot be suspended, but it can be revised by common
 agreement between the Prince and the National Council. The Prince p lays an active
 role in government. He names the Minister of State (in effect, the Prime Minister)
 from a list of names proposed by the French Government. He names as well the
 three Counselors of Government (of whom the one responsible for the interior is
 usually a French national). Together the four constitute the Government. Each is
 responsible to the Prince.
 
 
 1046
 Only the Prince may initiate legislation, although the 18-member National Coun-
 cil may send proposals for legislation to the Government. All legislation and the
 adoption of the budget require the Council's assent. Elections, which are held every
 5 years, are based on universal adult suffrage and secret balloting. Two political
 parties are currently represented on the Council. There is one independent member.
 The Constitution provides for three consultative bodies. The seven-member Crown
 Council (composed exclusively of Monegasque nationals) must be consulted by the
 Prince regarding certain questions of national importance. He may choose to consult
 it on other matters as wel. The 12-member Council of State advises the Prince on
 Vroposed legislation and regulations. The 30-member Economic Council advises the
 overnment on social, financial, and economic questions. One-third of its members
 come from the trade union movement, and one-third from the employers federation.
 Women are active in public service. The Mayor of Monaco and one member of the
 National Council are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government imposes no impediments to the establishment or operation
 of local groups devoted to monitoring human rights, there is none. There have been
 no requests from outside groups to investigate human rights conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that all Monegasque nationals are equal before the law.
 It differentiates between rights that are accorded nationals (including preference in
 employment, free education, and assistance to the ill or unemployed) and those
 guaranteed to all residents (e.g., freedom of religion, inviolability of the home).
 Women.-Reported instances of violence against women are rare. Marital violence
 is strictly prohibited, and any woman who is a victim of it may bring criminal
 charges against her husband. Women are fairly well represented in the professions,
 e g they constitute 6 of Monaco's 18 lawyers (including a former president of the
 bar), 5 of 42 physicians, and 8 of 26 dentists. Women are less well represented in
 the business world. The law governing transmission of citizenship provides for
 equality of treatment between men and women who are Monegasque by birth. How-
 ever, women who acquire Monegasque nationality by naturalization cannot transmit
 it to their children, whereas naturalized male citizens can.
 Children.-The Government is fully committed to the protection of children's
 rights and welfare and has well-funded public educatiand nd health care programs.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilitie.-The Government has mandated that public buildings
 provide for access for the disabled, and this has been largely accomplished.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are free to form unions, but fewer than 10
 percent of workers are unionized, and relatively few of these reside in the Principal-
 ity. Unions are independent of both the Government and the Monegasque political
 p  hque Confederation of Unions is not affiliated with any larger
 labor organization but is free to join international bodies.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike in conformity with relevant legis-
 lation. Government workers, however, may not strike. The first strike in several
 years occurred in March when the Monegasque Confederation of Unions organized
 a 1-day work stoppage by bank transportation, and factory employees.
 b.The Right to 0rqanize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the free
 exercise of union activity. Agreements on working conditions are negotiated between
 organizations representing employers in a given sector of the economy and the re-
 spective union. Antiunion disrimination is prohibited. Union representatives can be
 ired only with the agreement of a commission that includes two members from the
 employers' association and two from the labor movement. Allegations that an em-
 ployee has been fired for union activity may be brought before the Labor Court,
 which can order redress such as the payment of damages with interest.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Such practices are outlawed and
 do not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Special restrictions apply to the hiring, worktimes, and other conditions
 of workers 16 to 18 years old.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for full-time work is
 the French minimum wage plus 5 percent, i.e., currently $7.70 (Fr 39.60) per hour,
 which is adequate to provide a decent living for a worker and family. Most workers
 
 
 1047
 receive more than the minimum. The legal workweek is 39 hours. Health and safety
 standards are fixed by law and government decree. These standards are enforced
 by health and safety committees in the workplace and by the government Labor In-
 spector.
