 AZERBAIJAN
 Azerbaijan is a republic with a presidential form of government. Heydar Aliyev
 who assumed presidential powers after the overthrow of his democratically elected
 predecessor, was elected President in 1993. He and his supporters, many from his
 home region of Nakhichevan, dominate the Government and the multiparty, 125-
 member Parliament chosen in the November 1995 elections. The Constitution,
 adopted in a November 1995 referendum, established a system of government based
 on division of powers between a strong presidency, a legislature with the power to
 approve the budget and impeach the President, and a judiciary with limited inde-
 pendence. After years of interethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis,
 Armenian forces affiliated with the self-styled "Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh"
 (which is not recognized by any government) occupy 20 percent of Azerbaijan's terri-
 tory. Although both sides largel1y continue to observe the cease-fire concluded in
 May 1994 and the peace proess continues, there are continued reports of cease-fire
 violations from bothsides and military operations continued to affect the civilian
 population. There are about 780,000 Azerbaijani refugees and internally displaced
 persons (IDP's) who cannot return to their homes. In the part of Azerbaijan that
 the Government controls, government efforts to hinder the opposition continue to
 impede the transition to democracy. In the part of Azerbaijan that Armenians con-
 trol, a heavily militarized ruling structure prevents ethnic Azerbaijanis from return-
 ingto their homes.
 Police and the Ministry of National Security are responsible for internal security.
 Members of the security forces committed numerous human rights abuses.
 Azerbaijan has a state-dominated economy rich in oil, natural gas, and cotton. An
 informal private sector, operating outside official channels but often with ties to per-
 sons in the Government, plays an important role in the economy. In June and De-
 cember, the Government signed contracts for third and fourth international consor-
 tiums to develop additional oil fields. Oil bonus payments from these consortiums
 contributed importantly to the Government's budget and fiscal stability. However
 the economy continued to suffer from the lack of significant economic reform and
 the slow pace of privatization. The Parliament passed a revised mass privatization
 law in November 1995, but to date the Government has only privatized about 3,000
 small service enterprises. Russian measures to restrict transport flows at the north-
 ern border hamper trade. The loss of the Nagorno-Karabakh region and surrounding
 
 
 841
 territories which took significant amounts of agricultural land out of production, led
 to reduced agricultural output. Widespread corruption is an obstacle to economic de-
 velopment. The overall economic situation of the average citizen remains precarious,
 although in urban areas a growing monied class with trade and oil-related interests
 has emerged. Both underemployment and unemployment are extremely high.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, and the Government
 continued to commit serious abuses. The security forces beat persons and some beat-
 ings resulted in deaths. Security forces also arbitrarily arrested, and detained per-
 sons; conducted searches and seizures without warrants; and suppressed peaceful
 demonstrations. In a variet of separate incidents, the Government arrested 25
 members of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front Part and 9 members of the
 Islamic Party. In May one member of the Islamic Part  ed after being arrested
 and beaten by security forme officials. The Government did not take effective action
 to punish any abusers. Prison conditions remained harsh. The judiciary is corrupt,
 inefficient, and subject to executive influence. The Government tolerated the exist-
 ence of many opposition political parties, although it continued to refuse to register
 some of them. The Government restricts citizens ability to change their government
 peacefully. Government efforts to hamper opposition candidates marred parliamen-
 tary runoff elections in February. The Government restricted freedom of speech,
 press, assembly, association, religion, and privacy when it deemed it in its interest
 to do so. Press censorship continued, and the Goveent closed a leading inde-
 pendent newspaper for 1 month. However, scores of opposition and independent
 newspapers continued to publish and discuss a wide range of sensitive domestic and
 foreign policy issues. Discrimination against ethnic minorities and societal discrimi-
 nation and violence against women are problems.
 Nevertheless, there were some positive signs. The Government was open to in-
 creased dialogue with domestic and internatonal human rights organizations; un-
 dertook to investigate the alleged beating of a journalist; and was responsive to
 interventions on individual cases. For example, the Government released from cus-
 tody a former Foreign Minister and an opposition leader.
 Cease-fire violations by beth sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resulted in
 civilian injuries and deaths and the taking of prisoners. Insurgent Armenian fores
 in Nagorno-Karabakh and the occupied territories continued to prevent the return
 of IDI's to their homes. This restriction resulted in significant human suffering for
 hundreds of thousands of people.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Extra judicial Killings.-A member of the Islamic Party of Azer-
 basan, Haci Qablaqa Quliyev, died in  ay after severe beatin  by guards in prison.
 Rafiq Ismaylov, a barber not involved in politics, died after being beaten while in
 ] lice custody in Massali province at the end of 1995. Ilqar Samedov died in pretrial
 detent ion on July 29 as a result of injuries sustained during beatings by police. A
 Human Rights Watch report states that, according to a coroner's report, he died of
 "blows to the head with a blunt object." The Government took no action against of-
 fenders in any of these cases.
 There has been no action by the Government in the murder of opposition Azer-
 baijan Popular Front (APF) MP Shakhsultan Jafarov in July 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 All sides to the Naorno-Karaba   conflict still detain prisoners. The International
 Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC) visited 122 people held in relation to this con-
 flict. In July the parties freed a total of 109 in a prisoner exchange: 39 by Azer-
 baijan, 11 by Armenia, and 59 b the authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh. Subse-
 quently, 21 additional people have been detained: 17 Armenians held by Azerbaijan,
 including 2 women and one child, and 4 Azrbaijanis held by the authorities in
 Nagorno-Karabakh. The ICRC repatedly asked the concerned parties for notifica-
 tion of any person captured in reaion tothe conflict, access to all plaes of deten-
 tion connected with the conflict, and release of all such persons. The ICRC also
 urged the parties to provide information on the fate of persons reported missing in
 action. The Government presented to the ICRC a list of 856 persons allegedly held
 by the Armenians.
 e Human Rights Center of Azerbaijan, together with other local human rights
 organizations, successfully negotiated with the Ministry of Justice to visit a woman's
 prison.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Derading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torturei  illegal; however, the security fores practie of beating prisoners during
 arrest and interrogation was widespread. Ministry of National Security officials ar-
 
 
 842
 rested, beat, and then released Mirsaleh Jafarov, a member of the Islamic Party in
 April/May. Two persons died after beatings by security force officials, one while in
 police custody, and another while in prison (see Section l.a.).
 Prison conditions are harsh, especially in the special security prisons. The quality
 of food, housing, and medical care is poor. Prisoners often must rely on their fami-
 lies to procure food and medicine. There are widespread reports that authorities
 deny, or give inadequate, medical treatment to prisoners for serious medical condi-
 tions. The family of Kenan Gurel, on trial for participating in a coup attempt, re-
 ported that he receives inadequate treatment for a kidney ailment. Authorities se-
 verely limit opportunities for exercise for prisoners in security prisons.
 Despite Government assurances that former Interior Minister Iskendar Hamidov
 is receiving medical care, Hamidov's relations say that his medical care is inad-
 equate and that he continues to suffer from ill health in prison. Hamidov remains
 in the central Ministry of National Security prison, despite a sentence to a regular
 prison. The Government claims that incarceration of amidov in a regular prison
 would be dangerous for Hamidov, who as Interior Minister was responsible for plac-
 ingmany of the prisoners in jail.
 On two occasions, police beat a journalist (see Section 2.a.). Police also dispersed
 demonstrators by force (see Section 2.b.).
 There were no further developments in the 1995 arrest and beating of Farrukh
 Agaev for allegedly reading (opposition-oriented) bulletins on a wall in Lenkoran.
 Various foreign embassies have petitioned the Government for permission to visit
 all prisons. In general, when asked, the authorities grant foreign officials access to
 regular prisons to visit imprisoned nationals of their countries. However, the Gov-
 ernment denies access to detainees held in security prisons.
 Human rights organizations were able to visit prisons on at least one occasion.
 The ICRC visits most prisons in the country.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrests without legal warrant
 occur. Often authorities do not notify family members after arrests. Frequently, it
 is days before family members are able to obtain information as to whether authori-
 ties have arrested someone and where authorities are holding the detainee. Family
 members do not enjoy the right of visitation. Authorities generally deny bail to de-
 tained individuals and often do not inform detainees of the charges against them.
 Access to lawyers is often poor.
 Authorities arrested Kemal Talibov in Nakhichevan after he published a news-
 paper article criticizing political and economic conditions in the Nakhichevan Auton-
 omous Republic. Police arrested, beat, and then released Turkish journalist Yashar
 Tezel, who was found in the company of former Prime Minister Penah Huseynov.
 In the course of the year, the police arrested 25 members of the opposition Azer-
 baijan Popular Front Party. Among them was former Prime Minister Panah
 Huseynov. Security forces also arrested 9 members of the Islamic Party.
 Despite such actions, the Government did release some detainees. The Govern-
 ment freed former Foreign Minister Tofiq Qasimov from detention in February and
 allowed him to remain at home with his family to seek medical treatment after
 asimov suffered medical problems during incarceration. The court postponed
 asimov's trial pending his recovery. In July the Government released deputy chair
 of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party Arif Pashayev after 25 months in prison. In
 both cases, international and local human rights organizations, and foreign embas-
 sies, intervened on behalf of the prisoners.
 Various local estimates put the number of political detainees currently under ar-
 rest on politically motivated charges at approximately 35. Authorities charged them
 with common crimes or with treason.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a judiciary with lim-
 ited independence. The President appoints Supreme and Constitutional Court
 judges, subject to confirmation by Parliament. The President directly appoints lower
 level judges with no requirement for confirmation. Constitutional provisions for judi-
 cial independence to the contrary, judges do not function independently of the execu-
 tive branch. The judicial system is subject to the influence of executive authorities
 and has been widely seen as corrupt and inefficient.
 Courts of general jurisdiction may hear criminal, civil, and juvenile cases. District
 and municipal courts try the overwhelming majority of cases. The Supreme Court
 ma also act as the court of firs ins  ce, epending on the nature and seriousness
 of the crime.
 The government organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and
 republic levels. They are ultimately responsible to the Minister of Justice, are ap-
 pointed by the President, and confirmed by Parliament. The Constitution prescribes
 equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts. In practice,
 
 
 however, prosecutrial prerogatives still generally outweigh those of defense attor-
 neys. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than obtaining evi.
 dence against suspects.
 Cases at the district court level are tried before a panel consisting of one judge
 and two lay assessors. Judges frequently send cases unlikely to end in convictions
 back to the prosecutor for "additional investigation.' Such cases may be either
 dropped or closed, occasionally without informing the court or the defendant.
 The Constitution provides for public trials except in cases involving state, com-
 mercial, or professional secrets, or matters involving confidentiality of personal or
 family matters. The Constitution provides for the presumption of innocence in crimi-
 nal cases, and numerous other rights, including an exclusionary rule barring the use
 of illegally obtained evidence, a suspect's right to legal counsel, to be informed im-
 mediately of his legal rights, and of the charges against him. The Government has
 not made significant efforts to enforce these rights throughout the criminal justice
 system. Defendants may confront witnesses and present evidence. The court ap-
 points an attorney for indigent defendants. Defendants and prosecutors have the
 right of appeal. The Government has generally observed the constitutional provision
 for public trial. Foreign and domestic observers were able to attend trials, including
 sensitive trials involving high-profile political figures.
 The Government held approximately 100 political prisoners at year's end, a figure
 comparable with 1995 levels.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 population widely believes that the Ministry of National Security monitors tele-
 phones, especially those of foreigners and prominent political and business figures.
 The police have periodically raided the offices of opposition political parties and the
 homes of their members, allegedly searching for illegal weapons or other materials.
 These searches are usually conducted without a warrant, and investigations can re-
 sult in confining the individuals to their city of residence or a brief jail sentence for
 questioning. There were no reported cases of such limitations being imposed in
 1996.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-There were continued reports of civilian deaths and injuries due to shelling
 by Armenian forces. The Armenian press reported deaths and injuries to Armenian
 civilians from Azerbaijani shelling. Foreign diplomats who visited areas in Azer-
 baijan near the front lines met individuals who claimed that they'or family mem-
 bers were injured in shellings by Armenian forces. These sources reported civilian
 deaths from Armenian shelling. According to the Government, six persons were
 wounded by Armenian activity in the first 2 months of 1996. No annual figures were
 available on civilian and military casualties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and specifically outlaws press censorship; however, the Government
 often did not respect these rights in practice. While the press debated a wide variety
 of sensitive topics, censorship limited the public's ability to be informed about and
 discuss political issues. Censorship continued at approximately 1995 levels, al-
 though the Government did not prevent independent and opposition press from con-
 tinuing to play an active, influential role in politics. Officially, the Government lim-
 ited censorship to military topics. In practice, however, censorship of political topics
 continued. The Ministry of Information can legally close a newspaper for 1 month
 for violating censorship rules. Censors deleted portions of newspaper articles or en-
 tire articles. Journalists often exercised self-censorship and are forbidden to write
 about censorship. A major opposition newspaper claimed to have been subjected to
 105 cases of censorship in the course of the year. Censors banned an entire issue
 of one opposition newspaper for having previously published a mildly satirical arti-
 cle about the President. The Ministry of Information took another independent
 newspaper to court and had it closed or 1 month due to previously published arti-
 cles on sensitive foreign policy subjects. The President's office rescinded this order
 1 week later. On two occasions, the Speaker of Parliament banned a journalist from
 entering Parliament. In one of those cases, a court rendered an apparently pre-
 arranged verdict that confirmed the ban and ruled that the journalist had slandered
 Parliament. Authorities in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic banned an oppo-
 sition journalist from Nakhichevan after she published an article critical of condi-
 tions there. On two occasions, police beat a journalist attempting to cover dem-
 onstrations that the Government had not authorized. In one of these cases, when
 the journalist filed a complaint about police behavior, the prosecutor's office opened
 an investigation of police behavior. The investigation was ongoing at year's end.
 
 
 Despite government censorship, articles critical of government policy and high
 government figur es appeared routinely in the print media. Newspapers were able
 to publish articles opposing government views in sensitive areas such as Azer-
 baijan's relations with Russia and Iran, the Nagorno-Karabakh peace process, con-
 flicts within the President's political party, and government failures in economic re-
 form.
 A large number of newspapers continued to publish. One reliable source put the
 number at more than 300. These include independent newspapers and newspapers
 with links to major and minor opposition parties. Government-run kiosks and inde-
 pendent news distributors distributed opposition and independent newspapers. Most
 independent newspapers, many of which operated with precarious finances, re-
 mained dependent on the Government for printing facilities.
 The Government tightly controlled most radio and television. Opposition parties
 had virtually no access to the official electronic media. The Government appointed
 a new director of state television who said that it was the duty of state television
 to implement the policies of the President. There is a limited range of private tele-
 vision stations, and some of them are accessible only to those local residents who
 own modern, foreign-produced television sets. Independent radio, the choice of the
 overwvhelming majority of listeners, is almost entirey entertainment oriented. Inde-
 pendent television and rdio broadcasters are reluctant to sir controversial political
 topics for fear of Government retaliation.
 An order from the Ministry of Justice in June ordered the closing of all independ-
 ent television stations pending the passage of a national law regulating independent
 television. The authorities closed three stations, pending receipt of applications for
 broadcast licenses. Authorities closed another station after it interviewed a leader
 of an oppsition party. Six independent television stations continue to operate in
 Ba and other regons. Broadcasts of several foreign television stations can be seen
 in Azerbaijan, anj-there are no restrictions on reception of foreign stations via sat-
 ellite.
 The Government did not pursue a case against those responsible for beating the
 head of an indep   nent TV station in Bam in 1995. There is no evidence that the
 individual filed a complaint with the police.
 Appointments to  overnment-cntrolled academic positions are heavily dependent
 on political cnnections. Nevertheless, several professors with tenureae active in
 opposition parties. There were no complaints of violation of academic freedom or of
 censorship of books or academic j ournals.
 b. Freedom of Peacefzd Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights; however, the Government restricts the right of peaceful assembly and
 association when it decides that is in its interest to do so. The Government per-
 mitted demonstrations on some occasions, but on others it restricted citizens' rights
 to assemble freely. Although the authorities allowed a demonstration by opposition
 political parties at a foreign embassy, thev denied permits for demonstrations in the
 capital on at least there occasions, and dispersed demonstrators by force when they
 attempted to gather. Security forces broke up two demonstrations near the Russian
 embassy pretesting the treatment of Azerbaijanis in Russia in July and August. In
 the Nrich    evan Autonomous Republic, the polics    te iz  te local headquarters of
 the opposition Azerbaijan Popular F ron Par
 The Government cited no clear criteria when it denied permission to assemble. Po-
 lice broke up a demonstration called by a former leader of an opposition party. Au-
 thorities evicted Azerbaijan Popular Front Deputy Chairman and Member of Par-
 liament Ali Kerimov from a hall in which he was addressing supporters in his elec-
 tral district. In the latter part of the year, opposition parties began active prepara-
 tions for mounting campaigns for the 1998 presidential elections. As of year's end,
 there had been no government effort to obstruct these activities.
 The Government requires political parties to register. There are over 40 registered
 political parties. Some of these are affiliated with or support the President's party.
 At least 10 registered parties are considered opposition parties. There are at least
 three opposition parties that the Government has refused to register.
 The Gove    ent generally allowed associations other than  political parties to
 function freely. However, the Ministry of Justice requires private organizations to
 register. It de hed or unduly delayed registration for numerous private voluntary or-
 ganizations, including one private human rights organization. Reports of harass-
 ment of political figures continued. Individuals and groups involved in human rights
 activities reported a mixed record-while the Ministry of Justice declared that the
 operation of uregistered human rights organizations might be illegal, the Ministry
 also worked with these groups on specific human rights issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-aThe Constitution provides for no state religion and allows
 people of all faiths to practice their religion without restrictions. The Government
 
 
 845
 
 respects this provision in practice for Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, Russian Orthodox
 Christians, and Jews. However, a new law on foreigners and stateless persons con-
 tains language which prohibits religious proselytizing by foreigners. In July Par-
 liament passed an amendment to the law on religion that subordinated all Islamic
 religious organizations to the Azerbaijan-based Directorate of Caucasus Muslims.
 This law permits the production, importation, and dissemination of religious lit-
 erature only with the agreement of local government authorities. The Ministry of
 Justice denied registration to a foreign Christian group, but has allowed it to con-
 tinue to function. Two non-Orthodox Christian groups were evicted from facilities
 in which they held religious services and prevented from renting other facilities, but
 both groups had found facilities and continued to operate by year's end. Non-Ortho-
 dox Christian groups have complained of official harassment. Numerous articles in
 Government and progovernment newspapers crudely depicted various religious
 groups including some non-Orthodox Christian groups as a threat to national iden-
 tity, traditions, and morals. Some opposition newspapers also attacked Christian
 missionary activity. Because of anti-Armenian sentiment and the forced departure
 of most of the Armenian population, Armenian churches remained closed. Azer-
 baijan's Jewish community has freedom to worship and conduct educational activi-
 ties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to choose freely their
 place of domicile and to travel abroad and return. Residents of border areas in both
 Azerbaijan and Iran travel across the border in this restricted zone without visas.
 The Government no longer tried to require foreigners to obtain visas to travel out-
 side of Baku. Foreigners and citizens require a visa to travel to the Autonomous Re-
 public of Nakhichevan.
 There continue to be bans on travel outside of Baku on some prominent political
 leaders who are under criminal investigation. However, two opposition leaders
 under such restrictions-Isa Gambar of the Musavat Party (charged with using mili-
 tary force in the context of a rebellion leading to the overthrow of the Elcibey gov-
 ernment in 1993); and All Kerimov of the Azerbaijan Popular Front (charged with
 concealing hand grenades in his pockets)-were permitted to travel outside of Azer-
 baijan.
 The Government officially recognizes freedom of emigration. Jewish emigration to
 Israel is unrestricted. However, with the majority of those who wish to emigrate al-
 ready having left, the number of Jewish emigrants is now small. The remaining Ar-
 menian population in Azerbaijan (other than Armenians residing in the Nagorno-
 Karabakh region of Azerbaijan) is approximately 10,000 to 20,000, mostly people of
 mixed descent or in mixed marriages. While official government policy is that Arme-
 nians are free to travel, low-level officials seeking bribes have harassed Armenians
 wishing to emigrate.
 There were no draft notifications that restricted movement this year. Draft-age
 men must obtain documents from military officials before they can leave for inter-
 national travel.
 The number of refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan is approximately
 780,000. Armenians have begun to settle in parts of the occupied territories. How-
 ever, the Armenians have not allowed the hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis
 who were forced out of the now-occupied territories to return to their homes. Most
 of these people continue to live in camps and other temporary shelters, often at
 below-subsistence levels, without adequate food, housing, education, or medical care.
 The parties to the conflict have cut normal trade and transportation links to the
 other side, causing severe hardship to civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and
 the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan.
 The Constitution provides for political asylum consistent with international
 norms. The Government is receptive to international assistance for refugees and in-
 ternally displaced persons. It cooperates with international organizations to provide
 aid for them. The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations
 in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 However, the Government ordered at least two Iraqis whose claims to refugee status
 were still under consideration by the UNHCR to leave the country, but did not act
 to expel or repatriate them to Iraq. They remained in the country at year's end.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In theory the election law and Constitution allow citizens to change their govern-
 ment by peaceful means. However, Government interference in elections restricted
 citizens' ability to change their government peacefully.
 The Government held the third round of runoff elections for the national Par-
 liament in February. It was flawed by many of the same irregularities that marked
 the fin-st and second rounds in 1995. The most serious irregularities involved re-
 ported turnouts much higher than those observed at the polls. A continuing problem
 was multiple voting, with one person voting for a group. Most often, male heads of
 household voted for entire families. Foreign observers noted a greater tendency for
 local election officials to inflate voter turnout than in the first election round in No-
 vember 1995. The Government attempted to hinder international monitoring of
 these elections by not inviting some foreign observers until the evening before the
 election.
 In this special election round, the Government made a major effort to prevent the
 election of opposition Musavat Party candidate Isa Gambar, who ran in a district
 in Sumgait. Gambar was able to campaign and hold speeches and rallies in
 Suingait, despite his being onfined to the city limits of Baku by court order aspart
 of an ongoing investigation. However, police seized the Sumgait headquarters of the
 Musavat Party the week before the election and detained several Musavat party
 workers. There were numerous reports of government officials urging local election
 officials to prevent a victory by the Msavat Party leader.
 A parliamentary by-election in July was flawed by multiple voting, failure to
 check voters identities, and a reported voter turnout (90 percent) far greater than
 election monitors observed. Election observers had access to polling stations. They
 were also able to observe the ballot counting process, which appared fair.
 As a result of the flawed 1995 parliamentary election, the New Azerbaijan Party
 led by President Aliyev and nominally independent deputies loyal to the President
 occupy the overwhelming majority of seats in the 125-member Parliament. Parties
 considering themselves part of the opposition hold only 9 seats. Opposition parties
 continued to be active outside the Parliament, agitating for their views in their
 newspapers and through public statements. However, the Government continued to
 deny registration to at least three opposition parties not represented in Parliament.
 Explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from participating
 in elections, including the February 1995 election. A candidate from the Talysh
 Party stood in the 1995 election as an independent.
 Parliamentary activity revealed the severe limits on the legislature's independ-
 ence from the executive. The President's New Azerbaijan Party mounted a public
 attack on the Speaker of Parliament (who had expressed views critical of the Gov-
 ernment) that resulted in his orchestrated ouster from office. A confrontation be-
 tween Parliament and the Government over the state budget showed that the Par-
 liament's powers to question government ministers are limited in practice. The Par-
 liament exercises little legislative initiative independent of the executive.
 The Constitution allows citizens to file court proceedings to challenge illegal ac-
 tions of government officials. However, citizens rarely make use of this prvision,
 preferring to appeal to higher levels of authority, up to and including the President.
 There are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics. However, tra-
 ditional social norms restrict women's roles in politics. Men continued to cast votes
 for their wives and other female members of their families, an abuse that was wide-
 ly noted in the Parliamentary runoff election held this year. There are 11 female
 members of Parliament and 2 women with ministerial rank.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of minorities in politics as individ-
 uals. However, explicitly ethnically or religiously based parties were prohibited from
 participating in the February election. Indigenous ethnic minorities such as Talysh
 and Lezghis occupy some senior government positions; the Deputy Minister of De-
 fense is Lezghi; the head of the Central Election Commission is Talysh.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations monitor the human rights situation in the
 country. The Government posed no objections to international human rights groups
 monitoring the situation. Some of these groups investigate human rights abuses and
 disseminate their findings through the media. Eighteen women's groups are active.
 The Government has demonstrated a willingness to discuss human rights prob-
 lems with international government and nongovernmental organizations. Ministry
 of Interior and Justice officials conducted discussions with a local nongovernmental
 organization, the Institute for Peace and Democracy, on human rights issues. The
 
 
 847
 Prosecutor General and large numbers of law enforcement personnel participated in
 a seminar in December discussing legal aspects of human rights in Azerbaijan orga-
 nized by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross conducted education programs on international
 humanitarian law for officials of the Ministries of Interior and Defense, and for uni-
 versity and secondary school students. Government officials participated in a
 UNHCR-organized training seminar in December aimed at reforming the Law on
 Refugees and Displaced Persons.
 The Ministry of Justice announced that several human rights groups were not
 registered and warned that their continued operation might be illegal. However, the
 Government has taken no action to halt their activities. A local nongovernmental
 organization monitored the activities of political parties and published a newsletter
 with statements by opposition party leaders critical of the Government and the po-
 litical system.
 The Government did not facilitate foreign monitoring of the February runoff elec-
 tions, but welcomed foreign embassy monitoring of the July parliamentay by-elec-
 tion and provided monitors with district-wide access. The ICRC has had access to
 prisners of war as well as civilians held in relation to the conflict over Nagorno-
 Karabk. However, the ICRC has requested and been denied access to prisoners
 not related to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict being held in special security prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights irrespective of gender, race, nationality
 or national origin, religion, language, social status, or membership in political par-
 ties, trade unions, or other public organizations. In the wake of the conflict over
 Nagorno-Karabakh, there are widespread anti-Armenian sentiments in society. Pre-
 venting discrimination is not a major government priority.
 Women.--Discussion of violence against women is a taboo subject in Azerbaijan's
 patriarchal society. In rural areas, women have no real recourse against violence by
 their husbands, regardless of the law. Rape is severely punishable, but, especially
 in rural areas, only a small fraction of offenses against women are reported or pros-
 ecuted. Police statistics note 72 cases of rape this year. These figures probably re-
 flect underreporting, especially from the conservative rural areas.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, including the right to par-
 ticipate in all aspects of economic and social life. In general women have extensive
 opportunities for education and work. However, traditional social norms continue to
 restrict women's roles in the economy. Representation of women is sharply lower in
 higher levels of the work force. There are few women in executive positions in lead-
 ing businesses.
 The Association for the Defense of Rights of Azerbaijani Women spends most of
 its time fighting uniquely post-Soviet problems. It has helped divorced women, wid-
 ows, and wives whose husbands are in prison, all of whom have become socially and
 legally vulnerable since the fall of the Soviet Union. It assisted widows whose land-
 lords rivatized their apartments and then evicted them. It also worked with di-
 vorced women who feel unfairly treated by divorce courts.
 Children.-The Constitution and laws commit the Government to protecting the
 rights of children to education and health. Difficult economic circumstances limit the
 Government's ability to carry out these commitments. Education is compulsory
 through the eleventh grade, that is, until age 17. The Constitution places children's
 rights on the same footing as adults. The Criminal Code prescribes severe penalties
 for crimes against children. The Government has authorized subsidies for children
 in an attempt to shield families against economic hardship in the wake of price lib-
 eralization. The subsidies do not come close to covering the shortfall in family budg-
 ets, and the Government does not have the financial means to meet its new commit-
 ments. There are a large number of refugee and displaced children living in sub-
 standard conditions in refugee camps and public buildings. Children beg on the
 streets of Baku and other towns.
 People With Disabilities.-The law on support for the disabled, enacted in late
 1993, prescribes priority for invalids and the disabled in obtaining housing, as well
 as discounts for public transport, and pension supplements. The Government does
 not have the means in its current itancial crisis to make good on its commitments.
 There are no special provisions in the law mandating accessibility to buildings for
 the disabled.
 National  Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-The outbreak of hostilities and anti-Arme-
 nian riots in the inal years of the Soviet Union led to the expulsion of many Arme-
 nians and the departure of others. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians still
 live in Azerbaijan, mostly in mixed Azerbaijani-Armenian families. Some have
 
 
 changed their nationality, as reported in their passports, to Azerbaijani. With the
 nearly complete departure of the Armenian population, the number of problems re-
 ported by this ethnic minority has decreased. Armenians have complained of dis-
 crimination in employment and harassment at schools and workplaces, and of re-
 fusal of local government authorities to grant Armenians passports or pay pensions.
 Armenian widows have had permits to live in Baku revoked. In July a State tele-
 vision news program accused by name a Baku Armenian family of making inflam-
 matory anti-Azerbaijani statements. However, some persons of mixed Armenian-Az-
 erbaijani descent continue to occupy government positions. In a speech in August,
 the President urged Azerbaijanis not to accuse or ehave negatively towards Arme-
 nians in mixed families.
 Indigenous ethnic minorities such as the Talysh, Lezghis, Avars, and Georgians
 do not suffer discrimination. However, Meskhetian Turks displaced from Central
 Asia as well as Kurdish displaced persons from the Lachin region complain of dis-
 crimination.
 In the area of the country controlled by insurgent (Armenian) forces, the Arme-
 nians forced about 500,000 ethnic Azerbaijanis to flee their homes. The regime that
 now controls these areas has effectively banned ethnic Azerbaijanis from all spheres
 of civil, political, and economic life.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Most labor unions still operate as they did under the
 Soviet system and remain tightly linked to the Government. The Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of association, including the right to form labor unions. However,
 one or another subbranch of the government-run Azerbaijani Labor Federation orga-
 nizes most industrial and white-collar workers. Most major industries remain state-
 owned. There is at least one independent labor union, the Independent Oil Workers
 Union, which voices the demands of oil workers. In September a group of oil work-
 ers, including some fired after a strike in April, foundedan independent association,
 the Committee to Defend the Rights of Azerbaijani Oil Workers. This organization
 operates outside established trade union structures.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and there are no legal restric-
 tions on strikes nor provisions for retribution against strikers. Oil workers con-
 ducted several short strikes demanding back pay amounting to several months' ar-
 rears. After at least one of these strikes, management fired several strike organiz-
 ers. Employers did not meet assurances to restore back pay. There are no estab-
 lished mechanisms to avoid such wildcat strikes.
 Unions are free to form federations and to affiliate with international bodies, how-
 ever, none has done so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is effectively no system
 of collective bargaining. Government-appointed boards and directors run the major
 enterprises and set wages. Unions do not participate in determining wage levels. In
 a carryover from the Soviet system, both management and workers are considered
 members of the professional unions.
 There are no export processing zones. Although there has been a United Nations
 Development Program-supported effort underway to create an economic zone in
 Sumgait since 1995, Parliament has not yet considered legislation to create such a
 zone.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution allows forced or
 compulsory labor only under states of emergency or martial law, or as the result
 of a court decision affecting a condemned person. The Government has not invoked
 this clause. Two departments in the General Prosecutors Office (the Department of
 Implementation of the Labor Code and the Department for Oversight Over Minors)
 enforce the prohibition on forced or compulsory labor. During the fall, there were
 widespread, but unconfirmed, reports that local government authorities in rural
 areas forced children, teachers, and other adults to harvest cotton without payment.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age is
 16 years. The law allows children of age 14 to work during vacations with the con-
 sent of their parents and certification of a physician. Children of age 15 may work
 if the workplam's labor union does not object. There is no explicit restriction on the
 kinds of labor that children of age 15 may perform with unon consent. The Labor
 Ministry has primary enforcement responsibility for child labor laws. With high
 adult unemployment, there have been few, if any, complaints of abuses of child
 labor laws. 7llowever, in the fall there were widespread, but unconfirmed, reports
 that some rural authorities forced children between the ages of 11 and 16 to harvest
 cotton without payment (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-The Government sets the nationwide adminis-
 trative minimum wage by decree. It is $1.30 (5,500 manat) per month. The wage
 
 
 849
 is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 recommended monthly wage level to meet basic subsistence needs was estimated to
 be $72 (310,000 manat). There seems to be no active mechanism to enforce the mini-
 mum wage. However, since most people who work earn more than the minimum
 wage, its low level is not a major issue in labor or political debate.
 The disruption of economic links with the rest of the former Soviet Union contin-
 ues to affect employment in many industries. Idle factory workers typically receive
 less than half of their former wage. Under these conditions, many workers rely on
 the safety net of the extended family. More workers and unemployed persons turn
 to second jobs and makeshift employment in the informal sector, such as operating
 the family car as a taxi, selling produce from private gardens, or operating small
 roadside shops. Combinations of these and other strategies are the only way for
 broad sectors of the urban population to reach the subsistence income level.
 The legal workweek is 41 hours. There is a 1-hour lunch break per day and short-
 er breaks in the morning and afternoon. The Government does not enforce these
 rules in the informal sector.
 Health and safety standards exist, but they are mostly ignored in the workplace.
 Workers cannot leave dangerous work conditions without fear of losing their jobs.
