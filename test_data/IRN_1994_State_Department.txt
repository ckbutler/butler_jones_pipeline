 IRAN*
 The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979 after a populist revolution
 top pled the monarchy. The Government is dominated by Shi'a Muslim clergymen
 andtheir lay allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the Leader of the Islamic Revolution
 and functions as the Chief of State. He is also the Commander-in-Chief of the
 Armed Forces. President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, first elected in a popular
 vote in 1989, was reelected in 1993. The Constitution, approved in 1980 by popular
 referendum and revised in 1989, provides for a 270-seat unicameral Islamic
 Consulative Assembly, or Majles. The Government seeks to ensure that public policy
 is consistent with its view of political and socioreligious values, but serious factional
 differences exist within the leadership. The Government reinforces its power by ar-
 rests, summary trials and executions, and various forms of intimidation.
 Several government agencies are responsible for internal security, including the
 Ministry of Intelligence and Security, the Ministry of Interior, and the Revolution-
 ary Guards, a military force established after the revolution which is coequal with
 the regular military. These organizations regularly commit such abuses such arbi-
 trary arrests and torture.
 *The United States does not have an embassy in Iran. Accordingly, it draws heavily on non-
 U.S. Government sources.

 Iran has a mixed economy. The Government owns the petroleum and utilities in-
 dustries and the banks. Oil exports are the primary source of foreign exchange. The
 economy is still recovering from the disruptions of the 1979 revolution and the de-
 struction from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran remains isolated from international financial
 markets. Economic performance is adversely affected by corruption and government
 mismanagement. Unemployment in 1994 was estimated at 30 percent, and the an-
 nual rate of inflation was about 50 percent.
 The Government continues to be a major abuser of human rights. There was no
 evidence of improvement in 1994. In March, the United Nations Commission on
 Human Rights (UNHCR) concluded that the Government's 'continuing" abuse of
 human rights justifies international scrutiny. The United Nations extended for an-
 other year the mandate of Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, its Special Representative on
 Human Rights in Iran. Systematic abuses include arbitrary arrests and detentions,
 widespread use of torture, lack of fair trials, summary executions, and repression
 of the freedoms of speech, press, and association.
 A prominent social critic and historian, Ali Akbar Saldi-Sirjani, died in detention
 in November, 10 months after his arrest on improbable criminal charges. The Gov-
 ernment claims Saidi-Srjani died of a heart attack but did not permit an independ-
 ent autopsy. The Government failed to provide adequate protection for three Evan-
 glical Christian leaders who were murdered in 1994. Women face legal and social
 discrimination, important worker rights are restricted, and the Government contin-
 ues to persecute the adherents of the Baha'i faith. There is a lively and open debate
 on political issues but the ruling clerics effectively control the electoral process,
 thereby denying the people the right to change their government. The Government
 conceals its abuses and obstructs the activities of human rights monitors.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Given the lack of basic procedural
 safeguards in political trials, most of the executions ordered in such cases amount
 to summary executions. The U.N. Special Representative on Human Rights in Iran
 has cited the Government's "extensive" use of the death penalty. Although the do-
 mestic press stopped reporting most executions in 1992, executions appear to con-
 tinue at a rate of several hundred a year. Exiles and human rights monitors report
 that many of those executed for alleged criminal offenses were actually political dis-
 sidents.
 On February 25, the Government executed Faizullah Makhubat, 78, a Jew who
 had been detained under harsh conditions for 22 months at Evin Prison in Tehran.
 A leading member of Iran's Jewish community, Makhubat was convicted of espio-
 nage and sabotage. After taking delivery of the body, Makhubat's family members
 discovered that the eyes had been gouged out, the teeth broken, and contusions and
 bruises covered the body
 In November, Ali Akbar Saidi-Shjani, a leading intellectual dissident, died in de-
 tention 8 months after his arrest on the improbable charges of drug trafficking and
 espionage. Authorities claimed the cause of death was a  eart attack, but members
 of Saidi-Sirjani's family maintain that he had no history of heart disease or drug
 problems. The Government did not allow an independent autopsy.
 A best selling author, Saidi-Siijani was a prominent advocate of abolishing censor-
 ship. He emphasized Iran's pre-Islamic tradition of respect for individual rights and
 of fighting tyranny. He was arrested on March 14 with journalist Niazi Kermani,
 reportedly because they had published a work questioning the principles of the 1979
 revolution. Iranian newspapers published their alleged confessions to crimes of
 moral turpitude.
 Five members of the outlawed Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran were reportedly
 executed in February at Diselabad Prison in Kermanshah for engaging in unspec-
 ified political activity. The victims, who were allegedly tortured prior to execution
 were: Hossein Sobhani, Rauf Mohammadi, Bahman Kosravi, Ghaderi Moradi, and
 Adel Abdollahi.
 Three Evangelical Christian ministers were murdered by unknown assailants.
 The Government had accused them of seeking converts among Muslims. The Rev.
 Mehdi Dibaj, a pastor of the Assemblies of God church, was arrested in 1993 and
 sentenced to death for apostasy. He was released from prison in January after his
 case received international publicity, but was abducted and murdered. His body was
 discovered on a Tehran street in July.
 The Rev. Haik Hovsepian-Mehr, who served as Chairman of the Council of Protes-
 tant Ministers and Secretary General of the Assemblies of God church, was ab-
 ducted in February and found dead a few days later. Prior to his murder, Rev.
 
 
 1078
 Hovsepian-Mehr reportedly refused to si  a declaration from the then Ministy of
 Islamic Guidance stating that Iranian Cistians enjoyed full constitutional rights.
 The Rev. Tateos Michaelian, the pastor of St. John Presbyterian Evangelical Church
 in Tehran, and acting chairman of the Council of Protestant Ministers (a position
 he assumed after the abduction of Rev. Hovsepian-Mehr) was abducted in June. Ac-
 cording to the Government, the Rev. Michaelian's body was discovered in July,
 stuffed into a large freezer, with bullet wounds in the throat and the back of the
 neck.
 In response to an inquiry from the U.N. Special Representative, the Government
 in October claimed that the ministers were murdered by operatives of the
 Mojahedin-e Khalq, an opposition group seeking the Governments overthrow. Al-
 though there is no evidence that the Government was involved in the killings, it
 bears responsibility for trying the Rev. Dibaj for apostasy and fostering an atmos-
 phere of religious intolerance.
 In February security forces reportedly killed a number of Sunni Muslims who
 staged a demonstration in the city of Zahedan to protest the Government's destruc-
 tion of a local mosque. In August a large spontaneous demonstration broke out in
 the city of Qazvin after the Msjles rejected a proposal to designate the city as a sep-
 arate province. The Government dispatched troops to quell the disturbance, which
 reportedly attracted up to 100,000 demonstrators. During their efforts to restore
 order, the troops reportedly killed dozens of demonstrators and wounded hundreds.
 The Government continued to assassinate political opponents abroad. On January
 4, a member of the Revolutionary Command of the Kurdish Democratic Party of
 Iran, Taha Kermani, was assassinated in Corum, Turkey. Prior to his murder, Mr.
 Kermani was designated a refugee by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR). On March 10, a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran was
 assassinated in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq. A member of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, Ahmad
 Sadi Lahijani, was assassinated in Ghalebeih, Iraq, on May 29. On June 24, a mem-
 ber of the Revolutionary Command of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, Osman
 Mohamad Amini, was murdered in his apartment in Copenhagen. On November 14,
 a monarchist opposition figure, Ali Mohammed Assadi, was stabbed to death in Bu-
 charest.
 Investigations of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism abroad continued in 1994. In
 December a court in France convicted three Iranians of the 1991 assassination of
 former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and his assistant, Katibeh Fallouch. De-
 fendants Ali Vakili Rad and Massoud Hendi were sentenced to life and 18 years,
 respectively. The prosecutor said the crime was organized from "within the heart
 of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
 In 1993 the Government of Switzerland requested the extradition from France of
 two Iranians indicted in the 1991 murder in Geneva of Karem Rajavi, the brother
 of the leader of the Mojahedin-e Khaq, Masud Rajavi. Instead, the French Govern-
 ment expelled the suspects to Iran on December 29, 1993. The two were among 13
 Iranians indicted by the Swiss Government for the murder, the other 11 were at
 large at the time of the indictments.
 The trial of Kazem Darabi, an Iranian citizen charged with murdering four Ira-
 nian Kurdish dissidents in Berlin in 1992 under instructions from the Iranian Gov-
 ernment, continued in Germany.
 b. Disappearance.-No reliable information is available on the number of dis-
 appearances in 1994. However, in 1994 the UNCHR conveyed to the Government
 in 1994 the names of 506 missing persons. In the period immediately following ar-
 rest, many detainees are held incommunicado, a situation that amounts to tem-
 porary disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicate that security forces continue to torture detainees and pris-
 oners. Common methods include suspension for long periods in contorted positions,
 burning with cigarettes, and most frequently, severe and repeated beatings with ca-
 bles or other instruments on the back and the soles of the feet. Reports of flogging,
 stoning, amputations, and public executions also are common.
 Some prisoners are held in solitary confinement or denied adequate rations or
 medical care to force confessions. Female prisoners have reportedly been raped or
 otherwise tortured while in detention. In the past, prison guards have intimidated
 the family members of detainees and have sometimes tortured detainees in their
 presence.
 A German engineer, Helmut Szimkus, was released from Evin prison in Tehran
 on July 1 after serving 5  years for alleged spying. Szimkus later told reporters
 that he was tortured in prison and claimed he had witnessed guards torture chil-
 iren in the presence of their parents to extract confessions from the adults.
 
 
 1079
 In September the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) issued a re-
 port on "unresolved humanitarian issues' from the Iran-Iraq war. The ICRC noted
 that the Government violated the Third Geneva Convention by failing to identify
 combatants killed in action and exchange information on those killed or missing. Ac-
 cording to the report, the fate of almost 19,000 Iraqi prisoners of war (POV's) in
 Iran 4remained unknown!" The report criticized the Government for obstructing
 ICRC efforts to register and repatriate POWs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, there is reportedly no legal time limit on incommunicado
 detention, nor any judicial means to determine the legality of detention. Suspects
 maybe held for questioning in jails or local Revolutionary Guard offices.
 The security forces often do not inform family members of a prisoner's welfare and
 whereabouts. If known, the prisoner still may be denied visits by family and legal
 counsel. In addition, families of executed prisoners do not always receive notification
 of the prisoner's death. The family of Bahman Samandir, a Baha'i executed by the
 Government in 1992, has still been unable to recover his body.
 In August security forces arrested some 3,000 persons in Qazvin, after army
 troops had quelled disturbances in that city (see Section l.a.). Credible reports indi-
 cated that many of the detainees were released only after they signed a false confes-
 sion indicating they were members of the Mojahedin-e Khalq.
 Adherents of the Baha'i faith continue to face arbitrary arrest and detention. One
 Baha'i, Ramazan All Zolfaqari, was convicted of apostasy, imprisoned, and released
 on Janury 6. His conviction is atill in effect. As of August. about eight Baha'is were
 imprisoned because of their beliefs. The Government appe  to adhere to a practice
 of detaining a small number of Baa'is at any time. Two Jews are believedtobe
 in prison because of their religion, and a Christian leader named Beni Paul is also
 reportedly in detention.
 e. Denial  Fair Public Tria!.-Iran has two court systems: the traditional court
 system, which adjudicates civil and criminal offenses; and the Islamic Revolutionary
 Courts, which were established in 1979 to try "political offenses, narcotics crimes,
 and "crimes against God." Many aspects of the prerevolutionary udicial system sur-
 viv e      civil and criminal courts. For example, defendants have the right to a
 public trial, may choose their own lawyer, and have the right of appeal. Trials are
 adjudicated by panels of judges. There is no jury system. In the absence of post-
 revolution laws, the Government advises judges to base their decisions on Islamic
 law. Moreover, these courts are not fully independent. The revolutionary courts may
 consider cases normally in the jurisdiction othe civil and criminal courts and also
 may overturn their decisions. Assignment of cases to either system of courts appears
 to be ha phazard. The Supreme Court has limited authority to review cases.
 Defendants tried in the revolutionary courts are not granted fair trials. These de-
 fendants are often held in prolonged pretrial detention without access to attorneys,
 and their attorneys are rarely afrded sufficient time to prepare their defense. De-
 fendants are often indicted for such vague offenses as "moral corruption,"
 "antirevolutionary behavior," and "siding with global arrogance." Defendants do not
 have the right to confront their accusers or the right to appeal. Summary trials of
 5 minutes are common and some trials are conducted in secret. Others are show
 trials intended to highlight a coerced public confession. Two highly publicized show
 trials occurred in 1994: one for a person accused of bombing a religious shrine in
 Mashhad; the other for a person accused of bmbing Ayatllah Khomeini's tomb
 near Tehran. The Government accused the charged individuals with membership in
 the Mojahedin-e Khakq. Rather than conduct a genuine investigation into the bomb-
 ings, the Government linked them to the murders of the Evangelical Christian cler-
 ics (see Section 1.a) and characterized all of these events as a Mojahedin plot.
 in August the Majles approved a law reorganizing the court system. Among its
 prvisions, the law authorizes judges to act as prosecutor and judge in the same
 case. The rights of defendantsare further erdeidby the fact that many judges re-
 tired after the revolution, and others were disbarred fur ideological reasons. The
 Government has replaced them with judges who are regarded as politically accept-
 able to the regime.
 There are no available estimates on the number of political prisoners. However,
 the Government often arrests persons on trumpedup criminal charges when their
 actual offenses' are political. In October the U.N. Special Representative issued a
 report which noted that he had requested the Government to provide information
 on 78 reported political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrhe oterfrence with Privacsy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.- The
 Constitution states that "reputation, life, property, (and) dweling(s)' are protected
 from trespass except as "provided by law."However, security forces enter homes and
 offices, monitor telephonetonversations, and open mail without court authorization.
 
 
 1080
 The wife of writer Saidi-Sijani reported that, after her husband's arrest in March,
 the Anti-Vice Department of the Revolutionary Prosecutor's office raided her home,
 seized her husband's papers, and sealed the library (see Section L.a.).
 Paramilitary volunteer forces known as the Basiji and other security forces mon-
 itor the social activities of citizens. Such organizations may harass or arrest women
 whose clothing does not cover the hair and all of the body except hands and face,
 or those who wear makeup. Enforcement of such standards of public morality varies
 with the political climate and the jurisdiction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of the
 press, except when published ideas are "contrary to Islamic principles, or are det-
 rimental to public rights." In practice, the Government controls most publications.
 Newspapers are generally associated with various factions in the Government. They
 reflect different views and criticize the Government but are prohibited from criticiz-
 ing the concept of the Islamic Republic or promoting the rights of ethnic minorities.
 The Government may harass or shut down independent publishing houses that
 are overly critical of public policy. Nonetheless, some independent publishers out of
 favor with the Government continue to survive. In October a bimonthly newspaper,
 Asr-e Ma (Our Era), was launched by a former government minister. It has called
 for the establishment of political parties.
 Those whose comments offend the Government risk arrest and summary punish-
 ment. In 1994 Azizollah Amir Rahimi, a former general, distributed open letters and
 gave interviews to the foreign media in which he called on President Rafsanjani to
 step down and organize free elections. Rahimi and his son were reportedly detained
 on November 1 for his comments. No information on the status of their cases was
 available at year's end.
 In October 134 prominent writers distributed an open letter protesting excessive
 official censorship. In response, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati delivered a sermon on No-
 vember 11 in which he warned that Muslims might take some unspecified "action"
 against the writers. The semiofficial Tehran Times cautioned against freedom of
 speech, editorializing that such freedom does not permit publication of "unsocial, im-
 moral and seditious articles."
 The Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance ensures that books do not contain
 offensive material prior to publication. It inspects foreign printed materials prior to
 their release on the market. However, some books and pamphlets critical of the Gov-
 ernment are published without reprisal.
 In March the Government reaffirmed as binding and irrevocable the 1989 reli-
 gious decree condemning to death British author Salman Rushdie for his book, "The
 Satanic Verses." The Government considers the book blasphemous. It made no pub-
 lic move to repudiate its promise of a cash award to any person who kills Rushdie.
 The Government owns all broadcasting facilities, and their programming reflects
 its political and socioreligious ideology. In June officials reportedly seized r,995 sat-
 ellite receiving dishes and videotapes in the port of Bandar Abbas. The Majles
 passed a law in January 1995 banning the import and distribution of satellite
 dishes and calling for the removal of existing satellite dishes. But the law had been
 declared unconstitutional by the Council of Guardians at press time, so its enforce-
 ment is uncertain.
 Academic censorship persists, even though restrictions on academic freedom have
 eased since the immediate postrevolutionary period. However, in May Supreme
 Leader Khamenei said in a speech at the Islamic Open University that the univer-
 sity's atmosphere "must be protected from the penetration of poisonous and anti-Is-
 lamic thoughts" and that the university's administration "is justified in preventing
 the expression of any remarks against Islamic and revolutionary values."
 Government informers are said to be common on university campuses and mon-
 itor classroom material. Admission to universities is politicized; all applicants must
 pass "character tests" in which officials screen out applicants critical of the Govern-
 ment's ideology. To achieve tenure, professors reportedly must cooperate with gov-
 ernment authorities over a period of years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution permits as-
 semblies and marches "prvided they d not violate the principles of Islam." Numer-
 ous unplanned demonstrations occurred throughout Iran in 1994 (see Section L.a.).
 The Constitution also provides for the establishment of political parties, profes-
 sional associations, and religious groups provided they do not violate the principles
 of "freedm, sovereignty, (and) national unity" or question Islam or the Islamic Re-
 public. In practice, most independent organizations are banned, co-opted by the Gov-
 ernment, or moribund.
 
 
 1081
 In February the Ministry of Interior granted licenses to some 80 political and pro-
 fessional organizations out of an estimated 400 applications. No major opposition
 faction was evident aneng the licensed group. Authorities continue to monitor the
 activities of the Freedom Movement, a political group founded in 1961 and declared
 illegal in 1991.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution declares that the official religion of
 Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari Shi'ism." It also states that 'other Is-
 lamic denominations shall enoy complete respect." Religion is almost inseparable
 from government. The President and many top officials, including the Speaker of
 the Parliament and many parliamentary deputies, are mullahs (Is amic clergymen).
 Approximately 90 percent of the population are Shi'a Muslims. Aside from-slightly
 over 1 percent who are not Musims, the rest of the population are Sunni Muslims
 who include Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans, Baluchis, and other ethnic minorities.
 The Constitution recognizes Christianity, Judaism, and Zoreastrianism. Membe
 of these religions elect representatives to reserved Parliamentary seats. They are
 free to practice their religion and instruct their children, but the Government inter-
 feres with the administration of their schools. Harassment by government officials
 is common (See Section 5).
 Non-Muslims may not proselytize Muslims. Three Evangelical Christian ministers
 were killed in 1994. One, who had converted to Christiamty in 1983, had been sen-
 tenced to death for apostasy in December 1993 and released in response to an inter-
 national appeal (see Section l.a.).
 The Government regards the Baha'i community, the largest non-Muslim minority
 with 300,000 to 350,000 members, as a 'migided sect."t prohibits Baha'is from
 teaching their faith and maintaining links with coreligionists abroad.
 In October 1993, the Majles approved legislation that prohibits government work-
 ers from membership in gups that deny the "divine religions." The Government
 uses such terminology to describe members of the Baha'i faith. The law also stipu-
 lates penalties for government workers who do not observe 'Islamic principles and
 rules.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens may travel to any part of Iran, although there have been trav-
 el restrictions to Kurdish areas during times of heavy fighting. People may change
 their place of residence without obtaining official permission. The overnment re-
 quires exit permits for draft-age males and citizens who are politically suspect.
 Some Iranians, particularly those whose skills are in short supply and who were
 educated at government expense, must post bonds to obtain exit permits.
 The Government permits Iranian Jews to travel abroad, but often denies them the
 multiple-exit permits normally issued to other citizens. The Government does not
 nor    y permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at the same time.
 The Government and the UNHCR estimate that there were approximately 1.7
 million Afghan refugees in Iran in late 1994. The majority have been integrated into
 local society. Others live seminomadic lives or reside in government settlements.
 The UNHCR repatriated more than 110,000 refugees to Afghanistan in 1994 and
 is supervising the repatriation of many more. Tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish
 and Shi'a Muslim refugees, displaced by the aftermath of the Gulf War, remained
 in Iran in 1994. The Government of Iran provided assistance to these refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay associates who share
 a belief in the legitimacy of a theocratic state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's inter-
 pretation of Shra Islam. There is no separation of state and religion. The clerics
 dominate all branches of government completely. The Government represses any
 movement seeking to separate state and religion, or to alter the State's existing the-
 ocratic foundation. The selection of candidates is effectively controlled by the ruling
 clerics, consequently depriving citizens of the right to change their government.
 Regularly scheduled elections are held for the President, members of Parliament
 (the Majles), and members of the Assembly of Experts, a body responsible for select-
 ing the successor to the Leader of the Revolution. The MaJles exercises a consider-
 able amount of independence from the executive branch, but its decisions are re-
 viewed by the Council of Guardians (see below). Vigorous parliamentary debates
 take place on various issues, and in some cases the Majles has defeated laws pro-
 posedrby the executive branch. Most deputies are associated with powerful political
 and religious officials, but often vote independently and shift from one faction to an-
 other.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed of six Islamic cler-
 gymen, and six lay members who review all laws for consistency with Islamic law
 
 
 1082
 and the Constitution. The Council also screens political candidates for ideological
 and religious suitability. It accepts only candidates who support a theocratic state,
 but clerics who disagree with government policies have also been disqualified.
 Women are under represented in government. They hold 9 out of 270 Majles
 seats, and there are no female Cabinet members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government represses local human rights groups and in general is unco-
 operative with forei  goups. The Government continued to refuse in 1994 the re-
 peated requests b   e   N. Special Representative to visit Iran.
 In November 1994, the Government hosted a German-Iranian Human Rights
 Seminar in Tehran. It permitted the German participants to visit a prison in
 Esfahan, and permitted a second visit by journalists to Evin prison in Tehran. The
 Government also has established a human rights committee in the Majls and a
 human rights commission in the judiciary, but observers believe they lack independ-
 ence. Government officials state repeatedly that Iran should be judged by Islamic,
 rather than Western, human rights principles.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Discrimination against women has increased since the revolution. On
 January 31, Mina Kalout was reportedly stoned to death in Evin Prison. Kalout, a
 married woman, was accused of committing adultery with her cousin, Abdol-Hus-
 sein, who was executed for the offense. On February 22, Homa Darabi, a pediatri-
 cian, reportedly immolated herself to protest the Government's discriminatory poli-
 cies. Prior to her death, Darabi had been dismissed from an academic position for
 failing to adhere strictly to the Islamic dress code. On March 2, Tahereh Ghan'e
 a married woman with children, was reportedly stoned to death in Qom for alleged
 adultery. On May 5, a female student of medicine and women's activist at Beheshti
 University was found strangled to death. Her arm had been broken, as well. Al-
 though the Government claimed the student had committed suicide, 1,000 female
 students staged a sit-in on May 9 to protest what they believed to be her murder.
 Although domestic violence is known to occur, little is known about its extent.
 Abuse in the family is considered a private matter and seldom discussed publicly.
 There are no official statistics on the subject.
 In general, women suffer discrimination in the legal code, particularly in family
 and property matters. It is difficult for many women, particularly those residing out-
 side large cities, to obtain any legal redress. Although women may be educated and
 employed in the professions, social constraints tend to inhibit their educational and
 economic opportunities. Illiteracy and the lack of university degrees also affect their
 standing. The enforcement of conservative Islamic dress codes has varied consider-
 ably since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989. Nonetheless, such dress codes
 persist and are enforced arbitrarily.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to divorce, and regula-
 tions promulgated in 1984 substantially broadened the grounds on which a woman
 may seek a divorce. However, a husband is not required to cite a reason for divorc-
 ing his wife. In 1986 the Majles passed a 12-article law on marriage and divorce
 that limited the privileges accorded to men by custom and traditional interpreta-
 tions of Islamic law. The 1986 law also recognized divorced women's rights to a
 share of the property couples acquire during their marriage and increased alimony
 rights.
 We Government's views on women's rights were exemplified in 1994 by an open
 letter to the U.N. Special Representative from the President's Special Advisor on
 Women's Affairs, Shailia Habibi. In the letter, Habibi explained that legal restric-
 tions on a women's freedom to travel-a woman needs permission from a close male
 relative to obtain a passport-are consensual" because such restrictions "are de-
 signed to preserve the unity and sanctity of the family." She also accused "Western
 emancipation" of causing "corruption, prostitution, Lesbianism, and widespread ve-
 neral disease.*
 Children.-There is no known pattern of child abuse.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Kurds seek greater autonomy and con-
 tinue to suffer government prosecution. In August the Government reportedly razed
 17 Kurdish villages.
 Religious Minorities.-The Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination, particularly in the
 areas of employment, education, and public accommodations. Muslims who convert
 to Christianity also suffer discrimination.
 
 
 1083
 University applicants are required to pass an examination in Islamic theology. Al-
 though pub ic-school students receive instruction in Islam, this requirement limits
 access of most religious minorities to higher education. Applicants for public-sector
 employment are similarly screened for their adherence to Islam.
 Religious minorities suffer discrimination in the legal system, receiving lower
 awards in injury and death lawsuits, and incurring heavier punishments than Mus-
 lims. Sunni Muslims encounter religious discrimination at the local level.
 In 1993 the U.N. Special Representative reported the existence of a government
 policy directive on the Baha'is. According to the directive the Supreme Revoluton-
 ary Council reportedly instructed government aencies to block the progress and de-
 velopment of the Baha'i community, expel Bahai students from universities; cut the
 Baha'is' links with groups outside Iran; restrict the employment of Baha'is; and
 deny Baha'is "positions of influence " including those in education. The Government
 claims the directive is a forgery. Hlowever, it appears to be an accurate reflection
 of current government practice.
 The persecution of Baha'is persisted unevenly in 1994. The Government continued
 to return some property previously confiscated from individual Baha'is, although the
 amount returned is a fraction of the total seized. Property belonging to the Bahai
 community as a whole, such as places of worship, remains confiscated. Other gov-
 ernment restrictions have been eased, so that Baha is may currently obtain food ra-
 tion booklets and send their children to public schools. However, the prohibition
 against the admission of Baha'is to universities appears to be enforced. Thousands
 of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs in the early 1980's receive no unemploy-
 ment benefits and have been required to repay the Government for salaries or pen-
 sions received from the first day of employment. Those unable to do so face prison
 sentences.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no available information regarding whether
 the Government has legislated or otherwise mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Labor Code grants workers the right
 to establish unions, there are no independent unions. A national organization known
 as the Worker's House, founded in 1982, is the sole authorized national labor orga-
 nization. It serves primarily as a conduit for government control. The leadership of
 the Worker's House coordinates activities with Islamic labor councils which are or-
 ganized in many enterprises. These councils also function as instruments of govern-
 ment control, although they have frequently been able to block layoffs and dismis-
 sals. Moreover, a network of government-backed guilds issues vocational licenses,
 funds financial cooperatives, and helps workers find jobs.
 The Government does not tolerate any strike deemed to be at odds with its eco-
 nomic and labor policies. In 1993 the Parliament passed a law which prohibits
 strikes by government workers. It also prohibits government workers from having
 contacts with foreigners and stipulates penalties for failure to observe Islamic dress
 codes and principles at work.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize independently and negotiate collective bargaining agreements. It
 is not known whether labor legislation and practice in the export processing zones
 differ from the law and practice in the rest of the country. No information is avail-
 able on mechanisms used to set wages.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Section 273 of the Penal Code pro-
 vides that the Government may require any person who does not have work to take
 suitable employment. This provision has been criticized frequently by the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) as contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The labor law prohibits employ-
 ment of minors under 15 years of age and places special restrictions on the employ-
 ment of minors under 18. Education is compulsory until age 11. The law exempts
 workers in agriculture, domestic service, and some small businesses. By law women
 and minors may not be employed in hard labor or, in general, night work. informa-
 tion on the extent to which these regulations are enforced is not available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code empowers the Supreme Labor
 Council to establish annual minimum wage levels for each industrial sector and re-
 gion. It is not known if the minimum wages are adjusted annually or enforced. The
 L   r Code stipulates that the minimum wage should be sufficient to meet the liv-
 ing expenses of a family and should take inflation into account. Information on the
 share of the working population covered by the minimum wage legislation is not
 available.

 The Labor Code establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum, with one
 weekly rest day, normally Fridays, and at least 12 leave days of paid annual leave
 and several paid public holidays.
 According to the Labor Code, a Supreme Safety Council, chaired by the Labor
 Minister or his representative, is responsible for promoting workplace safety and
 health. The Council has reportedly issued 28 safety directives and oversees the ac-
 tivities of 3,000 safety committees established in enterprises employing more than
 10 persons. It is not known how well the ministry's inspectors enforce regulations.
