 CANADA
 The Canadian record in protection of human rights is one
 of the finest in the world and a source of considerable
 pride for most Canadians. The government and the vast
 majority of Canadians are anxious to guard against viola-
 tion of civil rights and injustices. Parliament, press,
 and public opinion are quick to react when it appears there
 has been a real or imagined infringement of human rights
 in Canada.
 Canadians are outspokenly critical of other nations where
 human rights may be violated, and the Canadian Government
 reflects this viewpoint. Canada is a staunch supporter
 of UN resolutions and declarations concerning human rights
 and has willingly accepted large numbers of persons from
 nations whose reputation for human rights is less well
 established.

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Canada has well-developed and extensive social welfare,
 health care, and education programs, both on the federal
 and local level.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within the country, foreign
 travel and emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government. The democratic tradition is very strong
 in Canada, elections are orderly and governments stable.
 French Canadians have complained from time to time that
 they are discriminated against in Canada. There have been
 problems in ensuring fully equal political and economic
 opportunities throughout Canada for the cultural and
 linguistic minority of Francophone Canadians, but the
 Canadian government is deeply committed to this principle
 and places high priority on seeing that it is carried out.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Canada's human rights performance is sufficiently good
 that to our knowledge there have been no outside requests
 for investigations.
