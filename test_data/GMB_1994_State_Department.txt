 THE GAMBIA
 On July 22, the Gambia National Army (GNA) deposed by coup d'etat the demo-
 cratically elected Government and dismissed the democratically elected Parliament.
 The four GNA lieutenants who planned and led the coup proclaimed themselves the
 Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) under the chairmanship of Lt.
 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, who also became Head of State.

 The GNA and the police report to the Ministers of Defense and Interior. The re-
 gme integrated the *lic's tactical support group (former gendarmerie) into the
 91. It reassigned, fired, summarily retired, or detained nearly all senior security
 officials after it took power and arrested and detained senior government officials
 and members of the press. It held detainees incommunicado and did not acknowl-
 edge their detentions.
 The Gambia's population of just over 1 million consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by reexporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, had begun to flourish, but has been in steep decline since the July 22 coup.
 The elected Government of Sir Dawda Jawara respected and protected human
 rights. The coup leaders committed widespread and repeated human rights abuses.
 The AFPRC detained armed forces and police personnel without charge; abolished
 politicalparties, political activities, and political publications; intimidated the press;
 dissolved local governments; and revoked rights to travel and transfer funds or as-
 sets for senior officials of the Jawara Government. It declared its decrees exempt
 from legal challenge, and, as noted above, ordered the arbitrary arrest, firing, and
 retirement of government officials and civil service employees loyal to the elected
 Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-An undetermined number of GNA
 soldiers died during and following an attempted countercoup on November 11. An
 AFPRC spokesman announced an estimated 16 total deaths during the attempt, but
 specifically named as dead only the 3 purported ringleaders. While it was widely
 rumored that authorities summarily executed many disident soldiers, the spokes-
 man denied that executions had been carried out. However, the military leadership
 did not provide a full accounting of casualties or information on the disposition of
 remains. In another incident in October, a soldier killed an apparent curfew violator
 under circumstances that remain unclear. The soldier believed involved was de-
 tained but remains unidentified.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While the AFPRC did not suspend that part of the Constitution that prohibits tor-
 ture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment, it ignored these provisions
 in regard to former ministers and miitary and police detainees.
 Credible reporting indicates that three military and police detainees were beaten
 unconscious at Mile 2 Prison in the presence of four members of the AFPRC in early
 September.
 The regime held former ministers of the Jawara Government under house arrest
 for 2 months after the coup, subjected them to lengthy interrogation, and then con-
 fined them at Mile 2 Prison or the National Intelligence Agency (the former Na-
 tional Security Service) headquarters for up to severa a. It released former min-
 isters from house arrest in September, but rearrested and detained 10 former min-
 isters in early November. Police physically mistreated one former minister after ar-
 resting him.
 Prison conditions were austere but improving before the July 22 coup. While no
 deaths in prison were reported during the year, no other information was available
 on postcoup conditions for the general prison populations at Mile 2 Prison and two
 other confinement facilities. The AFPRC assigned military guards to augment the
 corrections staff at Mile 2 Prison following the coup, and there were credible reports
 of malnourishment, illness, and beatings of military and security detainees. Women
 are not targeted for abuse while in custody.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was able to visit 32 detain-
 ees in two places of detention. Most of the detainees are soldiers and police arrested
 immediately after the July 22 coup. Others are members of the military seized after
 the abortive putsch of November 11.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Before the July coup, there were well-
 developed constitutional and legal procedures governing arrest, detention, and trial.
 After the coup, the regime frequently and arbitrarily arrested military and police
 personnel, civil servants, parastatal staff, and media representatives. An AFPRC de-
 cree authorizes detention of military or police officers for 6 months without charge.
 The same decree permits indefinite detention after review by a special tribunal. Fol-
 lowing the coup, the authorities acknowledged that they held approximately 30 mili-
 tary and police detainees, although the total number is believedt be higer. They
 released 16 detainees in November, but did not release or bring to trial the remain-
 
 
 97
 ing military and police detainees. The regime subjected prominent civilians in and
 out of government to lengthy surprise interrogations in uncomfortable cir-
 cumstances, often lasting overnight, and detained some officials for extended peri-
 ods.
 The authorities generally did not permit families reporter., or other private citi-
 zens to visit military and police detainees. They did occasionally permit exceptional
 visits by detainees' wives after direct petitions to the vice chairman of the A_-RC.
 In the aftermath of the November 11 counter-coup attempt, the AFPRC ordered
 new arrests and detentions. In December, it acknowledged holding 32 detainees, in-
 cluding 16 GNA and police personnel remaining in detention from the July 22 coup,
 13 persons detained after the November 11 attempted countercoup, and 3 others de-
 tained for crimes they were alleged to have committed while impersonating GNA
 officers.
 The AFPRC has not resorted to exiling opponents. However, three senior officials
 of the former government-President Jawara, Vice President Sabally and Secretary
 General Janha-remain outside The Gambia under explicit threat of arrest and de-
 tention if they return. Other officials who were outside the country at the time of
 the coup are at similar risk.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The AFPRC claimed that judicial provisions of the
 Constitution remained in effect, but it exempted its own decrees from court chal-
 lenge and flagrantly ignored due process rights with respect to arrest, detention,
 and trial. A tribunal consisting of a lawyer, a police officer, and a private citizen
 were, at year's end, reviewing cases of military detainees. However, tribunal action
 is advisory only, and the AFPRC may order indefinite detention of military and po-
 lice officers following the tribunal's review.
 The AFPRC appointed commissions to investigate individuals suspected of corrup-
 tion. These commissions have powers similar to a grand jury, including authority
 to imprison and fine for contempt, and to imprison or demand bond from individuals
 considered likely to abscond. Although modalities are not yet clear, findings of the
 commission are intended to lead to prosecution of appropriate cases in civil court.
 Although the Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, the courts tradi-
 tionally were responsive to executive branch pressure. The courts' slow prosecution
 of debt recovery cases under the Assets Management and Recovery Corporation Act
 was cited by the AFPRC as evidence of corruption under the Jawara Government.
 Cases of interest to the AFPRC moved quickly following the coup whereas AFPRC
 intervention impeded prosecution of two cases involving individuals in the AFPRC's
 favor.
 The judicial system remains structurally intact and recognizes customary, Shari'a,
 and general law. Customary law covers marriage and divorce for non-Muslims in-
 heritance, land tenure, tribal and clan leadership, and all other traditional and so-
 cial relations. Shari'a law is observed primarily in Muslim marriage and divorce
 matters. General law, following the English medel, applies to felonies, misdemean-
 ors in urban areas, and the formal business sector. Trials are public, and defendants
 have the right to an attorney at their own cost.
 Most prisoners detained under the AFPRC's anticorruption campaign or for secu-
 rity reasons are political prisoners. Along with the military and police personnel in
 long-term detention, authorities detained up to 30 additional persons for shorter pe-
 riods, usually 4 days or less.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though constitutional safeguards against arbitrary search remain in place, AFPRC
 priorities in security matters and corruption investigations override these safe-
 guards. Police seized private documents and property without due process and
 placed armed guards at homes and other properties suspected of having been ac-
 quired with embezzled or misappropriated funds. The AFPRC froze accounts of per-
 sons under suspicion and prohibited by decree the transfer of their property. It de-
 nied persons under house arrest access to international telephone service. Police
 must generally have court orders to conduct searches related to crimes unless the
 individual concerned agrees or it is deemed to involve an urgent matter of national
 interest. The Government has not generally intruded in family matters, and this
 has remained true under the AFPRC. Security officials are believed to monitor tele-
 phone communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The AFPRC significantly restricted these free-
 doms. An AFPRC decree prohibits political activities of all kinds, including posses-
 sion and distribution of political literature or engaging in political discourse by any
 other means. Two senior staff of the People's Democratic Organization for Demec-
 racy, Independence, and Socialism (PDOIS) were convicted of political activities and
 
 
 98
 posession of the party's newspaper, Foroyaa (Freedom), following promulgation of
 th decree. The two defendants were required to pay court costs and placed on pro-
 bation for the life of the decree. Conditions of probation included adherence to the
 decree and avoidance of activity that would be deleterious to public order. If a pro-
 bationer violates these conditions, authorities impose a prison sentence of 3 years.
 The AFPRC used summary arrest, interrogation, detention, beating, and deporta-
 tion to intimidate and silence journalists who published articles deemed inaccurate
 or sensitive. Banjul Daily Observer editor and publisher Kenneth Y. Best, a Libe-
 rian national, was deported on October 30 following a series of interrogations and
 detentions prompted by news stories the AFPRC considered excessively critical. All
 Gambian newspapers exercised self-censorship. English, French, and other foreign
 newspapers and magazines are available.
 There is no television in The Gambia, although the country receives Senegalese
 broadcasts. Private consumers also use satellite systems but these remain rare. The
 one government and two private radio stations normally did not reach listeners in
 the eastern part of the country. Private radio stations simulcast news provided by
 Radio Gambia, the government station. Senegalese and international radio broad-
 casts attract wide audiences. There is no university in The Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The AFPRC decree bans politi-
 cal meetings of any kind and political organizations. Other kinds of assembly are
 open to the public require police permits. Prior to the coup, police routinely granted
 permits.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all faiths are free to worship without gov-
 ernment restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Fre dom of movement for ordinary citizens remained unimpeded, but
 the authorities prohibited those under investigation for corruption or security
 charges from leaving the country.
 The Gambia continues to host approximately 2,000 Senegalese refugees, and the
 AFPRC continued to work with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR), the Gambian Red Cross, and other organizations in dealing
 with refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government through peaceful
 means. The AFPRC exercises total power. The first decree issued by the AFPRC
 suspended legislative and executive sections of the Constitution, including provi-
 sions for Parliament and elections. AFPRC Chairman Jammeh repeatedly stated
 that Western democracy is inappropriate for The Gambia. Four ministers of the 13
 in the AFPRC Executive Councd(cabinet) are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The AFPRC indicated that international human rights concerns are not appro-
 priate for those suspected of corruption or involvement in subversion, since they are
 considered criminals. However, the AFPRC granted the ICRC unsupervised access
 to military and police detainees for one visit in November. Human rights advocates,
 including representatives of the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights
 Studies and the International Commission of Jurists, attempted to open a dialog but
 were largely ignored by the AFPRC.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There is no officially sanctioned discrimination based on race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status.
 Women.-Although four women were appointed to the Executive Council women
 face extensive discrimination in education and employment. AFPRC chairman
 Jammeh criticized women's rights advocates, asserting that their advocacy promoted
 divisiveness.
 Females constitute about one-third of primary school students and roughly one-
 fourth of the high school enrollment. Employment in the formal sector is open to
 women at the same salary rates as men. No statutory discrimination exists in other
 kinds of employment, although women are generally employed in endeavors such as
 food vending or subsistence farming. Shari a law is usually applied in divorce and
 inheritance matters. Marriages are usually arranged, and polygyny is practiced.
 Women normally receive a lower proportion of assets distributed throug inherit-
 ance than male relatives.
 
 
 Domestic violence, including spouse abuse, is occasionally reported but is not com-
 mon. Police respond when cases are reported, and prosecute offenders if citizens file
 complaints. The media report on cases under trial.
 Children.-The care and welfare of children is considered primarily a family re-
 sponsibility. Authorities intervene when cases of abuse or maltreatment are brought
 to their attention.
 The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) is widespread and entrenched.
 Up to 60 percent of females may have undergone this procedure in early youth. Al-
 though found by health experts to be both physically and psychologically damaging,
 rural women strongly support the practice. In 1993 village women drove a promi-
 nent female FGM opponent from an upcountry village for speaking against the cus-
 tom. The AFPRC has yet to take a position on FGM.
 Young male children in the care of Koranic teachers have elicited significant con-
 cern. These children, known as Almudos, are put in the care of Koranic scholars for
 a period of Koranic education. Almudos are expected to beg for their food and cloth-
 in  as well as to support their teachers. The Ministry of ealth and Social Welfare
 published a report on Almudos and other street children in June. The report details
 hardships experienced by Almudos and recommends: legislation to reglate Koranic
 education, including a ban on placement of children with traditional teachers; re-
 gional cooperation to deal with the practice; and establishment of health and nutri-
 tional services for Almudos and other street children. The AFPRC has not reacted
 to the report.
 People With Disabiities.-There are no statutes or regulations requiring acces-
 sibility for the handicapped.
 No legal discrimination against the physically disabled exists in employment, edu-
 cation, or other state services. Most severely handicapped individuals subsist
 throughprlvate charity.iLess severely handicapped persons are fully accepted in so-
 ciety and encounter no discrimination in employment for which they are physically
 capable.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Rfht of Association.-Labor law remains unmodified by the AFPRC re-
 gime. The Labor Act of 1990 applies to all workers except civil servants. TheAct
 specifies that workers are free to form associations including trade unions, and pro.
 vides for their registration with the Government. it specifically prohibits police offi-
 cers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employees, from forming
 unions or striking.
 Approximately 20 percent of the work force is employed in the modern wage sec-
 tor, where unions are normally active. Roughly 30,000 workers are claimed as union
 members, or about 10 percent of the work force. The Gambian Worker's Confed-
 eration and the Gambian Workers' Union are the two main independent and com-
 peting umbrella organizations. Both are recognized by the Government, but rela-
 tions with the AFPRC were not tested.
 The Labor Act of 1990 authorizes strikes but requires that unions give the Com-
 missioner of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginning an industrial action (28
 days for essential services). It prohibits retribution against strikers who comply with
 the law regulating strikes. Upon application by an employer to the Supreme Court,
 the Court may prohibit industrial action that is ruled to be in pursuit of a political
 objective. The Court may also forbid action judged to be in breach of a collectively
 agreed procedure for settlement of industrial disputes.
 Because of these provisions and the weakness of unions, few strikes occur. Strike
 action was largely limited to a series of slowdowns and wildcat strikes by sanitation
 workers in greater Banjul to protest unpaid wages. These were interrupted by the
 July 22 coup did not resume.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, and there are no restrictions on union mem-
 bers' participation in international labor activities. The Gambia is not a member of
 the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 allows
 workers to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and
 fragmented, collective bargaining does take place. Each recognized union has guide-
 lines for its activities specified by the appropriate industrial council established and
 empowered by the Labor Act. Union members' wages exceed legal minimums and
 are determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or market forces. The Labor
 Department re *iters agreements reached between unions and management after
 insuring that the agreements are in compliance with labor law. No denial of reg-
 istration has been reported. The 1990 Act also sets minimum contract standards for
 hiring, training, terms of employment, wages, and termination of employment. The
 Act provides that contracts may not prohibit union membership. Employers may not
 
 
 100
 fire or discriminate against members of registered unions engaged in legal union ac-
 tivities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Criminal Code prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment is 18. There is no compulsory education, and because of limited second-
 ary school openings most children complete formal education by age 14 and then
 begin work. Employee labor cards, which include a person's age, are registered with
 the Labor Commissioner, but enforcement inspections rarely fake place. Child labor
 protection does not extend to youth performing customary chores on family farms
 or engaged in petty trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages and working hours are estab-
 lished by law through six joint industrial councils--Commerce, Artisans, Transport,
 Port Operations, A iculture, and Fisheries. Labor, management, and government
 are represented on these councils. The lowest minimum wage is $0.94 (9-Dalasi) per
 day for unskilled labor. This minimum wage is not adequate to sustain a suitable
 standard of living for a worker and family. Only 20 percent of the labor force-those
 in the formal economic sector-are covered by the minimum wage law. The majority
 of workers are privately or self-employed, often in agriculture. Most Gambians do
 not live on a single worker's earnings but share resources within extended families.
 The basic legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecutive
 days. A half-hour lunch break is mandated. In the private sector, the workweek in-
 cludes four 8-hour workdays and 2 half-days (Friday and Saturday). Government
 employees are entitled to I month's paid annual leave after 1 year of service. Pri-
 vate sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depend-
 in on length of service.
 Re Labor Act specifies safety equipment that an employer must provide to em-
 ployees working in designated occupations. The Factory Act authorizes the Ministry
 of Labor to regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance with safety standards. En-
 forcement is spotty owing to insufficient and inadequately trained staff. Workers
 may refuse to work in dangerous situations and may demand protective equipment
 and clothing for hazardous workplaces.
