 GUYANA
 The Co-operative Republic of Guyana is a small, developing democracy with a uni-
 cameral 65-member parliament chosen by direct elections in a multiparty political
 sstem. The President appints a Prime Minister and a cabinet. In March President
 Jagan of the Peoples' Progressive Party (PPP), who had been elected in 1992
 in the first democratic election since 1965, died suddenly. Prime Minister Samuel
 Hinds was sworn in as President that month in an orderly and peaceful transition.
 On December 15, citizens voted in free, fair, and nonviolent national elections. The
 PPP won a parliamentary majority, and PPP candidate Janet Jagan, widow of the
 late president, was sworn in as President on December 19. However, the major op-
 position party refused to accept the election results and initiated court action; at
 year's end, arrangements were made for a high-level Caribbean Community team
 to mediate the dispute. There is a constitutionally independent, albeit somewhat in-
 efficient, judiciary.
 The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) and the Guyana Police Force (GPF) are under
 civilian control. The GPF has the authority to make arrests and maintains law and
 order throughout the country. The GDF is a professional military responsible for na-
 tional defense, internal security, and emergency response. The President deployed
 the GDF on occasion to support police efforts to control crime. Members of the police
 committed human rights abuses.
 Guyana is a very poor country. The economy, which for years was centrally
 planned and contr0lled, is based on a mix of private and state enterprises. Rice,
 sugar, bauxite, and gold are the major exports. Although annual economic growth
 has averaged more than 6 percent over the past 4 years, the standard of living for
 most citizens is very low. More than half live in poverty, and per capita gross do-
 mestic product is estimated at about $760. External debt is high. There are severe
 shortages of skilled labor, and the economy is constrained by an inadequate and
 poorly maintained infrastructure for transportation, power distribution, flood con-
 trol, and communications.
 The Government's human rights record remained the same. Extrajudicial killings
 by police were a serious problem, but the authorities took steps to investigate and
 punish some of the perpetrators. Police continued to abuse suspects, and prison con-
 ditions were poor. The inefficient judicial system results in long delays in trials and
 lengthy pretrial detention. Other human rights problems included societal violence
 against women and children, and discriminst women, minorities, and in-
 digenous Amerindians. Some limitations on worker rights persist, but trade union
 activity was generally free of political interference.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudiciol Kiiling.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, police were responsible for numerous extrajudicial kilins. The
 Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) reported that police killed 24 civilians
 through August, om pared with 18 in all of 1996 and 11 in 1995. The Police Com-
 missioner's office challenged this figure, saying that the situations warranted the
 use of lethal force.
 The GHRA and other human rights activists have singled out the GPF's "impact
 squad" for its especially violent tactics. An elite group of mobile teams formed in
 1995 to provide immediate response to criminal activity, the impact squad faces
 many of Georgetown's most difficult criminal situations. However, a number of cases
 led the human rights community and the public to question the impact squad's tech-
 niques and disipline. In January impact squad members shot and killed Brindsley
 Davis near his family's home in Georgetown. The Police Commissioner's office is-
 sued a statement saying that Davis had attacked police officers with a machete as
 they were attempting to arrest him for robbery. However, family members and other
 eyewitnesses told the press that police cornered Davis in an outdoor bathroom, or-
 dered him to come out with his hands in the air, then shot him when he complied.
 By year's end, the Police Commissioner's office had released no further investigation
 results.
 In a similar case, relatives told the press that police summarily executed Carl
 Fields in his home in the town of Agricola in January. According to their state-
 ments, at least 12 police officers entered Fields' home, told him to lie on a bed, then
 killed him with 2 gunshots. Police stated that Fields was wanted for robbery. The
 coroner's inquest papers were filed in September, and a magistrate's court was ex-
 amining them at year's end to determine criminal liability.
 
 
 In August a member of the impact squad shot and killed Adam Sescotte an es-
 caped prisoner. According to numerous eyewitnesses, police were taking Sescotte
 into custody when one officer suddenly pulled a revolver and killed him with gun-
 shots to the chest and head. The police arrested and brought charges against the
 officer in question.
 In June police shot and killed Poke Puneshwar, apparently without motive. Ac-
 cording to witnesses who were in a canoe with Puneshwar, police fired multiple
 shots at them, killing Puneshwar. The police later issued a statement saying that
 the offiers involved were in pursuit of smugglers and that the shooting was the re-
 sult of a case of mistaken identity. The GHRA, however, reported that the police
 were drunk. The commissioner's office opened an investigation into the matter, and
 the authorities arrested and brought charges against five persons.
 The police responded to these three cases of alleged extrajudicial killings more
 rapidly than in pat years. The Police Commissioner and the Depament of Public
 Prosecutions (DPP) opened extensive investigations, and the DPP reported that the
 police did not interfere with its independent analysis of the cases. Thie DPP expects
 those charged to face trial.
 In August family members alleged that Bonitus Mark Winter, an Amerindian,
 died as a result of a brutal police beating. According to the family's complaint, Win-
 ter was arrested on August 9 on a misdemeanor charge, allegedly beaten into uncon-
 sciousness, then thrown into the Brickdam police precinct jail. He was released on
 August 16, but died of head injuries in a hospital on August 22.
 Very poor prison conditions and inadequate medical treatment contributed to the
 death of several prisoners (see Section 1.c.).
 The GPFs standing orders officially permit the use of firearms only when other
 means have been exhausted. However, many justice authorities and human rights
 activists say that because of rising crime and pressure from urban businesses, which
 are often the targets of criminals, the Government has taken a lax attitude toward
 investigations. In general, police abuses are committed with impunity. The statu-
 torily independent Police Complaints Authority (PCA) is required to transmit all
 complaints to the police commissioner, beth human rights gups and the PCA have
 criticized the commissioner for his failure to investigate these complaints properiy.
 Even when police officers do face charges, most of the cases are heard by lower mag-
 istrate courts, where other specially trained police officers serve as the prosecutors.
 As a result, no police officer accused of committing a human rights violation has
 ever been convicted on criminal charges. Nevertheless, during the year the PDF
 moved to open investigations more quickly, and its leaders began to take steps to
 increase accountability for violence and other abuses committdaby its members.
 The courts made progress on two cases that human rights activists had cited as
 examples of police impunity. In a case that attracted much public attention, justice
 officials dropped murder charges against lance corporal Robert Beresford, who had
 been charged with the May 1996 killing of Jermain Wilkinson. However, after an
 extensive investigation, the DPP reinstated the equivalent of second-degree murder
 charges against Beresford, who is expected to face trial in 1998. The trial of two
 police officers charged in September 1996 with shooting to death GDF soldier Urich
 Lynch iNew Amsterdam began in December.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and there were no known incidents of it. How-
 ever, the re    credible reports that criminal suspects were beaten severely while
 in custody of the GPF. In addition, several cases of wounding by the police of citi-
 zens who were not necessarily criminal suspects were reported. On January 17, a
 police patrol detained Shawn Williams, drove him to a remote location out of town
 an  leedly beat him while he was handcuffed. Williams reported that the beating
 occurredim the presence of a senior police official. In February Beresford Dey suf-
 fered two broken ribs after police beat, kicked, and struck him with a rifle butt, ap-
 parently because failed to show them proper respect. In June police shot taxi
 rver Terrence Holder in the mouth. Holder and a passenger told the GHRA the
 police were angry because he had not pulled over quickly enough. In August the
 GHRA met with the Minister of Home Affairs and formally requested investigations
 of these and nearly 90 other cases of excessive police force dating back to 1995. The
 Bourda market case, in which constable Oscar Cambridge shot and permanently
 cripled Frankie Figueira in May 1996, is also unresolved.
 ough the PCAis the principal body charged with looking into complaints of
 police brutality or abuse, it has no power to interview police officers or witnesses
 and must rely on material submitted by the police. The A refers cases of alleged
 abuse to the Police Commissioner. Investigations of such charges rarely result in se-
 rious disciplinary action, and most police abuses are committed with impunity. Offi-
 
 
 541
 cers charged as a result of complaints to the PCA are routinely suspended for a few
 days and sometimes fined, but rarely jailed. Critics of this process complain that the
 police force is responsible for investigating itself.
 Prison conditions are overcrowded and life-threatening in Georgetown's Camp
 Street prison, the ountry's Iargeat. Conditions in the four smaller prisons are gen-
 erally adequate. For most of te year, Camp Street prison held between 900 and
 1,000 prisoners in space initially designed to hold 350. Through August eight per-
 sons died in prison, most from diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, an AIDS.
 While many enter prison with these conditions, prison authorities admit that over-
 crowding ontributes to the spread of disease. In August inmates in the second larg-
 eat prison, at Maaroni, rioted and destroyed three othe faciity's buildings. Acord-
 ing to press reports, one prisoner died in the disturbance, and the Government was
 forced to move 100 more inmates to Camp Street. The only women's prison is at
 New Amsterdam, a facility that holds men and women in separate dormitory-type
 buildings.
 In January magistrate Cecil Sullivan and director of prisons Cecil Kilkenny
 opened investigations into the death of Leon Stewart, who had allegedly died be-
 cause of Camp Street's overcrowded conditions. Kilkenny eventually released a
 statement saying that Stewart had had a history of previous illness; however, Kil-
 kenny did not deny that overcrowding may have contributed to the death, and he
 reported that prisoners who became ill or who were injured often went months with-
 out receiving a doctoer's treatment. The Government reacted to Kilkenny's report by
 assigning more full-time nurse practitioners and pharmacists to the prison system
 and by requiring that doctors visit prisons more regularly. Prison directors and in-
 mates reported that, over the course of the year, medical coverage improved.
 In addition to overcrowding and a lack of medical personnel, poor staff morale is
 a serious problem within the prison system. The GHRA reports that prison staffers
 are poorly paid, and that their salaries and benefits do not compensate for the on-
 the-job risks. Prison officials lobbied the Government for increased funding to im-
 prove prison conditions. Prison officials were receptive to local and international
 NGO's requests to enter and inspect prison facilities and encouraged NGO-spon-
 sored efforts to improve physical and sanitary conditions.
 The GHRA participates as a member of the prisons' visiting committee, which in-
 vestigates prisoner complaints, inspects diets, reviews primary medical care serv-
 ices, and provides recommendations to prison authorities. The GHRA also partici-
 pated in training and development programs for prison staff and a family visit pro-
 gram for children of female inmates in the New Amsterdam prison.
 Although sanitary and medical conditions in police station temporary holding fa-
 cilities vary from station to station, in most cases these conditions are worse than
 in the prisons. Some such jails are bare, overcrowded, and damp. Few have beds,
 wash basins, furniture, or utensils. Diets and food preparation are of inconsistent
 quality. Each cell can have up to five persons, but rarely a toilet. Inmates are some-
 times escorted by staff members outside the cells to use holes in the floor for toilets.
 Inmates generally sleep on a thin pallet on the concrete floor. The East La Peni-
 tence police jail, where female prisoners are held until sentencing, is below standard
 compared to other jails and prisons in the country. Although precinct jails are in-
 tended to serve only as pretrial holding areas, some suspects have languished there
 as long as 4 years, waiting for the overburdened judicial system to take action on
 their cases.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 may be deprived of personal liberty except as authorized by law and requires judi-
 cial determination of the legality of detention, a mandate that the authorities gen-
 erally respected in practice.
 Arrest does not require a warrant issued by a court official. Police may arrest
 without a warrant when an officer witnesses a crime or at the officer's discretion
 in instances where there is good cause to suspect that a crime or a breach of the
 peace has been or will be committed. The law requires that a person arrested and
 held for more than 24 hours be brought before a court to be charged. Bail is gen-
 erally available, except in capital offense cases. In narcotics cases, magistrates have
 limited discretion in granting bail before trial but must remand persons convicted
 on narcotics crimes into custody, even if an appeal is pending.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice.
 The court system is composed of a High (Supreme) Court, a national court of ap-
 peal, and a system of magistrate courts that have branches in the various regions
 of the country.
 
 
 542
 
 Magistrates are members of the civil service and are trained lawyers. The mag-
 istrate courts deal with both criminal and civil matters. The Ministry of Legal Af-
 fairs headed by the Attorney General is the principal legal advisor to the State. The
 Director of Public Prosecution is statutorily independent and can file legal charges
 against offenders. The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law. This right is respected in prac-
 tice.
 Delays in judicial proceedings are caused by shortages of trained court personnel
 and magistrates, inadequate resources, postponements at the request of the defense
 or prosecution, occasional alleged acts of bribery, and the slowness of police in pre-
 paring cases for trial. The inefficiency of the judicial system is so great as to under-
 mine due process. The GHRA asserted that prisoners are often detained for 3 or 4
 while awaiting trial; however, the authorities denied that delays were this
 ng. Defendants are granted public trials, and appeal ma be made to higher
 courts. Appeals of some murder cases have experienced long delaya. Trial postpone-
 ments are routinely granted to beth the defense and the prosecution. However, pro.
 grans designed to improve legal structures, reform judicial procedures, upgrade
 technical capabilities, and improve efficiency of the courts are having a positive ef-
 fect.
 Although the law recognizes the right to legal counsel, in practice, with the excep-
 tion of capital crimes, it has been limited to those who can afford to pay. The
 Gertown Legal Aid Clinic, with public and private support, provides advice to
 people who cannot afford a lawyer, with a special interest in cases of violence
 against women and criminal cases related to civil cases in such matters (e.g., as-
 sault as part of a divorce case). The Government provides a small cash grant for
 the clinic as well as the services of a lawyer from the Attorney General's office.
 art from these efforts, very few lawyers provid fe fre services in criminal cases.
 fendants in murder cases who need a lawyer are assigned an attorney by the
 court. The Guyana Association of Women Lawyers provides free legal services for
 civil cases only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respects them
 in practice. Law enforcement officials must obtain legal warrants before searching
 private homes or properties. Although the authorities generally respected these re-
 quirements, there were numerous reports of police officers searching homes without
 warrants, particularly in neighborhoods where narcotics trafficking is a problem.
 Section 2. Respect for Civi Liberties, Including-
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Citizens
 openly criticize the government and its policies.
 The Government's daily newspaper, the Guyana Chronicle, covers a brad spec-
 trum of political and nongovernmental groups. The independent Stabrek News con-
 tinued to publish daily, and a wide range of religious groups, political parties, and
 journalists publish a lively variety of privately owned weekly newspapers.
 While the printed press flourished, a growing number of journalists charged the
 Government with failure to respect freedom of the electronic media. There are only
 tAree licensed radio stations, all of which are government-owned and -operated. Pri-
 vate interests alleged that the Government either denied or failed to respond to
 more than 20 requests for radio frequency authorizations. The Government main-
 tained that it is unable to grant frequencies to private stations because there is no
 legislation governing their allocation. Despite a similar lack of legislation to govern
 television frequencies, however, there were 1? independent television stations in ad-
 dition to the government station.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacef  Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right. The Public
 Order Act requires police permits for mass political meetings. The Police Commis-
 sioner has the authority to refuse permission for a public meeting if he believes that
 it will provoke a breach of the peace. In cases of refusal, applicants can appeal to
 the Minister of Home Affairs whose decision on the matter is final. Political parties
 and other groups held public meetings and rallies throughout the country without
 hindrance.
 The Constitution also provides for freedom of association, and the Government
 generally respects this right.
 
 
 543
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Members of all faiths are allowed to wor-
 ship freely, and there are no restrictions on foreign religious proselytizing.
 c. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigratwn, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within Guyana.
 Travel to Amerindian areas requires government permission, the result of a law dat-
 irag from colonial times designed to protect the indigenous people from exploitation.
 In practice, however, most people travel throughout these areas without regard to
 the formality of a permit. Citizens are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to re-
 turn.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The Government does not have a fixed policy on refugees or asylum but is
 studying draft model legislation prepared by the UNHCR. The issue of provision of
 first asylum did not arise; there were no reports of forced return of persons to a
 country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens enjoy this right and exercised it in free, fair, and nonviolent elections
 held on December 15. The unicameral Parliament is chosen by direct election in a
 multiparty political system based on proportional representation. Any citizen 18
 years or older can register to vote. The leader of the party that obtains a plurality
 of seats in Parliament during national elections becomes President, with a 5-year
 term of office, unless the party loses control of Parliament or calls elections earlier.
 The President appoints a cabinet and a Prime Minister who, with the President, ex-
 ercise executive power. Citizens are free to join or support political parties of their
 choice and established nearly 20 new ones in 1996.
 In addition to choosing a president, voters elected a new Parliament, in which 4
 political parties were represented. The two major parties-the PPP and the People's
 Nationa Coness    NC)-are largely formed by Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese,
 r       e      was the case during national eleionons in 1992, local and foreign
 independent observers judged the election to be free and fair. However, the leader
 of the PNC stated that his party would not accept the election results, alleging that
 they were riged. The PN   imtiated court action and called on its supporters to
 demonstrate m the streets. These remained largely peaceful and ceased after a high-
 level team from the Caribbean Community arrivedin early January 1998 to mediate
 the dispute.
 There are no legal impediments to participation of women or minorities in the p-
 litical process, but they are underrepresented in government and politics._The 19-
 person cabinet included 3 women, and the country's second-highest judge is a
 woman. The 72-member Parliament included 12 women and 10 Amerindians, rep-
 resenting both major parties. As a result of the December elections, for the frst
 time th rersident is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, the most active local human rights group,
 functioned without government interference.
 The GHRA is a nongovernmental organization (NGO) formed in 1979 with the
 participation of trade unions, professional organizations, various ethnic groups, and
 churches. It issues periodic press releases and publishes an annual report on human
 rights in Guyana. Various local church and neighborhood groups formed to criticize
 the Government's human rights policies or to demand action; the Government did
 not hinder their activities. embers of the Government openly discussed human
 rights issues and made public statements in response to foreign and local human
 rights reports. The authorities did not interfere with the activities of human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides fundamental rights for all persons regardless of race,
 sex, religion, or national origin. However, the Government does not always enforce
 these provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women, including domestic violence, is a significant
 troblem. Rape is common, and health professionals report a high incidence of incest.
 awyers say that more victims are reporting these crimes to the authorities, al-
 though there is still a social stigma attached to them. The police are sometimes
 hesitant to interfere in cases of domestic disputes. Because of their economic cir-
 
 
 544
 
 curnstances and the shortage of family shelters, victims of domestic violence are
 often trapped in their homes with their abusers. In December 1996, Parliament
 passed a 'a   eining domestic violence and establishing it as a crime. The authori-
 ties brought charges a       three men under the new law's provisions; two were
 tried and imprisoned. The Ministry of Labor has conducted seminars to educate men
 and women on the issues of domestic violence and women's rights. A local NGO has
 opened a shelter, which also provides women with legal and other counseling. In De-
 cember the Government opened a second shelter for battered women and victims of
 rae and incest.
 In November Parliament approved the Antidiscrimination Act, which builds upon
 the provisions of the 1990 Equal Rights Act. The two laws provide a strengthened
 framework under which women and minorities may seek redrs for dscriminatory
 acts or practices. There is no legal protection against sexual harassment in the
 workplace. Legislation prohibits dismissal on the grounds of prgancy, and dismis-
 sal on such grounds does not occur in practice. The Women's Affairs Buau of the
 Ministry of Labor, Human Services, and Social Security monitors the legal rights
 of women. In December the Government opened the Women's Leadershipc Institute,
 which seeks to provide training and promote greater participation by women i gov-
 ernment and the private sector.
 Legislation passed by Parliament in 1990 protects women's property rights in
 common law marriages and entitles a woman who separates or divorces to one-half
 the couple's property if she had been working and one-third of the property if she
 had been a housewife. Divorce by consent remains illegal. Legislation also gives au-
 thority to the courts to overturn a man's will in the event that it does not provide
 for his wife, as long as she was dependent on him for financial support.
 Children.-An estimated three-quarters of the population lives in poverty, and
 children are more severely affected than any other group. Although the Government
 provides free education through secondary school, the severe deterioration of the
 ublic education and health care systems has stunted children's futures. The public
 eath   stem  is inadequate and for many children private health care is
 unaffordable. Children are often not given the opportunity to attend school because
 their families need them to contribute to running the household by working or pro-
 viding child care.
 Concern continues to rise over the effects of domestic violence on children. The
 GHRA learned that three children died in the first 3 months of 1997 as a result
 of child abuse, and it believes that other deaths occurred but were unreported. Law
 enforcement officials added that the vast majority of criminal child abuse cases went
 unreported. Media reports of rape and incest further indicated that violence against
 chilDren is a significant problem. The administration of justice for children is char-
 acterized by a system that lacks social services or trained experts to deal with chil-
 dren fleeing sexual, physical, or emotional abuse. Many children also suffer from ne-
 glect or abandonment in a society where 3 percent of the population emigrates each
 year, often leaving children behind.
 People With Disabilities.-The lack of appropriate infrastructure to provide access
 to beth public and private facilities makes it very difficult to employ the disabled
 outside their homes. There is no law mandating provision of access or people with
 disabilities.
 There are several special schools and training centers for the disabled, but they
 lack trained staff and are in disrepair.
 Indigenous People.-Most of the small Amerindian population, composed of nine
 tribal groups, live in reservations and villages in remote parts of the interior. Their
 standsrd of living is much lower than that of most citizens, and their ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of
 natural resources is limited.
 Amerindian life is regulated by the Amerindian Act, legislation dating from colo-
 nial times designed to protect indigenous people from exploitation. The act gives the
 Government the power to determine who is an Amerindian and what is an Amer-
 indian community, to appoint Amerindian leaders, and to annul decisions made by
 Amerindian councils. It also prohibits th  e of alcohol to Amerindians and re-
 quires government permission before any Amerindian can accept formal employ-
 ment, although these provisions generally are not enforced. Both individuals and
 Amerindian groups seeremafee to criticize the Government.
 The Government has long maintained that it is committed to legally demarcating
 lands that have traditionaly been the homes of Amerindians. It has identified a
 total of 78 such villages and reservations, but despite the late President Jagan's
 promise at an international meeting in February 1996 to speed the process, only 1
 of these areas has been legally demarcated. In September President Hinds renewed
 the promise to speed the demarcation process, but many Amerindians and NGO's
 
 
 545
 feel that the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs does not have adequate funding or tech-
 nical capacity to carry out the demarcation.
 A serious allegation of physical abuse and exploitation of Amerindians was re-
 ported in 1997. In February opposition parliamentarian Matheson Williams alleged
 that members of an organized group in Supenaam and Danielstown were raping
 Amerindian women. He said he had interviewed 17 women who reported that they
 had been taken to a remote airstrip and gang raped. Williams called on the Min-
 istries of Amerindian Affairs and Labor to investigate the charges; he reported that
 one man was charged with rape, but by year's end the Government had produced
 no report concerning the incidents.
 National Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Longstanding ethnic tensions, primarily be-
 tween citizens of African and Indian descent, continued to influence society and po-
 litical life. Historical patterns of social organization have resulted in social and po-
 litical organizations coalescing around ethnic groups. This pattern of racial and eth-
 nic grouping has become politicized over the years, polarizing society along ethnic
 lines. Discrimination and exclusion continue to occur.
 Some Indo-Guyanese allege that the 1965-92 PNC government established a pat-
 tern of racial discrimination in favor of the Afr-Guyanese. However, some Afro-
 Guyanese now allege that they suffer racial discrimination and "political victimiza-
 tion" by the predominantly Indo-Guyanese PPP, which they say directs benefits and
 opportunities to its supporters. The civil service and defense and police forces are
 overwhelmingly staffecb~y Afro-Guyanee. Recruitment efforts targeted at Indo-Guy-
 anese candidates for the uaiformed services generally have met with an
 unenthusiastic response, with most qualified Tndo-Guyanese candidates opting for a
 business or prfessional career over military, police, or public service. The chief of
 staff of the Guyana Defence Force is Indo-Guyanese and there are other Indo-Guya-
 nese officers in both the GDF and the police force. The Government sponsored var-
 ious forums for discussion of racial problems and to promote inclusion. It supported
 the work of NGO's that deal with these concerns.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of association
 and specifically enumerates workers' rights to form or belong to trade unions. In No-
 vember the Government enacted the Trade Unions Recognition Law, which requires
 employers to recognize the union chosen by a majority of the workers; the law takes
 effect in 1999.
 A pproximately 34 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union members
 work in the public sector and in state-owned enterprises. Organized labor freely as-
 sociates in one major national federation, the Guyana Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), which is composed of 22 unions. There is a tradition of close ties between
 the trade union movement and political parties.
 Historically, the two major political parties wielded significant influence over the
 leadership of several unions, and trade union officials often served in dual roles as
 party officials. Although this still occurs, it is less common.
 Workers have a generally recognized right to strike. Strikes can be declared ille-
 gal if the union leadership did not approve them, or they did not meet the require-
 ments specified in collective bargaining agreements. Public employees providing es-
 sential services may strike if they provide the proper notice to the Ministry of Labor
 and leave a skeletal staff in place. There were few strikes in 1997, and none of those
 that did occur were prolonged or considered to be illegal.
 There was no legislation prohibiting retaliation against strikers or antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers. However, this principle was always included by the Gov-
 ernment in the terms of resumption after a strike. The new law scheduled to take
 effect in 1999 defines and places limits on the retaliatory actions employers may
 take against strikers. Arbitration rulings, whenever agreed to by the contending
 parties, are legally enforceable.
 Unions and their federations freely maintain relations with recognized Caribbean
 and international trade union and professional groups. All three of the major inter-
 national trade union federations have affiliates in Guyana.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Public and private sector em-
 ployees possess and utilize the generally accepted right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. The Ministry of Labor certifies all collective bargaining agreements and
 has never refused to do so. Until enactment of the new bill, however, this right was
 not codified, and employers were not legally required to recognize unions or to bar-
 gain with them.
 Individual unions directly negotiate collective bargaining status, pursuant to the
 1993 repeal of a regulation that required that all collective bargaining be negotiated
 
 
 through the TUC. Unions are dissatisfied with a provision granting the Ministry of
 Finance veto power over wage contracts negotiated by other ministries.
 The Chief Labor Officer and the staff of the Ministry of Labor provide consulta-
 tion, enforcement, and conciliation services. The Ministry eliminated a backlog of
 pending cases but insufficient manpower and transportation continued to limit the
 Ministry's ability to function.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or CornulyLabor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no indication that it occurs. The Government pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Fac-
 tories Act and the Employment of Young Persons and Children Act set out mini-
 mum age r       ments for employment of children. Legally, no person under age
 14 maylbe employed in any industrial undertaking and no person under age 16 may
 be employed at night, except under regulated circumstances. The Government pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor by children, and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 The law permits children under age 14 to be employed only in enterprises in which
 members of the same family are employed. However, it is common to see very young
 children engaged in street trading in the capital. While cognizant of the situation,
 the Ministry of Labor does not employ sufficient inspectors to enforce existing laws
 effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labour Act and the Wages Councils Act
 allow the Labor Minister to set minimum wages for various categories of private
 employers. The minimum public sector wage is $2.20 (G$307.84) per day. Although
 enfoement mechanisms exist, it is difficult to put them into practice, and unorga-
 nized workers, particularly women and children, are often paid less than what is
 gally required. The legal minimum wage for the public sector is insufficient to pro-
 vide an adequate standard of living for worker and family.
 The Shops Act and the Factories Act set hours of employment, which vary by in-
 dustry and sector. In general, work in excess of an 8-hour day or a 44-hour week
 requires payment of an overtime rate. However, if the initial contract stipulates a
 48 hour workweek, then the overtime rate applies only for hours worked in excess
 of 48 hours. The law does not provide for at least a 24-hour rest period.
 The Factories Act also sets forth workplace safety and health standards. The Oc-
 cupation Health and Safety Division of the Ministry of Labor is charged with con-
 ducting factory inspections and investigating complaints of substandard workplace
 conditions. As with its other responsibilities, inadequate resources prevented the
 Ministry from effectively carrying out this function. Workers cannot remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardizing continued employment.
