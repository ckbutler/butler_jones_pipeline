 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch. The fundamental rights of speech, assembly, press,
 religion, movement, and participation in the political process
 are guaranteed in the Constitution of 1978. These rights
 extend to all and are respected in practice. At all levels of
 government, elections must be held every 4 years. Voter
 participation is high in these free and open elections.
 The Spanish economy is mixed, with primary reliance on private
 initiative and market mechanisms. Although the economy is
 healthy, Spain continues to experience high unemployment. This
 is due in part to the entry of new workers into the labor
 force. Women and youth are disproportionately affected by the
 high level of unemployment.
 Human rights enjoy great respect in Spain. Charges of abuse
 of human rights most often occur in connection with political
 terrorism. A provision of the former antiterrorist law for
 10 days' incommunicado detention was found unconstitutional in
 1988. As a result, the amended penal code now provides for up
 to 5 days' incommunicado detention without a hearing in the
 case of suspected terrorists.
 In 1988 the Government continued to prosecute cases of alleged
 police abuse of detainees dating from prior years. Three
 police officers were sentenced to 29 years in prison for their
 role in the 1983 disappearance and presumed death of a
 prisoner. In November 1988, Spain signed the European
 Convention Against Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Punishment
 or Treatment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were approximately 160 terrorist-related incidents in
 Spain from January through September 1988 in which 11 people
 were killed and 28 injured. All the deaths and most of the
 injuries occur-red during actions claimed by or attributable to
 the Basque separatist group ETA (Basque Fatherland and
 Freedom). Two of the dead were civil guards; four were
 national police; and one an elderly retired army general who
 was shot dead as he left church in March. Not included in
 these statistics is the December 1987 bombing by ETA of a
 civil guard barracks in Zaragoza which killed 11 people,
 including 5 children, 2 adult dependents, and 4 civil guards.
 The Government has held intermittent talks with ETA in Algeria
 during the past 2 years in an attempt to end the violence. It
 broke off the talks in February after the ETA's kidnaping of a
 prominent Madrid businessman. After the businessman's release
 in late 1988, ETA issued a call for a truce and negotiations
 with the Government but its attacks continued. The Government
 has publicly stated that there will be no more contacts as
 long as ETA continues to carry out terrorist acts. Since 1987
 there has been close and effective cooperation between the
 Spanish and French Governments in the fight against ETA
 terrorism.

 SPAIN
 Two ranking police officers are in prison awaiting trial on
 charges chey organized a secret antiterrorist assassination
 band, Antiterrorist Liberation Group (GAL), which took credit
 for the killings of alleged Spanish Basque terrorists in
 southern France from 1983 to 1986. The Spanish Prime Minister
 publicly and firmly denied allegations that the Government had
 been aware of or condoned GAL activities.
 b. Disappearance
 Kidnapings for ransom are occasionally carried out by ETA.
 There are no claims that police or government security forces
 carried out secret arrests or kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are no documented instances of police abuse during 1988,
 although ETA detainees routinely charge that they are abused
 during detention. An improved police attitude with respect to
 human rights over the past several years may be attributed to
 the willingness of the Government to punish improper police
 behavior, publicity in the press, and concern by the police
 unions themselves with denunciations of police misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, a person is free from arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more
 than 72 hours without a hearing. The penal code, as reformed
 in 1988, permits a suspected terrorist to be held an
 additional 2 days without a hearing. Several sections of the
 former antiterrorist law, including the provision permitting
 up to 10 days' detention without a hearing for a suspected
 terrorist, were struck down as unconstitutional by the Spanish
 courts in 1987. The antiterrorist law was repealed by
 Parliament in 1988.
 During 1988 three police inspectors were convicted and
 sentenced to 29 years in prison on charges related to the
 illegal arrest, disappearance, and presumed death of a petty
 criminal in 1983. Four other police officers were acquitted
 in the case. The victim allegedly had been aware of police
 involvement in criminal activity.
 Exile is not practiced in Spain. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and
 guarantees the right to a fair public trial. This right is
 observed in practice. The law provides for an expeditious
 judicial hearing following arrest. Defendants may always
 appeal to the next highest court, and up to the Council of
 Europe in cases concerning human rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution protects the privacy of home and
 correspondence. Under the criminal code, government
 authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private
 correspondence. The present antiterrorist law gives
 
 
 1185
 SPAIN
 discretionary authority to the Minister of Interior to act
 prior to obtaining court approval "in cases of emergency."
 There have been no complaints that the Minister has abused
 this authority.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government scrupulously observes the guarantees of free
 speech and press provided for in the Constitution. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely expressed in speech and through the
 media. However, at the end of 1987, the Supreme Court upheld
 a 6-year prison sentence for a Spanish journalist who was
 found guilty of violating a law which prohibits insulting the
 dignity of the King.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 This right is fully respected and freely practiced.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have complete freedom to travel in and
 outside the country. The Government restricts neither
 emigration nor repatriation.
 The Law on Aliens permits detention of a person for up to 40
 days prior to expulsion, but specifies that the detention may
 not take place in a prison-like setting. A new detention
 center manned by the Red Cross opened in 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 all citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote.
 Opposition groups exist openly and take -n active part in the
 political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains good relations with international
 human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as with
 national groups, such as the Spanish Human Rights
 Association. The Foreign Ministry, through an office of human
 rights affairs, takes an active interest in human rights
 issues internationally.

 SPAIN
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Spain's Constitution provides for equal rights for all
 citizens. Education and economic and social services are
 generally available to all without discrimination of any
 kind. The Constitution promises equal rights to women, and
 the Government is dedicated to eliminating discrimination
 against women wherever it occurs. The Women's Institute, a
 government agency under the Ministry of Culture, is active in
 promoting social equality, women's mobility, and the
 participation of women in political, cultural, economic, and
 social life. Women comprise about 6.5 percent of the Congress
 of Deputies and 5.5 percent of the Senate. While they
 represent 31.2 percent of the total paid labor force, the rate
 of unemployment is higher among women (28 percent) than men
 (15.6 percent).
 Gypsies are a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 Spanish population. Despite their constitutional rights, they
 suffer discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs. Legal
 mechanisms exist by which they can seek redress, for example,
 from discrimination by an employer. As a practical matter,
 however, Gypsies do not normally seek such redress. The
 Government is committed to securing equal rights and treatment
 for Gypsies. A representative of the Gypsy community serves
 as special advisor to the Minister of Interior.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their
 own representatives, determine their own policies, represent
 their members' interests, and strike. They are not restricted
 or harassed by the Government and freely maintain ties with
 recognized international organizations. About 10 percent of
 the Spanish work force is unionized.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was established
 by the Workers Statute of 1980. Trade union and collective
 bargaining rights were extended to all workers in the public
 sector, except the military, in 1986. The first civil service
 trade union representation elections took place during the
 last quarter of 1987. Collective bargaining is used
 extensively in both the private and public sectors. Labor
 relations in free trade zones and export processing zones are
 regulated in the same manner as in the rest of the country.
 There are no restrictions on the right to organize or on
 collective bargaining in such areas.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is outlawed in Spain and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age of employment as established by the
 Workers Statute is 16 years. The Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security is primarily responsible for enforcement. The
 minimum age is effectively enforced in major industries and
 the service sector. It is more difficult to control on small
 
 
 1187
 SPAIN
 farms and in family-owned businesses. The Workers Statute
 also prohibits the employment of persons under 18 years of age
 at night, during overtime, or in sectors considered hazardous
 by the Ministry of Labor and the unions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workers in general have substantial, well-defined rights. A
 40-hour workweek is established by law. Spanish workers enjoy
 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid vacation. The
 legal minimum wage is $12.60 per day or $380 per month for
 workers over 18. For 17-year-olds, the minimum stands at
 $7.70 per day or $233 per month. For 16-year-olds, it is
 $4.80 per day or $146.50 per month. The minimum wage is
 revised.every year in accordance with the consumer price
 index. It is considered to offer a decent standard of living
 for a single person without dependents.
 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions
 and occupational safety and health conditions, but
 bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and inefficient.
