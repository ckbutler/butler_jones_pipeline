 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy with a unicameral
 Legislative Assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every 4 years.
 Miguel Angel Rodriguez of the Social Christian Unity Party won the presidency in
 the February elections, in which approximately 70 percent of eligible voters cast bal-
 lots. The Government respects constitutional provisions for an independent judici-
 ary.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished the military forces. The Ministry of Public Secu-
 rity-which includes specialized units such as the antidrug police-and the Ministry
 of the Presidency share responsibility for law enforcement and national security. In
 1996 the Government combined several-police units within the Ministry of Public
 Security, including the Border Guard, the Rural Guard, and the Civil Guard, into
 a single "public force." Public security forces generally observe procedural safe-
 guards established by law and the Constitution.
 The market economy is based primarily on agriculture, light industry, and tour-
 ism. After 3 percent growth in 1997, economic growth was projected at 4.5 percent.
 Government fiscal difficulties continued, with the public sector deficit projected to
 amount to 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The Constitution protects the
 right to private property; however, domestic and foreign property owners encounter
 considerable difficulty gaining adequate, timely compensation for lands expropriated
 for national parks and other purposes. The law grants considerable rights to squat-
 ters who invade uncultivated land, regardless of who may hold title to the property.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. The Government
 generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary pro-
 vide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Nonetheless, the
 judicial system moves very slowly in processing criminal cases, resulting in lengthy
 pretrial detention for some suspects. Domestic violence is a serious problem, and
 abuse of children also remains a problem. Traditional patterns of unequal oppor-
 tunity for women and racial minorities remain, in spite of continuing government
 and media efforts to advocate change.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In September 1997, a criminal court found two of three former udicial police offi-
 cers guilty of the 1994 murder of farmer Ciro Monge; the third officer awaited trial
 at year's end. The court sentenced the two men to 12 years in prison and $200,000
 (50 million colones) in fines and costs. The two convicted officers appealed the rul-
 ings and lost; one fled the country.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. The authorities generally abide by these prohibi-
 tions. An effective mechanism for lodging and recording complaints of police mis-
 conduct exists. As of mid-August, the Ombudsman's office had received 6 reports of
 police abuse of authority or misconduct. The Ombudsman's office investigates com-
 plaints and, where appropriate, initiates suits against officials.
 A large percentage of police personnel owe their appointments to political patron-
 age. The Rodriguez administration continued implementation of the 1994 Police
 Code designed to depoliticize and professionalize the police force. The Governmenfs
 long-term plan is to establish permanent, professional cadres, eventually resulting
 in a nonpolitically appointed career force. The basic course for new police recruits
 includes training using a human rights manual developed by the Ministry of Public
 Security.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment. Prisoners are separated by gender
 and by level of security (minimum, medium, and maximum). There are separate ju-
 venile detention centers. Illegal narcotics are readily available in the prisons, and
 drug use is common. While guards rarely abuse prisoners physically, there are cred-
 ible reports that prisoners are sometimes subjected to other forms of abuse such as
 extortion. The Prison Rights Ombudsman investigates complaints and refers serious
 cases of abuse to the Public Prosecutor.
 Penitentiary overcrowding remained a problem, with the prison population esti-
 mated at 67 percent above planned capacity. The Government is expanding six pris-
 ons to address this problem. In March 1996, the Supreme Court's Constitutional
 Chamber issued an order to the San Sebastian prison in San Jose, giving the insti-
 tution 1 year to achieve minimally acceptable conditions for the prisoners. As of Au-
 gust, that prison was still 88 percent above capacity, a decline from 121 percent the
 previous year, reflecting the transfer of many long-term prisoners to other institu-
 tions.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and law prohibit arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally respects these prohi-
 bitions.
 The law requires issuance of judicial warrants before making arrests. The Con-
 stitution entitles a detainee to a judicial determination of the legality of the deten-
 tion during arraignment before a court officer within 24 hours of arrest. The au-
 thorities generally respect these rights.
 The law provides for the right to release on bail, and the authorities observe it
 in practice. Generally, the authorities do not hold detainees incommunicado. With
 judicial authorization, the authorities may hold suspects for 48 hours after arrest
 or, under special circumstances, for up to 10 days.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Pub ji TriaL.-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Constitu-
 tion provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously
 enforces this right.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 The Legislative Assembly elects the 22 Supreme Court magistrates to 8-year terms,
 subject to automatic renewal uniess the Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds
 majority. Accused persons may select attorneys to represent them, and the law pro-
 vides for access to counsel at state expense for the indigent.
 Persons accused of serious offenses and held without bail, however, sometimes re-
 main in pretrial custody for long periods. Lengthy legal procedures, numerous ap-
 peals, and large numbers of detainees cause delays and case backlogs. There were
 802 accused persons, representing 17 percent of the prison population, jailed await-
 ing trial as of March 31.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 572
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction. The law re-
 quires judicial warrants to search private homes. Judges may approve use of wire-
 tap in limited circumstances, primarily to combat narcotics trafficking.
 The law grants considerable rights to squatters who invade uncultivated land, re-
 gardless of who may hold title to the property. Landowners in Pavones, Golfito, have
 a 10-year history of conflict with squatters, which includes frequent violent inva-
 sions. Upon taking office, President Rodriguez increased the police presence in the
 Pavones region in an effort to show his commitment to resolving the problem.
 The Government made more progress on issues of land tenure and protection from
 squatter invasions outside the Pavones region. The Legislative Assembly is reexam-
 ining laws that give title through adverse possession, and squatter evictions are oc-
 curring with increased frequency. On May 19, the police removed 278 families from
 a parcel of land in Cartago province. On September 4, police removed 300 families
 of squatters from property near Quepos, Puntarenas. These evictions were con-
 ducted lawfully and with respect for the rights of the squatters. There were no cred-
 ible accounts of abuses by the officers who enforced the evictions, despite the some-
 times forceful resistance of the squatters being removed.
 The investigation remains open in the case of the 1997 shootings in the Pavones
 region of U.S. citizen landowner Max Dalton and squatter Alvaro Agilar. Press re-
 ports indicated that the investigators believed the two men shot each other; charges
 were never pressed agalnst the first suspect in the case. At year's end, the official
 investigation remained inconclusive.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides fur freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press, a generally effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political sys-
 tem combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic free-
 dom.
 There are 9 major privately owned newspapers, several periodicals, 20 privately
 owned television stations, and over 70 privately owned radio stations, all of which
 pursue independent editorial policies. While the media generally criticize the Gov-
 ernment freely, there were unconfirmed allegations that the Government withheld
 advertising from some publications in order to influence or limit reporting. In March
 a court acquitted the editor and two reporters from the La Nacion daily newspaper
 after a former minister accused them of libel. However, the court found them guilty
 of a lesser charge of defamation, fined them, and awarded the plaintiff damages to
 be paid by the newspaper. In a separate case in May, a court absolved a reporter,
 an editor, and an executive from La Nacion of libel charges.
 In 1996 the Legislative Assembly passed a "right of response" law that provides
 persons criticized in the media with an opportunity to reply with equal attention
 and at equal length. While the print and electronic media continued to criticize pub-
 lic figures, the law has proven difficult for media managers to administer. On occa-
 sion, some media outlets delayed printing responses because submissions were not
 clearly identified as replies to previously published items.
 The Offie of Control of Public Spectacles rates films and has the authority to re-
 strict or prohibit their showing; it has similar powers over television programs and
 stage plays. Nonetheless, foreign and particularly American films spanning the U.S.
 rating system are offered to the public. A tribunal reviews appeals of the office's ac-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. While the Constitution establishes
 Roman Catholicism as the state religion, people of all denominations freely practice
 their religion without government interference. Religions education teachers, includ-
 ing those in public schools, must be certified by the Roman Catholic Episcopal Con-
 ference. Foreign missionaries and clergy of all denominations work and proselytize
 freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. There are no restrictions on travel within the country, on
 emigration, or the right of return.
 There is a long tradition of providing refuge to people from other Latin American
 countries. In August the Government declined to grant asylum to Elizabeth Trujillo,
 a Cuban who claimed inside knowledge of Fidel aso's state of health and a sup-
 
 
 573
 posed Cuban sponsored kidnap attempt against her. In April the dovernment grant-
 ed asylum to Peruvian judge Delia Revoredo after she fled Peru due to politically
 motivated threats. Her asylum was revoked later after she and her husband, Jamie
 Mur, whose own asylum petition was also pending, returned to Peru for a week in
 September to address some legal matters there.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government makes a distinction between political asylum and refugee status; the
 issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits repatriation of anyone subject to potential persecution, and there were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The
 authorities regularly repatriated undocumented Nicaraguans, most of whom entered
 the country primarily for economic reasons. However, in the wake of Hurricane
 Mitch, the Government announced a program of general amnesty for all Nica-
 raguans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans in the country prior to November 9.
 Allegations of abuse by Border Police periodically arise. Although instances of
 physical abuse appear to have declined, there were credible reports of extortion of
 migrants by border officials.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through free and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot every 4 years. The inde-
 pendent Supreme Electoral Tribunal ensures the integrity of elections, and the au-
 thorities and citizens respect election results. The Constitution bars the President
 from seeking reelection, and Assembly members may seek reelection only after at
 least one term out of office. In the 1998 elections, President Rodriguez's Social
 Christian Unity Party (PUSC) won a plurality in the Legislative Assembly, winning
 27 of 57 seats. The National Liberation Party (PLN) won 23 seats, the Democratic
 Force won 3 seats, and 4 minor parties, the Labor Action, National Integration,
 Costa Rican Renovation, and Libertarian Movement parties, each won 1 seat.
 Women encounter no legal impediments to their participation in politics. While
 they are underrepresented in leadership positions in the Government and political
 parties, this situation has begun to change. Both vice presidents, the Minister of
 Justice, and 11 legislative assembly deputies are women. Former Assembly Deputy
 Sandra Piszk continues as Ombudsman, a key autonomous post created in 1993 to
 protect the rights and interests of citizens in their dealings with the Government,
 and Linette Saborio remains the Director General of the judicial investigative orga-
 nization. The PUSC mandated that a minimum of 40 percent of posts in party coun-
 cils be occupied by women and created the new Ministry for the Condition of
 Women, headed by Dr. Yolanda Ingianna Mainieri. To commemorate the 45th anni-
 versary of the first female members of the Assembly, the new female legislators
 formed the Foundation of Women Parliamentarians of Costa Rica. While working
 for a number of social objectives, including the decentralization of government, the
 group's principal focus is promoting women's involvement in politics.
 Indigenous people may participate freely in politics and government. In practice,
 they have not played significant roles in these areas, except on issues directly affect-
 ing their welfare, largely because of their relatively small numbers and physical iso-
 lation. None of the 57 members of the National Assembly identifies himself as indig-
 enous. There are two black members of the Assembly. The country's 100,000 blacks,
 largely resident on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of citizenship, including the
 protection of laws against racial discrimination.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights I
 Various human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigat-
 ing and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are
 cooperative and responsive to their views. The Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica monitor and report on
 human rights, as does the Ombudsman's office.
 Several international organizations concerned with human rights, including the
 Inter-American Institute for Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights, are located in San Jose.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution pronounces all persons equal before the law, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects these provisions.
 Women.-The Government has identified domestic violence against women and
 children as a serious societal problem. The authorities have incorporated training
 on handling domestic violence cases in the basic training course for new police per-
 sonnel. The Law Against Domestic Violence classifies certain acts of domestic vio-
 lence as crimes and mandates their prosecution. An old law permits a judge to par-
 don a man accused of statutory rape if the perpetrator intends to marry the victim,
 she and her family acquiesce, and the National Institute for Children does not ob-
 ject. This law has not been applied in recent years. The domestic violence law re-
 quires public hospitals to report cases of female victims of domestic violence. It also
 denies the perpetrator possession of the family home in favor of the victim. Tele-
 vision coverage of this issue has increased in news reporting, public service an-
 nouncements, and feature programs. Reports of violence against women have in-
 creased, likely reflecting a greater willingness of victims to report abuses rather
 than an actual increase in instances of violence agist women. The public prosecu-
 tor, police, and the Ombudsman all have offices dedicated to this problem. The law
 against sexual harassment in the work place and educational institutions seeks to
 prevent and punish sexual harassment in those environments.
 Women constitute 50.1 percent of the population. Upon forming his cabinet, newly
 elected President Rodriguez created a new ministry dedicated to the status of
 women. The 1990 Law for the Promotion of the Social Equality of Women not only
 prohibits discrimination against women but also obligates the Government to pro-
 mote political, economic, social, and cultural equality. In March 1996, the Govern-
 ment's National Center for the Development of Women and the Family presented
 its 3-year National Plan for Equality of Opportunity between Women and Men. The
 lan is based in great measure on the Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth
 World Conference on Women in Beijing.
 According to the 1995 census, women represent 30 percent of the labor force. Most
 women work in the services sector, with others working in industry and agriculture.
 While laws require that women and men receive equalpay for equal work, average
 salaries for women remain somewhat below those of male counterparts. According
 to United Nations Development Program, women occupy 27.5 percent of executive
 and management positions and nearly 48 percent of professional and technical posi-
 tions. The average life expectancy for women increased by 12 years since the early
 1970's to 77 years, higher than the 72-year average for men.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare through
 well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government spends
 over 5 percent of GDP on medical care. In June the Legislative Assembly passed
 a constitutional amendment increasing spending on education from 4 percent to 6
 percent of GDP. The country has a high rate of literacy (95 percent) and a low rate
 of infant mortality (12 persons per 1,000). The law requires 6 years of primary and
 3 years of secondary education for all children. There is no difference in the treat-
 ment of girls and boys in education or in health care services. The autonomous Na-
 tional Institute for Children (PANI) oversees implementation of the Governmenfs
 programs for children. In December 1996, the Assembly passed a law strengthening
 PANI's role in protecting and promoting the rights of children, in accordance with
 the precepts of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 In recent years, the PANI has increased public awareness of crimes against chil-
 dren. In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Institute
 intervened in 3,119 cases of abandonment, 1,299 cases of physical abuse, 1,575 cases
 of sexual abuse, and 64 cases of psychological abuse of children. Abuses appear to
 be more prevalent among impoverished, less-educated families. Traditional attitudes
 and the inclination to treat such crimes as misdemeanors sometimes hamper legal
 proceedings against those who commit crimes against children.
 In February 1996, the PANI announced a comprehensive plan to improve the con-
 ditions of the poorest children. According to Institute estimates, 17 percent of chil-
 dren between the ages of 5 and 17 are involved in income-producing activities, and
 25,000 children work rather than attend school. The Government, police sources,
 and representatives of the United Nations Children's Fund acknowledge that child
 prostitution is a growing problem. Although no official statistics exist, the PANI has
 identified street children in the urban areas of San Jose, Limon, and Puntarenas
 as being at the greatest risk. The PAN estimates that as many as 3,000 children
 in metropolitan San Jose are involved in prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-The Equal Opportunity for Persons with Disabilities
 Law prohibits discrimination, provides for health care services, and mandates provi-
 
 
 sion of access to buildings for persons with disabilities. This law is not widely en-
 forced and many buildings remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Nonethe-
 less, a number of public and private institutions have made individual efforts to im-
 prove access. The PANI and the Ministry published specific classroom guidelines for
 assisting children with hearing loss, motor difficulties, attention deficit disorder,
 and mental retardation.
 Indigenous People.-The population of about 3.3 million includes nearly 33,000 in-
 digenous people among 8 ethnic groups. Most live in traditional communities on 22
 reserves which, because of their remote location, often lack access to schools, health
 care, electricity, and potable water. The Government, through the National Indige-
 nous Commission, completed distribution of identification cards to facilitate access
 to public medical facilities. The Government also built a medical clinic and several
 community health centers in indigenous areas. The Ombudsman has established an
 office to investigate violations of the rights of indigenous people.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law specifies the right of workers to join unions
 of their choosing without prior authorization, although barriers exist in practice.
 About 15 percent of the work force is unionized, almost entirely in the public sector.
 Unions operate independently of government control.
 Some trade union leaders contend that "solidarity" associations, in which employ-
 ers provide access to credit unions and savings plans in return for agreement to
 avoid strikes and other types of confrontation, infringe upon the right of association.
 After the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion ruled that solidarity associations and their involvement in trade union activi-
 ties violated freedom of association, the Government amended the Labor Code in
 1993. The following year, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) ruled that these and
 other planned changes fostered greater freedom of association. In 1995 the COE en-
 couraged the Government to approve legislation to allow unions to administer com-
 pensation funds for dismissed workers and to repeal labor code provisions restrict-
 ing the right to strike in certain nonessential public, agricultural, and forestry sec-
 tors. In June the Rerum Novarum Workers Confederation complained about govern-
 ment noncompliance with commitments to protect workers' rights but withdrew the
 complaint after the Rodriguez administration asked for a reasonable period to dem-
 onstrate its commitment to worker rights.
 There are no restrictions on the right of private sector workers to strike, but very
 few workers in this sector belong to unions. Accordingly, private sector strikes rare-
 ly occur. The Constitution and Labor Code restrict the right of public sector workers
 to strike. However, in February the Supreme Court formally ruled that public sector
 workers, except those irr essential positions, have the right to strike. Even before
 this ruling, the Government had removed penalties for union leaders participating
 in such strikes.
 Unions may form federations and confederations and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution protects the
 right to organize. Specific provisions of the 1993 Labor Code reforms provide protec-
 tion from dismissal for union organizers and members during union formation. The
 revised provisions require employers found guilty of discrimination to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Public sector workers cannot engage in collective bargaining because the Public
 Administration Act of 1978 makes labor law inapplicable in relations between the
 Government and its employees. However, the Supreme Court affirmed their rights
 to strike (see Section 6.a.). Private sector unions have the legal right to engage in
 collective bargaining.
 All labor regulations apply fully to the country's nine export processing zones
 (EPZ's). The Labor Ministry oversees labor regulations within the EPZ's, but ac-
 knowledged that it has only I inspector for every 30,000 workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no known instances of such practices. Laws
 prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this pro-
 hibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution provides special employment protection for women and children and estab-
 lishes the minimum working age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for
 workers under the age of 15. Laws prohibit forced and bonded labor by children,
 and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. Children between 15 and
 18 years of age can work a maximum of 7 hours daily and 42 hours weekly, while
 children between the ages of 12 and 15 can work a maximum of 5 hours daily and
 30 hours weekly. The PANI, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, generally en-
 
 
 forces these regulations in the formal sector. The Labor Ministry, with help from
 the ILO, is working to phase out child labor and has asked employers of children
 to notify the Ministry of such employment. Due to limited government resources for
 enforcement, some children-work on the fringes of the formal economy in excess of
 these limits. After two adolescents died from chemical poisoning while working on
 banana plantations in 1993, the authorities prohibited employment of youths under
 the age of 18 in the banana industry. Nonetheless, child labor remains an integral
 part of the large informal economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides for a minimum,
 wage. A National Wage Council, composed of three members each from government,
 business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors. Monthly
 minimum wages, last adjusted in June for the private sector, range from $132
 (34,400 colones) for domestic employees to $639 (166,700- colones) for some profes-
 sionals. Public sector negotiations, based on private sector minimum wages, nor-
 mally follow the settlement of private sector negotiations. The Ministry of Labor ef-
 fectively enforces minimum wages in the San Jose area, but less effectively in rural
 areas. Especially at the lower end of the wage scale, the minimum wage is insuffi-
 cient to provide a worker and family a decent standard of living.
 The Constitution sets workday hours, overtime remuneration, days of rest, and
 annual vacation rights. Although often circumvented in practice, it also requires
 compensation for discharge without due cause. Generally, workers may work a max-
 imum of 8 hours during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly totals- of 48 and 36
 hours, respectively. Nonagricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 per-
 cent of regular wages for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural work-
 ers do not receive overtime, however, if they voluntarily work beyond their normal
 hours. Little evidence exists that employers coerce employees to perform such over-
 time.
 A 1967 law on health and safety in the workplace requires industrial, agricul-
 tural, and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a joint manage-
 ment-labor committee on workplace conditions and allows the Government to in-
 spect workplaces and to fine employers for violations. Most firms subject to the law
 establish such committees but either do not use the committees or neglect to turn
 them into effective instruments for improving workplace conditions. While workers
 have the right to leave work if conditions become dangerous, workers who do so may
 find their jobs in jeopardy unless they file written complaints with the Labor Min-
 istry. Due partly to budgetary constraints, the Ministry has not fielded enough labor
 inspectors to ensure consistent maintenance of minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation, especially outside San Jose.
