 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty, parliamentary democracy.
 Executive power is vested in the President. The Cabinet, consisting of the Prime
 Minister and 16 Ministers who are responsible to Parliament, works with the Presi-
 dent in governing the country. Legislative power is held by the unicameral Par-
 liament. Judicial power is exercised by an independent judiciary, including the Su-
 preme Court and Supreme Administrative Court.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and supervised by the
 courts. Finland has a mixed econom with state owned, privately owned, and pub-
 licly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue their legitimate private interests,
 hold private property, and engage in economic activity without government inter-
 ference.
 During 1993 there were no reported violations in Finland of fundamental human
 rights. Members of national minorities and women enjoy the same economic and po-
 litical rights as all other citizens, although occupational segregation by sex is com-
 mon and leadership positions (in non-elected offices) in both the private and public
 sectors remain heavily male-dominated. Individuals are free to pursue their reli-
 gious beliefs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Killing for political motives by the
 Government or opposition political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance.-No cases of disappearances, abduction, or clandestine deten-
 tion were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment
 is guaranteed by law and is respected in practice. By law, prisoners must be treated
 justly with respect for their human dignity and without distinction on the basis of
 race sex, language, nationality, religious or political conviction, social position,
 wealth, or any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and im-
 prisonment or exile is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Police may hold
 a suspect for up to 7 days without charge. The suspect has access to a lawyer during
 that time. Once arrested, the accused must be given a court hearing within 8 days
 in a city or within 30 days in rural areas. The state pays legal fees Tor indigent de-
 fendants.
 Circumstances surrounding the arrest are subject to judicial review at the time
 the accused is brought to trial. If found innocent of the crime charged, the accused
 may apply to the same court for civil damages, and the arrest is deemed invalid.
 Bail as such does not exist in Finland. Individuals charged with minor offenses
 may be released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion. However, those
 accused of serious crimes must by law remain in custody pending trial, unless this
 would be unreasonable in view of the nature of the crime or the age of the suspect,
 or under other exceptional circumstances.
 Supervisory personnel from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior as well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice have
 authority to enter prisons and to order the release of prisoners held without
 charges. Exile has not been used as punishment in Finland and, by law, Finnish
 citizens cannot be exiled.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally residing in Finland
 have the right to effective counsel. The law provides that charges must be clearly
 stated and that civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time of war.
 The general court system includes municipal courts, courts of appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court. The President appoints Supreme Court justices, who in turn appoint
 the lower court judges. Judges receive permanent appointments, but are subject to
 mandatory retirement. They may choose optional retirement at age 63 but must re-
 tire at age 70. The judiciary is not subject to political interference.
 In addition to the general courts, a presidentially appointed Supreme Administra-
 tive Court adjudicates appeals from government decisions on administrative and tax
 matters. The Court of Impeachment is convened to handle cases of malfeasance by
 
 
 868
 cabinet ministers or the Chancellor of Justice. Other special courts handle labor
 matters, water rights, and prisoners' rights. Local courts may decide to conduct a
 trial behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when
 publicity would offend morality or endanger the security of the state. In national
 security cases, the judge may withhold from the public any or all information per-
 taining to charges against individuals, verdicts, and sentencing. Sanctions may be
 imposed if such information is made public. Provisional tribunals, or tribunals es-
 tablished for the express purpose of trying certain, specific cases or for the express
 purpose of sentencing a certain, specific individual, are prohibited by the Constitu-
 tion.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including prohibition of eavesdropping
 and mail tampering, are guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The police
 are authorized to conduct wiretapping under certain conditions of suspected crimi-
 nal activity. Senior police officials, rather than judges, have the authority to issue
 search warrants; there is no indication that this power is abused. The police are
 subject by law to judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice. No instances of abuse or legal deci-
 sions restricting freedom of the press were reported. A law remains on the books
 allowing the Government to censor films for foreign policy reasons, but has not been
 applied. Full academic freedom exists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is provided for by the Constitution. Public demonstrations require
 prior notification to the police. The Government encourages voluntary organizations
 and subsidizes private groups formed to achieve public purposes. These associations
 are permitted to maintain relations with other international groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Finland has two state religions: Lutheran and Eastern
 Orthodox. A special tax supports the state churches. Nonmembers may be exempted
 from the church tax by changing their census registration from the church-main-
 tained registry (where most people are registered) to the civil registry. Other de-
 nominations and religions enjoy complete freedom of worship. Proselytizing is per-
 mitted. About 88 percent of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Finns are free to travel within the area of the Nordic countries-Fin-
 land, Swed en, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland-without passports and need not
 apply for .exit visas for travel to other countries. No restrictions have been placed
 on emigration or repatriation. The granting of political asylum is a matter of fre-
 quent public debate, especially because of increasing numbers of asylum seekers and
 the costs of resettlement. In the first 7 months of 1993, 1,230 people applied for asy-
 lum, of whom 234 were granted refugee status. Local police issued another 1,600
 permits to ex-Yugoslavs who had entered Finland before July 22, 1992. (All of these
 oermits were 1-year renewable residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds.
 practice, renewal of temporary permits originally granted on humanitarian
 grounds is virtually automatic.) After that date, Finland imposed a visa requirement
 on residents of the former Yugoslavia. The largest groups of asylum seekers in 1993
 were from the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and Kurds. The Govern-
 ment of Finland states that it grants asylum in accordance with the 1951 United
 Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Finn-
 ish authorities accept relatively small numbers of refugees and asylum seekers, who
 receive generous assistance once admitted. Finland automatically gives Ingrians
 (ethnic Finns from Russia) resident status and resettlement assistance.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all citizens over the
 age of 18 elect their representatives from among multiple lists of candidates rep-
 resenting a wide spectrum of political ideologies. The country has the longest tra di-
 tion of women's suffrage in Europe (since 1906) and therree at present 77 women
 representatives (of a total of 200) in Parliament and 6 female ministers (of a total
 of 17) in the Cabinet.
 Parliamentary and municipal election take place every 4 years, whereas presi-
 dential elections are held every 6 years. At present, there are nine political parties
 in Pariament, of which four orm a non-socialist coalition Government, headed by
 a Center Party Prime Minister.
 
 
 869
 Legislation passed in 1991 provides for direct presidential elections beginning in
 1994.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several organizations in Finland monitor human rights performance- they include
 the Finnish led Cross, the government-sponsored Equality Council, te Minorities
 Rights Group, and the Women's Rights Union. In conjunction with the Swedish-lan-
 guage University in Turku, a Human Rigts Institute was founded in 1985 with the
 stated purpose of conducting human rights research, performing studies, and dis-
 tributing information on human rights. In September 1993 a Center for the Treat-
 ment of Torture Victims was opened in Helsinki. Finland is a member of the UN
 Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities Sami (Laps) who constitute less than
 one-tenth of 1 percent of the population, benefit from legal provisions protecting mi-
 nority rights and customs. Sami language and culture are supported financially by
 the Government. The Sami receive subsidies to enable them to continue their tradi-
 tional lifestyle, which revolves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and
 civil rights and are able to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cul-
 tural interests. Swedish is established as a second official language; about 6 percent
 of the population speaks Swedish as a native language.
 Women.-Women enjoy a wide array of social   Itenes that provide them with con-
 siderable economic independence. The government- established Council for Equality
 coordinates and sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers moth-
 ers, widows, and retirees. In 1985 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights
 bill which mandates equal treatment for women in the workplace, including equal
 pay for "comparable" jobs. In practice, comparable worth has not been implemented
 because of the difficulty of establishing criteria, but the Government, employers,
 unions, and others continue to work on implemention plans. Women's average earn-
 ings are 80 percent those of men and women still tend to be segregated m lower
 payi g occupations. While women have individually attained leadership positions in
 the private and public sectors, in general there are disproportionately fewer women
 in top management jobs. Industry and finance, the labor movement and some gov-
 ernment ministries remain male-dominated. Women are not permitted to serve in
 the military. Despite the large number of female elected officials, women feel ex-
 cluded from the innermost circles of political power. The Government's Equality
 Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations against sexual discrimination. Of
 the 114 complaints submitted to the Ombudsman between January 1 and Septem-
 ber 15, 1993, 102 had been processed, and violation of the law was established in
 29 cases.
 The law provides stringent penalties for violence against women; this provision
 is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shelter Homes and
 municipalities maintain about 55 shelters for female, male and child victims of vio-
 lence in homes all over the country. The annual number of calls to the police relat-
 ing to domestic violence is no longer centrally compiled, but is estimated at some
 10,000 to 12,000 per year. Shelter home officials estimate that the figure is less
 than hal f the number of actual incidents.
 Children.-Finland monitors the welfare of its children with extreme care. A tight
 network of maternity and child welfare clinics provide services to pregnant women
 and pre-school aged children free of charge.
 People with Disabilities.-Legislative measures protect the disabled from discrimi-
 nation. Statutes requiring accessibility to public places were enacted in the 1970's,
 but older buildings often lack neessary f    or the disabled and the new legis-
 lation is not retroactive. However, the Government will provide financing for the
 voluntary retrofitting of older buildings. Equipment for the disabled is not manda-
 tory on public transportation, but the government subsidizes improvements under-
 taken. Local governments maintain a transport service, which guarantees 18 trips
 per month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided with an inter-
 pretation service ranng from 120 to 240 hours per year depending on the serious-
 ness of the handicap. he severely disabled are guaranteed public housing.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the
 right to organize assemble peacefully, and strike-rights which are respected in
 practice in both the public and private sectors. Trade unions enjoy a protected sta-
 tus and play an important role in political and economic life. About 85 to 87 percent
 
 
 of the work force is organized. In Finland, employers are also organized into collec-
 tive bargaining associations. A 1-million-member blue-collar confederation, the
 Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), dominates the trade union
 movement. Two other central organizations cover white-collar, professional, and
 technical employees. All trade unions are democratically organized and managed
 and are independent of the government and of political parties.
 The Finnish Constitution guarantees the right to strike and strike actions by
 Finnish workers were decriminalized in 1922. In 1970 public sector employees were
 granted the right to strike. Strikes are restricted in certain cases, and cannot be
 called if a central incomes policy settlement (traditionally negotiated between union
 federations and central employers' organizations) is in effect. Also if more than 10
 employees ae involved in a strike, 2 weeks advance notification of the strike action
 is required. Trade unions are free to affiliate with and participate in international
 bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively exists in law and practice and is exercised extensively. Finland
 is a highly organized society in which over 80 percent of both workers and employ-
 ers are members of trade unions and employers' collective bargaiming associations.
 With very few exceptions, all collective agements since 1968 have been based on
 incomes policy agreements between central employees' and employers' organizations
 and the state. The central agreement covers the general level of wage and salary
 increases, other terms of employment, and a "social policy package" which provides
 for vacation, holidays, sick pay, maternity and paternity leave, travel costs, taxes,
 rents, etc. Workers are protected against anti-union discrimination and organization
 is encouraged in all sectors of the economy. Employers are required to reinstate
 workers if they are fired for union activities; however, this has not been a issue in
 recent years.
 Finland has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulso  Labor.-Paragraph 6 of the Finnish Con-
 stitution prohibits forced or compulsory a  r and is honored in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Compulsory education is legislated
 in Finland. Comprehensive school takes 9 years, with school starting at the age of
 7 years. It is legal to hire a 15-year old who has completed the mandatory course
 work, or who has had at least 10 years of schooling. The working hours of a 15-
 year old may not exceed 9 hours a day or 48 hours a week, and must fall between
 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. It is possible to hire a 14-year old, or a person in her or his
 fourteenth  ear if employed in light work during school holidays for a maximum
 of two-thirls of the hoiday period. The working hours of an employee under 15
 must not exceed 7 hours a day and 36 hours a week, and must fallbetween 7 a.m.
 and 7 p.m.- there must be a 14-hour period without work every 24 hours and a 38-
 hour period without work every week.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Finland has no legislated minimum wage, al-
 though all employers, including non-unionized employers, are required to meet the
 minimum wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in their industrial
 sector. These minimums suffice to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. In 1993 labor and management organizations reached agreement to
 allow payment of a sub-minimal wage to young workers or the long-term unem-
 ployed, on a temporary basis. This category of pay, which was little used in 1993,
 was authorized for 2 years as of June 15, 1993. The standard legal work week must
 not exceed 40 hours. Labor laws are enforced by the Government but the well-orga-
 nized local union leadership also plays a key role in ensuring employer compliance.
 The Government effectively enforces well-established occupational safety and health
 standards, and the unions also seek to ensure that workers' safety is protected. In
 1993 Finland made its regulations governing worker exposure to dangerous chemi-
 cals more stringent in conformity with European Community regulations. These reg-
 ulations are in the process of implementation.
