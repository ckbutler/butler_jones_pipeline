 GUATEMALA
 Guatemala is currently governed by Brigadier General Jose Efrain
 Rios Montt, who was asked by a group of young officers who
 staged a military coup on March 23, 1982 to lead a military
 junta. Alleging that fraud had taken place, the military junta
 rejected the results of the March 7 national election and
 dissolved the Congress. On April 28th it replaced the 1965
 Constitution with a new statute of government issued by decree.
 On June 9 Rios Montt dissolved the junta and assumed the title
 of President. As President and as Commander of the Armed Forces
 he directs the Guatemalan policy making process.
 On July I the Government decreed a state of siege which
 restricted civil and political liberties in Guatemala.
 Political party and labor union activities were formally
 suspended by the statute of government, although informal
 meetings have taken place. The press is prohibited from
 reporting on matters concerning the guerrilla insurgency, except
 for material provided by the executive branch. The press is
 also prohibited from reporting on political party activities.
 In practice, however, some articles other than those provided by
 the Government, do appear and there is some restrained criticism
 of government policy. The secrecy of the proceedings under the
 special courts established concurrently with the state of seige
 has raised serious concerns about due process, concerns
 heightened by four executions resulting from the secret
 proceedings.
 Guatemala has a 'dual economy' with a modern sector, which
 prospered through 1979, alongside a poorer traditional rural
 sector. Agriculture is the leading economic activity in output,
 employment, and foreign exchange earnings. Manufacturing for
 the local and Central American markets has grown rapidly in
 recent decades, but Guatemalan products have not proved
 generally competitive in the world markets. Government economic
 policy is predominantly laissez-faire. The public sector is
 small, and government revenue as a proportion of GDP is among
 the lowest in the hemisphere.
 The present state of the Guatemalan economy is poor. Sharply
 curtailed export earnings, loss of credit standing in world
 financial markets, declining investment, a collapse of tourism,
 and economic mismanagement in the previous government have
 adversely affected the Guatemalan economy, as have its efforts
 to overcome the guerrilla movement.
 Guatemalan governments have been confronted by guerrillas since
 the early 1960's. The armed opposition to the Government
 consists of four groups: the Guerrilla Army of the Poor; the
 Organization of the People in Arms; the Rebel Armed Forces; and
 the Guatemalan Communist Party. The .objective of these groups
 is to establish by force a 'revolutionary* government in
 Guatemala under their control.
 The previous government was relatively successful in combatting
 the guerrillas in the capital in 1981 and 1982, although bombing
 incidents were frequent. The urban guerrilla base has been
 further weakened by the RiosMontt Government and bombings,
 arson and guerrilla attacks in urban areas have been relatively
 infrequent in recent months.

 The guerrillas for years concentrated their efforts on gaining
 the support of the Indian population particularly in the
 relatively isolated western highlands. As the Guatemalan army
 challenged their control in this area, the guerrillas
 increasingly turned to violence and terror tactics against the
 Indians to force them to continue to provide material and
 logistic support. In attempting to suppress the guerrillas,
 Guatemalan governments, particularly the Lucas Garcia
 Government, which preceded Rios Montt, committed serious human
 rights abuses which affected large numbers of civilians who were
 caught between the Government and the guerrillas.
 With Rios Montt's assumption of power, the situation began to
 change. The Government publicly committed itself to ending the
 abuses of the Lucas Garcia Government. At the same time, it
 intensified its efforts to check the guerrillas through a
 variety of methods: a 30-day period of amnesty; an offer of
 unconditional talks, which was rejected by a guerrilla front
 group; intensified military operations, expansion of self
 defense forces (first established toward the end of the previous
 regime), provision of food, medicine and shelter for those who
 sought the government's protection, and a state of siege, still
 in effect, under which the Government suspended constitutional
 guarantees.
 In Guatemala's cities there has been a marked decrease in
 killings and disappearances since Rios Montt came to power,
 although some abuses continue to be reported. Some private
 citizens, including university students, were seized by members
 of the security forces on suspicion of having engaged in
 subversive activity. Some of these detentions were belatedly
 acknowledged by the Government and the persons were released.
 Others remain in detention. The guerrillas also have been
 responsible for kidnappings, including Rios Montt's nephew and
 Honduran President Suazo's daughter.
 The situation in the countryside, on the other hand, remained
 unclear for several months as the army fought to regain areas
 that had been largely abandoned to guerrilla control. Guerrilla
 violence against those suspected of aiding or supporting the
 Government reportedly increased. During this period it is
 believed that members of both the army and the guerrillas were
 responsible for killings of civilians. According to some
 reports large numbers of civilians lost their lives.
 In recent months it has become clearer both that the army has
 increased its control over areas formerly dominated by the
 guerrillas, and that its forces have begun to pay greater
 attention to the importance of proper treatment of the civilian
 population. Although there continued to be credible reports of
 human rights abuses by some military units, the overall conduct
 of the armed forces had improved by late in the year. The
 number of refugees and displaced persons increased with some
 communities and individuals seeking the army's protection and
 others-going to refugee camps in neighboring countries. The
 National Reconstruction Committee, with the assistance of the
 army and the World Food Program, has organized food and medical
 programs to aid the thousands of displaced persons in the areas
 of conflict.
 In an effort to give the predominantly Indian villagers some
 inducement to support the Government, the Rios Montt
 Administration has initiated what it calls its "beans and
 rifles" program whereby persons who support the Government are
 given the opportunity to work in rural and generally small-scale
 
 
 517
 public works projects for which they are paid in food. At the
 same time an estimated 400,000 men and youths have been
 incorporated into self-defense forces to protect their villages
 against the guerrillas and to assist the army in its efforts
 against the insurgents. Participation in the civil defense
 patrols is voluntary. Although pressure to join is great, the
 majority of villagers appear to support the program. Most
 recently, the government instituted a new program of 'housing,
 work, and food' to indicate a shift away from focussing on
 fighting the guerrillas to developing the country, particularly
 in the highlands.
 The attitude of the Government towards human rights criticism
 and groups has changed fundamentally under the Rios Montt
 Government. The present Government has permitted international
 inspection and has cooperated with organizations concerned with
 monitoring government human rights practices.
 The Rios Montt Government has begun the process toward
 transition to a democratic government by establishing an
 advisory Council of State. The Council began preparing decrees
 governing political parties, voter registration, and constituent
 assembly elections which will be sent to the President for
 approval or modification. President Rios Montt has said that
 these decrees will be promulgated on March 23, 1983, and that
 theiconstituent assembly will be inaugurated a year later. No
 date has been set for general elections. Although most
 political parties have refused to participate in the Council a
 cross-section of politically active citizens, including, for the
 first time, Indian representatives, have been appointed to it by
 the President.
 In the short term, human rights trends in Guatemala will be
 greatly influenced by the state of the guerrilla movement. If
 the guerrillas are overcome, and Government efforts to regain
 the confidence of the people and improve the conduct of the
 armed forces continue, the outlook is positive. In the longer
 term, the institutionalization of constitutional democracy, the
 first steps of which process have been announced, represents the
 best prospect for protecting individual human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 During 1982 the conflict between the Guatemalan Government and
 the guerrillas continued to result in the deaths of many
 civilians in addition to armed members of each party to the
 conflict. Clear attribution of responsibility for the deaths of
 noncombatants in the area of conflict is difficult. Government
 forces have been responsible for some of those deaths. It is
 also true that some villages that have organized local civil
 defense forces have been objects of guerrilla retaliation.
 Since Rios Montt came to power in March 1982 there has been a
 decrease in the level of killing. This has been most notable in
 the cities where the frequent disappearances, generally followed
 by torture and murder, that occurred frequently under his
 predecessor, have been sharply curtailed, though not eliminated
 completely. It is not possible to unequivocably assign
 responsibility for most of these killings. Some have been
 committed by right-wing political elements. For some other
 deaths, particularly those of Government officials, the
 guerrillas have claimed responsibility.
 
 
 518
 The situation in the countryside is less clear. Particularly
 during the first months of the Rios Montt Administration, as the
 army began to move into areas previously controlled by the
 guerrillas, there were numerous allegations of atrocities.
 Since many of the people reportedly killed were living in
 scattered settlements in the Guatemalan highlands it is
 difficult to verify many of the reports of large scale
 killings. It has been established that some of the alleged
 atrocities never occurred. In most cases known to have
 occurred, it has not been possible to clearly determine whether
 the guerrillas or the army was responsible. Where it has been
 possible to assign responsibility, it appears more likely that
 in the majority of cases the insurgents, who have increasingly
 turned to terror in recent months in an effort to force the
 villagers to support them, have been guilty. In some cases,
 such as the alleged massacre in the town of Juleque in late
 November 1982, the reports have been shown to be
 guerrilla-inspired disinformation. Other reports indicate
 government units have been responsible for noncombatant deaths
 and human rights abuses.
 Reports of incidents in which noncombatants are alleged to have
 been killed by the army have diminished in recent months as the
 army has regained control over large areas previously controlled
 by the guerrillas. The army reportedly has been making greater
 efforts to distinguish between active guerrillas and villagers
 who may have been forced to support the guerrilla movement.
 Guatemalan Government officials have stated that the Government
 of Guatemala has begun investigations of those cases implicating
 elements of the Guatemalan military.
 The Government promulgated a new military code of conduct in
 August, stressing the importance of humane treatment of
 civilians, and reportedly provided each soldier with a pocket
 copy of it. The military penal code forbids the mistreatment of
 civilians and mandates that all noncombatants be treated with
 respect. Soldiers have reportedly been punished for mistreating
 civilians,.
 On January 6, 1983 a guerrilla group (ORPA) issued a statement
 in Havana claiming it had inflicted 1160 casualties on
 government forces in 1982. It also claimed its forces had
 occupied 186 farms, towns and communities in 1982. The
 guerrilla groups issued bulletins and other publications through
 Havana in which they recounted the number of casualtiep they
 have inflicted, acts of sabotage committed, and other activities
 such as assassinations/executions/ village takeovers; bombings
 of bridges, municipal buildings, police stations, and electrical
 substations; and burnings of farms, crops and buses. Guerrilla
 groups have claimed responsibility for attacks on various
 embassies in Guatemala City, including a rocket attack on the US
 Embassy in March 1982.
 On September 17, 1982 the Government executed four individuals
 who had been tried and convicted by a special tribunal for
 attacks on elements of the National Police. The speed and
 secrecy of the proceedings prompted serious questions of due
 process.
 Political figures of all persuasions were the target of violence
 in the early months of 1982, prior to the military coup. On
 January 16, the Secretary General of the Christian Democratic
 Party in Retalhuleu Department, who also was mayor of
 Champerico, was shot to death. On February 4 the campaign
 manager of the winning candidate was killed by assassins. The
 
 
 519
 mayor of San Pedro Jocopilas, Quiche department, was shot and
 killed on February 6.' He was a member of the Revolutionary
 Party, one of the three parties in the coalition supporting the
 winning candidate. On February 7 the Christian Democrat mayor
 of Chichicastenango was killed. None of the killers has been
 identified.
 A US citizen-Brother James A. Miller of the La Salle Brothers,
 was shot to death in Huehuetenango on February 12, 1982. His
 killers have not yet been found. Those responsible for the 1981
 murders of an American priest, Father Stanley Rother, and an
 American Mennonite missionary, John Troyer, have not yet been
 identified and brought to justice.
 On May 27, the Episcopal Conference of Bishops of Guatemala made
 public a statement condemning the "massacres of numerous
 campesino and Indian families." The statement blamed 'elements
 of the extreme right and extreme left, who attempt to justify
 these murders."
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances have averaged about 26 per month during 1982. Of
 the yearly total of 319 victims, 26 were later released or
 reappeared. The Guatemalan penal code stipulates a prison
 sentence of eight to fifteen years for kidnapping or abduction
 and a death sentence if the victim dies. The law of the special
 tribunals, set up concurrently with the state of siege to try
 cases-of subversion, imposes the death sentence for kidnapping.
 Although the identity and political coloration of most of the
 abductors is not known, both the Government and far left have
 admitted to some, after the fact. The Rios Montt Government has
 taken steps to try to enforce official accountability for
 illegal abductions. For example, the Government disbanded a
 group of secret agents known as "command six* which was alleged
 to have been responsible for many kidnappings and deaths during
 the Lucas Garcia regime. In addition, 200 officers of the
 National Police have been dismissed of whom 85 have been sent to
 special courts on charges of various criminal acts.
 Nevertheless, abductions by the Government have continued. In
 June 1982, the Government announced it was holding 12 students
 who allegedly had been involved in subversive activities. On
 June 9, the Government released 16 students to parental
 custody. On the other hand, a number of kidnap victims, on the
 basis of their identity, are targets of leftist terrorists.
 These include government officials and their children,
 businessmen, farm owners, and farm managers. For example, two
 days before the national el-ection a prominent Guatemala City
 newspaper editor was kidnapped by one of the four major
 guerrilla groups and held for several months and only released
 after conditions had been met for publication of a communist
 manifesto in the international press and payment of a large
 ransom. Publication of a manifesto was also a condition for the
 release of children of the president's brother, the Interior
 Minister, and the President of Honduras.
 c.   Torture
 The civil and criminal codes expressly prohibit both physical
 and mental torture. Both the nullified constitution and the
 present statute of government provide for the punishment of
 public officials or employees who engage in such practices.
 Nevertheless, the Guatemalan press has reported numerous
 incidents in which bodies were found showing evidence of having
 been tortured; in most instances, no one has been able to
 
 
 520
 establish the identity of the perpetrators. Since the March 23
 coup, there has been a marked decline in the reported incidents
 of torture. It is alleged that police authorities used harsh
 interrogation methods in the case of Dr. Juan Jose Hurtado, whom
 they abducted on June 24; the Government released him on July
 29, and he subsequently left for the United States.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The main prison near Guatemala City is overcrowded; built to
 hold 700 prisoners, it currently houses some 1800. There are no.
 indications of malnutrition or inadequate feeding. Family
 members are allowed to bring food and clothing to prisoners.
 Reports of prisoner abuse are infrequent. Better-behaved
 prisoners are allowed individual unbarred rooms within a
 cell-block. These men are allowed televisions, radios, and
 other amenities. The more dangerous or unmanageable prisoners
 are kept in barred cells and in more crowded conditions.
 Inmates are permitted to buy luxuries not supplied by the
 facility. Social class, race, or religion do not appear to be
 factors in treatment accorded individual prisoners.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Until April 1982 Guatemala's Constitution of 19.65 provided for
 protection against arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 Nevertheless, throughout this period a considerable number of
 extra-judicial executions, political assassinations and unsolved
 murders took place. The criminal justice system under former
 President Lucas Garcia (1978-1982) was often unable to guarantee
 due process. Judges shied away from political cases and
 constitutional rights were, in fact, often ignored.
 The rights and privileges of Guatemalans under President Rios
 Montt's Government are to be found in the April 28 statute of
 government which closely resembles the cancelled 1965
 constitution. The July 1 state of siege restricts many of the
 personal guarantees listed in the statute of government such as
 the right to habeas corpus and the prohibition of arrests
 without a warrant. A separate decree also issued on July 1
 established courts of special jurisdiction. These courts are an
 integral part of the executive branch and not part of an
 independent judiciary. These courts can order the arrest or
 preventive detention of any person suspected of having committed
 crimes against the state or public order. There is no right of
 habeas corpus for individuals so arrested; freedom on bail is
 forbidden and the trials are held secretly. Reportedly, the
 judges in the special courts are civilian lawyers and military
 officers. A decree provides for a public defender to be
 appointed for the defendant. Whether these structures are
 enforced is not known due to the secrecy of the proceedings.
 These special courts are required by law to hold preliminary
 hearings, evaluate evidence, release prisoners for want of
 evidence, and turn others over to a hearing, after which
 sentence is passed.
 The number of persons held in preventive detention under special
 court jurisdiction is not known. On September 16, 1982, the
 Government announced its findings in the cases of 40 prisoners
 tried by a special court. Twenty-two were found not guilty and
 freed; eight were released pending review; six were held for
 sentencing; and four were condemned to death and executed on
 September 17. President Rios Montt announced on October 25,
 1982 that further executions were stayed pending establishment
 of review and appeal procedures for prisoners condemned to death
 by the special courts. This action, he said, was in accord with
 
 
 521
 the recommendations of the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission. By the end of the year the Government announced
 that it had established an appellate process.
 f. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The regular judiciary, as opposed to the special courts, is
 statutorily independent of the executive and military. Persons
 subject to the regular criminal and civil courts enjoy the
 rights of habeas corpus and freedom on bail. The majority of
 criminal cases continue to be heard in regular courts.
 Every defendant in the Guatemalan judicial system including the
 special courts has the right to counsel. In the regular courts,
 a defendant must be charged or released within 48 hours of his
 arrest. This rule does not apply to the courts of special
 jurisdiction. According to the Government, the proceedings of
 the special courts are not made public for security reasons;
 therefore, it is not known whether the statutory guarantees are
 observed in these cases.
 Prior to the coup of March 23 many judges were intimidated by
 death threats. Political murders, including those of judges and
 lawyers, went unsolved. According to press reports and public
 announcements, since the March 23 coup approximately 50 former
 officials of the Lucas Garcia Government have been brought to
 trial for cases of alleged corruption. Of this total, 14 were
 acquitted, 6 released pending a final decision, 3 convicted and
 25 are still awaiting trial. One official has taken political
 asylum in a foreign embassy. One escaped from prison and an
 unknown number fled the country to avoid possible prosecution.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Both the Constitution of 1965 and the 1982 statute of government
 prohibit invasion of the home unless authorized by a warrant.
 Nevertheless, the state of siege permits searches without
 warrants, and the Government has used the state of siege to
 cordon off sections of Guatemala City and conduct house to house
 searches.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Under the state of siege freedom of speech and press are
 restricted. The Government issued regulations enjoining the
 press from publishing information about the war, guerrilla
 activities, and politics. A separate regulation placed radio
 and television broadcasting under the control of the Directorate
 General of Broadcasting. The regulation has not been strictly
 enforced. Some criticism of government policies appears in the
 press and on television and radio. Political parties have
 received considerable press attention, especially during their
 dispute with President Rios Montt on the nature and function of
 the Council of State. Some joint letters from the political
 parties to the President have been published in full, describing
 their dissatisfaction with some of Rios Montt's policies. In
 addition to bulletins issued by the Government on the situation
 in the countryside, the press has sometimes published its own
 independent reports.
 Threats and violence against journalists have all but
 disappeared since the March coup. The last such incident was on
 
 
 522
 March 5, 1982, when the co-owner and editorial columnist of the
 leading morning daily "Prensa Libre" was kidnapped and held for
 five months by the Guatemalan Communist Party. Prior to the
 coup, on February 5, the publisher and editor of "La Nacion" was
 murdered after assuming the job of campaign director for General
 Guevara, a candidate in the March elections.
 Guatemalan journalists have three associations which continue to
 operate freely. The press associations declined to nominate a
 member and alternate to the Council of State because their
 by-laws forbid political activity. The President then named two
 well-known journalists, one from each of the two largest
 associations, to the Council.
 If a journalist is accused of treason or sedition based on his
 public statements or writings, he has recourse to a special
 hearing before he can be turned over to a regular criminal
 court. This hearing is conducted by a panel composed of
 representatives from the press association, the lawyers
 association, and city or municipal officials. Officials from
 the central Government cannot be members of this special panel.
 Th'is panel is obligated to review the charges and decide if the
 evidence warrants turning the accused over to a criminal court.
 This system is still in force.
 Despite the state of siege and its attendant restrictions on
 internal reporting on subversive activities, the army has
 invited foreign journalists to the combat zones and these
 invitations are often accepted. These journalists can freely
 report on their observations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Both the abrogated constitution of 1965 and the April 1982
 statute of government guarantee the right of peaceful assembly
 and association. During the election campaign of 1982, many
 such meetings and assemblies were held as part of the various
 party campaign efforts. Under the July 1 state of siege,
 however, the right to peaceful assembly has been suspended. The
 executive can suspend the functioning of any entity, group, or
 organization that is deemed contrary to public order and
 security. Military authorities have the right to dissolve by
 force any meeting or demonstration in which participants
 brandish or use weapons. Unarmed groups may be dissolved by
 force after two clear warnings to disperse.
 Only 10 to 15 percent of the work force in Guatemala is
 rganized into labor unions. There are some sectors, however,
 in which the workers are highly organized: telecommunications,
 light and power, longshoremen, breweries, banks, and
 entertainment.
 Both the nullified constitution and the statute of government
 provide for the right of workers and employers to organize
 freely, but limit the purposes of such organizations to economic
 protection and social betterment. These organizations and their
 directors may not take part in partisan politics. Workers may
 strike and employers may use the lock-out, exercised in
 accordance with law; public service companies may not do so.
 Under the state of siege, however, these rights do not exist.
 Nevertheless, the Government permits executive-level union
 meetings.
 Before the March 23 coup, the ever-present danger of physical
 violence, death, and/or disappearance of prominent labor leaders
 
 
 523
 brought the union movement to a virtual standstill. Since then
 the situation has improved significantly. On June 21, 1982, the
 leftwing National Workers' Center, in full-page ads in local
 newspapers marking the second anniversary of the 1980 kidnapping
 of 27 directors of that federation, blamed the former Lucas
 regime for these disappearances and criticized the Rios Montt
 Government for the continuation of violence against the
 Guatemalan people.
 In previous years, the International Labor Organization (ILO) in
 Geneva censured the Government for failure to respond to charges
 of "violation of freedom of assembly.' At the ILO conference in
 Geneva ending June 23, 1982, the committee on application of
 conventions and recommendations, while commending the new
 Government and noting that the attitude was much improved, did
 not lift the sanction. The Guatemalan Labor Minister told the
 ILO that the new regime would do everything possible to comply
 with Convention 87 and to cooperate with the ILO.
 Unions and professional organizations maintain relations with
 related international bodies. The American Institute for Free
 Labor Development in 1982 assigned a new resident country
 program director after an absence of two years, and the
 organization is presently engaged in a full range of courses for
 Guatemalan union leaders. There have been no reports in 1982 of
 intimidation or persecution of professional groups, including
 scientific-bodies, lawyers' associations, and other independent
 groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guatemala has no state or officially sanctioned religion. The
 country is approximately 75 percent Roman Catholic; the rest of
 the population is divided among various Protestant and other
 groups. By far the strongest of these other groups are the
 evangelical sects.
 Open practice of religion is permitted. Evangelical Protestants
 are active and their membership is claimed to be steadily
 increasing. Prior to the coup of March 23, however, Catholic
 priests suffered from sporadic but violent persecution. It was
 believed by many that government security forces were
 responsible for the majority of these repressive actions.
 Open practice of religion in areas of insurgent activity is
 still not safe. Some guerrillas in El Quiche, for example, have
 reportedly threatened to kill evangelical villagers if the
 latter are caught proselytizing. The Roman Catholic Church is
 reestablishing itself in conflict areas; it has assigned new
 bishops in the departments of El Quiche and El Peten.
 Conversion from one church to another is unrestricted.
 Adherence to a particular faith confers no advantage or
 disadvantage. President Rios Montt has appointed a small number
 of his fellow members of the Christian Church of the Word to
 advisory and presidential staff positions. Members of
 evangelical churches receive no advantages in dealing with the
 Government. The same is true for members of all faiths. The
 President addresses the people of Guatemala on national radio
 and television every Sunday. He includes frequent references to
 his religious beliefs in these presentations.
 Prior to the coup of March 23, certain members of the Roman
 Catholic Church were in distinct disfavor with the Government of
 Guatemala. Foreign Catholic priests and nuns were singled out
 
 
 524
 for criticism by certain government and military officials.
 Between January 1, 1982 and the coup of March 23, Catholic
 workers in various areas of the country received threats or
 warnings to leave Guatemala for their own safety. Two priests
 were seized by government security forces on January 5, 1982;
 they were released on January 7 with a warning to leave the
 country.
 In general, under the Lucas Garcia regime the Catholic Church in
 Guatemala was insecure in its status and uncertain of its
 future. There have been changes since the coup of March 23.
 President Rios Montt has stated that he would welcome the return
 of priests and religious workers who were driven out of the
 country by the violence, provided they are in good standing with
 the Catholic Church.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country has been restricted in a
 number of ways because of the continuing problem of guerrilla
 and terrorist action. Certain areas of the country have been
 heavily infiltrated by insurgents, and travel in these areas is
 dangerous. Buses have been stopped; people robbed and at times
 killed. Guerrilla bands have interdicted highways and back
 roads, making travel within certain rural areas of the country
 dangerous. This situation is gradually improving as the army
 improves its control in the countryside. As a result of the
 fighting, a large number of rural residents fled from their
 homes during the past year. Estimates of internally displaced
 persons during the past year range from 30,000 to 250,000. An
 additional 20,000 to 25,000 persons have sought refuge in
 southern Mexico and 600 in Honduras. Many of the internally
 displaced have returned to their villages with the encouragement
 of the government. Some of the refugees in Mexico have returned.
 The Constitution of 1965 and the 1982 statute which replaced it
 both guaranteed freedom of movement, but under the state of
 siege such freedoms have been suspended. The Government retains
 the right to search any vehicle and to restrict transit or
 parking of vehicles in any area.
 Normal emigration continues. The number of Guatemalans who
 travel abroad has not noticeably decreased. There are economic
 rather than political restraints on foreign travel as exchange
 reserves have fallen.
 Guatemalan citizenship may be suspended as a result of a final
 conviction of a felony. This suspension terminates upon
 completion of the sentence or upon amnesty or full pardon.
 Guatemala does not force refugees or expatriates from other
 countries to return to their native country if they do not wish
 to do so. Large numbers of Nicaraguans and Salvadorans live in
 Guatemala.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Guatemala is ruled by a military Government headed by
 General Rios Montt. That Government took power in a military
 coup d'etat on March 23, 1982. The year 1982 began in the midst
 of a national election campaign that culminated in the March 7
 elections. Four presidential candidates representing seven
 political parties participated in a hotly-contested campaign.
 The eighth registered party participated at the municipal and
 
 
 525
 congressional level, not fielding or endorsing a presidential
 candidate. Because of the wide selection of candidates and a
 broadbased effort to register and turn out voters, nearly 1.1
 million persons reportedly voted. This was a significant
 increase over the previous elections in 1978. General Anibal
 Guevara, who ran on a coalition ticket of three parties and who
 was closely associated with the previous Government, was
 declared the winner with slightly over 35 percent of the
 official total, followed by three civilian candidates with 25,
 21, and 9 percent respectively. About ten percent of the votes
 were blank or declared null.
 The three losing candidates and their parties alleged that the
 elections were fradulent and formed a post-election front
 against the 'fraud." They sent a letter of petition to
 President Lucas Garcia requesting that the elections be
 annulled. The military coup took place on March 23. The coup,
 led by junior officers, installed a three-man junta headed by
 Brigadier General Jose Efrain Rios Montt, who had been on
 inactive military status for several years. The other two junta
 members named were Brigadier General Horacio Maldonado Schaad
 and Colonel Franciso Luis Gordillo Martinez. That junta
 remained in place until June 9, when Rios Montt announced that
 he had accepted the resignations of the other two junta
 members. At the same time, it was announced by the army that
 General Rios Montt had assumed the title of President of the
 Republic.
 Following the military coup on March 23, the junta dissolved the
 Congress and rejected the results df the March 7 elections. By
 a decree of April 28, the junta issued a statute of government
 which replaced the 1965 constitution and suspended political
 party and labor union activities. The statute declared that
 public power would be exercised by the military junta, which
 would perform the executive and legislative (but not judicial)
 functions, and would be responsible for drafting, promulgating
 and implementing laws. All laws, not specifically cancelled by
 the statute remained in effect. In this latter category are
 included public safety and criminal law.
 The new military Government offered amnesty to all guerrillas
 who turned themselves in to the army, the Catholic Church, the
 Guatemalan Red Cross, or other specified institutions during the
 month of June. On June 15 President Rios Montt announced his
 willingness to conduct a dialogue with guerrilla leaders. The
 dialogue was rejected by a spokesman for the Democratic Front
 Against Repression. The Government then announced that,
 following the one-month amnesty period, a state of siege would
 be applied to bring "order and legality* to the Government's
 anti-guerrilla effort. By a series of decrees the Government
 implemented the state of siege on July 1.
 The state of siege permitted the Government to order a partial
 mobilization of army veterans to bolster military strength;
 required employers to guarantee reemployment of workers
 mobilized by the army; authorized temporary appropriation of
 private property, as needed, with equitable renumeration;
 cancelled licenses to bear arms and prohibited sale of arms and
 explosives, except as authorized; authorized search of houses
 and vehicles without court orders; established government
 control over radio and television broadcasting; and modified
 certain individual guarantees that had been enunciated in the
 statute of government, including the imposition of stricter
 control over entry and exit from the country, permission for
 gatherings of more than four persons, suspension of trade union
 
 
 526
 activity, the right to open mail, detention without written
 order, suspension of habeas corpus, and suspension of the right
 to petition government. Under the state of siege, the President
 would govern as commanding general of the army through the
 Ministry of Defense. The state of siege has subsequently been
 renewed each month for thirty-day periods.
 On September 15, the Guatemalan Government formed a Council of
 State composed of 30 members and 30 alternates representing
 various sectors of the society. The largest component of the
 council are the 20 persons representing Guatemala's Indian
 groups. The other 40 persons represent the association of
 municipalities, the national university, private universities,
 bankers, urban workers, professional associations, press
 cooperatives, women's associations, judiciary, agricultural
 workers, agriculture, Chamber of Industry, Chamber of Commerce,
 and a political party, the United Front of the Revolution. The
 Council functions strictly as an advisory body and partisan
 political activity remains prohibited. Within the Council,
 three commissions have so far been established for political,
 economic and human rights matters. The Council is drafting the
 electoral laws concerning voter registration, political party
 organization and constituent assembly elections. These are to
 be promulgated on March 23, 1983.
 There are both civilian and military ministers and both civilian
 and military officials in other government offices and
 agencies. The Supreme Court and other courts were not
 reorganized following the military coup. Appointments to
 judicial positions are made by the Government in consultation
 with professional bodies, such as the college of lawyers and the
 law faculties of the universities. Appointments to ministerial
 and other government posts, including the Council of State, were
 also in many cases made following such consultation. The
 indigenous members of the Council were selected in consultation
 with leaders of the various ethnic groups.
 Because of the unpopularity of the Lucas Garcia Government and
 the belief shared by a significant sector of the population that
 the March 7 elections had been affected by fraud, the military
 coup of March 23 was well received by many in Guatemala. This
 acceptance initially was shared by the opposition political
 parties which had formed the post-election front, and they
 publicly acknowledged their role in bringing about the coup.
 These opposition political parties expected the new military
 Government to quickly establish a timetable for new elections
 but this did not occur. Subsequently Rio Montt announced that
 decrees concerning voter registration, political party
 organization, and constituent assembly elections would be issued
 on March 23, 1983. He has said that the election of a
 constituent assembly will take place early in 1984. No date has
 yet been announced for presidential elections and a return to
 democratic constitutional government.
 Although political parties were formally suspended under the
 statute of government, they have continued to operate in a
 limited manner and have issued public statements critical of the
 Government. Representatives of the four opposition parties met
 periodically with President Rios Montt to express their concerns
 about the political process. These parties were invited to
 participate in the Council of State, but elected not to do so.
 One opposition party, not a member of the front, did
 participate. None of the three parties that had supported the
 candidacy of General Guevara in the March 7 election was
 permitted to join the Council. On September 13 the
 
 
 527
 four 'United Opposition Parties' reconstituted themselves as an
 *Interparty Constitutional Fronto and presented their platform
 to the press in a document signed by directors of each party.
 This document called for a return to a constitutional system and
 for a 'permanent democratic forum" of all representative sectors
 of society.
 Two arrest cases involving political figures have been reported
 in connection with alleged coup plotting. On August 14 and 15,
 the press reported the arrests of eight persons allegedly
 connected with the National Liberation Movement and National
 Authentic Center political parties and speculated that these
 arrests and a search for the vice president of the National
 Liberation Movement party were related to coup plotting. All
 eight were subsequently released in September and exonerated of
 any charges. The National Liberation Movement vice president
 was publicly disavowed by his party and is believed to be
 outside Guatemala. On October 14, the Guatemalan press reported
 the kidnapping of a member of the right-wing National Liberation
 Movement party who had been a candidate for office in the March
 7 national:elections. On October 15, the national police
 announced that this individual had been detained and would be
 consigned to a court. No charges were made public. Col.
 Francisco Gordillo, one of the three original members of the
 March junta, was detained, cashiered from the army and
 subsequently released from house arrest. He is appealing to a
 civilian appellate court the p imary findings of a military
 tribunal with regard to participation in coup plotting.
 In mid-1981 an Office of Women's Affairs was created in the
 Ministry of Labor. This office was charged with promoting the
 welfare of women and their participation in the Government.
 Within the military Government that came into power on March 23,
 women have been appointed to a number of important posts. Four
 women were named to the Council of State, including one from the
 Office of Women's Affairs. One of the four was also given the
 position of vice president of the Economic Commission of the
 Council. A woman was named to the Supreme Court by the military
 Government, the first such appointment in this country's
 history, and a woman was appointed to a lower court as judge.
 The governor of the Department of Jutiapa is a woman, and
 several women were selected as mayors throughout the country.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Lucas Garcia Government did not invite international
 observers to monitor the March 7 national election, but
 permitted the international press and diplomatic corps to travel
 freely around the country to observe the actual voting on
 election day.
 Prior to the military coup, the Guatemalan Government was not
 forthcoming in its relations with the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC). On March 11, 1982, the UNHRC adopted
 a resolution calling for the appointment of a special rapporteur
 for Guatemala. He was given the mandate to make a thorough
 study of the human rights situation to be presented to the UNHRC
 at its 1983 session. In a letter dated August 31, 1982 the
 Guatemalan permanent representative to the UNHRC stated that his
 Government would extend full cooperation when the rapporteur was
 named. At its regular annual session which ended on September
 10, 1982, the UNHRC Sub-Commission on Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a highly
 
 
 528
 critical resolution on Guatemala. Subsequent to this, a
 rapporteur was suggested by the Commission and accepted by the
 Guatemalan Government. The UNHRC has not yet named the special
 rapporteur.
 The new Guatemalan Government that came to power in March 1982
 expressed its willingness to cooperate with human rights
 organizations and publicly invited them to visit Guatemala.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) responded to
 a formal invitation from the Guatemalan Government and visited
 Guatemala between September 15 and 20, 1982. The Government
 extended full cooperation during the visit, which included trips
 to the areas of conflict and private meetings. President Rios
 Montt announced that, pursuant to a specific recommendation by
 the IAHRC that procedures governing the special tribunals be
 improved, particularly appeals procedures, before carrying out
 death sentences, he had suspended further executions by firing
 squads. Later the Government issued a decree which established
 an appeal procedure.
 -Representatives of the American Association for the Advancement
 of Science visited Guatemala in July to investigate the case of
 Dr. Juan Jose Hurtado, a Guatemalan pediatrician arrested on
 June 24.  Dr. Hurtado was released into the custody of the Red
 Cross and the Catholic Church on July 29 and left the country in
 August.
 A delegation from the Americas WatA4 Committee visited Guatemala
 in October 1982 and met with senior officials of the
 Government. The committee visited rural areas. A similar visit
 was made by representatives of the US National Council of
 Churches in November. The subsequent reports of both
 organizations were very critical of the human rights practices
 of the present Government.
 The Government has stated publicly and at the highest levels
 that international human rights observers are free to visit
 Guatemala at any time. The Government has specifically rejected
 charges by Amnesty International of government complicity in the
 massacre of Indians and peasant farmers. A number of Government
 spokesmen have stated that Amnesty International may visit the
 country to investigate these charges. Amnesty International
 says that, consistent with its normal practice prior to visiting
 a country, it has written to the Guatemalan Government regarding
 its human rights concerns. Amnesty International states that in
 the absence of a substantive response from the Guatemalan
 Government to Amnesty International's formal communications,
 Amnesty International has taken no decision to approach the
 Government with a request that it receive such a visit.
 The Guatemalan Red Cross, although autonomous, receives
 financial assistance from the Guatemalan Government and performs
 a wide spectrum of humanitarian services, including assistance
 to displaced persons. Two government organizations, the
 National Reconstruction Committee and the National Emergency
 Committee, are responsible for coordinating developmental and
 humanitarian programs of private voluntary and international
 organizations.
 There are no other private Guatemalan human rights organizations
 active in the country. The Roman Catholic Episcopal Conference
 of Bishops issued public statements on human rights. Other
 organizations, such as CARITAS, are active in humanitarian work
 in Guatemala.
 
 
 529
 Freedom House, in its 1982 report, classified Guatemala as "Not
 Free'.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Guatemalan economy provides some, but not all, basic
 economic and social necessities to the population of 7.5 million
 (as of mid-1982). The distribution of income, $1,160 per capita
 GNP in 1980, is skewed; a small percentage enjoy living
 standards commensurate with developed countries, while over half
 the population remains in traditional agriculture with low cash
 incomes from seasonal agricultural labor and cottage industry.
 In 1977 the calorie supply available for consumption met 98
 percent of nutritional requirements. The supply of staples,
 corn, and beans was sufficient in 1981 and 1982 at controlled
 prices. Severe nutritional want occurred in 1982 in local areas
 hard hit by the fighting.. Generally the poorest half of the
 population suffers from a deficit of 40 percent of the minimum
 daily calorie requirement. Employment generated by economic
 growth surpassed the rate of population growth (3.1 percent in
 1980) from the 1950's through the 1970's, but dropped sharply in
 1981 and 1982. Official figures place unemployment and
 underemployment (mainly the latter) at about 40 percent in
 1982. Health services and sanitation are fair to good
 (depending on income level) in Guatemala City and a few other
 urban centers, but generally poor in rural areas. Despite
 considerable public investment in potable water projects,
 medical centers and clinics, financed with the assistance of the
 Inter American Development Bank, only about 15 percent of the
 lowest income group living in the rural areas benefits. In
 1975, 39 percent of the population had access to safe water,
 primarily in urban areas. The infant mortality rate was a high
 66 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth was 58.9
 years in 1981. The Ministry of Health has undertaken a pilot
 program in three departments to provide basic primary health
 care on a wide scale.
 Economic growth over the past several decades under a free
 enterprise economic system has financed investment in the
 infrastructure necessary to create an integrated national
 economic system, but the growth that has taken place has left
 the contrast between the modern and traditional sectors of
 Guatemalan society increasingly pronounced. The contrast
 involves race, language, and culture, as well as income levels.
 For the most part, the Government has followed a laissez-faire
 social policy toward the Indian peoples. The indigenous groups
 have maintained their cultures by choice, but times are
 changing. Population pressure on the land, contact with
 economic development, and other pressures are causing a steady
 drift from traditional into non-Indian society.
 There are no legal barriers to cultural change or social
 mobility, but programs to assist that difficult process are far
 from adequate. One of the major steps taken in recent years,
 the tripling of the minimum wage in 1980, has been eroded by
 declining employment opportunities in the current recession.
 Since March 1982, through reprogramming and utilization of
 external resources, the Government has developed an immediate
 impact investment plan for the Indian highlands, which has been
 traditionally excluded from the benefits of prior economic
 growth. The National Reconstruction Committee has been granted
 funds to provide minimum shelter and food-for-work to persons
 displaced through political strife. The Government has begun
 implementing an access road project using hand labor to link the
 
 
 530
 Ixil triangle with the 'road network servicing the highlands and
 to create employment opportunities.
 Primary education and adult literacy have received moderate
 attention and public expenditure in recent years. The adult
 literacy rate may have improved somewhat from a figure of 46.1
 percent in 1973, but primary school enrollment was only 69
 percent in 1980.
 Literacy is a particularly great problem in Guatemala. Half the
 population is of Indian culture, having to learn Spanish (if at
 all) aq a second language. During the past year, the Government
 approved $4.7 million over four years as counterpart for a $3.0
 million AID loan that will expand non-formal education. This
 loan complements on-going projects to develop a system to teach
 Spanish as a second language to otherwise monolingual Indian
 children and a national literacy campaign begun by the prior
 Government. Construction of new rural schools has continued in
 the highlands and in the northern transversal strip.
 While adequate shelter for the poor continues to be a major
 problem, low-cost housing programs have been planned with the
 support of international donors. The Government has programmed
 $10 million to match a foreign assistance loan of $10 million
 for low-income housing solutions. In addition, the Government
 has been supplying minimum construction needs to permit the
 rehabilitation of 2,352 dwellings severely damaged by flooding
 in September 1982.
 In the agriculture sector, the present Government has continued
 the activities of its predecessor in opening large tracts of
 government lands for colonization. The development plan
 supports a shift to higher value agricultural crops as well as
 agro-industrial products. Because low cash crop prices have
 exhausted the working capital of many farmers, the Government
 has created a fund to guarantee commercial bank loans to the
 agricultural sector and has injected some liquidity into the
 bankihg system earmarked for agriculture.
