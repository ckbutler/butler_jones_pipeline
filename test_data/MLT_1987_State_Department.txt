 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. Executive power is
 vested in the President who appoints as Prime Minister the
 leadef of the party which gains a plurality of seats in the
 quinquennial election for the unicameral legislature. A 1987
 constitutional amendment stipulated that the party obtaining
 the majority of votes will receive a majority of seats in the
 legislature. The outcome of the May 9, 1987 election brought
 the Nationalist Party to power by a small majority (with 50.9
 percent of the vote) after 16 years of Labor Party rule. The
 transition of government generally was orderly.
 The Maltese economy is heavily dependent on its ability to
 export and on tourism and other service industries.
 Security is maintained by the Malta police which is under the
 temporary leadership of the commander of the armed forces
 until a new commissioner of police is named. The commander of
 the armed forces was placed in charge after the police failed
 to control a riot in June 1987 during which persons associated
 with the opposition Labor Party ransacked the law courts. The
 Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Minister of Justice, has
 jurisdiction over the police.
 The human rights situation in Malta improved gradually after
 the May 1987 election, and by the end of 1987 the political
 atmosphere was appreciably less tense. The new Government
 took several steps to improve Malta's human rights performance,
 including establishment of a commission to investigate and
 remedy past, present, and any future injustices; appointment
 of a bipartisan parliamentary select committee to examine ways
 to strengthen democracy in Malta's Constitution, specifically
 the role of the President and the independence of the
 judiciary; and in the area of church-state relations. The
 courts have upheld the constitutional right of free assembly.
 Additionally, the new Government has accepted all provisions
 of the European Convention on Human Rights and has signed the
 European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman
 or Degrading Treatment. Maltese delegations to the
 International Labor Organization now include representatives
 from independent unions. The local emmigrants commission now
 formally represents the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) in the handling of refugees in Malta.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No known incidents of political killing occurred during 1987,
 although preelection violence resulted in several injuries.
 The forier commissioner of police was relieved of his position
 and arrested in November. He was arraigned on charges of
 murder involving the death of a person in police custody in
 1980, of giving false testimony, of having bribed witnesses to
 give false testimony, and of having prevented other persons
 from giving evidence or information.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment.
 Several allegations of police beatings and ill-treatment of
 prisoners were brought to trial in 1987. Some allegations
 were dismissed for lack of evidence; in at least one case,
 charges against a criminal defendant were dropped because of
 evidence that his confession was forcibly obtained. No
 judgments have been handed down as yet in any of these cases.
 Certain police officers accused of abuse of authority have
 been removed from active service pending further investigation.
 On November 26, 1987, Malta joined 18 other member states of
 the Council of Europe in signing the European Convention for
 the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment.
 The convention authorizes an-international committee of
 independent experts to visit all places where persons are
 detained by public authority in order to ensure that they are
 not subjected to torture or degrading treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice.
 Any police officer above the rank of inspector may issue an
 arrest warrant without the need of a court order. The police
 may, on suspicion, arrest a person for questioning, and there
 were press reports of such arrests following a spate of
 bombings in June 1987. Within 48 hours, persons so arrested
 must be brought before the courts and charged or released.
 Persons so detained are not entitled to legal counsel. The
 police may also stop and search private vehicles without cause
 or warrant between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.. There are
 no known political prisoners or persons in political exile.
 The Constitution prohibits the use of any form of forced or
 compulsory labor, and this prohibition is respected in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. In 1987 the Parliament constituted a select
 committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister to make
 recommendations to amend the Constitution to strengthen
 judicial independence. Trials are public. Defendants have
 the right to counsel of their choice, at public expense, if
 necessary. They enjoy a presumption of innocence, may confront
 witnesses and present evidence, and have the right of appeal.
 The courts, jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay
 tribunals (e.g., the Industrial Tribunal, the Commissioners
 for Justice, and the Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have
 exclusive authority over certain judicial functions, although
 their independence is not legally guaranteed.
 Defendants in cases before the Industrial Tribunal or the
 Public Service Commission may not be represented by lawyers.
 The law prohibits attorneys who are Members of Parliament from
 acting as counsel in judicial cases against the Government,
 although they may act as counsel for the Government. This law
 has been challenged as being in conflict with the defendant's
 right to counsel of his choice as provided by the European
 Convention on Human Rights.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of thd home is ensured in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 opposition Labor Party has charged that the Government carries
 out telephone tapping; the Government has denied this
 allegation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although these freedoms are provided for by the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice, the opposition party has
 complained about bias in news coverage. Opposition viewpoints
 are discussed freely in the written press and in mass
 political meetings. The printed press is heavily politiciied
 and often affiliated with a particular political faction. The
 press associated with the party in power practices a
 considerable degree of self-censorship.
 Academic freedom is respected. Changes in the administration
 of the-university in August reinstituted departments,
 primarily in the humanities, which previously had been
 excluded from teaching. These changes also liberalized
 opportunities for student attendance at the university.
 The constitutionally mandated Broadcasting Authority exists to
 ensure impartiality in broadcasting. Television and radio are
 state owned. During the May elections, the Broadcasting
 Authority's major accomplishment was providing for equal time
 for both parties and organizing televised debates among
 candidates. Since the election, it has continued to insist
 uppn equal time for addresses and debates in which the views
 of both- parties are aired. Three-minute editorials by
 speakers representing the entire political spectrum are aired
 directly after the news broadcast twice a week.
 However, though the situation improved measurably this year,
 radio and television news reports are still subject to a
 certain amount of censorship. This was demonstrated in the
 June ransacking of the law courts--a major event--which was
 not reported at the time on either radio or television. There
 have been complaints from the Labor party of bias in news
 coverage.
 A 1987 constitutional amendment, based on the Foreign
 Interference Act, bans political activity by foreigners for
 the 9 months prior to publication of election results. The
 amendment was supported by both parties and rendered moot a
 court challenge to the constitutionality of the Foreign
 Interference Act.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is ensured in the
 Constitution. In general, police permits are issued for
 political meetings and other public activities of political
 parties or groups of citizens. The right to peaceful assembly
 was upheld in a November court decision against the former
 police commissioner who was found guilty of failing to protect
 properly a student group displaying posters in a public area.
 
 
 975
 MALTA
 Trade unionists and other interest groups freely exercise the
 right to set up associations. The right to strike or take
 other industrial action, however, is not specifically provided
 for, and there have been no such actions in 1987.
 The General Workers Union, the largest labor organization, has
 been statutorily fused with the Malta Labor Party since 1978.
 The previous practice of excluding other independent unions
 from the official delegation to the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) was reversed during the 1987 ILO session
 and the Government generally sought to project a more positive
 attitude toward implementation of international labor
 standards.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is
 protected constitutionally and is respected. The
 overwhelmingly dominant religion is Roman Catholicism,
 although there are small numbers of people who practice other
 religions.
 An interim agreement reached in 1986 on the financing and
 operation of church-sponsored private schools is still in
 effect. Under the interim agreement, teachers in these
 schools will receive salaries on a par with teachers in public
 schools by October 1988; agreement regarding the financing of
 the church school operations is pending while negotiations
 continue toward a definitive agreement.
 As one of its first acts after assuming power in May, the new
 Government dropped the previous Government's appeal in the
 court case regarding church property, thereby ensuring the
 Catholic Church's right to property ownership.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or emigration. Maltese who acquire the
 citizenship of another country may, under certain
 circumstances, lose their Maltese nationality. Maltese
 emigrants who return to Malta are not automatically entitled
 to regain their Maltese citizenship but must apply to the
 office of the Prime Minister. In most cases such applications
 are acted upon favorably.
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta
 generally are not permitted to remain in Malta. In December
 1987, a local emigrants commission was named to represent the
 UNHCR formally in Malta. This should enhance assistance to
 foreign nationals claiming refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political activity is intense, and partisan feelings are very
 pronounced in Malta. During the last election in May, 96.11
 percent of those registered actually voted. Preelection
 violence led to a number of.injuries.
 A constitutional amendment adopted in January 1987 ensured the
 election of the party receiving the majority of popular votes,
 thereby reversing the anomalous dutcome of the previous
 election in which.the Nationalist Party had received the
 
 
 976
 MALTA
 majority of popular votes but failed to win the majority of
 parliamentary seats. Elections with universal suffrage are
 held every 5 years. Opposition parties actively and freely
 debate.
 Charges have been brought against members of the opposition
 Labor party for'haqving prevented the free conduct of voting
 procedures at certain polling stations during the May
 election. These charges have been accompanied by considerable
 politicaltension; the case is pending.
 In August, a bipartisan parliamentary select committee was
 established to'make proposals for strengthening the democratic.
 system in Malta. The committee is studying the presidency,
 the independence of the judiciary, and electoral legislation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On November 26, 1987, Malta signed the European Convention for
 the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment.
 The Convention provides for investigations by an independent
 international committee.
 In the past, the indigenous human rights group, Hielsa, was
 active in pointing out human rights violations.. The
 Government places no restrictions on investigations by
 international human rights groups in Malta. The Government
 replied to Amnesty International in May 1987 concerning seven
 cases involving allegations of ill-treatment between 1980 and
 1985. In four cases, the Minister of Justice stated that an
 investigation would not be appropriate as legal proceedings
 were still continuing. In one case the Minister determined
 that no further investigation was justified. In another case,
 the police denied using violence. The final case, -that
 involving the police commissioner referred to in Section l.a.,
 is still pending.
 Symptomatic of their policy of emphasizing respect for human
 rights, was the. offer by the new Government to host a human
 rights information center under the auspices of UNESCO.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Public, economic, and social services are extended on a
 nondiscriminatory basis. However, for years there have been
 persistent allegations of partisan favoritism in the
 allocation of public housing, phone services, import and
 export licenses, and employment, as well as arbitrary
 transfers of public employees. In August the Government
 established a commission to investigate and remedy any
 injustices, discrimination, or unfair treatment. In addition
 to dealing with the current and any future allegations of
 discrimiination, the commission will investigate cases dating
 back to 1971. An opposition Member of Parliament is seeking
 constitutional redress to regain former employment as manager
 of a government controlled company.
 For reasons derived from tradition and culture, Maltese
 society does not generally associate women's rights with human
 rights. There are laws on equal opportunity and equal pay for
 equal work, but they are not always enforced. The 1988
 budget, which is currently being debated in Parliament, calls
 
 
 977
 MALTA
 for an increase in family allowances and a year of maternity
 leave for working mothers. To date, married working women
 suffer most markedly from discrimination in that they lose all
 entitlements and seniority personally acquired (retirement,
 health benefits, social security) upon marriage. The law
 officially designates the husband as head of the family unit
 with dominant responsibility for economic and financial
 questions, as well as all major decisions concerning
 children. A comprehensive family law has been under
 consideration by Parliament for some years. The status of
 Maltese women may also be raised internationally now that
 Malta is a signatory to the full text of the European Human
 Rights Convention.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Constitution identifies as a fundamental aim of government
 the responsibility to make available to all citizens the
 highest level of education and social welfare. Both the
 Government and opposition support the basic rights of citizens
 to own property, to work under just conditions and be
 appropriately remunerated, to maintain a standard of living
 adequate for health and well-being, and to receive universal
 education.
 Maltese law guarantees acceptable conditions of work,
 including minimum wages, maximum hours of work, a minimum
 working age of 16, and a provision for occupational safety and
 .health. Disputes about workers' conditions are dealt with by
 the Industrial Tribunal and not by the law courts. Persons
 before the Industrial Tribunal may be defended only by a
 representative of the union to which the majority of their
 coworkers belong; they may not be defended by legal counsel.
 In past years, this has been described in the International
 Helsinki Federation of Human Rights Report as "unjust" because
 of a number of decisions by the tribunal in which workers'
 rights were not considered to have been-adequately protected.
 The laws governing thg proceedings of the Industrial Tribunal
 have not changed.
 In the case of the Public Service Commission, before which
 government employees' disputes are heard, complainants are not
 represented by legal counsel but may be represented either by
 a union representative or a friend.
