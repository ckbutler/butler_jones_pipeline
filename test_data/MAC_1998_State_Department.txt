 MACAU
 Macau, a 13 square mile enclave on the south China coast, is recognized by both
 China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The "Or-
 ganic Statute" of 1976, which serves as the constitution, grants it considerable ad-
 ministrative, financial, and legislative autonomy from Lisbon. The governor, ap-
 pointed by the Portuguese President, has extensive powers under the Organic Stat-
 ute. Both the Governor and the Legislative Assembly exercise legislative power. Vot-
 ers directly elect only one-third of the legislators; the rest are appointed or elected
 indirectly by interest groups. The judiciary is independent.
 Under the principle of one country, two systems" specified in the 1987 Sino-Por-
 tuguese Joint Declaration, Macau is to become a special administrative region of
 China on December 20, 1999. Its economy and way of life are to remain unchanged
 for 50 years. After reversion, the "Basic Law," promulgated by China's National Peo-
 ple's Coness in 1993, is to serve as Macaus Constitution and most of the laws
 currently in force will continue to apply. A joint liaison group, composed of rep-
 resentatives from Portugal and China, is the mechanism for negotiating transition
 issues and implementing the Joint Declaration.
 The police force is firmly under civilian control. An increase in organized crime-
 related violence led the public to call for better maintenance of law and order and
 for greater Sino-Portuguese cooperation in combating cross-border crime. There are
 no troops stationed in Macau. However, the Chinese Government announced in Sep-
 tember that an "appropriately sized" People's Liberation Army garrison would be
 posted in the Special Admistrative Region after reversion.
 The market-based bconomy is fueled by textile and garment exports, along with
 tourism and gambling. A depressed real estate market, stagnant exports, an a de-
 cline in tourism have limited economic growth in recent years, a trend that contin-
 ued in 1998. Despite the economic downturn, most citizens still enjoy a high stand-
 ard of living.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 some problems remain, including: The limited ability of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment; some instances of press self-censorship; and inadequate provision for the
 disabled.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such abuses, and the authorities respect this provision in practice.
 The Public Prosecutor's Office investigated five complaints of police brutality during
 the year. In 1997 eight such allegations were lodged with the High Commissioner
 against Corruption and Administrative Illegality. The Covenant against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was extended to
 Macau on March 16. The Portuguese and Chinese Governments agreed in the Joint
 Liaison Group that the covenant would continue to be applied after reversion.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist, and the authorities respect them in practice. An examining judge, who
 conducts a pretrial inquiry in criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect
 evidence, order or dismiss indictments, and determine whether to release detained
 persons. Police must present persons remanded in custody to an examining judge
 within 48 hours of detention. The accused's counsel may examine the evidence. The
 law provides that cases must come to trial within 6 months of indictment. The aver-
 age length of pretrial incarceration is 3 months.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent. The Basic Law pro-
 vides for the continuation of an independent judiciary after reversion; however, the
 need to translate laws and judgments and a severe shortage of local bilingual law-
 yers (of the 100 lawyers in private practice, approximately 5 can read and write Chi-
 nese) and magistrates may hamper the continuation of the present system after re-
 version.
 The Governor, upon the recommendation of the Supreme Council of Justice (for
 the Superior Court) and the Judiciary Council of Macau (for the common courts),
 appoints judges. After reversion, the chief executive is to appoint judges, acting on
 
 
 the recommendation of an "independent commission composed of local judges, law-
 yers and eminent persons." Local judges are appointed for life. However, the terms
 of office of judges seconded from the Portuguese judiciary (the majority of judges)
 are due to expire on December 19, 1999. The future term of office for judges is under
 negotiation in the Joint Liaison Group. The Chief Procurator, currently appointed
 by the Governor, enjoys substantial autonomy from both the executive and judiciary.
 After reversion, the Chief Procurator is to be appointed by the central Government,
 upon the recommendation of the chief executive.
 The Superior Court is the highest court in Macau, although until reversion the
 Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice and Constitutional Court remain competent.
 The Superior Court consists of six magistrates divided into two panels, one of which
 hears only administrative, fiscal, and customs duties cases; the other oversees all
 other cases. An additional judge serves as President of the Court. Cases before the
 Superior Court are heard initially by the relevant panel of three judges. When such
 a panel's ruling is appealed, the case is heard by all six judges, with the President
 voting only in case of a tie. This structure results in a situation in which three of
 the individuals hearing an appeal have already rendered an opinion in the initial
 judgment. Critics charge that this procedure calls into question the objectivity of the
 subsequent ruling. Beneath the Superior Court are the courts of first instance and
 the Court of Auditors.  ,
 The law provides for the right to, a fair trial, and citizens enjoy this right in prac-
 tice. Trials are open to the public. The Criminal Procedure Code provides for the
 accused's right to be present during proceedings and to choose an attorney or re-
 quest that one be provided at government expense. The judiciary provides citizens
 with a fair and efficient judicial process, although the average waiting period be-
 tween the filing of a civil case and its scheduled hearing is 18 months. The slow
 translation of laws and administrative guidelines into Chinese presented a problem
 in the past. Most laws issued between 1976 and 1991 have now been translated into
 Chinese and are being published slowly. Since 1991 all new legislation has been
 issued simultaneously in Chinese and Portuguese.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Laws
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of owner-
 ship of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a fam-
 ily. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these rights, and the Gov-
 ernment generally respects them in practice. However, on occasion journalists prac-
 tice self-censorship. In August the Government refused to allow the staging in a
 government auditorium of a play dealing with Macau's 1967 anti-Portuguese riots.
 There are eight Chinese and three Portuguese daily newspapers, five Chinese and
 two Portuguese weekly newspapers, one television station, and one radio station. In
 addition all Hong Kong newspapers and many international newspapers are freely
 available. Although there is no government censorship or intimidation of the press,
 criminal triads have sent threatening letters to newspapers warning of retaliation
 if they cover tiad activities. Critics charge that the leading newspapers are pro-
 China publications that do not give equal  attention to iberal and prodemocracy
 voices. Local journalists continue to oppose a government proposal to establish a
 press council to monitor the press and advise the Government of press issues.
 Article 23 of the Basic Law obliges the Macau Special Administrative Region to
 enact laws that "forbid any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the
 central People's Government, or theft of state secrets," as well as "prohibit foreign
 political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the region."
 Human rights groups are concerned that these provisions may restrict fundamental
 rights and freedoms. They are particularly concerned because current penal provi-
 sions concerning crimes against state security became law in November 1995 when
 a new penal code was adopted, but become null and void on December 19, 1999.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Under local law,
 individuals and groups intending to hold peaceful meetings or demonstrations in
 public places are required to notify the president of the relevant municipal council
 in writing at least 3 days but no more than 2 weeks in advance of the event; how-
 ever, no prior authorization is necessary for the event to take place.
 The law provides for freedom of association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. There is no law prohibiting political parties, but there are no genu-
 ine political parties. Both civic associations and candidates' committees may present
 
 
 983
 candidates in the elections by direct or indirect suffrage (see Section 3). However,
 Article 23 of the Basic Law obliges the Macau Special Administrative Region to
 enact laws that "prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies of the region from
 establishing ties with domestic political organizations or bodies."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Portuguese law as extended to Macau provides for free-
 dom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. However,
 human rights groups have expressed concern that the Legislative Assembly thus far
 has failed to establish these rights in local law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government has assisted in the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people. Only
 seven Vietnamese refugees remain in Macau; all other boat people have emigrated
 to host countries. No Vietnamese refugees were repatriated in 1997 or 1998. Macau
 returns an average of 444 illegal Chinese migrants to China each month.
 The law includes provisions for handling refugees and asylees in accordance with
 the provisions of the U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 protocol. There are no reports of refugees being forced to return to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have a limited ability to change their government. The 23-member Legis-
 lative Assembly is composed of 8 members elected in direct elections; 8 indirectly
 elected by local community interests; and 7 appointed by the Governor. Elections
 are held every 4 years. The Chinese Government has agreed that the current legis-
 lators may continue to hold office after reversion until their current terms expire
 in 2001. The number of directly elected legislators is to increase gradually in subse-
 quent elections. After 2009 the rules on the Assembly's composition may be altered
 by a two-thirds majority of the total membership, with the approval of the chief ex-
 ecutive. Although the Legislative Assembly can enact laws on all matters except
 those reserved for bodies in Portugal or the Governor, in practice the Governor initi-
 ates the vast majority of legislation, either directly through "decree-laws" or through
 bills that must be a pproved by the Legislative Assembly. While the Legislative As-
 sembly has the legal power to refuse to ratify laws issued by the Governor, in prac-
 tice it does so rarely. In the first 9 months of 1998, the Governor issued 45 decree-
 laws, while the Legislative Assembly passed 7 laws.
 The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed of elected
 and appointed members, also provides some measure of popular representation. The
 Basic Law provides for an appointed executive council to fulfill this role after rever-
 sion. Municipal assemblies are elected by direct, universal, secret ballot. The Basic
 Law stipulates that the Macau Special Administrative Region may establish non-
 political municipal bodies responsible for cultural affairs and public sanitation.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, and
 are still underrepresented, they hold a number of senior positions throughout the
 Government. Three of the 23 Legislative Assembly Members, including the Presi-
 dent of the Assembly, are women. Women hold approximately 25 percent of local
 senior civil service positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution does not proscribe discrimination based on race, sex, reli-
 gion, disability, language, or social status explicitly, it does incorporate the principle
 of nondiscrimination. Separate laws provide for many of these rights. For example,
 under the law that establishes the general framework for the educational system,
 access to education is stipulated for all residents regardless of race, religious belief,
 or political or ideological convictions.
 Women.-Violence against women is not common. For cases that are reported, the
 authorities enforce criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence and prosecute
 violators. However, police and court statistics do not distinguish between spousal
 abuse and other assault cases. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social
 worker counsels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their
 complaints are resolved, battered women may be provided public housing, but no
 
 
 984
 facilities are reserved expressly for them. In 1997 nine rape cases were brought to
 court; in the first 9 months of 1998 there were five cases.
 Women are becoming more active and visible in business. The Government esti-
 mates that women account for 43 percent of the work force. Equal opportunity legis-
 lation enacted in 1995, applicable to all public and private organizations, mandates
 that women receive equal pay for equal work, prohibits discrimination based on sex
 or physical ability, and establishes penalties for employers who violate these guide-
 lines. However, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office, no cases alleging dis-
 crimination have been brought to court.
 Children.-The Government has not promulgated any statutes specifically to pro-
 tect the rights of children, relying on the general framework of civil and political
 rights legislation to protect all citizens. School attendance is not compulsory; how-
 ever, the vast majority of residents' minor children attend school. Basic education
 is provided in government-run schools and subsidized private schools, and covers
 the preprimary year, primary education, and general secondary school education.
 The Education Department provides assistance to families of those children who
 cannot pay school fees. The children of illegal immigrants are excluded from the
 educational system (see Section 6.d.).
 Child abuse and exploitation are not reported to be widespread problems. In 1997
 eight cases of child abuse were reported, and only two cases were reported during
 the first 9 months of 1998.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1997 the United Nations Human Rights Committee
 recommended that Macau do more to ensure the economic and social rights of the
 disabled. There are few special programs aimed at helping the physically and men-
 tally disabled gain better access to employment, education, and public facilities.
 Laws do not mandate building access for the disabled. More than two-thirds of the
 funding for services for the disabled comes from government subsidies. In 1996 the
 Government subsidized 4 homes and 10 rehabilitation centers for the disabled. Nine
 schools have programs for the disabled, providing special education programs for
 359 students. In December 1997, the Government formed a working group to define
 the fundamental rights of the disabled and determine the role of social service orga-
 nizations in assisting them. The extent to which physically disabled persons experi-
 ence discrimination in employment, education, and the provision of state services is
 not fully known.
 National]RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The governmental and legal systems place a
 premium on knowledge of the Portuguese language, which is spoken by less than
 4 percent of the population. The Chinese language received official status in 1993,
 and the use of Chinese in the civil service is growing. According to government sta-
 tistics, by the end of 1996, individuals born in Macau or in the People's Republic
 of China filled only 64 percent of senior government positions. Considerable pres-
 sure remains on the Government to accelerate the process of making the civil serv-
 ice more representative of the population.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Portuguese Constitution recognizes the right
 and freedom of all workers to form and join trade unions and these rights are ex-
 tended to Macau. The Government -neither impedes the formation of trade unions
 nor discriminates against union members. However, human rights groups are con-
 cerned that no similar rights and protections have been incorporated into local law
 to ensure such protections after reversion.
 People's Republic of China interests heavily influence local trade union activities,
 including the selection of union leadership, and stress the importance of stability
 and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of the private sector union
 members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observers claim that
 this organization is more interested in furthering the Chinese political agenda than
 in addressing trade union issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions.
 A few private sector unions and two of the four public sector unions are outside Chi-
 nese control.
 Although the Portuguese Constitution provides workers with the right to strike,
 labor leaders complain that there is no effective protection from retribution should
 they exercise this right. The Government argues that provisions in the labor law
 requiring an employer to have "justified cause" to dismiss an employee protect strik-
 ing employees from retaliation.
 Unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies. Three
 new unions were registered in 1998. Three civil service unions-representing Por-
 tuguese, Macanese, and Chinese employees-are affiliated with the major non-Com-
 munist Portuguese union confederation.
 
 
 985
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Macau's unions tend to re-
 semble local traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural ac-
 tivities rather than issues relating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, nor-
 mally favor employment without the benefit of written labor contracts except in the
 case of migrant labor from China and the Philippines. Chinese unions traditionally
 have not attempted to engage in collective bargaining. Portuguese laws protecting
 collective bargaining apply, and the Government does not impede or discourage such
 activity.
 Although the law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and it does not appear to be
 widespread, representatives from some civil service unions raised concerns during
 the year over government practices that they feel disadvantage them. Workers who
 believe that they have been dismissed unlawfully may bring a case to court or lodge
 a complaint with the Labor Department or the High Commissioner against Corrup-
 tion and Administrative Illegality. In 1997 and 1998, there were two work stop-
 pages, which technically are not considered strikes. On several occasions, Chinese
 migrant workers staged protests to demand their back pay.
 There are no export processing zones; Macau is a free port.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced and bond-
 ed labor, and there were no reports of such practices. Children are covered under
 laws prohibiting forced or bonded labor, although they are not specified in the legis-
 lation.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits minors under the age of 16 from working, although minors between the
 ages of 14 and 16 can be authorized to work on an "exceptional basis." Local laws
 do not establish specific regulations governing the number of hours these children
 can work, but International Labor Organization conventions are applied. The Labor
 Department enforces the law through periodic and targeted inspections and viola-
 tors are prosecuted. The incidence of child labor has declined significantly since ef-
 fective enforcement began in 1985. In 1997 the Labor Department Inspectorate con-
 ducted 676 inspections and uncovered 35 violations of child labor laws, all in the
 same factory. In the first half of 1998, only 1 violation of child labor laws was de-
 tected during 381 inspections. Forced and bonded labor is prohibited by law; al-
 though child labor is not specified in the law, it is covered by the law's provisions,
 and there were no reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Local labor laws establish the general principle
 of fair wages and mandate compliance with wage agreements, but there is no man-
 datory minimum wage. Average wages generally provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. In the absence of any statutory minimum wage or publicly
 administered social security programs, some large companies provide private wel-
 fare and security packages. Labor activists charge that the absence of a government-
 backed social security fund leaves many workers vulnerable.
 Labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, and medical and maternity care. Although the law provides a 24-hour
 rest period for every 7 days of work, worker representatives report that workers fre-
 quently agree to work overtime to compensate for low wages. The Department of
 Labor provides assistance and legal advice to workers on request, but government
 enforcement of labor laws is lax because of limited resources.
 Migrant workers, primarily from China, make up approximately 16 percent of the
 work force. These workers often work for less than half the wages paid to a local
 resident who performs the same job, live in controlled dormitories, work 10 to 12
 hours a day, and owe large sums of money to the labor-importing company for the
 purchase of their job. In 1997 The U.N. Human Rights Committee noted the lack
 of protective measures for working conditions and the absence of social security pro-
 grams for nonresident workers as an area of concern. Labor interests claim that the
 high percentage of imported labor erodes the bargaining power of local residents to
 improve working conditions and increase wages.
 The Department of Labor enforces occupational safety and health. Failure to cor-
 rect infractions can lead to government prosecution. In 1997 the Labor Department
 Inspectorate carried out 793 inspections and uncovered 668 violations carrying fines
 worth a total of $1.3 million. Although the law includes a requirement that employ-
 ers provide a safe working environment, no explicit provisions exist to protect the
 employees' right to continued employment if they refuse to work under dangerous
 conditions.
