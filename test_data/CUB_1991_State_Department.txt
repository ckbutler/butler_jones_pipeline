 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state dominated by President Fidel
 Castro, who is Chief of State, Head of Government, First
 Secretary of the Communist Party, and Commander in Chief of the
 Armed Forces. President Castro seeks to control nearly all
 aspects of Cuban life through a broad network of directorates
 ultimately answerable to him through the Communist Party, as
 well as through the government bureaucracy and the state
 security apparatus. The Party is the only legal political
 entity and is headed by an elite group whose membership is
 ultimately determined by Fidel Castro. All government
 positions, including judicial offices, are controlled by the
 Party. Though not a formal requirement, party membership is a
 de facto prerequisite for high-level official positions and
 professional advancement in most areas.
 The Ministry of Interior (MININT) is the principal organ of
 state security and totalitarian control. It operates border
 and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations,
 determines whether or not to recognize nongovernmental
 associations, investigates evidence of nonconformity, regulates
 migration, and maintains pervasive vigilance through a series
 of mass organizations and informers. The Ministry is under the
 de facto control of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR). The
 mass organizations attempt to extend government and Communist
 Party control over each citizen's daily activities at home,
 work, and school. Through neighborhood Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution (CDR), citizens are exhorted to
 ensure ideological conformity and to report deviation.
 The Cuban economy is highly centralized and managed by
 President Castro and a group of close advisers. The Government
 controls the means of production and is virtually the country's
 sole employer. In 1991 the economy continued to decline,
 particularly as a result of the accelerating deterioration in
 Cuba's economic relationship with the Soviet Union, its
 principal trading partner. President Castro allowed discussion
 of minor adjustments to the economy during the'Fourth Party
 Congress in Octoben but ultimately resisted any significant
 change. The Government continues to implement its program of
 stringent austerity measures known as "the special period in
 peacetime," which emphasizes economic self-sufficiency at the
 expense ofsocial programs.
 Cuban authorities attempt to neutralize dissent through a
 variety of often nonviolent tactics designed to keep activists
 off-balance, divided, and discredited by labeling them mentally
 disturbed, social misfits, or hostile agents of certain foreign
 countries. The Government sharply restricts virtually-all the
 basic human rights. including freedom of expression,
 association, assembly, and movement, as well as the right to
 privacy, the- right of citizens to change their government, and
 worker rights. MININT has among its major functions the
 suppression of dissent and opposition of any kind. Just prior
 to the Pan-American Games in August and during the Party
 Congress in October, Cuban state security engaged in,acts of
 intimidation against nearly all human rights activists. Twelve
 activists were detained for periods of from several hours to
 several days. Four were subsequently tried and sentenced to as
 long as 3 years on such charges as "contempt," "illegal
 association," and "clandestine printing."
 In mid-November, Cuban authorities unleashed a wave of
 repression that continued through-the end of the year against
 human rights activists, largely through the use of "acts of
 
 
 554
 CUBA
 repudiation"--attacks by officially organized mobs that are
 portrayed as being spontaneous public rebukes of dissident
 activity. Leaders of the opposition umbrella group, the Cuban
 Democratic Convergence, were targeted by such attacks after
 meeting with a visiting Spanish official. In one instance, a
 mob dragged the leader of the dissident group Criterio
 Alternativo, Maria Elenz Cruz Varela, out of her residence (see
 Section 2.b.). She and four other Criterio members were later
 sentenced to up to 2 years in prison for "felonious
 association" and slander. Detentions of other activists
 continued through December 31. including Yndamiro Restano,
 leader of the opposition group Harmony Movement (MAR), and
 three ofvits members.
 In response to the passage in March of U.N. Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) Resolution 1991/68, mandating the
 establishment of a special representative to report on human
 rights violations in Cuba, the Cuban Government said it would
 not respect "a single comma" of the resolution. Although Cuba
 was reelected to the UNHRC in June, it continued to refuse to
 cooperate with the mandate and ignored letters from the special
 representative requesting a visit to Cuba.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In 1991 there were at least six cases of probable extrajudicial
 killings by the security forces. A 17-year-old youth, Yoel
 Reyes Torres, was killed by a policeman in the town of San
 Agustin following an argument. Arnaldo Gonzales was reportedly
 shot and killed by Special Brigade Agent Reinaldo Milau in the
 city of Holguin. Following an investigation, Milau was
 arrested. Heribeito Vega Calzadillo was reportedly
 pistol-whipped and then fatally shot in the stomach by MININT
 employee Julio Cruz after an argument at a recreation center.
 No further information about official investigations of these
 cases was available at year's end.
 On January 28, the Provincial Military Court of Havana tried
 police officer Isaac Guilarte Rodriguez for the fatal shooting
 on September 28, 1990, of human rights activist Angel Galvan
 Vanegas. According to family members who attended the trial,
 only police officers were called to testify, although other
 witnesses to the shooting were present. Guilarte was acquitted.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1991.
 c.. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and
 prisoners. However, beatings, neglect, isolation, and other
 abuse by prison officials are often directed at those prisoners
 who have been convicted of political crimes (including human
 rights advocates) or are unwilling to conform. The Government
 claims that prisoners have guaranteed rights, such as family
 visitation, adequate nutrition, pay for work, the right to
 request parole, and the right to present a petition to the
 
 
 555
 CUBA
 prison administrator. However, these purported rights are
 frequently and capriciously withdrawn, particularly in the
 cases of political prisoners, according to human rights
 activists. There was no indication that Cuban authorities
 investigated reports of abuse or took disciplinary action
 against security agents responsible for such abuse.
 On January 1, 14 prisoners organized themselves at Combinado
 del Este Prison, calling themselves "nuevos plantados." The
 "nuevos plantados," like the original plantados, refused to
 wear prison uniforms and demanded political democracy and
 freedom of expression. The authorities initially suspended
 medical treatment for the prisoners, then separated the group
 by transferring the prisoners to various prisons throughout the
 country. During a February 5 visit by his mother, Orlando
 Dominquez de la Coba, who has one arm, was handcuffed to a rail
 and showed marks of having been beaten. Another "nuevo
 plantado," Orlando Azcue Rodriguez, was kicked and beaten with
 fists and hoses before being transferred from Pinar del Rio to
 a Camaguay prison. Arturo Montane Ruiz and Manuel Pozo Montero
 were beaten ini the Ceramica Rojo Prison in Camaguay while they
 staged a hunger strike over their conditions and treatment.
 Reports from the prisoners related through family members
 indicated that the "nuevos plantados" were beaten each time
 they refused to wear uniforms.
 Human rights activists and political dissidents are
 systematically harassed and abused in public and private. On
 Sunday, June 16, four members of the activist group MAR were
 attacked and beaten with fists by 25 plainclothes policemen
 after attending a mass with 52 other MAR members at a Catholic
 church in the Miramar district of western Havana. On June 25,
 MAR leader Yndamiro Restano was accosted and beaten by three
 state security officials in plain clothes after he was denied
 permission to enter what was cohsidered~to be a public trial of-
 two Cuban doctors charged with plotting to kill Fidel Castro.
 Maria Celina Rodriguez, an activist of the Brotherhood for
 Christian Rights, reported that after visitinq the U.S.
 Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy on August 2, she was
 followed and verbally abused by five men who were apparently
 from state security. As she attempted to gain the attention of
 persons in the American Broadcasting Company Television Sports
 compound, which was set up for the Pan-American Games, the five
 men assaulted her, ripped her clothing, forced her into a car,
 and took her and her infant child into custody; She was
 released about August 25. She was not charged with any
 offense; however, her detention included confinement in a
 psychiatric hospital.
 Cuban authorities utilized "acts of repudiation" to intimidate
 activists and as a pretext for their arrest. Activists were
 roughed up, in some cases suffering serious injury, by mobs who
 chanted slogans and threw trash and other refuse at their
 homes. Several were arrested "for their own protection," then
 later charged and sentenced to terms in prison (see Section
 2.b.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 245 of the Cuban Law of Penal Procedures requires
 police to file-formal charges and either release a detainee or
 place him at the disposition of a prosecutor within 96 hours of
 arrest. Authorities are also legally required to provide
 suspects with access to a lawyer within 10 days of arrest.
 These procedures are routinely denied to those detained on
 
 
 556
 CUBA
 state security grounds. Article 61 of the Constitution permits
 denial of all constitutionally and legally recognized civil
 liberties in the case of anyone actively opposing the "decision
 of the Cuban people to build socialism." Cuban authorities
 invoke this open-ended article and justify lengthydetentions
 of dissidents on the grounds that they constitute
 counterrevolutionary elements."
 Reports of arbitrary arrests of human rights activists
 continued unabated,, but the incidence of prolonged detention
 without trial decreased in 1991. In addition, the Government
 stepped up-efforts to pressure dissidents to disavow activism
 or choose between exile or long prison terms. From November
 1990 through December 1991, there were over 50 detentions of
 activists, a number of them held without charge. Of these,
 only about a dozen came to trial. On December 20 and 26, MAR
 leader Yndamiro Restano and three of the group's members were
 detained. On December 31, the leader of the Humanitarian-
 Feminine Movement, Bienvenida Cucalo, and three of the group's
 members were detained. At year's end, all remained in
 detention without being charged.
 Cuban authorities often use prolonged detention to prepare,
 false charges or to preempt meaningful activity by human rights
 activists. This occurred in the case of Professor Luis Pita
 Santos, who was taken into detention on October 9 after he
 called for a demonstration on October 25. The Government also
 preempts dissident activity by arbitrarily-prolonging prison
 sentences by sentencing detainees on new charges for human
 rights activities allegedly committed during imprisonment. The
 new charges are sometimes not announced until near.the end of -
 the original prison term or shortly after the term ends. For
 example, David Moya Alfonso and Samuel Martinez Lara were
 forced into,exile under threat of having to complete prison
 terms that had been prolonged on the basis of new charges
 brought against them during previous imprisonment. After years
 of international pressure, the Government released the last two
 "plantados historicos," a group of prisoners arrested in the
 1960's who refused to wear their prison uniforms or submit to
 political indoctrination. Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez was released
 on March 23, after 22 years in prison, and was permitted to
 emigrate to the United States in.April. Mario Chanes de Armas
 was released on July 16, after being imprisoned for 30 years,
 but at year's end had still not been allowed to emigrate. Also
 released during 1991 were political prisoners Hubert Jerez
 Marino, head of the Marti Committee for Human Rights, after
 serving 18 months in prison for "disseminating false news";
 Samuel Martinez Lara, who was freed into conditional liberty
 following his trial; Pedro J. Dorta Rodriguez, after serving 11
 years of a 15-year sentence; Cecilio Rodriguez Campo, after
 serving 8 of 15 years; Juan Martinez Perdono, after serving 4
 of 10 years; members of.the Democratic Integrationist Movement
 (MID) Mario Fernandez Mora and Edgardo LLompart Martinez, after
 serving 18 months of 6- and 3-year terms respectively for
 "rebellion"; Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Committee for
 Human Rights and National Reconciliation, released into limited
 freedom for the remaining 3 months of a 2-year term for
 "spreading false news"; and factory worker Orlando Azcue
 Rodriguez, after serving 15 months of'a 3-year term for
 "spreading enemy propaganda," during which he was chained to
 the bars of his cell and badly beaten for staging a hunger
 strike.

 CUBA
 e." Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cuban law and trial practices do not meet international
 standards for fair and impartial public trials. Although the
 Constitution provides for independent courts, it explicitly
 subordinates them to the NationalAssembly and the Council of
 State (Article 122). Judges are elected by the rubberstamp
 National Assembly and its lower level counterparts. The
 independence of the judiciary is compromised by the
 subordination of the courts to the Communist Party. ,There is
 no known case in wahich a Cuban court has successfully ruled
 against the Government on any political or security matter.
 Civil courts'exist at three levels: municipal, provincial, and
 the Supreme Court. All civil courts are presided over by
 panels composed of a mixture of professionally qualified judges
 and lay judges. 'There is also a system of military tribunals
 whic: assume jurisdiction for certain "counterrevolutionary
 activity" cases. Most trials are held in public, however,
 closed trials are held when state security is involved.
 Testimony from a member of a CDR may be introduced onbehalf of
 a defendant and may contribute to either a reduced or a longer
 sentence. The law recognizes the right of appeal in municipal
 courts. In'provincial courts, some cases are,appealable and
 others are not. Cases involving maximum prison terms or the
 death penalty are open to appeal. The Law of Penal Procedure
 provides that an appeal must be presented within 5 days of the
 verdict.
 Criteria for evidence presented in Cuban courts, particularly
 in the cases of human rights activists, are arbitrary and
 discriminatory. The sole evidence provided in many cases,
 particularly with regard to those with political significance,
 is the defendant's confession. The confession is usually,
 obtained under duress and without legal advice or the knowledge
 of the defense lawyer. Defense lawyers often are not allowed
 to meet with the defendants until the day of the trial. This
 practice is so common that when an exception was made in the
 case of activist Elizardo Sanchez, the authorities flaunted the
 fact and advised family members that they should be grateful
 for the consideration. Several other activists who have-served
 prison terms stated that they were tried and sentenced without
 defense counsel and were not permitted to speak on their own
 behalf.
 Cuban law provides an accused the right to a defense attorney,
 but the latter's impartiality and independence are compromised
 by the absence of a private bar association and by ideolbgical
 controls exerted over members of the state-controlled.lawyers'
 collectives, especially in defending persons accused of crimes
 against state security. Observers have noted a reluctance
 among attorneys to defend persons charged with political
 offenses. Lawyers are discouraged from taking political cases
 because of the persecution suffered by those who have done so
 in the past. Former political prisoners have alleged that
 state security officials apply pressure on all persons involved
 in the judicial process, and that those officials, not the
 courts, really decide the fate of the detainee. Foreign
 observers at trials of human rights activists report that the
 behavior of defense lawyers and judges indicates that decisions
 on guilt and sentencing are not made at the trials but
 beforehand, though sentences can be changed in court, depending
 on the defendant's cooperation during proceedings.
 
 
 558
 CUBA
 In 1991-the Government continued to use the judicial system to
 discredit human rights activists by publicly associating them
 with certain foreign governments or with violent activities.
 At the trial of activist Samuel'Martinez Lara, the Government
 accused him of attempting the violent overthrow of the Cuban
 Government-and tried to link him with foreign diplomats who
 were mentioned-by.name. Virtually every prosecutipn witness
 was either an acknowledged employee of the state security
 organization or a government informer, Trial observers
 concluded'that the testimony used to convict Martinez was
 probably fabricated. -In addition, the prosecutor verbally
 abused and intimidated selected witnesses without restraint by
 the presiding judge. Martinez was found guilty'even though
 there was no concrete information to substantiate the charge of
 "rebellion" or plotting to overthrow the Government.
 Foreign observers, including media representatives, were unable
 to attend the November 25 trial and December 4-appeal of Maria
 Elena Cruz Varela, leader of the dissident group Criterio
 Alternativo (CA), and other CA members who were charged with
 "felonious association" and slander after she arranged a
 meeting between dissidents and a visiting foreign dignitary.
 Court officials said there was no room for such outsiders. The
 courtroom was filled with construction workers and CDR members
 who, during the proceedings, conducted "acts" of repudiation"
 against the defendants. Cruz was sentenced to 2 years; the
 other four defendants received similar terms.
 The Penal Code includes a concept of "dangerousness" (articles
 72-89), defined as "the.special proclivity of a person to
 commit crimes, demonstrated by his. conduct in manifest
 contradiction of-Socialist norms.-" In 1991 there were reliable
 reports that authorities continued to intimidate activists and
 dissidents by threatening them with prosecution under this
 article. If the police decide that a person is exhibiting such
 behavior, the offender may be brought before a court which may
 call for therapy or political reeducation lasting from 1 to 4
 years-;
 According to reliable human rights monitors, there were
 approximately,200 political prisoners and detainees in Cuba at,
 year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Official intrusion into private and family affairs remains one
 of the-,most repressive and pervasive features of life in Cuba.
 Government- or Communist Party-directed mass organizations
 permeate Cuban society. The State has assumed a virtual right
 of interference into the lives of its citizens, even those who
 do not actively oppose the Government and its-practices. These
 intrusions are calculated to encourage ideological conformity
 and aim ostensibly at "improvement" of the citizenry.
 Government authorities possess a wide range of social
 controls. The educational system teaches that the State's
 interests have precedence over all other ties and commitments.
 Teachers, selected in part for their ideological commitment,
 emphasize Communist Party doctrine in the classroom and can
 sanction students whose families question orthodox opinion.
 Teachers also evaluate the political and ideological character
 of their students, which is noted in records carried with each
 student throughout his or her education. Failure to join a
 party-controlled student group or otherwise not having an
 
 
 559
 CUBA
 acceptable record may result in denial of student or worker
 access to higher education, a choice of career, or improved
 employment prospects.
 MININT employs an extensive security apparatus to determine the
 legality of all private and public associations, utilizing an
 intricate system of informers, block Wardens, and block
 committees (CDR) to monitor and control public opinion. The
 guardians of social conformity, CDR's are neighborhood
 surveillance/security committees tasked with closely monitoring
 the daily lives of individual residents. Participation in
 Cuba's 80,000 CDR's is described as voluntary; however, in
 urban areas it is in fact involuntary. CDR's report suspicious
 activities, such as contact with foreigners, reception of
 foreign radio or television broadcasts in the home, conspicuous
 consumption, unauthorized meetings, and attitudes toward the
 Government and the Revolution.
 In 1991, in response to growing dissatisfaction of Cubans over
 the deteriorating economic situation in the country and the
 Government's policies to deal with it, CDR activity intensified
 as the Government heightened its campaign against
 "counterrevolutionaries." In early summer, the Government
 established so-called rapid reaction brigades, authorized to
 act to thwart even impulsive signs of dissent that might-occur
 during the Pan American Games. Members are drawn from MININT
 and CDR's. A large portion of the members are women and young
 people trained in martial arts, who appear to be local citizens
 responding against dissident activity. Members are
 "voluntarily" bused from workplaces on an emergency basis to
 deal with any popular discontent. These brigades were used
 against activists during a demonstration attempted near the
 Villa Marista Detention Center on September 6.
 Cubans have no right to receive publications from abroad and
 expect that all correspondence with foreign countries will be
 read by state security officials. Overseas telephone calls are
 monitored, and conversations to and from foreigners in
 embassies and public places are reported. Well-known activists
 report frequent physical surveillance by security agents, as do
 foreign diplomats and journalists. In one case, state security
 personnel took over a garage across the street from the
 residence of one activist and installed video equipment to
 monitor activities in and around his home. The authorities
 regularly search activists' homes for little purpose other than
 intimidation. On June 30, authorities searched the home of MAR
 leader Yndamiro Restano, detained him without charge, then
 freed him some 24 hours later. On July 25, an activist was
 visited by state security police who showed him a doctored
 photograph of him dressed in the uniform of a MININT official
 and told him that they could cause him "family problems,"
 presumably by using the doctored photograph to make family
 members distrust him. Activists report that the use of tactics
 to divide family members is a new stratagem by the.authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are widely restricted. The Government does not
 allow direct criticism of the Revolution or its leaders; laws
 are enforced against antigovernment propaganda, antigovernment
 graffitti, and slander or insults against government
 officials. Local CDR's inhibit freedom of speech by monitoring
 and reporting on dissent or criticism (see Section l.f.).
 
 
 560
 CUBA
 The electronic and print media are owned by the State or
 party-controlled organizations and operate according to party
 guidelines. Cuban media faithfully reflect government views on
 events and are used to indoctrinate the public. No public
 forum exists for airing one's views apart from the
 government-controlled media. Artistic and literary freedoms
 are circumscribed by government control. Party and government
 officials carefully scrutinize humor and irony in the arts.
 Academic freedom is also severely limited. Education is the
 exclusive prerogative of the State, and the school system
 follows Marxist-Leninist precepts as interpreted by government
 guidelines. Academics may write freely so long as their work
 does not conflict with any government or Communist Party policy.
 In June the Government responded to an appeal by 10
 intellectuals for political reform by removing them from their
 jobs and expelling them from the National Union of Writers and
 Artists, which issued a statement that labeled them agents of a
 foreign government. The Government also campaigned to
 discredit the signatories and then moved to exercise greater
 control over the Union. A new union leadership was installed,
 with the new president subsequently named to the Politburo of
 the Cuban Communist Party.
 On October 7, a number of human rights activists held a joint
 press conference in Havana to present suggestions for the
 Fourth Party Congress that began on October 10. At least two
 Spanish journalists and one Polish journalist-who, along with
 more than 40 other journalists, attended the press
 conference--were subsequently expelled from Cuba. On September
 6, two journalists attempting to observe a demonstration by
 activists were roughed up by "rapid action brigades" as the
 journalists attempted to leave the area.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution does not provide for freedom of assembly or
 association, and those freedoms are not permitted. Any
 assembly of more than 3 persons, even in a private home, is
 punishable by up to 3 months in prison and a fine. According
 to article 240 of the Penal Code, organizers of "illicit or �
 unrecognized groups" may receive a sentence of up to 9 months.
 There was no known instance in 1991 of authorities approving a
 public meeting of a human rights group. Human rights groups
 are not recognized by the Government.
 Article 208 of the Penal Code forbids the existence of "illegal
 or unrecognized groups." The Ministry of Justice, in
 consultation with MININT, determines whether to recognize
 organizations. Apart from "recognized" churches.and one or two
 carefully monitored groups such as the Masonic'Order, small
 human rights groups represent the only associations outside the
 State and the Party. Authorities continued to ignore
 applications for legal recognition by the Cuban Committee for
 Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN).and the Cuban
 Committee for Human Rights (CCPDH). The charge of "illegal
 association" is often used by Cuban authorities to harass,
 intimidate, and jail activists. At least 16 dissidents have
 been convicted on these charges; these charges remain pending
 against 12 others, so that the authorities are able to jail
 them at any time.
 "Acts of repudiation," which are officially sponsored mob
 gatherings outside the home of a suspected counterrevolutionary
 to shout insults and paint condemnatory slogans, took place
 
 
 561
 CUBA
 against several political activists, including Osvaldo Paya
 Sardinas, head of the Christian000ement Liberation, which had
 been gathering signatures in favor of a referendum to reform
 the Cuban Constitution; Jose Luis Pujol, founder of the
 Alternative Criteria movement; and Gonzalez Gonzalez of the
 CCPDH. On November 19, Maria El4na Cruz Varela, the leader of
 Alternative Criteria who had set up a meeting of dissidents
 with a visiting foreign official, was forcibly removed from her
 home by a government-organized crowd of 200. She was beaten
 and dragged downstairs from her fourth floor apartment, which
 was ransacked. The attackers stuffed CA treatises in her mouth
 in an attempt to force her to eat them. Other "acts of
 repudiation" took place at the homes of CA members Jose Luis
 Pujol, Pastor Herrera Macuran, Gabriel Aguado Chavez, Elviro
 Baro, Eliezer Aguilar, Hubert Matos Sanbhez, Fernando Velazquez
 and Jorge Pomar, who suffered a fractured nose and ribs and
 whose wife was beaten. Several of these persons were later
 tried and sentenced to terms of up to 2 years in prison for
 "felonious association" and slander. On November 22, some 200
 people hurled eggs, stones, and insults at the home of Elizardo
 Sanchez, leader of the Cuban Democratic Convergence. The "act
 of repudiation" started shortly after Sanchez and his brother
 were detained by police and warned to desist from further
 dissident activity. The two were released at night and forced
 to return home through the crowd, which roughed them up as they
 returned to their residence. In the same period, other "acts
 of repudation" took place at the homes of Osvaldo Paya, leader
 of the Christian movement Liberation, and Vladimir Garcia
 Alderete, of the Association for Free Art.
 Most meetings among activists are monitored closely, and when
 the authorities interpret an agenda to include criticism of the
 Government or the political leadership, they take preemptive
 action to prevent the gathering, often invoking legal
 prohibitions on peaceful assembly. This occurred twice in
 June, the first time when human rights activists attempted to
 form a coalition group, and then when a group of activists
 attended a Sunday mass to publicize human rights issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes the rights of citizens to profess
 and practice any religious belief. However, the Government has
 placed severe restrictions oa the practice of religion and
 discriminated against believers. Religious adherents are
 excluded from membership in the Communist Party and thus from
 almost all executive and leadership positions, including posts
 in the Government, the courts, and the teaching professiom.
 Those who publicly profess their religious beliefs are subject
 to informal discrimination in the workplace and through social
 pressures on their children at school. The Fourth Party
 Congress debated and approved the admission df religious
 adherents to the Communist Party. While this new policy
 recommendation is likely to have a positive effect on the lives
 of Protestant adherents, it will not necessarily affect the
 current Catholic Church-State relationship. On December 1, the
 Catholic Bishops Episcopal Conference issued a statement which
 concluded that religious believers could not in good faith join
 the Cuban Communist Party because it is an "atheist and
 materialist" party.
 The Government and the Communist Party continue to maintain
 restrictions and controls on the activities of organized
 churches. Churches and other religious groups still must
 register with the Government and be officially "recognized."
 
 
 562
 CUBA
 Authorized religious organizations are customarily permitted to
 hold religious activities only at specifically designated
 places of worship. Many Catholic and Protestant churches have
 closed, and new construction of'church facilities has been
 restricted since the Revolution.
 All Jehovah's Witnesses suffer discrimination for failing to
 participate actively in the Revolution. However, the level of
 oppression exercised against Witnesses has varied from tacit
 toleration to virtual suppression of the practice of the faith,
 depending on the time and place. Many Witnesses have been
 imprisoned or fined for religious activities. With few
 exceptions, Jehovah's Witnesses find it impossible to attend
 school beyond the ninth grade, and are given menial low-paying
 jobs. Witnesses are constantly watched by CDR's and often
 harassed. They are detained by police for questioning, and
 their homes are subject to police raids, normally, but not
 always, carried out with a search warrant.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on domestic travel. All Cubans
 require permission from the Government to depart and remain
 abroad. During 1991 the general age limit for foreign travel
 was lowered from 45 for men and 40 for women to 20 for both
 sexes.
 In 1991 the Government permitted several thousand persons,
 including hundreds of former political prisoners, to leave the
 country permanently. It also granted exit permits to several
 emigrants who had been consistently refused in the past,
 including Alexander Menendez and Lisette Vazquez, children of
 Cuban sports figures who had defected. The Government
 continued to delay or deny, without explanation, exit permits
 to some-persons or their immediate families who had been
 accepted into immigration or refugee programs, or are dual
 nationals, a status which Cuba does not recognize. These often
 include relatives of asylees, such as Nydia Cartaya and her
 four daughters, or professionals who are forbidden to work in
 their fields because they tried to emigrate but are nonetheless
 refused exit permission.
 It is a crime for Cubans to depart the country without official
 permission. Persons who attempt to leave by boat'face fines or
 prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 1 year. In 1991
 discrimination against intending legal emigrants continued. A
 number of complex regulations affecting the ability to work and
 receive social benefits apply specifically to intending
 emigrants. Once emigration formalities are completed, all
 family posessions revert to the State unless relatives can
 prove ownership to the authorities' satisfaction.
 There is no right of repatriation. Exit permits for
 unofficial, temporary travel specify that the person must
 return to Cuba within 30 days, although extensions may be
 obtained. Cuban emigrants must apply for permission to return
 for temporary visits. Cubans who left the island prior to 1959
 are usually permitted to return for temporary visits. There is
 an annual limit of 10,000, however, on the number of Cuban
 emigrants who, having left the island between 1960 and 1980,
 are permitted to return for temporary visits. Cubans who left
 the island after 1980 are generally not permitted to return to
 visit.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Cuban citizens have no legal right to seek to change their
 .government or to advocate such change. The only political
 organization allowed in Cuba is the Communist Party. Members
 of the highest governing bodfies, the Politburo and the Central
 Committee, are selected by a small group of party leaders.
 President Castro ignored calls for democratic reform and
 labeled the human rights activists who proposed them "worms"
 and traitors working to undermine the Cuban Revolution. Any
 change judged not to be within the Revolution is rejected, as
 are proposals by Cubans who seek nonviolent political change or
 open debate about the Cuban political system. The Government
 has retaliated against those who have sought to change the
 Government or its policies. Activist Samuel Martinez Lara was
 tried and charged with rebellion or attempting to change the
 Government by force. Although Martinez Lara stressed the
 nonviolent nature of his group's desire to see change, the
 prosecutor refused to recognize the distinction between
 peaceful anc violent change.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights monitors are-subject to varying degrees
 and forms of intimidation. The Government continued to refuse,
 in violation of its own statutes, to consider applications for
 legal recognition submitted by several Human rights groups in
 1991. The three principal domestic human rights monitoring
 groups are: the Cuban Human Rights Committee (CCPDH, the
 Cuban Pro-Human Rights Party (PPDHC), and the Cuban Commission
 for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN). In
 September two umbrella organizations, the Cuban Democratic
 Convergence and the Cuban Democratic Coalition, were
 formed-each by the fusion of a number of smaller human rights
 groups.
 The Government angrily rejects criticism of the human rights
 situation in Cuba. The Cuban reaction to the passage in March
 of a United Nations Human Rights Commission resolution
 mandating the naming of a special representative to investigate
 the human rights situation in Cuba was to state that Cuba would
 not comply with "a single comma" of the resolution. In July,
 when U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar named Rafael Rivas
 Posada to be the special envoy, the Cuban representative to the
 United Nations stated that Cuba did not recognize the UNHRC
 mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the special
 representative, despite the fact that Cuba is a UNHRC member.
 At year's end, Cuba maintained its refusal to cooperate with
 the mandate and had ignored requests by the special
 representative for a visit to Cuba to meet with the Cuban
 Government and people.
 No domestic or international human rights groups are recognized
 by the Government or permitted to function legally in the
 country. Visits by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, suspended in June 1990, were not reinstated in 1991. In
 1991, however, representatives of a few foreign nongovernmental
 human rights organizations were able to make unofficial visits
 to Cuba.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a majority population of
 persons with black and mixed racial ancestry. The Constitution
 expressly forbids discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or
 national origin, but evidence suggests that some racial and
 sexual discrimination does occur.
 The Family Code of 1975 states that women and men have equal
 rights and responsibilities regarding marriage, divorce,
 raising children, maintaining the household, and pursuing a
 career. The Maternity Law for Working Women of 1974 provides
 18 weeks of paid maternity leave, and working women are granted
 prefdrential access to goods and services. Approximately 39
 percent of Cuban women work, and they are ywell represented in
 the professions, although few are in positions of significant
 policy responsiblity.
 Cuban law establishes strict penalties, including the death
 penalty, for rape. The Penal Code also provides sanctions for
 sexual coercion of women by authorities or guardians. These
 statutes appear to be generally enforced. Anecdotal
 information from human rights groups and other sources
 indicates that domestic violence and sexual assaults occur, but
 lack of statistical data makes it difficult to gauge its
 extent. Violent crime is rarely reported in the press. Due to
 cultural traditions, victims of mistreatment are reluctant to
 file reports or press charges, so instances are likely under
 reported.
 Information about specific incidents of racial discrimination
 is not available; In general, blacks tend to be concentrated'
 in low-paying and low-status jobs; there are few in senior
 government circles and in the top military ranks.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives priority to state or collective needs
 over individual choices regarding matters involving free
 association or provision of employment; the decisions and
 choices of workers are subordinate to the "demands of the
 economy and society" (article 44). Strikes are not permitted
 under the law, nor are any industrial actions known to have
 occurred in 1991 which were treated as strikes. However, there
 were reports of work stoppages in April by dockworkers in
 Cienfuegos who refused to load export foodstuffs which they
 believed should be kept for domestic consumption. Established
 Cuban labor organizations-are not trade unions in any real
 sense and do not act as a voice for worker rights, including.
 the right to strike. Labor is organized under the control of
 the State and Party through one umbrella group, the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC). The CTC is affiliated
 with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions
 and plays a leading role in its regional organization, the
 Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America. The
 CTC serves primarily as an instrument of'the State to enforce
 political and labor discipline, to encourage productivity and
 extended hours of "voluntary" labor, to hold down labor costs,
 and to conserve raw materials. However, some CTC member labor
 organizations have served as debating forums for the
 consideration of a limited range of labor issuee, such as
 worker safety and local working conditions.

 CUBA
 Independent unions are explicitly prohibited. Even discussion
 of such a step has been subject to punishment. In July local
 dockworkers in Havana elected a union representative who had
 not been handpicked by the Party leadership. He was
 immediately fired and expelled from the CTC. In October he and
 several others announced the formation of an independent union,
 the General Union of Cuban Workers. A'municipal court ordered
 the others fired shortly thereafter. At year's end, the
 Government had not responded to the fledgling union's petition
 for formal recognition, but neither had it taken any other
 action against the group.
 In 1991 the ILO accepted for the first time a complaint
 alleging multiple worker rights violations in Cuba.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Effective collective bargaining does not exist. The State
 Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. There are no known export processing
 zones in Cuba. Because the CTC is a government instrument,
 antiunion discrimination is only a relevant concept as it
 applies to the Government's repression of attempts to form
 independent union groups.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code contains
 prohibitions against forced labor. Workers do not have freedom
 to change jobs without official approval. Every worker must
 present a work identification card when seeking a new job.
 This card contains information on performance of "voluntary"
 work, protection of Socialist property, political
 consciousness, failure to meet production goals, and
 negligence. In practice, any job change remains under the
 control of the authorities who grade and evaluate employee
 records that form the basis of the work identity cards.
 Special groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan
 from other jobs, are employed on special construction projects
 and have taken on increased importance in the Government's
 efforts to complete tourist and other facilities that were
 given priority attention, such as the Pan American Games
 facilities. Some human rights monitors allege that workers
 refusing to "volunteer" for such projects often find themselves
 victims of discrimination or even at risk of losing their
 jobs. Microbrigade workers, however, are reportedly rewarded
 with priority listing for apartments, a very powerful incentive
 for voluntary work.
 Various International Labor Organization (ILO) bodies have
 found for a number of years that governmental restrictions on
 the freedom to choose or change employment are incompatible
 with ILO conventions prohibiting forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age is 17; however, the Labor Code
 provides for exceptions for those aged 15 and 16 to allow them
 to obtain training or to fill labor shortages. There is no
 evidence that authorities deviated from these rules in 1991.
 However, all students above the age of 11 are expected to
 devote 30 to 45 days of their summer vacations to agricultural
 work up to a maximum of 8 hours per day. The "voluntary labor"
 of student brigades continues to be utilized extensively in the
 agricultural sector.

 CUBA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Cuba's minimum wage is supplemented by social security
 consisting of free medical care'and education, along with
 subsidized housing and food. However, even with these
 subsidies,'a worker needs to earn substantially more than the
 minimum wage to support a family. Also, many common
 commodities increasingly can only be obtained on the black
 market economy or at prices substantially higher than the
 official government-listed price. The value of social security
 in improving living standards has been significantly eroded by
 the chronic shortages and tight rationing that are standard
 features of the Cuban economy. For example, most newly married
 couples must live with relatives for several years before
 obtaining housing.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays for
 unusually demanding jobs such as underground mining. The
 Government has discontinued most routine work on alternate
 Saturdays as an energy-saving measure. Provisions for worker
 safety and control of pollution generally appear to be
 inadequate. There is a lack of effective control and
 enforcement mechanisms to ensure worker safety, and industrial
 accidents are apparently frequent.
