 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A
 coalition government (Social Democratic Party and People's
 Party), formed originally after the 19t6 national election,
 continued in office after the October 1990 election. The
 liberal/nationalist Freedom Party and the loosely united Green
 Party comprise the opposition.
 The police and security organs are subordinated to the
 executive and judtcial authorities. The State Police, the
 secret service branch of the National Police, was extensively
 reorganized after it was discovered that it had engaged in
 monitoring the activities of private citizens without
 sufficiet grounds.
 Austria has a developed economy, and its citizens enjoy a high
 standard of living.
 Human rights are highly respected in Austria, and individual
 rights and political freedoms are provided for in the
 Constitution and generally protected.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from-
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings,
 either by government authorities or opposition groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no political abductions.
 c.- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is banned by Article II of the European Convention for
 the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; which
 is incorporated into the Austrian Constitution.
 In 1990 discussions of police brutality continued in the wake
 of citizen complaints of unnecessary use of force and other
 misconduct by police, highlighted by a reported case of rape
 by Vienna police officers of a teenage drug addict in
 custody. The conservative People's Party called for a
 "practicable police law," to be adopted in the next
 legislative term, that would stipulate more clearly the limits
 on police cbnduct during investigations. A bill for that
 purpose introduced by the Minister of the Interior was not
 passed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or exile. In
 criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial
 detention for up to 48 hours, by which time an investigative
 judge must decide on the legality of continuing the detention.
 Provided the investigative judge agrees, the accused may be
 held pending completion of an investigation for a maximum of 2
 years. Grounds for investigative detention are enumerated in
 the law, as are conditions for release on bail..

 AUSTRIA
 In recent years there has been a general decline both in the
 number of those in investigative detention and of those
 serving prison sentences. Although the number of criminal law
 violations has increased steadily, the number of persons
 serving prison sentences has decreased from 7,795 in 1987 to
 5,975 at the end of 1989.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. Trials are public. Judges are
 appointed for life and may not, in principle, be removed from
 office. Jury trials are prescribed for major offenses, and
 those convicted have the right of appeal. Written charges
 must be presented to the accused, who has the right to be
 represented by a lawyer.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities. Constitutional
 provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail and
 telephone. However, in 1990 a scandal broke out involving the
 activities of the State Police and led to a restructuring of
 that organization. The State Police were shown to have
 extensively monitored the activities of private citizens
 without sufficient grounds. Among other activities, the State
 Police provided, upon request, security checks for Austrian
 companies. Of 11,000 Austrians who inquired whether they had
 been monitored, approximately 20 percent had files with the
 State Police. These people were given access to their files
 unless "state interests" intervened. Many of the files were
 eventually shredded. The Interior Minister implemented a
 major restructuring of the organization, reducing its staff
 from 800 to 440. He emphasized that the State Police would
 focus in the future on measures against terrorism and
 rightwing extremism, as well as on counterintelligence, drug
 trafficking, arms dealing, and technology transfer. Adoption
 of a new police law (see Section l.c.) is planned, one
 stipulating a clear legal basis for the activities of the
 State Police.
 The privacy of family life is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent, and
 multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be removed from circulation if they violate
 legal provisions concerning morality or public security. As a
 matter of practice, such cases are extremely rare. Opposition
 viewpoints are given wide attention in Austrian publications.
 Freedom of academic expression is respected. Austria's
 well-established democratic political system, its active and
 independent press, and its effective judiciary combine to
 assure continued freedom of speech-and press.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Public demonstrations require a permit from the
 police authorities, who may consider only the public.safety
 aspect of the proposed demoftstration and not its political
 purpose. Permits are routinely issued.
 The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 makes an exception to
 freedom of association in the case of Nazi organizations and
 activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945, as amended in
 1947, also prohibits Nazi organizations and activities. The
 law on the formation of associations stipulates that
 permission to form an association may be denied if it is
 apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal
 activities of a prohibited organization. On the basis of that
 law, a political party with a strong nationalist, xenophobic
 platform was barred from running in the October national
 elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is provided for in the Constitution, although the
 treaty of St. Germain, which also is a constitutional
 provision, restricts this freedom to the practice of religions
 which are compatible with public safety and morality. In
 order to qualify as a recognized religious organization under
 Austrian law, religious groups register with the Government.
 Although 88 percent of the population is Roman Catholic, most
 of the world's major religions are represented.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement
 within the country or the right to change residence or
 workplace. Austrian residents are free to travel abroad and
 to emigrate. Citizens who have left the country have the
 right to return.
 As a result of the democratization process in Eastern Europe,
 Austria's traditional role as a country of asylum for refugees
 has changed. As political refugees from Eastern European
 countries have been replaced by economically motivated
 immigrants seeking work, the Austrian Government has taken
 measures to stem the flow. These have included the
 introduction of visa requirements for Romanians and Poles and
 the use of the armed forces at the frontier with Hungary to
 prevent illegal immigrants from Romania from entering Austria.
 As of September 1990, the- number of asylum applicants totaled
 18,712, of which 12,000 were Romanian. While the Austrian and
 Romanian Governments agreed on the return of some 7,000
 Romanians .who were unemployed and who had not been granted
 asylum in Austria, this agreement had not been implemented at
 year's end.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a democratic parliamentary
 system. Under the Constitution, national elections must be
 held at least every 4 years. Elections are free and regularly
 draw high levels of participation. There is universal
 suffrage for those 19 years of age and older.

 AUSTRIA
 The national elections of October 1990 resulted in the
 continuation of a coalition government composed of the two
 largest political parties. No party won an absolute majority.
 The Social Democratic Party, which won 80 seats in Parliament,
 went into coalition with the People's Party, which won 60
 seats. Two other parties are represented in Parliament: the
 liberal/nationalist Freedom Party won 33 seats, and the Greens
 won 10. Several small parties participating in the elections,
 including the Communist Party, did not receive sufficient
 support to elect candidates to the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Allegations of improper activities on the part of the
 authorities are discussed and investigated by the press,
 public groups, and private persons without government
 hindrance. Both international and local human rights groups
 operate freely.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Court of
 Human Rights in Strasbourg for implementing the European
 Convention on Human Rights. Austria concerns itself
 extensively with international human rights matters,
 especially the human rights situation in Eastern Europe.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Austria has an extensive public welfare system, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. In employment and in other areas, there is extensive
 legal protection against discrimination because of race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. In practice, there is
 no pattern of such discrimination.
 Legal restrictions on women's rights have long been
 abolished. Women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward economic
 equality in the postwar era. Nevertheless, in practice
 inequality still exists in political, economic, and social
 fields, despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979 to reform
 family law.
 In 1989 the Government passed a law making spousal rape a
 criminal offense and providing an expedited procedure for
 barring husbands from their homes for 3 months when they had
 threatened their wives with violence. The latter procedure is
 available even in the absence of a divorce action, a
 significant change from previous law.
 The human rights of Austrian minorities are fully respected.
 In this context, the availability of Slovene school
 instruction in the Province of Carinthia continued to be an
 issue in 1990. Following a Constitutional Court ruling that
 bilingual school instruction (in German and Slovene) had to be
 available throughout the province, and not only in Slovene
 areas, a federal law was passed on June 27 to implement the
 decision. So far, no agreement has been reached on a
 constitutional law extending these regulations to the
 provinces of Styria and Burgenland, which have small Croatian
 and Slovene minorities. The Governor of Carinthia has called
 for such a law to provide equal rights for the people in those
 provinces.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers have the right to form and join unions of their
 own choosing without prior authorization. This right is
 protected under general constitutional guarantees of freedom
 of association. In practice, Austrian trade unions have an
 important and independent voice in the political, social, and
 economic life of the country.
 In 1990, 60 percent of the work force was organized in 15
 national unions, each of which is a member of the Austrian
 Trade Union Federation (ATUF). This organization has a
 strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual unions
 and the federation are independent of government or political
 party control, although there are formal factions within these
 organizations that are closely allied with political parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly guaranteed by
 the Austrian Constitution, it is universally recognized in
 Austria as a right of workers, including those in the civil
 service. Strikes in the postwar period have been
 comparatively few and of short duration. In 1989, for
 example, time lost to strikes amounted to only 50 seconds per
 worker. In February 1990, a 5-day strike by some 5,000
 employees at the Steyer-Daimler-Puch truck plant was the
 longest Austria has experienced in 30 years. High on the list
 of reasons for Austria's record of labor peace is the system
 of "social partnership"-Austria's unofficial forum for
 cooperation among labor, management, and government. At the
 center of the system is a joint parity commission for wages
 and prices, chaired normally by the Federal Chancellor, which
 has an important voice on major economic questions.
 The ATUF and its members have affiliations with all three
 world labor federations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 The labor movement enjoys widespread acceptance, and almost
 all large companies, private and state owned, are strongly
 organized. Worker councils representing all of the workers in
 a unit operate at the enterprise level, and workers are
 entitled by law to elect one-third of the members of the
 boards of major companies. Collective agreements are
 negotiated by the ATUF on behalf of its member unions with the
 National Chamber of Commerce and its associations,
 representing the employers within a framework of wage-price
 policy guidelines set by the Joint Parity Commission. A 1973
 law imposes on employers the obligation to prove that job
 dismissals are not motivated by antiunion discrimination.
 Workers are further protected by membership in the Austrian
 Chambers of Labor, to which all employees except civil
 servants belong. These chambers fulfill several functions
 that are handled by trade unions in other countries, such as
 carrying out studies and preparing legislative proposals. The
 ATUF, however, is exclusively responsible for collective
 bargaining. The leaderships of the Chambers and the ATUF are
 elected democratically. Austria has no export processing
 zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 During the past 4 years, the Committee of Experts of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has expressed some
 concern over Austria's compliance with ILO Convention 29 on
 forced labor. Specifically, the ILO has been concerned with
 Article 2, paragraph 2(c), referring to "prison work to be
 carried out under the supervision and control of a public
 authority only." In response, the Austrian Government has
 provided information on progress toward compliance-;with the
 convention.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 15. The law is effectively
 enforced by the labor inspectorate of the Ministry for Social
 Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated national minimum wage in Austria.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set
 minimum wage rates by job classification for each industry. A
 worker whose annual income falls below a poverty line
 (approximately $488 per family member per month) is eligible
 to receive social welfare benefits. The average Austrian has
 ,a high standard of living, and even workers at the low end of
 the wage scale have a relatively decent minimum standard.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours
 since 1975, more than 50 percent of the labor force enjoys
 collective bargaining agreements setting a maximum workweek at
 38 or 38.5 hours.
 Legislation, under which a labor inspectorate attached to the
 Ministry of Social Affairs conducts inspections of
 occupational health and safety conditions, ensures the
 effective protection of workers in these areas. Workers can
 file complaints anonymously with the labor inspectorate, and
 the inspectorate may bring a suit against the employer on
 behalf of the employee. In 1989 there were only 320
 on-the-job deadly accidents among a work force of 3.4 million.
