 BARBADOS
 Barbados is a constitutional democracy. Its House of Assembly is
 the third oldest in the Western Hemisphere. It enjoys a free,
 democratic system of government modeled on the British system
 with two parties. The Prime Minister is the Head of Government.
 The country is a member of the British Commonwealth.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force insures public order; it respects
 the constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights. The
 quality of its personnel and training has improved lately, and
 morale is good. A well-established, British-model legal system
 provides due process and legal safeguards.
 Annual per capita income in Barbados is approximately $3,500.
 The mainstays of the economy are light manufacturing, tourism,
 services, and sugar.
 In 1983, there were no changes in Barbados' excellent human
 rights situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No killings for political motives have been reported in Barbados.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Constitution, and there
 have been no reports that it is practiced. There have also been
 no reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment. Prison conditions are humane although some
 overcrowding has been reported. Prison facilities are being
 expanded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Barbadian Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment, and this prohibition is respected in practice. The
 right of habeas corpus is guaranteed and observed. An individual
 must be taken before a court of law within 72 hours of arrest.
 Attorneys have ready access to their clients.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 offense be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable time
 by an independent and impartial court.  This is the practice,
 and defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. The
 Government provides free legal aid to the indigent. The
 judiciary acts independently and is free of intervention from
 other branches of government. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government of Barbados does not interfere arbitrarily in the
 private lives of its citizens.
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry. This
 prohibition is respected in practice. Warrants are required for
 entry and search of privately owned property. There is no
 censorship of mail or restrictions on the receipt of foreign
 publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Barbadian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and
 press, and these freedoms are respected. The two daily
 newspapers and one radio station function independently of the
 Government. The Government owns the Caribbean Broadcasting
 Corporation Radio and Television Service, which is modeled after
 the British Broadcasting Corporation, and is independent of
 government control. Opposition views are regularly reported.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and p;ivate
 organization are observed. Various trade associations and
 private organizations function without government hindrance.
 Fifty percent of the labor force is organized. Protests or
 strikes have occurred when collective bargaining has failed.
 Although one major union has some ties to the opposition party,
 labor leaders and the rank-and-file are motivated primarily by
 economic and social, not political, considerations. Full access
 to recognized international bodies continues unabated.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and the
 Methodist faiths dominate, there is a wide variety of religious
 organizations active in the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within and outside
 Barbados; the Constitution guarantees the right to do so. In
 replying to public criticism of some cricket players touring
 South Africa, the Government stated that it had no power to
 restrict such travel. Barbados has a small number of applicants
 for refuge and asylum admission who are handled on a case-by-case
 basis. Barbados is a party to the 1972 Convention on the Status
 of Stateless Persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Barbados is a parliamentary democracy following the British
 model, in which parties compete freely in honest elections held
 at least once every five years. There are no impediments to
 participation in the political process. There is universal
 suffrage, the minimum voting age being 18 years.

 The present government under the Barbados Labor Party came into
 office in 1976 and was reelected in June 1981 with 17 of the 27
 assembly seats. The differences between the government party and
 the opposition Democratic Labor Party are based more on history
 and personalities than on ideology. Both parties tend toward
 democratic socialist policies, and they have taken power in turn
 during three decades of self-rule. The "loyal opposition"
 criticizes the Government in generally constructive fashion and
 presumably would not hesitate to call attention to human rights
 abuses. There are no third parties at present, although there
 exists a miniscule but vocal leftist fringe group.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Since there have been no reports of human rights violations in
 Barbados, human rights groups have not requested investigations.
 Barbados advocates strengthening the human rights machinery of
 the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The
 Government favors more investigations into alleged violations of
 human rights in other countries and the increased use of
 factfinding or observer teams to monitor controversial political
 and electoral situations. The Government has spoken out on human
 rights violations in other countries, particularly in the Western
 Hemisphere and Africa. There are several small groups fostering
 consciousness of human rights.
 In its 1983 report, Amnesty International expressed concern only
 over the imposition of the death penalty in the country. Freedom
 House gives Barbados its highest rating of "free" in both
 political rights and civil liberties.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Barbados has a population of 251,000 with growth rate of only .3
 percent due to continued emigration and a declining birth rate.
 Barbados had a 1981 per capita income of about $3,500. Three
 years of sugar crop shortfalls, continued increases in world
 petroleum prices (70 percent of the oil used is imported), and a
 significant decrease in tourism have caused an.economic downturn,
 after several years of solid economic growth. The recession now
 appears to have ended as a result of the Government's monetary
 and fiscal policies, world economic recovery, and an upturn in
 tourism.
 Citizens have long had access to public and private educational
 systems, and the adult literacy rate is 99 percent. Primary
 school enrollment is compulsory. Looking ahead to future
 educational needs, the Government has begun expanding the
 secondary school system.
 Adequate medical care is available to all residents through local
 clinics and hospitals under the Government's health program.
 There is one doctor for every 1,500 people. Average life
 expectancy for Barbadians is 70.8 years. Infant mortality is
 22.7 per 1,000 births. Government health insurance programs
 cover all Barbadians. Overall, Barbadians are well housed and
 fed.
 There is no discrimination based on race or sex. Barbados is a
 signatory to the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Discrimination against Women. Women actively participate in
 all aspects of national life. One Cabinet member is a woman, and
 women are well represented at all levels in both the public and
 private sectors. Women's groups speak out on public issues and
 insist on being consulted by the Government on important issues.
