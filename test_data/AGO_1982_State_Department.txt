 ANGOLA*
 The People's Republic of Angola is an autocratic party state
 ruled by a small group of officials within a single political
 party, the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola - Labor Party (MPLA). All major policy decisions are
 determined within the party structure. During 1982 the human
 rights situation in Angola was affected by continuing armed
 hostilities between the military arm of the Popular Movement
 for the Liberation of Angola and the opposition National Union
 for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). Intensified
 fighting between MPLA and UNITA forces during 1982 led to marked
 deterioration in the quality of life, and extensive loss of
 life. Arrests of UNITA sympathizers were more publicized than
 previously, but there was no indication that the number of
 arrests or the Government's handling of human rights changed
 significantly from 1981;
 When the Portuguese granted independence to Angola on
 November 11, 1975, the three major liberation groups which had
 fought Portuguese rule were engaged in a bloody civil war, marked
 by the intervention of both Cuban and South African forces. With
 Cuban and Soviet assistance the Marxist MPLA succeeded by early
 1976 in ousting the two rival movements from Luanda, the capital,
 and from power. Both rival groups, the National Front for the
 Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and UNITA, reverted to guerrilla war-
 fare which has continued ever since. The FNLA carries out spora-
 dic guerrilla operations in northern Angola but does not pose a
 major threat to the Luanda Government. UNITA, however, has the
 allegiance of a substantial portion of the Ovimbundu tribe
 (approximately 35-40 per cent of the country's population) and
 continues to pose a serious challenge to the Government's control
 of large areas of the southern, eastern, and central portions of
 the country.
 Since taking power in 1975 by force of arms, the MPLA has re-
 fused reconciliation with and a role in the Government to UNITA,
 which has stated that it is willing to discuss a political settle-
 ment. The MPLA has established an autocratic one-party state with
 concomitant restrictions on freedom of expression and suppression
 .of political opposition.
 The fighting in Angola has resulted in extensive civilian casual-
 ties. An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban combat forces support
 the Angolan armed forces in their operations against UNITA and
 are stationed at strategic locations in central and southern
 Angola. UNITA conducts guerrilla operations throughout most of
 central, southern, and eastern Angola, and UNITA controls a sec-
 tion of southeastern Angola. UNITA's operations and Angolan/
 Cuban counterinsurgency operations have resulted in numerous
 civilian deaths. In addition to ideological differences, the
 MPLA and UNITA have different ethnic bases. The MPLA and UNITA
 compete for the allegiance of civilian populations through
 persuasion and intimidation, and have accused one another of
 atrocities against civilian populations. Innocent civilians are
 also caught in the middle of hostilities between the Southwest
 Africa People's Organization (SWAPO - a Namibian resistance
 movement with bases in Angola) and South Africa. SWAPO, which
 the MPLA allows to operate in Angola, carries out cross-border
 * There is little reliable information on human rights practices
 in Angola. The United States does not maintain diplomatic
 relations with the People's Republic of Angola, and thus has no
 diplomatic personnel on the spot to monitor human rights condi-
 tions or to evaluate allegations of abuses.

 guerrilla operations from Angola against targets in Namibia, and
 South African forces regularly conduct military operations
 military operations against SWAPO bases in southern Angola. The
 MPLA and others have from time to time alleged that South African
 forces have committed atrocities against innocent civilians in
 Angola. However, these allegations have not been corroborated,
 and indications are that the South Africans have aimed their
 operations against military targets.
 The continuing civil war and a prolonged drought have resulted
 in large numbers of displaced persons in central and southern
 Angola and have severely disrupted the economy. The declining
 prices of oil and diamonds, the two principal sources of Angola's
 revenue, and decline in food production as a result of the civil
 war have exacerbated this serious economic situation. Moreover,
 the continuing civil war has forced the Government to devote a
 substantial portion of its financial resources to the military.
 The MPLA has made an effort to provide humanitarian assistance to
 the displaced persons and has allowed the International Committee
 of the Red Cross to operate in Angola. However, these efforts to
 ameliorate human suffering have been severely limited by the
 continuing hostilities. Malnutrition is widespread, and the
 quality of life continues to deteriorate.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The continuing civil war in Angola resulted in a number of allega-
 tions that MPLA, UNITA, and South African forces have killed
 civilians.
 While some civilian casualties have probably resulted from South
 African operations against SWAPO in southern Angola, available
 information indicates that during 1982 South African forces
 directed their operations against military targets and not against
 civilians.
 Hundreds of civilian deaths during 1982 resulted from the civil
 war between UNITA and the Cuban-supported MPLA. The fighting is
 widespread, but there are no reliable casualty figures available.
 There have been a number of unsubstantiated reports of specific
 incidents of indiscriminate killing by both sides. There have
 also been unconfirmed reports that UNITA practices urban terror-
 ism in MPLA-controlled areas. In October the MPLA publicly
 charged that UNITA killed hundreds of civilians in the Huambo
 area of central Angola. Similarly, UNITA has charged that the
 MPLA has killed civilians sympathetic to UNITA. The MPLA has at
 times reportedly executed UNITA prisoners -- both with and with-
 out trial--and UNITA has reportedly retaliated by executing
 MPLA prisoners. It should be stressed, however, that no firm
 evidence exists to substantiate any of these claims and counter-
 claims. In April 1982 the Angolan state radio announced that
 the People's Revolutionary Tribunal (established by the MPLA in
 1976 to try prisoners accused of endangering the security of the
 state or of economic sabotoge) sentenced five suspected UNITA
 prisoners to death for "undermining the internal security." In
 October, MPLA authorities reportedly executed six alleged sup-
 porters of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of
 Cabinda (FLEC), a separatist movement which is waging a guer-
 rilla war in the Cabinda enclave. UNITA has charged that Cuban
 and Angolan forces have used napalm and other weapons against
 givilians in the UNITA-controlled areas of southeastern Angola.
 These charges have not been verified.
 
 
 21
 b. Disappearance
 There is no information to indicate that abductions, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by the MPLA
 security agencies.
 The Government has, however, not cooperated in US Government
 efforts to locate an American pilot who disappeared in September
 1980 while flying over Angola.
 c. Torture
 Although the Constitution charges the state with responsibility
 to guarantee the integrity of the person, allegations of torture
 in Angolan prisons have been made in the past. Information is
 insufficient to determine the extent to which torture is practiced
 by the police or security services. Americans who have at times
 been imprisoned in Angola have not been physically tortured or
 abused during their imprisonment.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The prisons are overcrowded, with substandard diet and sanitation,
 but these conditions seem to reflect the poor state of the
 economy more than deliberate maltreatment. Some reports have
 alleged that foreigners are not treated well, but Americans who
 have been imprisoned in Angola have been well-treated, and had
 access to available medical care. During 1982 US diplomats
 were on several occasions allowed to visit three Americans held
 by the Angolan authorities prior to their release on November 17
 as part of a Red Cross-sponsored prisoner exchange, but the
 authorities had not permitted such visits prior to 1982. No
 family visits were permitted.
 Prison authorities reportedly have wide latitude in the treatment
 of prisoners, with rules governing the treatment of prisoners
 either lax or non-existent. Americans who have been imprisoned
 in Angola at various times, both at the main Sao Paulo prison in
 Luanda and the Ministry of State Security prison in Luanda, have
 reported arbitrary treatment of prisoners by guards through
 solitary confinement, confiscation of personal effects, physical
 intimidation, and prolonged interrogation. Foreign advisers,
 including Cubans and East Germans, are reportedly involved in
 helping the MPLA security services, and may be involved in
 helping to run some prisons.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges
 of human rights violations in Angola have been arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment without due process. Numerous reports allege
 that individuals are arrested and imprisoned on suspicion or
 denunciation by others and, in some cases, held for years without
 being notified of the charges, if any, against them. According
 to Amnesty International on its 1982 Report, this is true of
 most people arrested for political reasons.
 One American citizen who was released in 1980 had been held for
 nearly three years without being charged or tried. An American
 pilot who made an emergency landing in Angola in 1980 was held
 for six months while authorities investigated his case. Yet
 another American pilot who made an emergency landing in Angola
 in early 1981 was arrested and held without being charged until
 he was released as part of a Red Cross-sponsored exchange on
 November 17, 1982.   It is not known how many persons have been
 arbitrarily arrested and held without trial.
 
 
 22
 The Ministry of State Security, military security forces, and
 police have independent powers of arrest and detention without
 charge or trial. While some alleged supporters of opposition
 groups were tried before the People's Revolutionary Tribunal,
 many were arrested for political reasons and held without being
 charged or tried. Lines of authority governing who is empowered
 to arrest and detain persons are unclear. For example, the
 People's Revolutionary Tribunal has a detention review commis-
 sion, but it is not known how that commission operates, and
 uncharged detainees are not necessarily allowed to appeal to
 this commission. Part of the difficulty in identifying the
 extent of arbitrary arrest is that political prisoners are
 imprisoned at the main prisons in Luanda with criminal offenders
 as well as in special detention camps. Amnesty International
 has reported on a number of specific cases.
 UNITA also reportedly holds a number of prisoners, including
 MPLA soldiers as well as foreigners captured as a result of
 UNITA operations. In September UNITA released a Red Cross nurse
 who had been held since May. She publicly stated that she was
 well-treated. Other prisoners, including two Soviets, a number
 of Portuguese, and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lubango were
 released by UNITA during 1982.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of the accused to legal counsel and defense is guaran-
 teed in the Constitution, but there is insufficient information
 to assess adequately the observance of this right or whether
 accused persons are given fair trials. Two Americans alleged to
 be mercenaries were given public trials in 1976 and were allowed
 access to attorneys. The right of appeal exists in some cases,
 but it is unclear whether this provides a practical safeguard
 for the accused. A fair public trial is denied to those arbitrar-
 ily detained without being charged.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the domicile and confidentiality of correspon-
 dence are guaranteed in the Constitution, but it is not known to
 what extent these rights are respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, conscience,
 and belief but significantly restrains the exercise of these
 freedoms by requirements that activities must fall within "the
 area of realizing the fundamental objectives of the People's
 Republic of Angola," that they must be "in the national inter-
 est," or that they "conform to public order."
 Censorship of political expression exists, and the Government
 runs the media. Although opposition views are not aired, the
 press frequently contains articles criticizing government fail-
 ings in economic areas. The Government is especially sensitive
 to criticism in the foreign press, and has occasionally expelled
 foreign correspondents for writing articles critical of its
 policies, or describing activities of opposition movements.
 Entry of foreign correspondents into Angola is tightly restricted
 as is the circulation of Western journals and periodicals.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is denied to any political movement other
 
 
 than the MPLA, and all other political movements have been
 banned. There are numerous unconfirmed reports of arrests of
 people who voice support of opposition movements or alternative
 political systems.
 The only trade union movement in Angola is the government-
 controlled National Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA). Tradition-
 al labor union activities and rights are tightly restricted by
 the Government. Strikes are prohibited by law as a crime
 against the security of the state.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and
 belief and provides for separation of church and state, the MPLA
 has publicly emphasized the importance of propagating "atheism,"
 and has criticized religious activities. Churches have been
 allowed to continue their religious activities. Church services
 are regularly held and there is widespread attendance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As a result of the continuing civil war, the Angolan Government
 is acutely security-conscious and has restricted travel. There
 is a pass system within Angola, and foreigners are generally
 prohibited from traveling outside the principal cities. Travel
 abroad is carefully controlled by restrictions on passport issu-
 ance and exit visas, and by currency restrictions. Emigration
 is tightly restricted. The Angolan Government limits travel to
 Angola through a selective and stringent visa policy.
 in August 1981, Angola became a signatory to the UN "Convention
 Relating to the Status of Refugees." Angola has welcomed refugees
 from other countries. There are approximately 50,000 Namibian,
 18,000 Zairian, and 5,000 South African refugees in Angola.
 Since mid-1980 between 120,000 and 150,000 former Zairian
 refugees in Angola returned home with the auspices of the UN
 High Commissioner for Refugees.
 The Angolan Government has not made special efforts to encourage
 its citizens' return. The right of voluntary repatriation for
 those who continue to support movements opposed to the MPLA does
 not exist in practice, and anyone formerly associated with an
 opposition movement who returned to Angola would face a reason-
 able fear of persecution. As a result of fear of persecution,
 approximately 250,000 Angolans have taken refuge in:Zaire, and
 thousands of other Angolans who have settled in Zaire are no
 longer considered refugees. There are 18,000 Angolan refugees
 in Zambia and an undetermined number in Portugal. Of the approx-
 imately 400,000 Angolans who left the country since independence,
 the Angolan Government claims that some 180,000 have returned,
 but this claim cannot be verified.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The People's Republic of Angola is ruled by a small group of
 officials within the single party, the MPLA-Labor Party, which
 is the only legal political party. The Government has banned
 all political activities by opposition groups, and denies them
 access to the state-controlled media.
 The Constitution guarantees the exercise of political power to
 the "masses," through organized forms of "popular power." In
 effect, this restricts political expression to participation
 in the MPLA-Labor Party or to one of its controlled and sanction-
 ed organizations such as its youth wing, the Angolan Women's
 
 
 Organization, or the trade union movement.
 The MPLA Government has established political institutions con-
 sistent with its ideology, with political power centered in the
 party's politburo and central committee. A national popularly-
 "elected" "People's Assembly" was established in 1981. Although
 the party claims that these steps were taken to increase popular
 participation in government, political rights do not appear to
 have been expanded. All real political power is exercised within
 the party structure through the politburo and central committee
 at the national level and local party structures at the provin-
 cial level. Key figures in the MPLA play leading roles in the
 People's Assembly. The People's Assembly and the Government
 Council of Ministers (composed of all government ministers and
 the President) carry out policy determined by the party. During
 1982 the MPLA launched a campaign to increase membership in the
 party, but participation is still restricted to a small segment
 of the population.
 Angolan citizenship is denied to those individuals with claims
 to another nationality, who have committed homicide, opposed
 the "liberation struggle", or joined clandestine organizations
 opposed to the "decolonization process." Voting rights of those
 citizens who are known supporters of opposition groups are
 restricted.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens and pro-
 scribes discrimination because of color, race, ethnicity, sex,
 birthplace, religion, education, or economic or social condi-
 tions. Women participate in the MPLA, not only in the Angolan
 Women's Organization, but also in the higher levels of the par-
 ty. Women in the higher party organs, however, have not been
 numerous. Only three of the MPLA's 65 central committee members
 are women, while none of the government ministers or vice minis-
 ters are female. Social, cultural, and traditional factors tend
 to limit the participation of women at the highest levels of the
 party and Government, although women are accorded equal status
 under the law and party regulations.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International has expressed concern about the imprison-
 ment of members of political opposition groups and arbitrary
 arrest and detention, and has cited a number of specific cases.
 Amnesty International's annual report for 1982 stated that it
 appealed to the Angolan Government at various times to commute
 the death sentences imposed on alleged numbers of opposition
 groups, but these appeals were apparently unheeded. The Interna-
 tional Committee of the Red Cross, which operates a large relief
 program for displaced persons in Angola, has not been able to
 obtain the authorization of either the Government or UNITA to
 visit prisoners, except in isolated instances.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Although Angola is potentially one of the richest countries in
 Africa, its economy has been severely damaged as a result of the
 continuing civil war, the decline in the prices of oil and dia-
 monds, its two principal sources of revenue, and by the exodus
 of skilled manpower. Of the approximately 500,000 Portuguese
 residents prior to independence, only 30,000 remain. The con-
 tinuing civil strife and South African incursions against SWAPO
 have damaged the country's infrastructure and forced the diver-
 sion of most assets to the military. The presence of thousands
 of Cuban combat troops has burdened the economy. Although
 
 
 25
 thousands of civilian Cuban and East European advisors are
 working in technical and professional positions, the require-
 ments for skilled manpower have not been fully met.
 These economic problems have had a disastrous effect on the
 population. The-distribution system for foodstuffs has been
 disrupted, and deteriorating security in central Angola due to
 MPLA-UNITA hostilities forced the International Committee of the
 Red Cross in October 1982 to suspend its extensive food relief
 and medical programs. The over 200,000-500,000 persons in
 central and southern Angola, who have been displaced from their
 homes as a result of the combination of civil strife and a pro-
 longed drought, are suffering from severe malnutrition. Many
 rural inhabitants have abandoned the countryside to seek food
 and safety in urban areas. As a result of this rural exodus,
 crops are not being planted. UNITA's guerrilla activities in
 central and southeast Angola have also disrupted agricultural
 production. Major urban centers such as Luanda have been over-
 whelmed by the-influx from rural areas. There are severe food
 shortages in the urban areas, and public services are severely
 taxed. As a result, the health of the Angolan population as a
 whole has deteriorated.
 While the Government is not indifferent to the plight of these
 displaced persons, it does not have the capability to respond.
 At the Government's request, the United Nations Disaster Relief
 Organizations (UNDRO) in 1981 evaluated relief needs and report-
 ed that assistance in the form of food, and supplies such as
 medicines, blankets, and tents, is required for over half a
 million persons. During 1982 the MPLA made a major effort to
 obtain food assistance from Western countries and various inter-
 national organizations. A number of Western countries provide
 economic and technical assistance.
 The United States has for the past several years provided humani-
 tarian food assistance under the Food for Peace program through
 shipments of grain under the auspices of UNICEF and the World
 Food Program.
 Although the Constitution states that it is the duty of the
 state to provide conditions for social development, work, health
 care, and education, continuing internal hostilities and the
 exodus of trained personnel have severely hampered the Govern-
 ment's efforts to provide basic economic and human needs to
 Angolans. For example, although physicians from several coun-
 .tries are serving in Angola under assistance programs, the
 number is insufficient to supply minimum health care to more
 than a small fraction of the total population. Available data
 highlights the poor quality of life. The population growth rate
 is 2.4 percent with high infant mortality of 154.4/1000, and
 life expectancy at birth is only 42 years.
 The Government has been concentrating efforts on improving the
 educational system. There is 82 percent enrollment in primary
 school. The Government has had some success in expanding
 its basic literacy program, but the current literacy rate is
 estimated at only 30 percent.
 A thriving and expensive black market is known to exist.
 Despite government controls on prices, the severe scarcity of
 nearly all goods has caused the inflation rate to skyrocket.
 The MPLA has established as its goal the transformation of
 Angola into a "socialist" economy and the major sectors of the
 economy, oil, diamonds, and banking, have been nationalized.
 The right to private property is, however, guaranteed by the
 Constitution, and a small portion of the economy, mainly in the
 agricultural sector, still operates under private ownership.
