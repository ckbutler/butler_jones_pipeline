 MALI
 Mali is a single-party state in which effective authority is
 exercised by General Moussa Ttaore, President of the Republic
 and Secretary General of the Democratic Union of the Malian
 People (UPDM), the country's only legal political party and
 supreme political entity. President Traore assumed power
 through a military coup in 1968. The military Government
 adopted a new Constitution in 1974. Since then, under
 Traore's leadership, the military have retained a privileged
 position, but civilians have also played an increasingly
 important role in daily government operations and in the
 party. In 1988 military officials held approximately 22
 percent of the cabinet portfolios and 25 percent of the seats
 in the party's Central Executive Bureau. Military officers
 occupied 4 of the 7 regional governerships, 11 of the 46
 districts, and an important number of lower-level
 administrative posts, particularly in the border areas.
 Mali maintains an army and air force, which provide both
 external and internal security. The gendarmerie (paramilitary
 police) assists in the latter area. Mali has no special
 internal security force.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of
 approximately $190, Mali is among the world's poorest
 countries. Mali is landlocked and lacks major mineral
 resources. Its economy rests on subsistence farming and
 animal husbandry. Although data is not yet available,
 agricultural production in 1988 was expected to increase
 substantially due to good rainfall. However, any gain in the
 food supply is offset by Mali's rapidly growing, largely
 illiterate population, and unemployment is a persistent
 problem. In 1988 the Government continued its attempts to
 modernize the economy, particularly through fiscal reform and
 privatization of state enterprises, but Mali remains heavily
 dependent on external aid.
 Human rights, including political rights, are circumscribed by
 the Government. However, in 1988 the last known political
 prisoner was released, the controversial desert prison of
 Taoudenit was closed, and the Government expanded its practice
 of permitting citizens to criticize government economic reform
 policies, corruption, and inefficiency within limited arenas,
 including the UDPM convention in March.   In June 1988,
 President Traore was elected chairman of the Organization of
 African Unity (OAU). In his first few months he has been an
 active OAU President, seeking to resolve numerous outstanding
 African regional conflicts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No incidents of disappearance, abduction, or hostage-taking
 were reported.

 MALI
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government does not condone police brutality and has
 issued specific instructions prohibiting brutality against
 suspects. However, physical abuse of suspected persons
 sometimes occurs during police interrogation or in confronting
 demonstrations. There were no instances of officials being
 tried or punished for such actions. Torture is rare, but
 public beating by the citizenry of persons identified as
 thieves occasionally takes place.
 Prison conditions are harsh and characterized by inadequate
 medical facilities and food supplies. Several prisons are
 located-in isolated, inhospitable desert regions, which makes
 it difficult for family members to visit prisoners and provide
 extra food. However, at one of the more isolated prisons, at
 Kidal, prison conditions are better than in Bamako's
 overcrowded central prison. Prisoners are permitted to work
 outside the prisoh and are paid a token sum for their work.
 On the eve of Mali's independence day, September 22, the
 Government announced the closing of the Taoudenit Prison, an
 isolated security prison on the site of ancient salt mines in
 which prisoners worked. In the past, political prisoners have
 reportedly been held there, and Amnesty International has
 received reports that two long-term political prisoners died
 in Taoudenit in 1987.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malian judicial system is based on the French model.
 Detained persons do not have the right to a judicial
 determination of the legality of their detention, but arrests
 cannot be made without formal charges. However, in political
 cases, the authorities do not always follow this practice.
 Malian law does not provide for release on bail, but detainees
 are sometimes released on their own recognizance.
 Administrative backlogs often cause delays in bringing people
 to trial. Detainees are usually allowed access to a lawyer of
 their choice.
 Several students from the teacher training college (ENSUP)
 were briefly detained (and reportedly beaten) on March 2 after
 a march on the Ministry of Education. The disturbances were
 part of a series of strikes and demonstrations staged by
 teachers and students protesting the Government's nonpayment
 of salaries and scholarships.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A part of the executive branch, the judiciary, is not
 independent. The Ministry of Justice supervises both law
 enforcement and judicial functions. The Supreme Court is the
 highest court, with both judicial and administrative powers.
 The National Assembly can convene a High Court of Justice to
 hear cases against state ministers, but this Court did not
 meet during 1988.
 Corruption remains a major political issue, and trials against
 corrupt officials continue, notably in the Special Court of
 State Security. Defendants usually admit guilt in the hope of
 receiving a more lenient sentence and allow their lawyers to
 argue mitigating circumstances. The verdict and sentence are
 
 
 207
 MALI
 rendered by a panel of three judges. The death penalty is
 mandatory under the law for anyone convicted of embezzling
 more than $36,000. However, in most embezzlement trials,
 restitution by the accused can decrease the severity of the
 sentence. Once convicted, a person can appeal for a
 presidential pardon or request a new trial. The right to
 request a presidential pardon or a new trial exists in
 mandatory death penalty cases.
 From November 1987 to July 1988, a Special Court of State
 Security was convened to try government officials who had
 misappropriated government funds. Judgments ranged from
 20-years in prison at hard labor to not guilty.
 On the occasion of the 1988 Malian Independence Day, the
 Government again pardoned prisoners, including three persons
 imprisoned for plotting to overthrow the Government. As far
 as is known, there were no political prisoners being held in
 Mali at the end of the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Inviolability of the home is provided for in the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Police searches are
 infrequent, and warrants aie issued and recorded, though
 sometimes after the fact.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Malian Constitution does not expressly provide for freedom
 of speech and press. However, President Traore, in an address
 during his state visit to the United States, noted that freedom
 of expression is respected in Mali. In theory, criticism is
 permitted within the councils of the sole political party,
 which all Malians are encouraged to join. Not all Malians are
 party members, however, and questioning of government
 authority outside party deliberations is discouraged, although
 not expressly forbidden.
 The Government controls all major Malian media, and all
 journalists are government employees. There are independent
 specialty magazines such as Jamana, for cultural and social
 news, or Podium, for sports news, that contain some political
 commentary and circulate freely. While'questioning of
 government authority is not permitted, media and public
 criticism of specific programs and the performance of some
 government offices or'office-holders is allowed. Prior to the
 1987 Extraordinary Party Congress, the President himself .
 participated in a series of public meetings-in which charges
 of corruption were leveled against his Government.
 Academic freedom does not include the right.to criticize the
 Government, nor is this right extended to the only recognized
 labor union, which is considered by many to be an arm of the
 Government. The union has, however, occasionally expressed
 some criticisms. Private Malian publications which are more
 than mildly critical of the Government do not exist, but
 international publications, even those critical of Mali and
 its Government, are available. Satire and social criticism in
 the media, sometimes with a political cast, are not common but
 are occasionally encouraged by the Government.

 MALI
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malian Constitution provides for the right of citizens to
 form organizations to protect their "professional interests,"
 but in reality only selected nonpolitical organizations such
 as urban professional associations qualify. The only groups
 which assemble freely are the women's, youth, and similar
 associations of Mali's single political party.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is%a secular state. The Government generally does not
 discriminate on religious grounds. Although 90 percent of
 Malians are Muslim, most other religions may practice their
 faiths freely and are permitted to establish houses of worship
 as well as schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths
 enjoy government cooperation. Proselytizing and conversion
 are permitted, except in the case of the Baha'i, who may
 practice at home but may not proselytize or establish houses
 of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 police checks sometimes occur in which Malians and foreigners
 alike are stopped, particularly at night. These checks are
 used ostensibly to restrict the movement of contraband goods.
 In practice, some police probably supplement their frequently
 delayed salaries by assessing ad hoc fines or confiscating
 goods. Malians are free to change residence or workplace.
 Foreign travel requires an exit visa, but this is easy to
 obtain. Repatriation is not restricted.
 In the past drought years, Mali both accepted and generated
 displaced persons. Several thousand Malians were repatriated
 from Algeria in 1986 and 1987. In 1987 Mali also welcomed
 back over 100 Malians deported from France.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have limited and infrequent opportunity to influence
 their government and no ability to change it. Important
 policies and decisions are made by a small group--the
 President, the 19-member Central Executive Bureau of the UDPM,
 and the Council of Ministers. The memberships of these groups
 overlap. The military role in governing Mali remains
 important, but civilian participation in the leadership groups
 has been growing. Party congresses, including the one held in
 March, are called by the President to consider special issues,
 such as recent issues of political participation and
 corruption. The 1987 Special Party Congress adopted a new
 National Charter of National Reorientation of Public Life,
 calling on Malians to dedicate efforts to economic development.
 The Congress also appointed a special commission to assist the
 Secretary General of the party to recruit new leadership and
 encourage greater public participation in the party and, by
 extension, the Government. These efforts continued throughout
 1988.

 MALI
 Within the one-party system, multiple candidates often contest
 party elections at the local level, but for National Assembly
 elections, which are held every 4 years, only one carefully
 selected party candidate runs for each seat. Proposed
 legislation is debated and endorsed in the National Assembly
 after its acceptance by the Council of Ministers and review by
 the Supreme Court. Party membership is a prerequisite for
 voting and for holding a civil service appointment or other
 government position. All citizens are encouraged-to join for
 a nominal fee.
 While underrepresented, women are present at all levels of the
 Government and in the party. Two women are cabinet ministers,
 and one is in the party's Central Executive Bureau. One
 woman, the President of the Malian Women's Association, is a
 member of the National Assembly. A few women serve in the
 armed forces and the police department.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is generally responsive to inquiries by
 recognized human rights groups, but there are no local
 organizations to monitor human rights. The Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs handles inquiries from Amnesty International
 or other international human rights organizations. Mali does
 not play a major role in international human rights forums,
 although this may change as a result of President Traore's
 tenure as OAU Chairman.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mali does not practice religious or ethnic discrimination, nor
 does it have the civil and racial strife evident in many other
 multiethnic countries. Virtually all of Mali's ethnic groups
 are represented at the highest state and party levels.
 Although some nomadic groups such as the Tuaregs are not
 completely integrated into the economic and political
 mainstream, Mali is relatively free of ethnic tensions.
 Social and cultural factors place men in the dominant position
 in Mali. However, women play an important economic role, both
 in market life and in farming. Custom tends to restrict women
 to "women's issues" when they participate in politics.. The
 Malian Women's Association focuses primarily on establishing
 cooperatives, improving health programs, fostering education,
 and campaigning against female circumcision, which is still
 widely practiced.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM), composed of 12
 unions, is Mali's only recognized workers' organization. The
 UNTM claims to maintain a degree of autonomy from the
 Government, and unlike the women's and youth associations, it
 is not officially a part of the UDPM. It has on occasion
 offered limited criticisms of certain government programs. It
 is, however, subject to considerable government influence and
 control, and the UNTM Secretary General is a party member,
 although not a member of the Central Executive Council (BEC)
 of the UDPM. The UNTM maintains contacts with international
 
 
 210
 MALI
 labor organizations, both public and private. The UNTM is
 affiliated with two international labor bodies: the
 Organization of West African Workers and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 Within limits, strikes have been permitted, but they rarely
 occur. Given Mali's high level of unemployment, most workers
 are reluctant to strike for long periods of time. Basically,
 any union planning to go on strike must notify the UNTM and
 get prior approval. In the case of the student strikes of
 1988, no approval was given, but the strikes still took place.
 In January teachers and students struck for approximately 1
 month over nonpayment of their salaries and scholarship
 stipends. News reports stated that 85 teachers of a branch of
 the National Education and Cultural Association who
 participated in the strike were later transferred, but
 government sources maintained that these were normal transfers
 and that some of the strikers had illegally infringed on the
 right of others to work.  Protests subsided for several
 weeks, but on March 2 students from the teachers' training
 college marched from their school to the Ministry of National
 Education to protest the transfer--which they believed was
 arbitrary--of one of their teachers. Some students were
 reportedly held for several hours by security forces, but were
 later released. The protests subsided after the Government
 made back payments of salaries. In November the ILO's
 Committee on Freedom of Association concluded that the
 antiunion reprisals taken by the Government of Mali against
 the striking teachers, which were said to include transfers,
 dismissals, and arrests, constituted an infringement on their
 freedom of association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The limits to collective bargaining are arbitrary. The Malian
 Constitution specifically provides for the liberty of citizens
 to form organizations to protect their "professional
 interests," and there are no specific constraints by the
 Government or employers on workers attempting to organize. In
 practice, Mali's unitary party system has effectively
 inhibited the development of independent, politically oriented
 labor unions. At present, there are no unions not affiliated
 with the UNTM.
 There are no export processing zones in Mali, and labor
 legislation is applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited. This prohibition is
 generally observed in practice. Duly convicted criminals may
 perform various jobs; at the prison at Kidal, they are paid
 for this work. There have been reports that a form of
 traditional slavery is still practiced in some isolated parts
 of the country.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, but with parents'
 permission children can be apprenticed at 12. In practice,
 children in rural areas join the family farming work force at
 a much younger age. As workers in the informal sector, they
 are not protected by laws against unjust compensation,
 excessive hours, and capricious discharge.
 
 
 211
 MALI
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Mali has a detailed labor code specifying conditions of
 employment, including hours, wages, and social security
 benefits. The minimum wage is approximately $42.50 per month,
 which could provide a "decent" standard of living, if it went
 to support only one person. However, many wage earners
 support extended families. Health and safety standards vary,
 depending upon the category of work, but there is. limited
 enforcement due to the lack of inspectors. Employers are
 required to pay into a national social security fund.
