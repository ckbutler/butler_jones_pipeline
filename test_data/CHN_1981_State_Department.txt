 CHINA
 In the five years since the death of Chairman Mao and the
 removal of the radical "Gang of Four' from power, China has
 become a more prosperous and open society. In the context of
 a traditionally authoritarian Chinese culture, and a Marxist-
 Leninist political structure, the Chinese leadership has
 devoted most of its attention in domestic affairs to economic
 modernization. Rural incomes reached record levels in 1981,
 and the increased material well-being of urban residents is
 readily observable. Cultural life has become steadily more
 lively, and features classical Chinese opera and other
 entertainment and art forms devoid of political content. In
 education, thousands of Chinese scholars and researchers have
 gone abroad and hundreds of foreign students and teachers now
 reside on Chinese university campuses. Foreign scholars
 visit China regularly, and present lectures that are
 sometimes at odds with official policies. China's
 universities and think tanks are exploring innovative
 approaches to economic and social problems. Political
 controls over scientists have lessened. Hundreds of
 churches, mosques and temples have opened their doors for the
 first time since the early sixties, and China has a seminary
 for the training of Christian clergymen. Radio broadcasts
 from overseas are listened to freely by Chinese citizens, and
 foreign periodicals are available to a limited extent in
 academic institutions. Movies and some television programs
 made abroad are also shown, although foreign exchange
 constraints severely limit their importation.
 At the same time, the political structure has continued to
 impose significant limitations on individual rights and
 freedoms. The regime does not tolerate fundamental criticism
 of the Communist Party, and has dealt strictly with those
 putting forward such criticism. Artists and writers need not
 always praise *socialism," but they must be cautious in
 criticizing society's flaws so as not to suggest that social
 problems are a by-product of "socialism" or party leader-
 ship. While Chinese and foreigners continue to enjoy more
 freedom of contact than they have in years, these contacts
 are subject to monitoring by an extensive security network.
 Despite increasing religious freedom, believers must exercise
 restraint in their contacts with foreign religious organiza-
 tions. Foreign newspapers and periodicals are not available
 to most Chinese citizens, although tens of millions of
 Chinese see extensive though occasionally edited translations
 from the foreign press in publications such as *Reference
 News," a restricted-circulation daily which is sent to ten
 million subscribers, but is seen as well by family members,
 co-workers and friends of these subscribers.
 China made moderate progress in 1981 in developing mechanisms
 ultimately intended to give individuals more of a voice in
 local affairs, particularly in the rural areas where economic
 decision-making is being transferred downward to small
 agricultural production groups and, in some areas, to
 individual families. In 1980 and 1981, over four hundred
 million voters participated in elections for county-level
 assemblies. For the first time in the history of the
 People's Republic of China, there were more candidates than
 positions to be filled. About thirty percent of the victors
 
 (M0)
 
 
 566
 were non-party members, according to a Chinese government
 report. The election campaigns were generally bland,
 however, and selection of candidates strongly influenced by
 the Communist Party, whose representatives sat prominently on
 local nominating committees. In the handful of cases where
 candidates actively espoused non-Marxist views, party
 authorities objected, but interfered in the election process
 only in some instances.
 Worker's congresses have now been formed in many of China's
 larger industrial enterprises. These representative bodies
 are intended to institute participatory democracy in the work
 place. In 1980, it-appeared that the congresses would play a
 major role in the day-to-day.running of enterprises, even to
 ..the point of electing-factory managers, and would not be
 under party authority. This prospect has been clouded,
 :however. According to provisional regulations published in
 July, 1981, the congresses are-to operate "under the
 %leadership of the party committees,* and their powers are to
 be primarily advisory.
 China made further progress during the year in re-
 establishing a legal system. Legal and judicial procedures
 .were effectively gutted during the Cultural Revolution
 (1966-76), and only in 1979 did the restructuring of the
 legal system begin. According to official figures, there are
 now-200,000 judicial workers in China, including 6,800
 lawyers, of whom 5,500 are full-time advocates. The number
 of law schools and law departments continues to grow, and
 -there has-been some exchange with Western legal scholars and
 judicial officials. By mid-1981, 1,300 legal advisors'
 offices had been established in urban areas in all parts of
 the country. Legislation is being drafted in areas such as
 civil procedure, contracts, commercial law, and patent and
 copyright law. In 1981i more land dispute-cases -- mostly in
 -rural areas -- than ever.before were brought before the
 'Judiciary. Previously such cases were-handled informally by
 party authorities.
 .China. has also revived,the institution of mediation
 committees, informal, nonjudicial groups which assist in
 -resolving civil and minor criminal matters. According to
 statistics released in August, 1981, these committees handled
 6,200,000 civil cases in 1980, ten times the number disposed
 of by the basic level courts. Committee workers, mostly
 !retired-persons, numbered 5,750,000, organized into 810,000
 committees.
 Despite these positivedevelopments, the year was also marked
 by an extensive and effective campaign against dissident
 organizations and: publications. All unofficial publications
 were ordered closed, and editors who ignored the directive
 -were -subject to arrest. In April, Xu Wenli, deputy editor of
 the unauthorized journal 'April Fifth Forum," was taken into
 custody in Beijing. Other dissident editors and activists
 were arrested in Guangzhou, Changsha, Taiyuan, Wuhan, and
 *other cities. Although reliable information is sparse, the
 -best estimate is that-over the past year perhaps fifty
 dissidents were detained, some of whom were sentenced without
 trial to terms in labor camps, pursuant to "labor education"
 regulations. The drive-against unauthorized publications,
 combined with last year's ban on wall posters, has further
 dried up important sources of information about human rights
 .conditions in China and eliminated outlets for political
 -expression. In September, 1981, excerpts from a manuscript
 allegedly-written by dissident Liu Qing were published in the
 foreign press, allegedly providing material on human rights
 violations, including physical mistreatment, in a Chinese
 detention center in 1979-80.
 
 
 567
 Chinese authorities also tightened controls on professional
 writers and artists in 1981. Official commentaries in the
 party and army newspapers criticized People's Liberation Army
 writer Bai Hua for his negative and pessimistic view of
 modern day China. Top leaders attacked 'unhealthy
 tendencies' among some writers, and suggested that authors
 engage in self-criticism. The current tightening up against
 professional writers and artists has been quite mild in
 comparison with the campaigns against professional writers
 and artists in the nineteen fifties and during the Cultural
 Revolution, and it is evident that the leadership is divided
 on how far to press the issue, with those favoring moderation
 clearly in the majority. In marked contrast to the treatment
 of unofficial journal editors, no professional, established
 writers have been arrested, sent to labor camps or otherwise
 subjected to harsh treatment.  Official commentaries have
 created a chill in the literary atmosphere; nevertheless,
 Chinese writers and artists are producing and publishing
 works in a quantity not seen in China for over two decades,
 1. Respect For The Integrity Of The Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 Article 32 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Article 136 of
 the Criminal Code prohibit the-use of torture or duress in
 acquiring evidence. Wall posters and other sources in 1979
 and 1980 alleged that torture by electrical means continued
 to be practiced in some prisons and labor camps. A 1980
 public report of the Supreme People's Procuratorate
 acknowledged that cases of torture and illegal detention
 continue to occur, and said that the government prosecuted
 over 10,000 cases of violations of citizens rights, including
 torture, in 1979 and 1980. There have been no new
 allegations of torture in 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Chinese authorities launched an anti-crime drive in 1981,
 emphasizing the need for prompt and severe punishment for
 those convicted of serious crimes. Authorities held numerous
 mass sentencing rallies, sometimes attended by many thousands
 of spectators. The accused persons, who had been sentenced
 to death after trials, were sometimes escorted by solemn
 motorcade through city streets to the rally. At the site,
 the defendents would be publicly denounced and their death
 sentences disclosed. They would then be led out of the rally
 and executed forthwith. Traditionally, Chinese justice has
 placed emphasis on deterrence of crime through the use of
 public airing of the details of crimes, and of the punishment
 of criminals.
 Dissident Liu Qing was detained in 1979 for several months,
 and then sentenced to three years of *labor education,*
 according to a document published in the foreign press and
 alleged to be Liu's own manuscript. In the selections from
 the document, as reported abroad, Liu claimed to have
 received and witnessed physical abuse while in detention,
 although he did not claim he was physically abused to extract
 information or a confession. Although labor education is
 supposedly a non-penal sanction, Liu stated that he was
 detained in a prison farm, featuring high walls, electrified
 wire, and guard dogs. His primary transgression was the
 publication of the transcript of the October 1979 trial of
 dissident Wei Jingsheng, an affair labelled a 'public trial"
 by Chinese authorities, but closed to foreigners on the
 ground that Wei's alleged criminal acts involved national
 security information. The Chinese authorities denounced the
 Liu manuscript as a fake, and delivered warnings to foreign
 reporters in Beijing who had reported its substance.

 China has embarked on an extensive family planning program
 aimed at limiting family size to one or, at most, two
 children. The program, which consists of propaganda, peer
 pressure and economic rewards and disincentives, has had
 mixed results. There have been several reports that families
 in some localities occasionally have left their places of
 residence to escape social pressure and economic
 disincentives associated with the family planning program,
 thereby losing their established jobs and residences.
 According to a journalistic account, some local authorities
 in Guangdong province have committed abuses in their zeal to
 reduce the population growth rate. The accounts alleged
 cases of forced abortions, detention, and psychological
 pressure to induce agreement for abortions, but also
 indicated that this was contrary to central government policy
 and regulations.
 Information about conditions in penal institutions is
 sparse. In a Beijing prison visited on occasion by
 foreigners, inmates live and work under crowded but sanitary
 conditions. A prison official claimed that physical abuse of
 prisoners was not tolerated. This very likely reflects
 official party policy, but in practice treatment in penal
 labor camps probably varies widely. Beatings reportedly
 occur in some camps, but not in others; letters and family
 visits are sometimes permitted and at other times not.
 Inability to find work on the outside leads many inmates to
 remain in the camps as contract workers at low wages after
 release. Regulations passed in 1981 allowing authorities to
 cancel urban residency permits for recidivists and escapees
 may increase the number of 'contract' labor camp workers.
 c. Disappearances
 The whereabouts of dissidents arrested at Beijing's former
 Democracy Wall and other places in 1979 and 1980 is
 uncertain, as is the disposition of those detained in 1981.
 Based on unofficial reports, it appears likely that many of
 these persons were sentenced under the labor education
 regulations to labor camps. On the positive side, much
 larger numbers of people, running into the hundreds of
 thousands, who were incarcerated as political prisoners
 during the Cultural Revolution and earlier periods, have
 apparently been released in recent years. While the thrust
 of China's policy has been to rehabilitate former political
 prisoners, it is not clear whether other political prisoners
 detained during these earlier periods have yet been released.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Chinese law allows a detained person or his family to obtain
 his release if public security officials do not follow proper
 arrest procedures, but, in practice, this proviso apparently
 is seldom used. A prisoner can be detained for up to two
 months before the prosecution makes a public charge against
 him, although this period can be extended with the approval
 of a higher prosecuting unit or the National People's
 Congress Standing Committee.
 Many minor offenses in China have been handled under a labor
 education regulation which empowers the public security
 officials, in consultation with representatives of local
 civil affairs and labor bureaus, to sentence miscreants to up
 to four years of labor without trial. This regulation has
 been used by local authorities with increasing frequency
 against political dissidents. There is no recognized appeal
 procedure.
 
 
 569
 China continues to maintain a system of penal labor camps,
 primarily for common criminals. It appears that the total
 number of political prisoners in these institutions has
 diminished considerably in recent years, due both to natural
 attrition and to the reversal of verdicts in hundreds of
 thousands of cases. Of the many thousands of prisoners in
 labor camps (some estimates range upwards of 100,000), the
 number of political prisoners cannot be gauged.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the constitution and the criminal procedure code
 stipulate that a defendant has the right to defend himself at
 trial, or to appoint an attorney or other representative.
 Although a defendant's attorney has the right to meet with
 him in custody, in practice this does not occur until after
 the pre-trial interrogations have been completed and the
 defendant has been indicted. All attorneys in China who
 practice before the courts are employees of state-supported
 legal advisors' offices.
 Decisions on guilt or innocence appear to be made during the
 pre-trial investigation, and the trials become the equivalent
 of sentencing hearings, with the role of defense attorney
 limited to pleading for clemency or arguing that there were
 extenuating circumstances that mitigate the offense. There
 have been no public reports of a defendant being found
 innocent after trial, but there have been reports of
 sentences reduced on appeal.
 Chinese press articles in 1981 criticized some Communist
 Party officials for interfering in judicial cases. It is
 highly likely that verdicts in all political cases are
 reviewed in advance by party authorities.
 The criminal procedure code stipulates that all trials should
 be held in public, except those involving state secrets,
 personal secrets, and juveniles. In practice, attendance at
 public trials has required an admission ticket, obtained from
 organizations selected by the authorities.
 In the past there have been reports of special courts and
 hearings for political offenders, particularly Communist
 Party members. Party members apparently can be subjected to
 observation, detention and reform through labor under the
 rubric of party discipline, thereby circumventing entirely
 the judicial system.
 Under labor reform regulations reaffirmed in February 1980,
 those who commit "minor theft or fraud,* or who have been
 expelled from their work units for anti-social and in some
 cases 'counterrevolutionary* behavior may be sent by
 administrative (quasi-judicial) action to labor reform camps
 for periods of up to four years. Reportedly each city and
 province maintains its own camp or set of camps.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The criminal code requires the use of search and arrest
 warrants issued by a prosecutor or a court in most cases.
 There is no reliable information as to whether this proviso
 is carried out in practice. There have been some reports of
 the use of electronic eavesdropping in the residences of
 suspected political dissidents.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Assembly and Religion
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the press,
 but in practice fundamental, overt criticism of Communist
 Party rule and party ideology is not permitted. The campaign
 against underground journals succeeded in virtually eliminat-
 ing the publication of dissident views. Many of the
 authorized periodicals and newspapers are published by the
 party itself, and others, as well as radio and television
 broadcasts, are under tight party control. At the same time,
 in recent years, there has been increasingly broad toleration
 of criticisms voiced among friends and close acquaintances
 such as co-workers.
 In this context, criticism of abuses in the execution of
 policy by government and party officials -- usually low or
 middle ranking -- is permitted and practiced by many
 newspapers. Criticism of the actions of higher ranking
 officials occurs as well, but on a more restrained and
 limited basis. "Letters to the Editor* columns have become
 popular features, and frequently trigger investigations of
 alleged injustices. Although only a few are published, many
 newspapers receive over 1,000 letters per day and maintain
 large investigative staffs to act as ombudsmen in seeking
 corrective action from party and government authorities.
 Public practice of religion has increased significantly in
 the past three years. According to some estimates, there are
 more than four million Christians in China, and over a
 hundred churches are known to be open. There are over 13
 million Muslims, and perhaps as many as 2,000 mosques.
 Buddhist monasteries have resumed activities, and have
 ordained small groups of novice monks and nuns on several
 occasions since 1979. Christian ministers and priests say
 they are free to proselytize and conduct rites in private
 homes; generally, however, churchmen have been circumspect.
 A good deal of. property has been restored to churches. The
 cathedral in Shenyang, for example, supports itself by rents
 from one thousand apartments returned to its ownership.
 Chinese-Vatican relations continue to be strained, partly
 because of the Vatican's continuing recognition of the claim
 of the authorities in Taipei to be the government of China.
 Equally importantly, Chinese-Vatican relations remain
 strained over the schism between the officially recognized
 "Patriotic Catholic Church,* which does not recognize the
 Vatican's authority, and the *underground* Church, which
 remains loyal to the Vatican. Chinese authorities-objected
 strenuously to the appointment by the Vatican in 1981 of a
 Bishop of Guangzhou. Bishop Gong Pingmei, arrested in the
 nineteen fifties, apparently remains imprisoned in Shanghai.
 In November 1981 several priests and Catholic laymen were
 reportedly arrested in Shanghai on charges of maintaining
 ties with the Vatican.
 Problems faced by religious organizations in China include
 the continued occupation (dating from the Cultural Revolu-
 tion) of some religious property by military and other units,
 and the reluctance of some local officials to carry out the
 government's stated policy of relative tolerance.
 The constitution guarantees the rights of assembly and
 association, but in practice thepe rights are circumscribed.
 Although controls on Chinese contacts with foreigners have
 continued to be relatively relaxed, in keeping with the
 practice of the past five years, Chinese citizens whose work
 does not require or permit contact with foreigners may be
 warned or, in extreme cases, detained if they persist in
 meeting foreign acquaintances.
 
 
 Minority ethnic and religious groups in border areas such as
 Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Yunnan, as well as in
 ethnic autonomous enclaves, are permitted a degree of local
 political and social autonomy, official recognition of their
 languages and cultures, and preferential treatment in col-
 lege admission. Some ethnic minorities living in border
 autonomous regions and enclaves have been granted tax rates
 and economic subsidies more favorable than those accorded
 local Han Chinese residents. (Note. Han Chinese, who are in
 the minority in border autonomous regions and ethnic autono-
 mous enclaves, comprise 94 percent of the total Chinese
 population.)
 Since 1980, the party and government have more aggressively
 promoted the political and social advancement of minority
 persons in autonomous areas, and taken steps to discourage
 the migration of Han Chinese into ethnic minority areas.
 There have also been some reports, however, that the party
 and government more recently have slowed the turning over of
 administrative duties to ethnic and religious minorities.
 Reports of demonstrations against Han Chinese rule by
 minority ethnic and religious groups in some few places, as
 well as counter-actions by Han Chinese residents, continue to
 surface. For their part, local Han Chinese residents, many
 of whom were encouraged to emigrate into border autonomous
 regions by earlier government policies, sometimes express
 resentment over new policies which favor or appear to favor
 the local ethnic and religious groups. The Chinese
 government has tried, thus far unsuccessfully, to woo the
 Dalai Lama back from exile, in an attempt to placate Tibetan
 nationalist sentiment.
 The trade union structure is controlled by the Chinese
 Communist Party and is used primarily to channel party policy
 downward. Along with the party's other mass organizations,
 the All-China Federated Trade Union (ACFTU) was reconstituted
 at both the local and national level by late 1978. The ACFTU
 has about 50 million members of the 100 million in the
 industrial labor force. This figure does not include
 agricultural workers, civil servants or the growing numbers
 in the "private* and 'collective* sectors. Trade union
 leaders have stressed that their organization follows the
 leadership of the party and is the means through which the
 party *maintains ties* with the workers.
 The primary function of the trade union organization in the
 work-place is to foster labor discipline and greater
 productivity. The trade union organization does not act on
 behalf of the economic interest of the workers by negotiating
 wages or other benefits at the plant level with plant
 management. At the local level, the union performs a variety
 of welfare and social functions such as making small loans
 to workers in need, management of the health and insurance
 systems and intervention in work site health and environ-
 mental issues. Periodically, the government has encouraged
 the union's active participation in the protection of the
 welfare of the workers. The constitution guarantees the
 right to strike though there have been no reports reaching
 the US government of any strikes in recent years.
 The recently established workers' congresses also assist in
 representing workers' interests in welfare and other matters,
 including an advisory role in plant management. Wide
 publicity was given to the censuring of a factory manager who
 reportedly obstructed the functioning of the workers'
 congress in his enterprise.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Travel Abroad,
 Emigration and Repatriation
 In 1981, China continued its relatively relaxed controls over
 foreign travel and emigration. Out of fear of a brain drain,
 individuals with certain degrees or skills must have the
 
 
 572
 permission of their work unit to travel abroad, and some have
 been refused. Others have reportedly been refused permission
 on security grounds. But thousands of Chinese citizens are
 now traveling abroad to study, visit relatives or conduct
 business. Legal emigration also continues apace. To cite
 U.S. figures alone, about 8,000 immigrant visas were issued
 by the American Embassy and consulates general in China in
 fiscal year 1981, with approximately 70,000 more waiting for
 U.S. visa numbers.
 During the same period, more than 15,000 U.S. non-immigrant
 visas were issued, while several thousand applicants who had
 secured travel documents from Chinese authorities were found
 ineligible for U.S. non-immigrant visas. The number of
 illegal emigrants going from Guangdong province to Hong Kong
 has apparantly decreased, due to Hong Kong's stricter
 immigration controls, but a substantial number still make
 their way across the border. Those who are arrested trying
 to exit China illegally reportedly receive only a mild
 censure from the Chinese authorities.
 China has taken in over 260,000 refugees from Southeast Asia
 in the past few years, although the flow diminished somewhat
 in 1981. The government has reportedly spent over $450
 million on refugee care and settlement. Conditions in
 refugee camps vary, but in general are on a par with those of
 local Chinese residents. Those who have been able to secure
 refuge in other countries have been able to depart China
 without hindrance.
 Travel in China is subject to restrictions. Chinese citizens
 who wish to travel to another locale are required to obtain
 letters of introduction from their work units in order to
 secure public accommodations. They also need ration coupons,
 usually valid in only one province, to obtain certain
 commodities. These coupons may be obtained only if the
 traveler registers with the local public security office.
 Travelers who rely on relatives or friends for accommodations
 and food are also supposed to register. In practice, many
 Chinese citizens travel frequently, and some simply ignore
 bureaucratic requirements.
 Chinese are normally given work assignments by central or
 local authorities. There are many examples of spouses,
 particularly professional persons, who are obliged to live
 separately, sometimes for years, due to work assignments in
 different cities. There are also many instances in which
 Chinese ignore local regulations and. move to other areas in
 search of work.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Several other political parties nominally exist in the
 People's Republic of China, but the Communist Party dominates
 all important aspects of political, economic and social life
 and decision-making, particularly in urban areas. Within
 this constraint, however, there is some degree of political,
 economic and social autonomy in rural areas and ethnic and
 religious minority areas, though this autonomy does not
 extend to party politics. The urban-based non-Communist
 parties are maintained with the ruling group's blessing, and
 articulate the viewpoints of interest groups such as
 intellectuals. They often are utilized as propaganda organs
 to rally support for government policies. These parties
 continue to recruit new members on a limited scale.
 The eight non-Communist parties form part of the membership
 of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
 (CPPCC), a loose coalition whose members also include
 independent intellectuals, writers and artists, national
 
 
 573
 minority group and religious representatives, and overseas
 Chinese. Although the CPPCC receives guidance from the
 Communist Party and is not a policy-making body, it can make
 policy recommendations, and its annual meetings have recently
 been fora for the discussion of national issues.
 The local assembly elections carried out in 1980 and 1981
 provided the first opportunity in many years for Chinese
 citizens to elect local representatives directly, and over
 400 million persons reportedly participated. Chinese
 citizens over the age of 18, except persons incarcerated for
 criminal offenses and those held mentally incapable, were
 enfranchised. Voters chose delegates to county-level
 assemblies from candidate lists which comprised 1.5 to 2
 times the number of representatives to be elected. The
 candidates in these local elections were chosen, on the basis
 of the nomination of three or more persons, by local election
 committees compromising representatives of the Communist
 Party and party-controlled mass organizations, the government
 and united front and independent personages. Despite the
 closely controlled candidate selection process, there were
 several reports of hotly contested elections, including a
 handful involving awowedly non-Marxist candidates. In cases
 where candidates actively espoused non-Marxist views, party
 authorities objected, but interfered in the election process
 only in some instances. About thirty percent of the victors
 were non-party members, according to a government report.
 Once elected, local assemblies elected local governments,
 generally from slates containing more candidates than
 positions to be filled, as stipulated in the election law
 passed in 1979.
 Under the system of 'democratic centralism,* the 39 million
 members of the Communist Party elect grass roots committees
 which in turn elect representatives to higher party organs,
 culminating in the Party Congress, the Central. Commmitee, and
 the Political Bureau. The party is experimenting with
 multi-candidate elections to party organs at various levels,
 and has already carried out some multi-candidate elections to
 higher party organs, including the important Party Secre-
 tariat. However, given the party's system of indirect
 election to party posts above the grass roots level, higher
 party officials generally exercise a decisive influence in
 the selection and election of officials at lower levels.
 Men continue to dominate the senior Chinese leadership
 positions. A December, 1980, Chinese press report lamented
 that the percentage of women admitted to the party and
 participating in government and political affairs was very
 low. According to official statistics, however, about 20
 percent of the deputies elected to local assemblies in
 1980-1981 were women, as were 15 percent of the local
 government officials elected by these assemblies.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Chinese officials have not responded to requests by Amnesty
 International and other non-governmental organizations for
 meetings and information regarding alleged human rights
 violations. There are. no known organizations in the People's
 Republic of China reporting on human rights violations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 China faces massive problems in meeting the basic human needs
 for one billion people. The government has succeeded in
 providing basic nutrition, health care, and education. The
 average life expectancy of 68 (in 1980) is high for a country
 that ranks in the bottom half of developing countries in per
 capita income.
 
 
 574
 The growth of free markets in the past three years has
 increased the quantity and variety of foods available to
 consumers while boosting the incomes of rural producers.
 Although some key items, such as grain and cooking oil, are
 rationed, most Chinese have a simple but adequate diet.
 Flooding in Hubei province and drought conditions in Hebei
 province resulted early in 1981 in an appeal for relief
 assistance through international organizations, but the
 Chinese have dealt with these disasters essentially on their
 own.
 Chinese education policy aims for universal education through
 the high school level in urban areas, and a grade school
 education in rural locations. Overall, about 60 percent of
 eligible students complete primary school, and 30 percent
 complete high school. About five percent of China's high
 school graduates receive university training. Overall, China
 now has about 210 million students, including one million in
 universities. Adult literacy was reported to be 66% in 1976.
 Basic health care is available at no or modest cost to
 Chinese citizens. Urban standards of health care are
 significantly better than those in rural areas as reflected
 in the different infant mortality rates -- 12 per 1,000 in
 the cities and 20-30 per 1,000 in the countryside. China has
 a total of about 2 million hospital beds, and 1.17 doctors
 per thousand persons. The government strongly encourages
 single-child and two-child families, and through use of
 social pressure and economic incentives and disincentives,
 succeeded in reducing the population growth rate from 2.0 per
 thousand in 1970 to 1.2 in 1979.
 Housing is crowded in urban areas. The government has
 embarked on a large-scale construction program in an attempt
 to cope with this problem. In the past two years, China has
 built 1.5 billion square meters of urban housing, enough for
 fifty square meters for each of three million families. This
 amounts to nearly one quarter of all urban housing built
 since 1949.
 Cash incomes in both urban and rural areas increased by 25
 percent in 1980, according to official figures. Real
 economic growth for 1980 was estimated to be seven percent,
 but will probably drop in 1981.to 3 or 4 percent. Official
 price data show inflation running at a rate of 6 to 8 percent.
 The increase in Chinese per capita GNP from U.S. $437 in 1977
 (U.S. government estimate) to U.S. $538 in 1980 has been
 accompanied by an increase in the supply of consumer goods,
 reflecting the government's emphasis on the development of
 light industry. (Note: U.S. Government estimates of Chinese
 per capita GNP, which reflects the value of services and the
 real value in purchasing power of the Chinese yuan in U.S.
 dollars, is substantially higher than official Chinese
 statistics which are computed at the official exchange
 rate.) China's new economic development strategy, which
 emphasizes rapid improvement in the living standards of the
 Chinese people, represents a fundamental shift away from
 China's earlier reliance on the Soviet model, which stressed
 large expenditures for the rapid growth of the heavy industry
 and capital goods sectors and military expenditures.
 China has a labor force of about 560 million, of which 15-20
 percent reside in urban areas. There are no reliable
 estimates of unemployment in rural areas. For cities,
 unemployment estimates range from 4 million persons to 10
 million persons. During 1980 and 1981, the government made
 significant progress in increasing employment opportunities
 by encouraging individual, family-run and small-scale
 collectively operated private enterprises, mostly in the
 service sector. According to official figures, 1,260,000
 people were self-employed in March, 1981, the majority of
 them in urban areas. Labor service companies set up in many
 areas provided loans and other assistance to young people who
 wish to set up their own enterprises. These programs
 supplement the government's regular program of assigning jobs
 to all college and technical school graduates.
