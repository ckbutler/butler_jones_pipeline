 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional, democratic republic with a
 parliamentary government elected by universal suffrage.
 The President serves as chief of state, but direction of
 the executive is exercised by the Cabinet under the leader-
 ship of the Prime Minister. Two parties occupy the sixty-
 five seats in the unicameral parliament. The judiciary
 is independent. Malta is a member of the British Common-
 wealth.
 In terms of racial composition and religious affiliation
 the Maltese population is generally homogeneous, with an
 established tradition of respect for legal norms. Reflect-
 ing this tradition, chapter four of the Maltese constitu-
 tion states the general principle that every person in
 Malta is entitled to fundamental individual rights and
 freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political
 opinion, color, creed or sex.
 The potential threat to these generally observed high
 standards exists primarily in Malta's intensely partisan
 political disputes. In a particularly serious October
 1979 outbreak, government supporters severely damaged
 several opposition party clubs, the facilities of the
 leading independent newspaper, and the home of the leader
 of the opposition. There was no recurrence in 1980.
 The constitution guarantees social rights in principle
 and in practice, and government policies help insure ful-
 fillment of economic rights.
 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Section 37 of the Maltese constitution prohibits inhumane
 or degrading punishment. Torture is not practiced by
 the government of Malta.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from inhuman or degrading punishment is provided
 for by Section 37 of the constitution and respected in
 practice. The approximately 100 persons who make up
 Malta's total prison population are provided with ade-
 quate living space, food, health care and recreational
 opportunities on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 c. Disappearances
 Abduction or secret arrest is not practiced by the
 government of Malta.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided
 for in Section 35 of the constitution and respected in
 practice, although the constitutional requirement that a
 detainee be brought before a court within 48 hours is
 sometimes circumvented by rearresting prisoners imme-
 diately after release. There are no political prisoners.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial before an impartial court is provided
 for in Section 40 of the constitution and is respected
 in practice. The judiciary is independent. There is an
 Appeals Court. Malta's system of military justice was
 taken over intact from the British forces. Only military
 personnel are subject to this system, and there are pro-
 visions for appeal to civilian courts. In the military
 courts' brief history there has never been a court-martial
 judgment rendered.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Protection for privacy of the home is provided for by
 Section 39 of the constitution and is respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The constitution declares that availability to citizens
 of the highest grades of education and social welfare are
 fundamental aims of government. Both government and
 opposition are committed to pursuit of these aims and
 to support of the basic economic rights to own property,
 to work with just conditions and remuneration, to a
 standard of living adequate for health and wellbeing, and
 to universal education. In 1980 the government continued
 and extended social benefit programs, which include old
 age pensions equal to two-thirds of working salary,
 maternity and marriage benefits, and low-cost housing.
 Maltese public education is free, nondiscriminatory and
 extensive in relation to Malta's limited resources. The
 literacy rate is over 80 percent, and education is compul-
 sory to age 16. Over the last few years the government has
 instituted a compulsory work-study regimen for all univer-
 sity and upper secondary school students.. Arts and
 science degree programs have been eliminated.
 Traditionally, general standards of health care in Malta
 are relatively high. Infant mortality is about 1.5
 percent; life expectancy is 69.4 years for men and 73.4
 years for women. Government programs in health care have
 concentrated on providing inexpensive health services to
 the largest possible segment of the population, but a pro-
 longed labor dispute between the government and the Medical
 Association has led to the departure from Malta of many
 local doctors. They have been replaced by foreign physi-
 cians on contract to the government.
 Assisted by substantial external financial assistance,
 the Maltese economy has completed its long transition
 from economic dependency on the provision of services for
 foreign military forces to reliance on export manufacturing,
 tourism and other service industries. In 1979 gross
 national product (GNP) rose to about $979 million, up
 15 percent over 1978, and the rate of inflation was
 about 7.5 percent. With a population growth rate of
 only 1.2 percent, per capita GNP rose to over $3,000
 and the minimum wage to about $70 per week. Unemployment
 is low. Growth continued to be strong in 1980, but the
 rate of inflation increased substantially to a projected
 16 percent.

 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 under-represented in the professions and management. There
 are some limitations on women's property rights within
 marriage which derive from traditional Maltese social
 values and traditional notions of women's property rights.
 There are also some limitations on public sector employ-
 ment of married women, but strong private sector demand
 for female labor has ensured a very low level of
 unemployment among women, who constitute about 27 percent
 of the labor force. Public economic and social services
 are extended on a non-discriminatory basis.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution and
 respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution and
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is a high degree of participation in Malta's demo-
 cratic political system. Voting is not compulsory, but
 approximately 95 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot
 during the 1976 parliamentary elections.
 Women take an active part in Malta's political life. There
 are three women parliamentarians out of 65 members of
 the House of Representatives, one of whom is the Minister
 of Labor, Culture and Welfare. Both the Malta Labor
 Party and the Nationalist Party have active women's organi-
 zations, which are playing an increasingly prominent
 political role.
 There is an active trade union movement representing
 approximately one-third of the labor force. Approximately
 70 percent of trade union members belong to the General
 Workers Union, which is formally integrated with the
 governing Malta Labor Party. Most of the remaining unions
 are affiliated with the Independent Confederation of Trade
 Unions (CMTU).
 Responding to recent complaints by a CMTU member union of
 anti-CMTU discrimination by the government, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization Committee on Freedom of
 Association noted the absence of evidence supporting
 the allegation but warned generally of the danger of
 government favoritism for one union to the disadvantage
 of others.
 4. Government Attitude and Pecord Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Ii~vestigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 No requests are known to have been made for outside in-
 vestigation of the human rights situation in Malta.
