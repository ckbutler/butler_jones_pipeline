 VANUATU
 Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) became independent on
 July 30, 1980. Following independence, a short-lived
 rebellion on two islands was put down by the national
 government with the help of Papua New Guinea troops.
 Vanuatu has a population of approximately 114,000 who live
 on a double chain of 80 islands. For almost 75 years the
 islands were governed under a condominium administration
 by the British and French. As a result the colony, already
 fragmented by tribal and indigenous language differences,
 was officially divided by language, religion and culture.
 Thus the new government, in addition to facing the whole
 range of problems of a small developing country, has the
 major task of establishing a sense of national identity.
 The Republic of Vanuatu has three official languages:
 Bislama (Pidgin), English and French. The constitution is
 democratic and protects human rights. The head of state,
 the president of the Republic of Vanuatu, is elected by an
 electoral college consisting of members of parliament and
 the presidents of the regional councils (local governments).
 The duties of the presidents are primarily ceremonial. The
 parliament, a single chamber legislature, is elected by
 universal franchise under a proportionally representative
 electoral system. Executive power is vested in the prime
 minister who is elected by a majority of parliament, and
 appoints his cabinet (i.e. the council of ministers).
 There are also constitutional provisions for institutions
 to protect customary law and tradition. Under the Vanuatu
 constitution, a national council of chiefs advises the
 parliament and is charged with the promotion of Vanuatu
 culture and language. The constitution also provides for
 an independent judiciary. The chief justice of the supreme
 court is appointed by the president of the republic in
 consultation with the prime minister and leader of the
 opposition. The other three supreme court judges are
 nominated by the speaker of parliament, the national
 council of chiefs and the presidents of the regional
 councils. In addition there are island and village courts.
 The constitution also provides for a national ombudsman.
 The president, upon the advice of the council of ministers,
 can declare a state of emergency. However, there are
 strict restrictions on the duration of the state of
 emergency. Parliament cannot be dissolved during an
 emergency and the parliament (by an absolute majority)
 can terminate a state of emergency at any time. There are
 constitutional provisions limiting the government's powers
 during a state of emergency (e.g., inhuman treatment and
 forced labor are prohibited and the right to life is
 protected). Detention of a person (except enemy aliens)
 for more than one month without trial is also prohibited.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There were charges of police brutality during the rebellion
 following independence. However, to date, no evidence has
 come to-light of officially-condoned systematic violations
 of human rights.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As mentioned above, during the armed rebellion there were
 allegations of cruel and inhumane or degrading treatment.
 It has been reported thnt such incidents were the result of

 settling old scores among conflicting groups in Vanuatu
 rather than of the official policy of the national government.
 The national government has publicly condemned the alleged
 brutality and has promised to investigate the charges.
 There were no reports of summary executions in Vanuatu during
 the rebellion. Prison conditions at the time were bad because
 of overcrowding, but have improved since then as many of the
 prisoners have been released.
 c. Disappearances
 In Vanuatu there have been neither reports of disappearances
 nor any reports of people being abducted, secretly arrested
 or clandestinely detained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There were charges that arbitrary actions were taken during
 the rebellion, especially against French settlers and
 their supporters. Fearing a wave of anti-French discrimina-
 tion or, in some cases, retaliation against those Frenchmen
 who supported the pro-French rebel cause, thousands of
 French settlers fled to New Caledonia. Many of these
 settlers have since been banned from re-entering Vanuatu
 as prohibited immigrants.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides for a fair public trial including,
 inter alia, presumption of innocence until proven guilty,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right of appeal
 to the supreme court. The trials of those accused of
 participating in or abetting the rebellion in 1980 were
 carried out in accordance with the constitution. The courts
 are independent of military or executive control and the
 national ombudsman has the power to investigate complaints
 against the government.
 f.. Invasion of the Home
 Protection of the privacy of the home is provided for in
 the constitution. It is very likely, however, that during
 the rebellion these provisions were not always observed.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed by the constitution and respected
 by the government. However, the government, under the
 emergency provisions of the constitution, can restrict
 these rights for a limited period of time. There are a
 number of small newspapers and newsletters published by
 political and church groups but the government publishes
 the only major national newspaper. There is no commercial
 radio or TV and the government runs the national radio
 station. Vanuatu has a small but active trade union move-
 ment, recognized by the government, with the right to
 organize, strike, and bargain collectively.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel abroad; passport
 fees are not excessive. There are no refugees in Vanuatu.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens of Vanuatu are free to participate in the
 political process. The existence of a vocal opposition
 in parliament is evidence of the openness of the political
 system. Under the constitution, sovereignty rests with
 the people and the franchise is universal, equal and secret.
 Every citizen of Vanuatu who is at least 18 years old is
 entitled to vote. At independence residents had the
 opportunity to opt for Vanuatu citizenship and any person
 born since independence who has at least one parent who is
 a citizen of Vanuatu is entitled to citizenship. There are
 also provisions for naturalization after ten years of
 residence.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Vanuatu Government has publicly expressed willingness
 to permit investigation from qualified and objective
 outsiders.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Vanuatu is a middle income country with a per capita income
 of $525 per annum. As the majority of indigenous people
 live on the subsistence economy, per capita figures do not
 give an accurate picture of the quality of life in Vanuatu.
 As in all the Pacific Island countries, there exist great
 differences in wealth (i.e., money income) between the urban
 population, who live for the most part on the money economy,
 and the rural population, most of whom live on the sub-
 sistence economy. Following independence and the rebellion,
 there was considerable economic dislocation caused by the
 exodus of many French settlers who were heavily engaged
 in the commercial and plantation life of the New Hebrides.
 This was particularly the case on Espiritu Santo (the
 battleground in the armed rebellion), which was once a busy
 French commercial and economic center. Trade with France
 and other traditional trading partners was disrupted and
 the economy suffered; and even before independence the New
 Hebrides had had a negative balance of trade. To make
 matters more difficult, the new government inherited an
 over-large public service as a result of the condominium
 administration which, prior to independence, consisted of
 three separate public services: French, British and local.
 Government efforts to rationalize this situation have met
 with considerable resistence from the civil servants, who
 went out on a brief strike in protest. Before independence,
 Vanuatu was almost wholly dependent on the United Kingdom
 and France for external aid. French financial assistance
 has declined considerably in the post-colonial period, so
 even though British aid has remained significant there has
 been a large reduction in total external financial assistance.
 Other countries and multilateral aid donors have begun to
 increase their aid in the post-independence period (e.g.,
 Australia, New Zealand, UNDP, and the European community).
 The United States has a modest aid program in Vanuatu and
 has offered to establish a small Peace Corps program there
 in FY-82.
 The level of health and nutrition in Vanuatu compares
 favorably with other countries in the South Pacific.
 However, the health system inherited from the British
 and French is likely to be too expensive for the
 government of Vanuatu to maintain at pre-independence
 701
 levels. It is possible, however, that with foreign aid the
 government will be able to provide a basic level of health
 services.
 One of the most difficult problems facing the Vanuatu
 government is the integration of the British and French
 school systems into a single education system. An inter-
 national team of educators is presently preparing recommenda-
 tions for the Vila government. In the meantime a considerable
 proportion of the French aid will be earmarked for French
 language schools. Like most developing countries in the
 Pacific, Vanuatu is faced with a lack of trained personnel.
 The government is attacking this problem by the use of
 expatriates in key positions while students go abroad for
 advanced studies. Vanuatu students study in France, the
 United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, at the University
 of the South Pacific in Fiji, and at the University of Papua
 New Guinea. It is likely to be some time before Vanuatu
 will be self-sufficient in trained personnel.
 The government of Vanuatu is pledged to improving the
 economic lot of the Vanuatu people. Although per capita
 income is low, the quality of life has been accurately
 described by one economist as "affluent subsistence". Under
 the constitution, "all land in the republic belongs to the
 indigenous-custom owners and their descendants". This
 reversion of all land to the indigenous people is likely to
 have sweeping economic consequences. It throws into doubt
 the continuation of the plantation system (mostly French)
 which was the backbone of the New Hebrides agricultural
 economy. The government has yet to come to grips with the
 question of compensation to the pre-independence, non-
 indigenous land owners, which is also provided for in the
 constitution. Many large plantations fell into neglect
 when the French owners fled the country. To remedy this
 situation the government has begun training local people
 in plantation management. The Vanuatu government is
 supporting development programs to enable these fertile
 islands to produce once again agricultural products for
 export (coffee, beef, copra and cocoa).
