 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique is a one-party state in which effective power is
 concentrated in the hands of President Joaquim Chissano and
 top officials of the party, the Front for the Liberation of
 Mozambique, or FRELIMO. The Constitution gives the President
 extensive powers to appoint and dismiss top officials in the
 ministries, courts, military and security organizations, and
 provincial governments.
 Since the late 1970's, the FRELIMO Government has been under
 attack from an insurgent group, the Mozambican National
 Resistance, or RENAMO. Despite agreements between Mozambique
 and South Africa in 1984 and 1989, and the revival of a joint
 Mozambican-South African security commission aimed at
 investigating and ending-support to RENAMO, most Mozambican
 policymakers believe aid from South African and other foreign
 groups continues.
 The security forces include the armed forces of Mozambique
 (FPLM), numbering about 60,000 soldiers, a people's militia,
 and the Mozambican National Security Service (SNASP). For its
 part, RENAMO claims to have 25,000 men under arms and an
 additional 3,000 trainees. More than 7,000 Zimbabwean troops
 are assisting government forces, primarily in central
 Mozambique, with the objective of keeping the Harare-Beira
 railroad open. Approximately 700 to 800 Malawian troops are
 assisting in keeping the Nacala rail line open.
 Mozambique has a mixed economy, consisting of state-owned
 enterprises, cooperatives, and private enterprises. Up to 85
 percent of the population, however, is employed in small
 scale, semisubsistence agriculture. Once a self-proclaimed
 Marxist-Leninist party, the FRELIMO Fifth Party Congress in
 July removed the reference to Marxism and endorsed the
 2-year-old economic reform plan which has fostered currency
 devaluations, budgetary cuts, and reductions in the areas of
 the economy reserved exclusively for state enterprises. While
 growth in 1989 was projected at 4 percent, the continuing
 civil conflict-has undercut many of the benefits of the
 reforms. RENAMO deliberately attacks economic targets; in
 some areas, the prevailing anarchy has led to the total
 breakdown of internal trade. A combination of war and
 unfavorable weather has disrupted food production to the point
 that a third of the nation's population is thought to be
 dependent on international food aid.
 Human rights were tightly circumscribed in 1989. Major human
 rights concerns were harsh prison conditions; the use of
 arbitrary, incommunicado detention, especially by SNASP; the
 denial of fair trials; restrictions on freedoms of press,
 assembly, and association, and the right of citizens to change
 their government; and serious limitations on worker rights.
 However, it became more possible during the year for people to
 voice their views, including in people's assemblies and public
 meetings. The Government and party, especially at the Fifth
 Party Congress in July, continued to address some of the
 abuses, reorganizing the legal system to reduce SNASP and
 military dominanace of the judiciary. A new constitution
 which included a bill of rights was discussed in party forums
 at the end of the year and proposed to the public on January
 9, 1990. Publication and ratification are expected in 1990.
 The most blatant abuses of basic human rights occurred as a
 direct result of the conflict. Widespread reports of
 massacres directed against civilians, kidnapings, torture, and
 
 
 236
 MOZAIIOUE
 looting continued throughout the year. Most of these
 atrocities were attributed to RENAMO, but some were also
 attributed to government forces. Seeking an end to the civil
 war, which has cost 600,000 lives, the Government launched a
 peace initiative in January, using Mozambican religious
 leaders and Kenyan and Zimbabwean mediators to explore
 contacts. Despite these efforts, at the end of 1989 fighting
 had intensified. An estimated 2 million people were
 displaced, half of them living in refugee camps in neighboring
 countries, the remainder living in *accommodation centers"
 throughout the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Both sides were again responsible for the deaths of civilians
 in the course of their conflict (see Section l.g.). Most of
 the killings are attributed to RENAMO forces. Deplorable
 prison conditions resulted in some deaths (see Section l.c.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-perpetrated disappearances
 in 1989. However, there are thousands missing due to the
 conflict, including as a result of kidnapings in areas
 affected by the war. RENAMO, in particular, regularly holds
 civilians against their will, often employing them as porters
 or forcibly impressing them.
 Amnesty International (AI), in a special 1989 report,
 expressed its concern about several disappearance cases,
 including those of Uria Simangi and Joana Simeno, and sought,
 without success, information from the Government on the
 whereabouts of a number of political opponents of the
 Government who disappeared from detention in the mid-1970's.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both government and RENAMO forces have been accused of
 torturing prisoners and civilians. Journalist William
 Finnegan described one 1989 incident in which FPLM soldiers
 severely beat a farmer they suspected of collitborating with
 RENAMO. RENAMO's systematic practice of beatfIg or mutilating
 civilians continued unabated in 1989. According to many
 reports, RENAMO has cut off lips, ears, breasts, and limbs,
 burned or buried people alive, and forced family members to
 witness or participate in the tortures of their relatives.
 Former RENAMO soldiers claimed that threats of beating and
 torture were used to keep forced recruits from escaping.
 In September the National People's Assembly repealed, for both
 military and civilian courts, Mozambique's controversial
 "flogging law" which allowed people convicted of certain
 offenses to be punished by whipping. In practice, very few
 courts have imposed the flogging penalty, although military
 courts sentenced two soldiers to flogging in the final weeks
 before the law was repealed. In February charges were brought
 against an agent of the popular police in Maputo, because he
 had ordered two women flogged withQut due process.
 
 
 237
 MOZA14BIOUR
 Prison conditions in Mozambique remain life threatening. In
 June the local press reported that 15 prisoners had starved to
 death in a prison in Manica Province. Prison officials failed
 to purchase adequate food. The officials said severe budget
 cuts and inflation had deprived them of sufficient resources.
 In the aftermath of the scandal, provincial althorites
 launched an investigation of prison conditions and increased
 the prison budget.*
 Since 1988 the Government has allowed the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to the prisons where
 national security-prisoners, both those already convicted and
 those awaiting trial, are held. RENAMO does not permit ICRC
 access to areas under its control, claiming that it holds no
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest', Detention, or Exile
 The law requires that in most cases detainees be charged or
 released within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most
 serious crimes can be'aetained for up to 84 days without being
 formally charged or investigated. With court approval, such
 detainees can then be held for two additional periods of 84
 days while the police complete their investigation. While
 detained, persons have the constitutional right to counsel and
 to contact relatives and friends. In some cases, detainees
 may be released from prison while the investigation proceeds,
 but the bail system in Mozambique remains ill-defined. The
 law provides that it the prescribed period for investigation
 has been completed and no charges have been brought, the
 detainee must be released. In practice, however, this is
 often overlooked, in part because of the severe lack of
 administratiVe resources and trained lawyers.
 The security'police (SNASP) organized under the Ministry of
 National Security, have the power to arrest persons accused of
 political and economic crimes against the State, such as
 espionage or sabotage. In September the Government restored
 the right 6f political prisoners to submit habeas corpus
 petitions. These detainees now have the same rights as other
 prisoners: to contact a lawyer and to be charged or released
 within a set period of time. In practice, these guarantees
 are also often overlooked due a lack of administrative
 resources. The SNASP can also order preventive detention, for
 indefinite periods, and many persons are never brought before
 a court. These detainees are often held incommunicado and do
 not have the right to challenge the legality of their
 detention,
 The number of political/security detainees awaiting trial as
 distinguished from those that had been convicted was unknown
 at year's end. An estimated 600 prisoners were held in SNASP
 military prisons at the end of 1989. In August under the
 authority of the amnesty law, the Ministry of Justice ordered
 the release of 1,600 prisoners from civilian prisons,
 including'100 security prisoners convicted under the defunct
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal.
 There were no reports of anyone being exiled from Mozambique
 during 1989. The law of amnesty, first promulgated for a
 12-month. period in 1987, remained in force throughout 1989.
 The Government maintains that this amnesty permits any RENAMO
 member to return to civilian life and participate in the
 political life of the country. Over 3,000 ex-RENAMO members
 reportedly returned in 1988. The Government claimed that
 
 
 238
 MOZAMBIQUE
 thousands more accepted amnesty in 1989, although many of
 these were probably civilians living in RENAMO-controlled
 areas rather than actual fighters. There have been few
 reports of mistreatment of amnestied RENAMO members.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique now has two complementary justice systems: the
 civil/criminal, composed of the judiciary under the Ministry
 of Justice and a police force under the Ministry of Interior;
 and the military justice system, under the Ministry of
 National Security. The latter has jurisdiction over most
 cases involving crimes committed by military personnel and
 cases of crimes by civilians which adversely affect the
 military. A separate court system for national security
 crimes, the Revolutionary Military Tribunal, was abolished in
 December 1988. The Minister of Justice appoints judges at the
 district and provincial level, while the President appoints
 judges to the newly formed Supreme Court.
 With the establishment of the Supreme People's Court and the
 appointment of Supreme Court justices in the final months of
 1988, the Mozambican legal system took on the final form
 envisaged in the 1976 judiciary organization law. Persons
 accused of crimes against the security of the people and the
 State (i.e., the majority of political prisoners) are now
 tried by the provincial courts under standard criminal
 judicial procedures, with the right of appeal to the Supreme
 Court. This represents a significant improvement over trials
 conducted by the former Revolutionary Military Tribunal.
 Nonpolitical trials conducted by the regular civil and
 criminal court system are generally fair, are held in public,
 and carry the right of appeal. However, a large backlog of
 pending cases has resulted in long waiting periods before
 cases are brought to trial. Political trials can be held in
 public; but SNASP can order that a specific trial be closed.
 In �heory, SNASP's influence over the judicial process has
 been greatly reduced, although its extensive detention powers
 are apparently unchanged. Whether provincial courts will be
 able-to resist executive and military influence in political
 and security cases has yet to be tested. As far as is known,
 there were no such cases tried at-the provincial level in 1989.
 In addition to the regular people's courts at the provincial
 and district levels,- there are at the local level customary
 courts which handle matters such as estate and divorce cases.
 The proceedings are usually conducted in public by a trained
 representative of the Ministry of Justice,'assisted by two or
 four popularly elected lay judges inst-ructed to exercise
 common sense and to apply locally accepted principles.
 The Military Crimes and Military Tribunal law which took
 effect in 1988 established a nationwide system of brigade
 courts and provincial military courts and specified
 military-related crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 In areas of active insurgency, homes are entered at will by
 security or police forces. It is widely assumed that
 
 
 239
 MOZAMBIQUE
 surveillance devices are employed to monitor local and
 international telecommunications systems and that mail is
 periodically inspected.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In 1989 RENA140 staged a series of attacks in every province of
 the country. The Government responded with a July offensive
 on RENAMO's headquarters in central Mozambique. Both
 government (FPLM) and RENAM4O forces were again responsible for
 violations of humanitarian law in 1989, although RENAMO abuses
 continued to be much more widespread and systematic. Attacks
 against civilians were reported almost daily, and, given the
 remoteless-of much of the countryside, many more attacks
 undoubtedly went unreported.
 In January refugees crossing into Malawi from Tete Province
 said that in several separate instances FPLM forces had herded
 suspected RENAMO sympathizers into their huts, which were then
 set ablaze. Although the refugees were vague about numbers,
 scores of people died. In general, however, FRELIMO abuses,
 especially summary executions, have declined since the
 implementation of the Government's heavily publicized amnesty
 program. Government forces occasionally forced rural people
 into guarded villages, especially in areas where local
 sympathies for RENAMO were thought to be high. A Maputo daily
 newspaper reported that civilians, mainly in rural areas,
 complain of living in fear of FRELIMO soldiers' misconduct,
 especially in their abuse of women. AI reports that in May
 and June 1989 six soldiers and militia members were charged
 with various offenses. The local media have published
 accounts of punishments for such abuse.
 Numerous credible sources report that RENAMO still executes
 noncombatants after attacks on.villages, often hacking or
 burning people to death,- apparently to intimidate would-be
 resisters. Such assassinations are especially aimed at any
 representative of the Government, including party officials,
 school teachers, and health workers. In one such attack on a
 communal village in Gaza Province in the south, 54 civilians
 are said to have died. In March RENAMO killed three Italian
 Capuchin priests and held one captive briefly after attacking
 their mission. In July, apparently timed for the Fifth Party
 Congress, RENAMO forces attacked a suburb 6 miles north of
 Maputo, killing four civilians, and, according to government
 sources, torturing four others, including an 8-year old child,
 by cutting off their ears. Also in July RENAMO guerrillas
 reportedly killed more than 80 civilians in an attack on
 Ressano Garcia, a town close to the South African border.
 Numerous other refugee accounts accuse RENAMO of
 systematically kidnaping civilians, including children, some
 in their early teens, who are forced to bear arms for
 RENAMO.   RENAMO also forces civilians, after an attack on
 their settlement, to carry confiscated items back to RENAMO
 camps; those prisoners too weak to keep up are sometimes
 killed. Prisoners allegedly are forced to cultivate food for
 the insurgents, and violence against women, including rape, is
 common. RENAMO's policy of deliberate destruction of economic
 targets, including factories and land transportation
 facilities, has touched off famine conditions in some areas,
 particularly Zambezia Province. Relief convoys, health
 workers, and clinics were frequently targeted for attack.

 M4OZAMBIOUE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In 1989 Mozambicans were allowed to speak freely on many
 issues, but press freedom was restricted. The Constitution
 provides for freedom of speech and opinion and citizens are
 officially encouraged to express their views in grassroots and
 higher level party meetings. The FRELIMO Fifth Party Congress
 in July was the culmination of a year-long debate on
 wide-ranging policy matters in party assemblies nationwide.
 The national media remain small and controlled. The two radio
 stations and one television station are government owned; the
 print media are owned by private entities, but the Government
 makes key management decisions and provides subsidies. There
 is no prior censorship, but it is understood that the press
 must follow certain guidelines; it cannot contradict
 government policy, and it must support the general goals of
 FRELIMO. Within these limits the media can engage in vigorous
 investigative reporting. In 1989 the media featured frequent
 press exposes of incidents of official abuse of power,
 bureaucratic mismanagement, and government and military
 corruption.
 Given the problems of poverty, illiteracy, and shortage of
 hard currency, the market for books and publications is
 small. However, some foreign publications, including
 independent Western news magazines, do occasionally appear in
 bookstores. Church groups circulate newsletters and pastoral
 letters. Western journalists (including Americans) are
 welcome in Mozambique, and the Government assists in their
 visits. Regular foreign radio broadcasts and South African
 television are received without interference or restrictions.
 Academic freedom is circumscribed. Some attempt is made to
 encourage teachers to promote pro-FRELIMO patriotism and to
 provide texts with a similar bias. In fact, resource
 limitations render these attempts ineffectual. Students at
 the university level complain of "elitism" on the part of
 senior professors which discourages the full interchange of
 ideas more than they complain of ideological limitations on
 debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No political organization is permitted outside the party. The
 Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and association,
 but it also makes FRELIMO, the "guide of the organs of state
 power," the only legal political organization. All mass
 organizations, such as the women's and youth's organizations
 and the sole labor union, are associated with the party.
 Nonpolitical association is uncommon, but permitted (e.g.,
 leading private businessmen formed an association in 1988).
 Organized protest and demonstrations are rare. One major
 exception was a student strike in May at Eduardo Mondlane
 University. Students, while carefully stressing that theirs
 was not a political movement, demanded improved living
 conditions, scholarships, and a more representative student
 organization than that provided by the FRELIMO-linked
 organization of Mozambican youth. Eventually, high government
 officials addressed some of their demands, and the students
 returned peacefully to their classes, without penalty.
 
 
 241
 MOZAMBIQUE
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution mandates strict separation of church and
 state and guarantees individuals the freedom to "practice or
 not practice a religion." Religious institutions, however,
 are required to "conform with the State's laws." The
 Government does not require religious organizations or
 missionaries to register, and foreign missionaries are readily
 granted visas.
 In the early postindependence period, relations between the
 Government and religious organizations were frequently tense
 and characterized by numerous expropriations of church
 property and official criticism of religious activities-and
 beliefs. In recent years, however, the Government has
 attempted a rapproachement with religious institutions.that
 intensified in 1989. The Government and party leaders praised
 major denominations for their contribution-to Mozambican
 social development, and the Fifth Party Congress decided to
 allow private entities, presumably including religious
 institutions, to operate schools. In December the Government
 returned the Maputo synagogue to the local Jewish community.
 In the formal dialog between the Government and leaders from
 several religious denominations, the discussions centered on a
 comprehensive law to resolve such issues as the extent to
 which religious groups can print and distribute publications,
 the ownership of some expropriated church properties, and
 whether Muslim women can be exempt from obligatory military
 service. However, the Government has not yet returned a
 Maputo church seminary or passed legislation on religious-
 freedom, as it had indicated it would do.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 As an emergency security measure and to prevent evasion of
 conscription, the Government requires all citizens to obtain
 travel permits from the local authorities. In practice, this
 directive is often ignored because of the lack of
 administrative control and resources in parts of the
 countryside. However, many religious leaders complain that
 government security regulations requiring missionaries and
 others to seek permission for interprovincial travel
 interferes unduly with their work. The Government also
 requires people to move from areas designated as security
 zones. There is no exile or revocation of Mozambican
 citizenship for political reasons.
 Presently, some 385 refugees of various nationalities,
 including South African, have successfully sought refugee
 status in Mozambique. These refugees receive material aid
 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 with the full cooperation of the Mozambican Government. There
 are no reported cases in which refugees have been forced to
 return to countries where they have a well-founded fear of
 persecution.
 Security conditions have forced many Mozambicans to leave
 their homes. An estimated 1 million are internal refugees,
 living mainly in displaced persons camps scattered throughout
 the country. In these camps, they receive emergency aid from
 the Government and from the international community. Many
 
 
 242
 MOZAMBIQUE
 thousands more have taken refuge in neighboring countries.
 According to recent estimates, 627,700 Mozambican refugees are
 in Malawi alone. Other receiving countries include Zimbabwe,
 with 74,000 refugees; Tanzania, 72,000; Zambia, 24,000; and
 Swaziland, 10,000. Another 38,000 are thought to be in South
 Africa, although this estimate is only an approximation, given
 the difficulty in distinguishing economic migrants from
 displaced persons and refugees.
 While Mozambican law does not address the issue of emigration,
 in practice the Government does not interfere with those who
 wish to -leave. The Government readily accepts and aids
 repatriates. An estimated 116,000 refugees have returned to
 Mozambique, some on their own initiative and some through
 UNHCR voluntary repatriation programs coordinated with
 neighboring governments. South Africa routinely repatriates
 undocumented Mozambicans, although in recent well-publicized
 instances, they have allowed the-temporary entry of villagers
 who are fleeing RENAMO attack. The- Government has protested
 these involuntary repatriations, including from Zimbabwe, but
 is unable to prevent them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government or
 the laws that govern them. In practice, the President and the
 Council of Ministers control policymaking and implementation.
 The President has extensive appointive powers in both his
 government and party roles. He sets policy guidelines in
 consultation with the 12-person Politburo and the 164-member
 Central Committee of FRELIMO, whose members are elected at
 party congresses at 5-year intervals. The Constitution does
 not allow the formation of new or dissenting parties.
 Non-FRELIMO party members, however, may and do participate in
 the Government, including at the ministerial level.
 People may choose delegates to a series of hierarchically
 organized peoples' assemblies, including the National People's
 Assembly, from a slate of candidates prepared by FRELIMO. The
 peoples' assemblies have been the scenes of occasional
 spirited debates, but they function largely as advisory
 bodies, with little real power to initiate policies not
 sanctioned by high-level authorities.
 Following the contacts between church leaders and RENAMO
 groups in Kenya, the Government and party publicly backed
 peace talks with RENAMO. The Fifth Party Congress endorsed a
 negotiated settlement but stipulated that RENAMO must agree to
 renounce violence and support the current Government, its laws
 and Constitution. President Chissano also asked the
 Presidents of Kenya and Zimbabwe to help mediate the
 conflict. For its part RENAMO demands free elections and a
 multiparty system. However, there is considerable variance
 between RENAMOs demands and its practices in its areas of
 operations. RENAMO has not established any recognizable
 administrative machinery that might provide a more concrete
 indicator of its plan of government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government was increasingly receptive to international
 human rights monitoring groups in 1989. An AI delegation
 
 
 243
 MOZAMBIQUE
 visited Mozambique in September,.at the Government's
 invitation, and AI's subsequent report commanded favorable, if
 selective, comment by the Government.  The decision to repeal
 the law on flogging may have been-influenced by concern
 expressed by various international groups.
 The ICRC now has access to security prisons nationwide and is
 likely to begin visits to civilian prisons, where some
 security prisoners are reportedly held. The Ministry of
 Justice and the ICRC organized a conference on human rights in
 March to discuss the application of human rights principles in
 international human rights conventions and the problems of
 refugees and asylum in Mozambique. U.N. agencies, such as the
 UNHCR and the International Labor Organization (ILO), also
 have programs in the country.
 There are no internal Mozambican human rights organizations,
 either official or independent. Current restrictions on
 freedoms of speech and press would make it difficult, if not
 impossible, for any group to report fully and objectively on
 the Government's human rights policies.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 According to official government policy and pronouncements,
 Mozambique is a multiracial, nondiscriminatory society. There
 does not appear to be any systematic persecution on the basis
 of ethnicity or race. There are no ethnic or racially based
 quotas on government employment or benefits, nor is the
 Government controlled by any-one of Mozambique's 10 major
 ethnic groups.
 Nonetheless, the FRELIMO Government tends to include a
 disproportionate number of southerners, mostly from the
 Shangaan ethnic group, at all levels. Members of the northern
 Makonde tribe are well represented. White, Asian, and
 mixed-race Mozambicans are also heavily represented relative
 to their numbers in the population, causing a certain degree
 of resentment. However, whites, Asians, and those of mixed
 race are not allowed in the military. Most observers, both
 Mozambican and foreign, believe that ethnic imbalance results
 from the greater educational opportunities available to
 southerners and nonblacks under the fbrmer colonial
 administration and not from deliberate government policies.
 In 1989 the disproportionately high number of Shangaan
 speakers in highereducation was cited by university and
 government officials as an injustice requiring priority
 action. It is widely believed that the personnel changes
 following the Fifth Party Congress were intended to promote
 greater regional balance. The Government has also been
 undertaking a little publicized "Africanization" program of
 moving black Africans into positions formerly occupied by
 whites.
 The leadership of the RENAMO insurgents is predominantly from
 the Shona-speaking ethnic groups who live near the Zimbabwean
 border.
 The Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex
 and mandates equal rights and responsibilities for women.
 Family law requires that women have equal property rights and
 rights over the children in any marriage. FRELIMO's mass
 organization for women, the Organization of Mozambican Women
 (OH4), has made a long-term project of studying the
 
 
 244
 MOZAMBIQUE
 traditional practices of the various ethnic groups and
 challenging, through grassroots education programs, those
 practices that are determined to be detrimental to women.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against
 women, especially wife beating, is fairly widespread in
 Mozambique, especially in the rural areas. The police do not
 normally intervene in domestic disputes, and cases are rarely
 brought before the courts. Official government policy is
 against such violence, but it has not addressed-the issue
 specifically, and its influence is weak, especially in many
 rural areas affected by the civil war. The FRELIMO women's
 organization has a campaign to change public attitudes. Other
 practices, such as female genital mutilation (circumcision)
 and bride-price payments, also continue in some rural areas.
 Female circumcision is found most frequently in coastal areas,
 particularly among Muslim groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers are free to join or not to join a trade union.
 However, all trade unions must belong to a central labor union
 association, the Organization of Mozambican Workers (OTM),
 which is loosely affiliated with FRELIMO. Trade unions
 independent of the OTM are prohibited by law, and there has
 been no known effort to form another federation. In past
 years, over half of the salaried workers in Mozambique
 belonged to OTM-affiliated unions. However, press reports
 indicate that union membership in Maputo Province, where a
 disproportionate number of Mozambique's salaried workers are
 located, actually decreased in 1989. Many factories have been
 destroyed in the conflict with RENAMO, forcing OTM members who
 lost their salaried jobs to turn to subsistence agriculture.
 Other workers have become too impoverished to pay union dues.
 Unions do not have the right to strike in practice, and there
 was no known strike activity in 1989. High unemployment makes
 strike action ineffective. In mid-1988, a wildcat strike by
 dockworkers ended when the Government fired the strikers and
 replaced them with newly hired workers.
 The OTM considers its relations with international trade union
 organizations to be an important element of its mission, and
 it frequently serves as a conduit for foreign assistance to
 Mozambican trade unions. The OTM is not affiliated with any
 non-African international trade union organizations. It is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council. The
 OTM participates in exchange and training programs with the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations and with unions from several Western European
 nations. The OTM also has extensive ties to Soviet and East
 European unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are only allowed to organize and negotiate with
 employers within the OTM structure. Union membership is
 voluntary, but the Government encourages workers to join and
 actively participate in unions. The Government sets wage
 rates, so collective bargaining, as such, does not exist.
 However, the Government consults the OTM on labor and economic
 policies which affect unions, and the OTM monitors
 
 
 245
 MOZAMBIQUE
 occupational safety conditions.
 One of the OTM's primary activities is to represent workers at
 disciplinary action hearings and during labor disputes. The
 OTM sponsors a number of training programs for workers and
 operates a canteen service to provide low-cost meals at work
 sites and factories.
 Some professional organizations, such as the Association for
 Journalists, Writers, and Musicians, have attained quasi-union
 status following a 1988 agreement that allowed them to
 petition the National People's Assembly for improvements in
 members' working conditions. The Association of Mozambican
 Journalists received a significant wage increase for its
 memberd as a result.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law; there have
 been no reports of such labor practices by the Government.
 RENAMO.reportedly forces kidnaped civilians to perform various
 support functions,.including portering arms and supplies, and
 growing food for combatants.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated, and in the wage economy the minimum
 working age is 16. Because of high adult unemployment, there
 are few children in regular wage positions. However, minor
 children commonly work on family farms or in the urban
 informal sector, where they perform such tasks as watching
 cars or collecting scrap metal.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is set at about $27.50 per month at the
 current official exchange rate, although it is less than half
 that amount in dollar terms at the black market rate of
 exchange. This salary is not adequate to sustain an average
 worker's family, especially under the ongoing economic reform
 plan which reduced or removed government subsidies on many
 basic goods. Given the 40 percent unemployment rate and the
 occasional lack of effective government enforcement, many
 salaried workers are probably receiving less than the minimum,
 and workers must turn to second jobs, if available, or more
 likely to subsistence agriculture to survive. An estimated 85
 percent of the work force is engaged in semisubsistence
 agriculture, which is not covered by minimum wage legislation.
 The standard legal work week is 44 hours. Women workers are
 guaranteed 2 months paid maternity leave, although it is
 difficult to ensure compliance with these regulations. If
 firms have,.day-care facilities, women reportedly have the
 right to to breaks of 30 minutes duration daily for a year to
 feed their children.
 Most of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and is not affected by the wage economy and government
 regulations regarding working conditions. In the small,
 modern sector, the Government has enacted health and
 environmental laws to protect workers.  On occasion, the
 Government has closed firms for noncompliance with these laws,
 but enforcement is difficult in the current economic situation.
