 INDIA
 India is a parliamentary democracy with a free press, civilian-controlled military,
 independent judiciary, and active political parties and civic associations. Competi-
 tive elections produce regular changes of leadership at the national, state, and mu-
 nicipal levels.
 The 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order. However, the central Government provides guidance and support through use
 of national paramilitary forces and in law has ultimate responsibility for protecting
 the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The Union Ministry for
 Home Affairs controls the nationwide Indian Police Service, most of the paramilitary
 forces, and the internal intelligence bureaus. The rapid growth of the internal intel-
 ligence bureaus and the increased- use of paramilitary forces against separatist
 insurgencies and communal unrest have given the Home Ministry increasing day-
 to-day control over law and order operations. Centrally controlled paramilitary
 forces are deployed throughout India and have been responsible for significant
 human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast. These abuses ulti-
 mately raise questions about the effectiveness of civilian oversight and the extent
 of the Government's willingness and ability to prosecute offenders vigorously. Army
 units are also deployed for internal security duty in Kashmir and the northeast, and
 generally show greater respect for human rights than the paramilitary forces, al-
 though they have also been responsible for some abuses.
 India has a mixed economy, with the private sector dominating agriculture, most
 nonfinancial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy industry. The
 Congress (I) Government pursued economic liberalization and structural reforms
 begun in 1991. Trade and foreign investment restrictions were relaxed, certain gov-
 
 
 1339
 
 ernment subsidies and foreign exchange and price controls were reduced, and the
 government deficit was brought under control. India's economic problems are
 compounded by population growth of 2 percent per year, with a current total of
 about 891 million. Income distribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the
 urban population and 51 percent of the rural population live in extreme poverty.
 Despite extensive constitutional and statutory safeguards, significant human
 rights abuses persist throughout India. The abuses are aggravated by severe social
 tensions and the authorities' attempts to contain violent secessionist movements.
 Abuses are particularly acute in disturbed areas, such as Punjab and Kashnir,
 where the judicial system has broken down in the face of terrorist threats. As in
 past years, areas of abuse include: extrajudicial executions and reprisal killings by
 security forces in Kashmir, Punjab, and northeast India (encouraged in some cases
 in Punjab by government bounties on killed militants); political killings, kidnaping,
 and extortion by nilitant; torture, rape, and deaths of suspcts in police custody
 throughout India; incommunicado detention for prolonged periods without charge
 under special security legislation; inadequate prosecution of police and security
 forces' personnel implicated in abuse; widespreadintercaste and communal violence;
 legal and societal discrimination as well as extensive violence, both societal and by
 police and other agent of government against women; infrequent prosecution of
 dowry deaths" (wife murder); and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded,
 and child labor.
 In 1993 the Government sought to address human rights concerns by opening dia-
 logs with international human rights organizations and the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross (ICRC), allowing some international monitors access to Kash-
 mir Amd other parts of India, enhancing human rights training for police and army
 personnel, and creating a National Human Rights Commission with powers to in-
 vestigate and recommnend punishment in cases of police abuse. To date these efforts
 have produced only modest results.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Politico) and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Politica killings by both government
 forces and militants continued at a disturbing rate, particularly in ,[ammu and
 Kashmir, Punjab, mid the northeast, where separatist insurgencies continued in
 1993. Extrajudicial executions of suspected militants and their supporters by gov-
 ernment security fortes accounted for hundreds of deaths, as did terrorist attacks
 by militant groups. Ethnic and communal strife resulted in additional killings.
 Deaths in police custody received increased public attention in 1993 and were the
 subject of significant court decisions mandating compensation for victims and their
 families. However, as in the past, there was little evidence that the responsible offi-
 cials received appropriate punishment.
 Extrajudicial executions in areas facingseparatist insurgency were generally tol-
 erated by state authorities, who claimed the breakdown of judicial systems lef secu-
 rity forces no alternative for dealing with accused terrorists. A September 1991
 amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure granted broad rotection to all public
 servants, including the security forces, for acts committed wile dischalng their
 official duties in states under President's rule. This provision contributed to the se-
 curity fores' sense of impunity in  Janimu and Kashmir, which remained under
 President's rule throughout the year.
 Civilian mid security force casualties reported in Kashmir were relatively stable,
 but the number of litants killed climbedsignificantly. Press reports indicate that
 1,1t civilians and 215 security force personnel died in insurgency-related violence
 in Kashmir in 1993. Militant casualties during this same period numbered 1,438
 many of whom died under suspicious circumstances. The Jammu and Kashmir Aasic
 Rights Protection Committee, a group headed by a retired high court justice, drew
 on press accounts to detail 168 deaths in security force custody during the first 4
 months of 1993. The victims of custodial violence included a state police constable,
 whos reported death in army custody in April sparked a 6-day police rebellion cen-
 tered in Srnnagar. (See Section 1g. for further discussion of extrajudicial killing in
 Jammu and Kashmir.
 Kashmiri militant groups carried out politically motivated killings on a wide scale,
 targeting government oicials, alleged police informers, members of rival factions
 and Hindu civilians. On August 14, militants stpped a bus in Jammu and killed
 16t findu men. On August 3, militants attacked Hindu pilgrims near Anantnag, kill-
 ing    and injuring 23. Among those killed in targeted militant attacks were a re-
 tired assistant commissioner, a Hindu leader in Jammu, a Srinagar-based news
 raner for All  cidia Radio, and the relative of a local  s leadr.

 In Punjab police continued to engage in extrajudicial killings including faked "en-
 counter" killings. In the typical scenario, police take into custody a suspected mili-
 tant or militant supporter without filing an arrest report. If the detainee dies during
 interrogation or is executed, officials deny he was ever in custody and claim he died
 during an armed encounter with police or security forces. Alternatively, police may
 claim to have been ambushed by militants while escorting a suspect. Although the
 detainee invariably dies in "crossfire," police casualties in these "incidents" are rare.
 In one such incident, a 22-year-old Sikh farmer, Manjinderpal Singh, was picked
 up by police on July 12. According to the Punjab Human Rights Organization, the
 detainee's father and members of-the village council on July 14 contacted the dis-
 trict police chief, who told them Singh would be released soon. On July 20, the po-
 lice chief reported that Singh had been killed on July 15 in an encounter with mili-
 tants. The police reportedly offered no explanation for the delay in informing the
 family.
 In another case of extrajudicial killing, Kulwant Singh, a Sikh lawyer, dis-
 appeared on January 25 along with his wife and child after he was called to the
 Ropar police station to pick up a client. Following repeated inquiries by local law-
 yers for over 2 weeks, the district police superintendent announced that Kulwant
 Singh and his family were killed on January 25 by two terrorists who wanted to
 surrender. The police superintendent claimed the terrorists who allegedly confessed
 to the killings committed suicide by swallowing cyanide shortly before their role in
 Kulwant Singh's murder was made public. Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh
 agreed to order an inquiry into the case but reportedly backed off in the face of po-
 lice resistance.
 The Armed Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983 grants
 army and paramilitary personnel wide dscretion in the use of lethal force, giving
 authorities an easy defense for "encounter" killings. Extrajudicial executions were
 also encouraged by the Punjab government's practice of offering bounties for killed
 militants. The chief minister told the state assembly that over 41,000 such bounties
 were paid between 1991 and 1993; in some cases more than one person claimed
 credit for the same killing.
 The claim of Indian human rights groups that Punab police were engaged in a
 systematic campaign to liquidate militants and their suppors is borne out by data
 showing a high ratio of militant to security force casualties. Press reports indicate
 589 alleged Sikh militants were killed in Punjab in 1993, compared to 23 civilians
 and 16 members of the security forces.
 There were several reports during 1993 that Punjab police "hit teams" were pur-
 suing Sikh militants in other parts of India. On May 17, one such team raided an
 apartment in Calcutta looking for alleged militant Lakshmi Singh. According to
 neighbors, Punjab police commandos broke into the apartment early that morning,
 shot Singh and his wife in their bedroom, then fled with the bodies. The government
 of West Bengal lodged a protest with the Punjab government, but no disciplinary
 action was reported against the police commandos.
 In a similar incident, on July 3 two brothers, Dilbagh and Kashmir Singh, were
 taken into custody in Bombay by a Punjab police team. After his release, Kashmir
 Singh claimed they were subjected to mental and physical torture before being put
 on a train for Punjab on July 5. When they turned his badly bruised body over to
 family members, police said Dilbagh Singh had fallen from the moving train. Bom-
 bay Sikh activists claimed Dilbagh Singh was killed by the police and called for a
 full investigation, but no action was taken. Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill told jour-
 nalists on July 22 that "the purpose of having such teams has been to trace, iden-
 tify, and kill top militants. Gill added that Punjab police teams were stationed in
 the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra, Jammu and
 Kashmir, Assam, and Uttar Pradesh.
 There were few instances of terrorist violence in Punjab during 1993, inpart a
 consequence of stringent government security measures. On April 25, the district
 commissioner (head of civil administration) in Bathinda was injured b1 a bomb that
 exploded near his vehicle. On March 24, militants on a scooter killedseven people
 and injured two when they opened fire on a crowd near Ludhiana. Sikh militants
 operating in the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh killed 11 people and injured 3 in a
 string of apparently random attacks on June 9. On September 24, Sikh militants
 reportedly fired on a bus-load of Youth Congress leaders near Ludihiana, killing 3
 Inthe states of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, Maoist revolutionary Naxalites tar-
 getedpoliticians, landlords, and government officials in terrorist attacks. The An-
 dhraPradesh Civil Liberties Committee in turn charged the state government with
 killing 249 suspted Naxalites in faked "encounters during 1992. In February the
 People's War Group (PWG) assassinated the Additional Director of the Andhra
 
 
 1341
 
 Pradesh police academy in a daylight attack. The PWG killed several dozen other
 police and paramilitary personnel in ambushes and land mine attacks. The Maoist
 Communist Center (M6), a Naxalite group active in Central Bihar, operated a par-
 allel judicial system that ordered summary executions of landlords and other "c ass
 enemies."
 In the seven states of northeastern India, at least 18 major insurgent groups were
 active, including the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), the Nationaf Social-
 ist Council of Nagaland (NSCN), and the Bodo Security Force. Most of the reported
 casualties in the northeast were army and paramilitary personnel. In August and
 September, however NSCN militants killed more than 200 Kuki tribesmen, includ-
 ing women and children, in a series of attacks in the hill districts of Manipur. This
 followed an NSCN ambush on June 29 that left 27 army personnel dead and 24 in-
 jured.
 Large-scale army operations in Assam were suspended, but the army retained
 overalf responsibilty or coordinating police and paramilitary forces in the region.
 Under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act of 1958, army and security forces were
 given wide discretion to use lethal force in Assam and four other northeastern
 states. In February the regional high court in Guwahati ordered the Indian army
 to pay $1,600 in compensation to the family of a man who disappeared in 1991
 while in army custody. The court had earlier issued a habeas corpus petition order-
 ing the Government and army to produce the man in court after he had been de-
 tamned for interrogation about his son. ULFA militants in Assam killed accused in-
 formers and at least seven "deserters" who had accepted a government amnesty.
 ULFA's chairman reportedly issued a directive from Bangladesh calling for the
 death of all ULFA members who surrendered to police.
 Indian news papers reported nine deaths in custody or after police torture in and
 around Delhi during 1993. Press reports from the southern city of Bangalore alleged
 there were six deaths in police custody there during the year ending August 30. The
 Chief Minister of West Bengal told the state assembly there had been 277 custodial
 deaths in his state since 1977, of which only I case was probed by the courts.
 India's Criminal Procedure Code requires a magisterial inquiry in every case of
 a death in police custody. However, most custodial abuse is directed at the poor and
 uneducated lower castes, who are unlikely to understand their right to redress. In-
 quiries are often not carried out, and when an investigation does occur, the results
 are generally not made public.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances are believed to occur on a large scale. There
 are credible reports that l~lice throughout India often do not file required arrest
 reports, with the result that there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances in
 which relatives claim a person was taken into police custody and never heard from
 again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no records of ar-
 rest.
 This problem is particularly acute in Punjab, where there was a sharp rise in re-
 ported disappearances as the police sought to eliminate militants and their support-
 ers. Sikh human rights groups reported dozens of disappearances in which police
 claimed they neverheld a person, even when there were witnesses to the arrest.
 In cases where officials acknowledged an individual was in custody, police some-
 times report the detainee was killed while trying to escape when taken to recover
 an alleged arms cache. Without exception, human rights gups say, these detainees
 are never seen again. The Human Rights Trust, a Delhi-based nongovernmental or-
 ganization (NGO), reported 28 such cases, with registered arrest reports, between
 January and May. One case involved Gurdev Singh Kaonke, a Sikh religious leader
 who reportedly escaped while being taken to recover an arms supply on January 2
 and has not been seen since.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture is prohibited by law there is credible evidence that torture of de-
 tainees is common throughout India. ometimes this abuse is part of the interroga-
 tion process, sometimes it is to extort money from the victim or his relatives, and
 sometimes it is summary punishment doled out by individual police officials.
 Confessions extracted by force are generally inadmissible in court. Under the Ter-
 rorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), however, a confession
 made to an officer above the rank of superintendent of police is admissible as evi-
 dence, provided the police have "reason to believe that it is being made voluntarily."
 Press accounts and reports by human rights groups indicate that brutality in ex-
 tracting confessions under the TADA is common.
 Indian human rights groups have detailed numerous individual cases of torture
 and abuse during interrogation by police and paramilitary forces in Kashmir, Pun-
 jab, and Assam. Forms of torture include beatings, rape, burning with cigarettes
 ana hot rods, suspension by the feet, crushing of limbs with heavy rollers, and elec-
 
 
 1342
 tric shocks. Many alleged torture victims die in custody, and others fear to aeak
 out due to the threat of police retaliation. Consequently there are few firsthan ac-
 counts. One exception was the case of Masroof Sultan, a Kashmiri student who was
 pulled from a bus on April 8 and tortured with electric shocks. Sultan told foreign
 journalists he was shot and left for dead by border security force (BSF) soldiers who
 tried to pass off his death as a crossfire incident. Sultan's family claims to have seen
 him in custody and pleaded for his release. Although his case was taken up by sev-
 eral governments and international human rights groups, the Government did not
 investigate Sultan's torture or punish those responsble.
 Another case involved the gang-rape of a Kashmiri woman on May 25 by army
 troops outside Srinagar. The victim, Nazeera Jan, told reporters that 10 soldiers
 broke into her room, tied her husband to a tree outside, and sexually assaulted her.
 A medical examination confirmed that she had been raped, and the army announced
 court-martial proceedings against four of the accused. State officials claimed that
 the four were each sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but this punishment was
 not publicized. In Calcutta, a police constable was sentenced to life imprisonment
 for his involvement in a custodial rape incident in 1992 that was taken up by oppo-
 sition politicians and women's groups.
 In response to a parliamentary question on August 19, the Home Ministry stated
 that 146 security force personnel had been disciplined for "acts of omission and com-
 mission during operations in Jammu and Kashmir during the past 3 years." Be-
 cause the Government did not publicize the forms of punishment or the crimes in-
 volved, it was impossible to judge the adequacy of the punishment or even if the
 crimes involved human rights issues. A Home Ministry note given to the South Asia
 Human Rights Documentation Center described punishments ranging from 7 years'
 to 6 months' imprisonment meted out in nine cases of rape, extortion, or sexual
 abuse. There is no evidence that any member of the security forces has been pun-
 ished for an incident of custodial death or custodial torture in Jammu and Kashmir.
 Among Kashmiris, there is a general impression that official abuse goes
 unumshed.
 stodial abuse is common even in Indian states free of insurgency. Scheduled
 castes and harijans, people at the bottom of India's social ladder, are particularly
 vulnerable to police violence. There continued to be consistent reports that police,
 mostly upper caste Hindus, deliberately targeted tnembers of these groups and reli-
 gious minorities for beatings and rape. A highly publicized case from 1992, involving
 a low caste thief castrated while in police custody, remained stuck in the courts. The
 district magistrate's report to the Supreme Court called for disciplinary action
 against four police officers, along with three doctors accused of altering evidence. As
 of the end of the year, the station house officer and assistant subinspector charged
 in the case remained out on bail, despite a Supreme Court recommendation that
 bail be cancelled by May 10.
 The Government grew increasingly sensitive to allegations of police abuse during
 1993 and took some steps to address the problem. The Home Ministry reiterated
 instructions to police authorities that coercive methods should not be used on per-
 sons in police custody and expanded human rights training at India's elite national
 police academy. The Government says many members of the police have been dis-
 ciplined for abuse of detainees. However, punishment is usually meager (suspension
 or transfer) and occurs only in a small percentage of incidents. The courts have
 played a role in trying to bring police behavior into line with Indian law. In a key
 decision on March 30, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the right of victims and their
 families to seek compensation from the Government for abuse while in police cus-
 tody. However, the serious backlog in India's judicial system means that custodial
 abuse cases usually move slowly. In 1993, for instance, three policemen were sen-
 tenced to life imprisonment for their role in a custodial death in 1980. In August
 the principal suspect in this case was granted bail, pending his appeal before the
 Delhi high court.
 The Government does not allow independent monitoring of prisons by NGO's.
 Prison conditions are, however, the subject of frequent press reports and have been
 assessed by human rights groups relying on testimony from former detainees. Press
 reports include charges of sexual abuse of prisoners; the use of prisoners by prison
 officials for domestic labor; the sale on the black market of food and milk meant
 for prisoners; and the sale of women prisoners to brothels. Women constitute 2 to
 6 percent of the total prison population, according to the 1987 National Expert Com-
 mittee on Women Prisoners Report.
 A June 1993 report by the Human Rights Trust charged that prisoners in New
 Delhi's Tihar jail, considered one of the best-run in India, had inadequate food, med-
 ical care, and clothing. The prison houses approximately 8,500 prisoners in facilities
 designed to hold 2,219. Over 90 percent are awaiting trial, according to the jail's
 
 
 1343
 inspector general, and may be held months or even years before getting a court
 date. There were reportedly some 120 suicides in Tihar between 1988 and 1992.
 The Juvenile Justice Act of 1986 provides that boys under 16 and girls under 18
 are not to be held in prisons. However, these provisions appear to be widely ignored,
 especially in police lockups. The Supreme Court has criticized the states for not pro-
 viding separate facilities for children in jails and for not constructing reformatory
 institutions.
 In August the Supreme Court took up the issue of persons with mental disorders
 who have committed no crimes but are held in prisons throughout India. In its re-
 spnse to a petition by a West Bengal human rights monitor, the Court restrained
 the Government from putting mentally ill people in jail and directed all state gov-
 ernments to report on the status of "noncriminal lunatics" in their states. A senior
 West Bengal official stated that there were more than 1,000 such persons in West
 Bengal prisons.
 There are three classes of Indian prison facilities. Class 'C" cells are the worst.
 They often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food. They are over-
 crowded, and the use of handcuffs and fetters is common. Prisoners in these cells
 reportedly suffer the most abuse. Prisoners are designated class "C" on the basis
 of their standing in society, not on the nature of the crime-those who cannot prove
 they are either college graduates or income taxpayers when they come before the
 magistrate are class "C."
 Class "B" cells are for college graduates and taxpayers. Crowding is less of a prob-
 lem in "B" cells, and the food and treatment of prisoners are reportedly better than
 in class "C." Class "A" cells are for "prominent persons," as designated by the Gov-
 ernment. Prisoners in these cells are accorded private rooms, visits, and adequate
 food, which can be supplemented by their families. In fact, very few prisons actually
 maintain class "A" ce]s; class "A" prisoners are usually held in government guest
 houses. These provisions are not evenly enforced. Kashmiri political leaders Abdul
 Gani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Geelani, for instance, were held in class "C" cells at
 New Delhi's Tihar jail, even though their backgrounds entitle them to class "A" fa-
 cilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were credible reports of wide-
 spread arbitrary arrest and detention under the special security laws enacted over
 the past decade to help law enforcement authorities fight separatist insurgencies.
 The Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed of the grounds for
 arrest, given the right to be represented by counsel, and (unless he is being held
 under a preventative detention law) produced before a magistrate within 24 hours
 of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused is committed to custody (either po-
 lice or judicial remand) or released. An accused must be informed of his right to bail
 at the time of arrest and (unless he is being held for a nonbailable offense) may
 apply for bail at any time. The police must file a charge sheet within 60 or 90 days
 of arrest, depending on the severity of the crime. If the police fail to do so, court
 approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention laws in the event
 of threats to public order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the
 length of detention and for judicial review. Government critics charged with political
 offenses such as sedition or disruptive speech are typically held for extended periods
 under the TADA or the NationalSecurity Act (NSA) but are never formally tried.
 Some alleged militants in Kashmir and Punjab have been in detention for years.
 International human rights groups claim there are thousands of political detainees
 in India.
 The NSA, passed in 1980, permits detention of persons considered security risks;
 police anywhere in India (except Kashmir) may detain suspects under NSA provi-
 sions. The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (1978) covers corresponding pro-
 cedures for that state. Under the NSA's strong preventive detention provisions, a
 person may be detained without charge or trial for up to 1 year on loosely defined
 security grounds. A detention order must be confirmed by the state government and
 reviewed by an advisory board of three high court judges within 7 weeks of arrest.
 NSA detainees are permitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be
 informed of the grounds for detention within 5 days (10-15 days in exceptional cir-
 cumstances). Some 16,000 people have been detained under the NSA since its incep-
 tion. More than two-thirds of those detained were released by order of the state gov-
 ernment or advisory board. According to the Government, as of May 1993, there
 were 639 people under NSA detention nationwide. The cumulative figure for Public
 Safety Act arrests in Kashmir (as of January 1, 1993) was 2,983, with all but 998
 of the arrestees subsequently released.
 The TADA, though enacted in 1985 to fight insurgency in Punjab, has been in-
 voked by almost every state in India, including those where no real emergency ex-
 
 
 1344
 ists. The TADA punishes those found guilty of terrorist and disruptive acts or mem-
 bership in a terrorist gang with no less than 5 years' imprisonment and up to the
 death penalty for certain terrorist crimes. Disruptive activities are defined broadly
 to include speech or actions that disrupt or challenge the sovereignty or territorial
 integrity of India. The TADA extends the period to 60 days during which a detainee
 may be held in police custody after remand by the court and allows administrative
 detention up to 180 days (1 year in spial circumstances). Suspects held under the
 TADA must be presented within 24 hours before an executive magistrate who re-
 views the detention kder, but human rights groups say this requirement is fre-
 quently ignored. The Act was extended for 2 years in May, when an amendment
 was added requiring authorization from a state police inspector general before a
 court takes cognizance of a TADA case. (See also Sections 1.c. and i.e.)
 There were 7,816 reported arrests under the TADA in 18 states and union terri-
 tories during 1992. The Government claimed a total of 52,268 people were arrested
 under the TADA between 1985 and February 15, 1993. Of these, only 434 were con-
 victed. The vast majority of TADA detainees are eventually freed on bail or released
 without charge.
 There are widespread accusations that the special security laws have been mis-
 used in states not experiencing civil unrest as a convenient way to hold people with-
 out trial. These accusations are borne out by government data showing TADA and
 NSA arrests by state. In 1992, for instance, TADA was used more frequently in Gu-
 jarat and Anda Pradesh than in Punjab, which was the Act's original target. In-
 deed, during the first 7 months of 1993 Gujarat registered 1,409 TADA arrests,
 more than half the nationwide total of 2,514. As of April, detentions under NSA in
 1993 were highest in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.
 Human rights monitors and the president of the Madras High Court Lawyers As-
 sociation accused the Tamil Nadu government of using the NSA and other special
 security laws to detain political opponents under the pretext of fighting terrorism.
 In Punjab, state authorities used the TADA to arrest Sikh political leaders and pre-
 vent opposition rallies. In Assam, authorities used the TADA to silence journalists
 and human rights activists suspected of separatist sympathies. In Maharashtra, po-
 lice were accused of using the TADA to round up Muslims indiscriminately on sus-
 picion of involvement in the March 12 Bombay bombings.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-India has an independent judiciary with strong
 constitutional safeguards. An October Supreme Court decision gave the Chief Jus-
 tice of India-in consultation with his colleagues--a decisive voice in selecting judi-
 cial candidates. Under the Constitution, judges are appointed by the President and
 may serve up to age 65 in the Supreme Court and age 62 in the state high courts.
 India's legal procedures generally assure a fair trial when the function normally,
 but the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from an Indian Bar that is fully independent of the Govern-
 ment. There are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system.
 This is not true for cases tried under the TADA which can be appealed only to the
 Supreme Court. Since many TADA detainees lack the resources to gain access to
 the Supreme Court, the act effectively limits appeal.
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases but
 allows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation such as the TADA. Defendants are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty except in certain cases (see below). There are effective channels for
 appeal at all levels of the judicial system, although there is some limitation on ap-
 peals under the special security laws. Sentences must be announced in public.
 The TADA authorizes secret testimony to protect witnesses and suspends the
 usual prohibition on the use of evidence gathered through police interrogation, Indi-
 ans charged under the TADA with certain categories of crimes are presumed guilty
 and carry the burden of proving their innocence. Human rights groups charge that
 these categories are so broad--including cases in which weapons are recovered or
 there is strong incriminating evidence-that they can be manipulated to fit any
 case. TADA trials are held before special courts. The state or central government
 may designate a court as a TADA court for any geographic area, any case, or any
 class of offenses. Appointees to TADA courts must have served as a Sessions Judge
 or Additional Sessions Judge immediately prior to their appointment. Some 450 pe-
 titions have been filed before the Indian Supreme Court challenging the constitu-
 tionality of the Act, but the court has yet to give its opinion. Constitutional chal-
 lenges to the TADA cover a broad spectrum. Many contend that the TADA violates
 the accused's right to due process. Others claim the TADA abrogates the jurisdic-
 
 
 1345
 
 tional rights of the States by eliminating appeal to the High Court. Still others ad-
 dress the TADA's incompatibility with the constitutional guarantee of free speech.
 Muslim personal law governs many noncriminal matters involving Muslims, in-
 cluding family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government's declared policy is
 not to interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result
 that laws that discriminate against women are upheld. Different personal laws are
 administered through the single civil court system.
 In Kashmir and Punjab the judicial systems barely function. In both states,
 threats by militants against judges, witnesses, and their family members have cre-
 ated a situation in which no court is willing to hear cases involving terrorist crimes.
 As a result, there were no convictions of alleged terrorists in Kashmir or Punjab
 during 1993.
 There are no political prisoners in India. (For political detainees, see Section 1.d.)
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 Indian law, warrants are normally required for searches and seizures. In a criminal
 investigation, however, police may conduct searches without a warrant if obtaining
 one would cause undue delay. They must justify such searches after the fact in writ-
 ing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the offense being investigated.
 This requirement appears to be respected. The Special Powers Acts allow an officer
 or noncommissioned officer of the Armed Forces to arrest without warrant, any per-
 son who has committed a cognizable offense or against whom a reasonable suspicion
 of such an act exists. The officer may use such force as necessary to effect the ar-
 rest, enter and search, without warrant, any premises, and recover any proerty
 reasonably suspected to be stolen or any arms believed to be unlawfully kept. There
 is no judicial review of this procedure. Indeed, the Acts bar any prosecution, suit,
 or other legal proceeding against any person in respect to anything done or pur-
 ported to be done in exercise of the powers conferred by the Acts, except with the
 prior sanction of the central Government.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping telep hones and intercepting
 personal mail, is authorized under the Indian Telegraph At "on the occurrence of
 any public emergency or in the interest of the pub ic safety or tranquility." These
 powers have been used by every state government.
 g. Use of Excessie Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Both government forces and militants committed egregious violations of hu-
 manitarian law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Muslim majority
 population in the Kashmir valley increasingly found itself trapped between the re-
 pressive tactics used by security forces to combat insurgency and the militants' acts
 of wanton violence. Approximatel 400,000 Indian army and paramilitary forces
 have been deployed th-oughout ammu and Kashir to contain the separatist
 movement. Under the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, se-
 curity frce       n       sweeping powers, including authority to shoot to kll
 suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace and to destroy structures sus-
 pected of harboring militants or arms.
 Ther   re credible reports that security forces frequently used exessive force
 against civilians, sometimes in retaliation for attacks by ashmiri militants. On
 January 6, a 40-man BSF unit responded to a hit-and-run attack by militants by
 flring on civilians and setting fire to buildings in Sepere, a stronghold of the Hizb-
 Um   jahideen militant group. According toKashmiri and Delhi-based investigators,
 the day-long BSF rampage lef 43 people dead, 14 injured, and around 300 homes
 and businesses burned. Witnesses reported that BSF personnel used rags dipped in
 fuel to spread the flames and fired indiscriminately on civilians.
 The Government responded by dispatching senior officials to Sopore, promising
 compensation to victims, suspending nine BSF personnel (including the com-
 mandant), and transferring the entire BSF unit. The Government also ordered a ju-
 dicial inquiry into the incident. This effort was hampered by a reported militant
 order to witnesses to boycott the investigation. As ofyrear's end, the judge assigned
 to the probe had yet to complete his investigation. BSF troops were accused of fiing
 without warning on an October 22 demonstration in the militant stronghold of"
 Bijbehara, leaving 41 dead and 76 inured, according to the Peoples Union for Civil
 Liberty. Despite government claims that the security forces were ambushed by mili-
 tants, only one BSF subinspector was injured. The Government subsequently an-
 nounced two official investigations and a separate inquiry by the National Human
 Rights Commission into these incidents.
 There were other examples of BSF personnel using excessive force against civil-
 ians. In mid-April, at least 16 people were killed and 260 shops and houses were
 gutted when fire swept through the Lal Chowk area of Central Srinagar. Itap-
 p eared the blaze began when Kashmir demonstrators set fire to an abandone
 bunker. However, press reports indicate the BSF troops responded by firing ran-
 
 
 1346
 domly at demonstrators and setting fire to homes and businesses in neighboring
 areas. An official inquiry was announced, but the results were never released. In
 July a BSF soldier shot and killed an 8-year-old boy when he reportedly mistook
 a kitchen utensil the boy was holding for a grenade. When the enraged parents ran
 at the BSF men, they too were shot and killed.
 Kashmiri militant groups were also guilty of serious human rights abuses. In ad-
 dition to political killings detailed in Section L.a., militants committed extortion and
 carried out acts of random terror that left hundreds of Kashmiris dead. Two people
 were killed and three injured on May 11 when militants reportedly fired a rocket
 at the government headquarters in Srinagar. Twenty-five people were injured on
 May 3 when a bomb planted by alleged militants exploded in a Jammu theater. On
 September 15, a bomb reportedly planted by militants exploded in a Hindu temple
 in Jammu, killing one person and injuring eight others. Between January 1990 and
 July 1993, the Government claimed militants killed 1,817 civilians.
 Militant groups were accused of executing captured soldiers and informers by
 strapping grenades to their bodies and setting them off in public. In addition, mili-
 tants were implicated in dozens of killings involving rival separatist factions. The
 Government accused the Hizb-Ul Mujahideen group of responsibility for the March
 31 execution of Dr. Abdul Ahad Guru, a leading Kashmiri human rights monitor.
 On March 22, a Delhi paper carried a report that Dr. Guru was being used by the
 Home Ministry as a channel to the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. Ten days
 later, his bullet-ridden body was found on the outskirts of Srinagar.
 Kashmiri militants continued to use kidnapings of prominent businessmen and
 Zoliticians to seek the release of detained militants, sow terror, and extort funds.
 Ater a hiatus of several months, kidnapings in Jammu and Kashmir climbed sharp-
 ly during the first part of 1993. Among those held were a former Member of Par-
 liament, the director of the State Tourism Development Corporation, and a univer-
 sity professor. The Home Ministry reported that 22 government employees were kid-
 naped during the period from April to June. Press reports indicate that abductions
 continued at a similar pace throughout the year.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution protects these freedoms, and
 they are, with some limitations, exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a
 wide variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Indian newspapers and maga-
 zines regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrong-
 doing, and the press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived
 government lapses.
 The Press Council of India is a statutory body of journalists, publishers academ-
 ics and politicians, traditionally chaired by a sitting or former Supreme 6ourt jus-
 tice. Designed to be a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates com-
 plaints of irresponsible journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This
 code includes not publishing articles or details that might incite caste or communal
 violence. The council publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes to have
 broken the code of conduct, but its findings, while noted by the press community,
 carry no legal weight and have little influence on journalists.
 National television and radio are government monopolies and are frequently ac-
 cused by opposition politicians and the print media of manipulating the news to the
 benefit of the Government. However, international satellite television is not
 censored or otherwise controlled by the Government and is widely distributed in
 middle-class neighborhoods via cable. It is gradually eroding the Government's mo-
 nopoly on electronic media.
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict publication of
 sensitive stories, but this is sometimes interpreted broadly by the Government to
 suppress criticism of its policies. For instance, in Punjab, despite the decline of mili-
 tancy, the Government occasionally impounded issues of newspapers because of
 what it considered objectionable reporting.
 The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remained in effect in Jammu
 and Kashmir throughout 1993. Under the Act, a district magistrate may restrict the
 press from carrying material resulting in "incitement to murder" or "any act of vio-
 lence." Punishment permitted under the Act includes seizure of newspapers and
 printing presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar regu arly car-
 ried militant press releases attacking the Government and reported in detail on al-
 leged human rights abuses. The Government has taken no steps to prevent Kash-
 miri papers from printing militant press releases. Reporters were subject to harass-
 ment by security forces. On August 5, three journalists in Srinagar were beaten
 with batons and rifle butts by BSF troops who objected to their coverage of an oppo-
 sition rally. In Assam, the Government arrested an editor and several reporters in
 
 
 1347
 
 connection with articles they published about ULFA militant activities. Journalists
 and academics who gathered in the state capital on February 20 to protest these
 arrests were met witha police baton charge in which 25 people were reportedly in-
 jured.
 In Tamil Nadu, the state government applied intense pressure to the opposition
 press as relations between the state government and Delhi deteriorated. Stat offi-
 cials frequently used "defamation" charges in the courts to intimidate editors and
 journalists. In July the state government withdrew police protection from a Madras
 weekly; shortly thereafter, the newspaper was ransacked. An official investigation
 was launched immediately after the attack. There has never been a determination
 of responsibility. The Government permitted foreign journalists to travel freely in
 Kashmir, meet with militant leaders, and file reports on government abuses.
 On January 31 militants in Punjab assassinated a reporter for the Hind
 Samachar Ncws droup. The Babbar Khalsa International claimed responsibility,
 saying it would not tolerate journalists who projected a negative image of militancy.
 InKashmir, rival militant groups threatened journalists and editors and even im-
 oed tbans on some publications. Mlitants burned the residence of an
 anguage newspaper editor who refused to carry their press release. In Sep-
 tember the paper suspended publication citing militant harassment.
 Journalists in the western states of Mraharashtra and Gujarat were subject to reg-
 ular harassment by Hindu radicals representing nongovernment political groups. On
 August 18, members of the Shiv Sena Organization assaulted the editor of a Bom-
 bay newspaper when he criticized the Shiv Sena newspaper at a journalists' semi-
 nar. The same day, members of a Hindu labor organization ransacked the office of
 a Bombay tabloid and beat up its senior reporter. In May the editor of a Gujarat
 newspaper was stabbed to death by unidentified attackers. Six months earlier, the
 local Shiv Sena chief had publicly threatened the editor's life, after he published edi-
 trials critical of the group.
 A government censorship board reviews films before they are licensed for distribu-
 tion. Board members are appointed by the Government, through the Ministry of In-
 formation and Broadcasting. The board deletes material deemed offensive to public
 morals or communal sentiment. Producers of video news magazines are also re-
 quired to clear their products with the boeard, which occasionally censors parts of
 stories that pt bthe Government in a bad light. There is a mechanism to appeal the
 board's decision which sometimes results in a censorship ruling being overturned.
 Indians enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range af views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are em powered to accredit local private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assocation.-The Constitution protects the
 right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations, and these rights are
 generally respected in practice.
 Local governments ordinarily respect the right to prtest peacefully, but authori-
 ties sometimes requirepermits and notification prior to hl ding parades or dem-
 onstrations. Under the Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC), the authorities may order
 the dispersal of any assembly of five or more people that is likely to cause a disturb-
 ance of the peace. The Code allows the authorities to ban such assemblies prospec-
 tively for a period up to 2 months. At times of civil tension, authorities may ban
 public assemblies or impose a curfew. In February the Government used previsions
 of the Criminal Procedure Code to ban a large raily in the capital by the Hindu
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and to arrest those defying the ban. The BJP claimed
 about 50,000 people were arr-ested nationwide, most of whom were released within
 a few days. In October and December, the State government in Punjab arrested over
 1,000 opposition party members in an effort to prevent a prtest march to Delhi and
 a proposed series of sit-ins at district headquarters buildings.
 The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967 empowers the Government to
 ban organizations whose activities promote communal hatred. Five religion-based
 organizations (three Hindu and two Muslim) were banned under the Act in reaction
 to the destruction of a mosque in Ayohya in December 1992, but enforcement of
 the bans was lax. A special tribunaloverturned the ban on three of the organiza-
 tions in June. The Government restricted freedom of assembly in Srinagar and
 other parts of Jammu and Kashmir by placing them under sporadic curfew during
 much of the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-India is a secular state in which all faiths enjoy freedom
 of worship. Government policy does not favor any religious group. Nevertheless, ten-
 sions over religious differences pose challenges to the secular foundation of the In-
 dian State.
 Hindu-Muslim tensions remained high in the aftermath of the December 1992
 Ayodhya crisis. Communal riots in Bombay during early January left at least 550
 
 
 1348
 
 people dead and 2,500 injured. Witnesses said some of those killed were stoned to
 death or burned alive. In a report published in August, the Indian People's Human
 Rights Tribunal, led by two retired high court judges, characterized the riots as 'an
 organized crime perpetrated by communalists in connivance with the police.' The
 Tribunal's report, supported by over 2,000 depositions, asserts that the police were
 either passive bystanders or openly sided with Hindu mobs. Press accounts state
 that the overwhelming majority of those killed or injured in the riots were Muslims.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 cused or convicted of crime. While specifically designed to deal with Sikh places of
 worship in the Punjab, the law technically applies to all religious sites.
 Indian religious organizations may maintain communications with coreligionists
 abroad, but financial contributions from overseas are regulated by the Home Min-
 istry and may not be used to finance publishing. There is no national law to bar
 proselytizing by Indian Christians, but laws in some states discourage them from
 practicing openly.
 Foreign missionaries can generally renew their visas, but since the mid-1960's the
 Government has refused to admit new resident missionaries. Those who arrive now
 do so as tourists, and stay for short periods. As of January 1992, there were 1,611
 registered foreign missionaries in all of India. The sharp rise of conversions among
 tribals of the northeast continued to create tensions; as in the past, state officials
 refused to issue permits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter some north-
 eastern states.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Indian citizens enjoy full freedom of movement within the country, ex-
 cept in certain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are re-
 quired. Travel abroad is generally not restricted, but there are exceptions. Under
 Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engage outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India." This provision is occasionally used to bar govern-
 ment critics (especially advocates of Sikh independence) from traveling abroad.
 Millions of people of Indian origin live abroad. Indian citizens may emigrate with-
 out restriction.
 Although India is not a signatory to the U.N. Convention and Protocol on the Sta-
 tus of Refugees, the Government follows the general principles laid down in that
 document, including opposition to turning back refugees at the border. Those whom
 it recognizes as refugees are placed in camps (Chakmas, Sri Lankan Tamils) or re-
 settlement areas (Tibetans). Tibetans have been accommodated by the Indian au-
 thorities since the 1950's. Afghans, Burmese, and other nationalities are neither de-
 ported nor recognized as refugees. Instead, they receive renewable residence permits
 and are recognized as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) or are ignored.
 Bangladeshis formerly received the same treatment, but as domestic political
 pressure increased during 1991 and 1992, the Indian government began to crack
 down on their entry. During 1991, according to government statistics, 53,733 illegal
 immigrants from Bangladesh were apprehended on the border and turned back.
 Government officials say there is no firm estimate of the number of Bangladeshis
 living illegally in India, but estimates range from 2 to 15 million. In addition, India
 is home to over 54,000 Chakma tribal people who fled the Chittagong Hill tracts
 of Bangladesh during the 1980's. Indian and Bangladeshi officials meeting in May
 reached agreement for expeditious repatriation of the Chakmas. Press reports assert
 that rations and cash assistance to the camps in Tripura were reduced in a bid to
 encourage repatriation under this agreement. As of the end of the year, however,
 there had been no discernible repatriation.
 About 80,000 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka were living in 131 government-run
 camps, and up to 100,000 more were settled with friends and relatives throughout
 Tamil Nadu. The state government, using central government resources, provided
 shelter and subsidized food to those in the camps. In May the Tamil Nadu govern-
 ment banned all NGO assistance to the camps in an apparent effort to encourage
 repatriation. About 7,000 Tamils were repatriated voluntarily during August and
 September under an Indian government program monitored by the UNHCR. India
 also provided humanitarian assistance to over 100,000 Tibetan refugees in
 Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and elsewhere in India.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Indian citizens freely exercise their right to change their government. India has
 a democratic, parliamentary system or government with representatives elected
 under universal adult suffrage; the voting age is 18.
 Multiparty elections are held regularly at local, state, and national levels. A Par-
 liament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elections or under constitu-
 tionally defined emergency situations. State governments are elected at regular in-
 tervals except in states under President's rule.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 gency in any state in the event of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
 Similarly, President's rule-rule from the center-may be declared in the event of
 a collapse of a state's constitutional machinery. President's rule remained in effect
 in Jammu and Kashmir throughout the year. It was lifted in the states of Uttar
 Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachel Pradesh, and Rajasthan following elections in
 1993 and declared in the northeastern state of Manipur on December 31.
 Under the Constitution, seats are reserved for scheduled tribes and scheduled
 castes in Parliament and state legislatures in proportion to their population. Politi-
 cal parties and tribal groups work to advance the interests of indigenous people and
 on several occasions have extracted specific concessions from the Government.
 Women account for about 7 percent of the members of Parliament. They hold or
 have held a variety of senior positions, including Deputy Speaker of the upper house
 and Prime Minister. By law, women are guaranteed 30 percent of seats in all local
 elected bodies (municipal councils and village panchayats). Some states have dis-
 cussed the idea of a similar reservation for state assemblies. A government report
 stated that 40 to 50 percent of women exercised their franchise in the 1991 national
 election.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent Indian human rights organizations are active and vocal. They in-
 clude the People's Union for Civil Liberties, the People's Union for Democratic
 Rights, the South Asia Human Rights Documentation Center, Citizens for Democ-
 racy, and numerous regional organizations. These groups investigate specific allega-
 tions of human rights abuses and publish reports on their findings, which are often
 highly critical of the Government and militant groups. All of India, including Kash-
 mir and Punjab, is open to Indian investigators.
 The central Government is generally tolerant of dissent. Nonetheless, human
 rights monitors have been targeted by the police for arrest and harassment. In addi-
 tion, a number of monitors were the victims of killings, some of which may have
 been politically motivated. Dr. Farooq Ashai, a prominent Kashmiri orthopedic sur-
 geon and specialist in the 'reatment of torture victims, died on February 18 when
 he was caught in the line of fire from a security forces' bunker. Five weeks later
 Dr. Abdul Ahad Guru, a leading Kashmiri human rights activist, was abducted and
 killed by unidentified gunmen (see Section 1.g.). Another Kashmiri human rights
 figure, Hirdai Nath Wanchoo, was killed under similar circumstances in December
 1992. Results of the official investigation were never released; however, according
 to press accounts the Government investigators blamed the Jamait-ul-Mujahideen
 for Wanchoo's death. Since Wanchoo was a vocal critic of security force abuses, most
 Kashmiris found the accusation not credible and accused the Government of the kill-
 int  Punjab, the police harassed, intimidated, and occasionally arrested human
 rights monitors. In one case, a Sikh human rights monitor was held without charge
 for 3 weeks, then released with instructions to say nothing about his time in police
 custody. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, hundreds of activists and local residents at-
 tempting to block the Narmada Dam project were arrested and subjected t. police
 intimidation; some alleged they were tortured by police. Doctors in Delhi who treat-
 ed victims of communal riots in December 1992 and documented charges of official
 involvement were later subject to harassment by police investigators. Hospital ad-
 ministrators reportedly received requests from the Home Ministry directing them to
 seek explanations from some doctors who were involved in an NGO investigation of
 the Delhi riots. The doctors were associated with the Delhi Medicos and Scientists
 Forum, which published a report on the Delhi riots that accused the Delhi police
 of communal bias and excessive use of force.
 In May the Government introduced authorizing legislation for a national human
 rights commission. The bill was criticized by Indian human rights groups, which
 claimed the commission would be dominated by government servants, barred from
 investigating allegations of abuse involving the army and paramilitary forces, and
 
 
 1350
 provided with inadequate investigatory staff. A Presidential Ordinance issued on
 September 29 and passed by the Parliament in December revised the Commission
 to give rater representation to retired jurists but left it with a limited mandate
 to investigate security force abuses In December the Commission instructed state
 governments to inform it within 24 hours of any custodial death. If an incident is
 not reported on time, the Commission will assume there was a cover-up attempt.
 The central Government remains sensitive to international allegations of human
 rights violations. However, in July the Home Ministry reversed its on tanding pol-
 icy of barring investigating teams from Amnesty International and other inter-
 national human rights organizations. Although no such investigations occurred in
 1993, the Government indicated the timing of such visits would be determined in
 consultations with the central Government and the concerned state government.
 The Government also reached agreement with the ICRC for a seminar on inter-
 national humanitarian law to be held in Delhi in early 1994. In August a four-mem-
 ber delegation from the International Commission of Jurists traveled to Kashmir as
 guests of the Government and met with a range of lawyers and human rights mon-
 itors.
 Indian human rights groups say the Government seldom responds to inquiries
 from U.N. bodies such as the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Dis-
 appearances and the Special Rapporteur on Torture. The official review performed
 by the Human Rights Committee of India's 1989 Report to the Committee produced
 several recommendations for policy changes to strengthen the protection of human
 rights in India, including revision of India's special security legislation which could
 violate provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 guage deeply divide Indian society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination,
 these differences are frequently manifest in social and cultural practices that have
 a profoundly discriminatory impact.
 Women.-India has an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women,
 including the Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, and
 the Sati (Widow Burning) Prevention Act. Deeply rooted traditions, often tied to re-
 ligious or social practice, lead to lax and sometimes no enforcement of these laws,
 especially in rural areas. Female bondage and forced prostitution remain common
 in parts of Indian society.
 According to an Indian government study, which is borne out by press reporting,
 violence against women-including molestation, rape, kidnaping, and wife murder
 ("dowry deaths")-has increased over the past decade. Domestic violence in the con-
 text of dowry disputes is a particularly serious problem. In the typical dowry dis-
 pute, a groom's family will harass a woman they believe has not provided a suffi-
 cient dowry. Occasionally, this harassment ends in the woman's death, which family
 members often try to pass off as a suicide or kitchen accident. Although most
 "dowry deaths" involve lower middle-class families, the phenomenon crosses both
 caste and religious lines. The Government's strategy to combat violence against
 women emphasizes education and legislation to stiffen punishment for abuse. A Na-
 tional Commission for Women, established in January 1992, investigates cases of
 abuse and reports to the Government on measures to improve the status of women
 in Indian society. The Commission has publicized several cases of sexual harass-
 ment and physical abusn, but is criticized by women's groups for acting in a politi-
 cized manner.
 Government figures show a total of 4,785 dowry deaths during 1992, down about
 7 percent from 1991. Under a 1986 amendment to the Indian Penal Code, in every
 unnatural death of a woman in the first 7 years of marriage where it is proved she
 was subject to harassment, the court must presume her husband or in-laws were
 responsible. In such cases, police procedures require that the investigation be con-
 ducted by an officer of deputy superintendent rank or above and that a postmortem
 be performed by a team of two or more doctors.
 In March three family members were sentenced to capital punishment in a dowry
 death case in Aligarh. However, such convictions are rare. One case highlighted by
 the Indian press took 4  years to reach a preliminary hearing where a judge was
 to7 decide if there was sufficient evidence to try the victim's husband and in-laws
 for murder. Moreover, lawyers handling dowry cases complain that judges and pros-
 ecutors (usually men) are uninterested in cases of domestic violence and are suscep-
 tible to bribes.
 Despite several provisions in the Constitution promising equality before the law
 and prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, the personal laws of several
 
 
 1351
 Indian religious communities provide for legally sanctioned gender discrimination.
 Under Islamic personal law, a Muslim husband may divorce his wife unilaterally;
 there is no such provision for women. Islamic law also provides for a man to have
 up to four wives, while polyandry is prohibited. These provisions have sparked de-
 bate within India's Muslim community and have been loudly criticized by some
 Hindu groups as examples of preferential treatment given to Muslims.
 Existing laws relating to asset and land ownership give women little control over
 land use, retention, or sale. The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance
 rights for Hindu women, but in practice married daughters are seldom given a share
 in parental property. Islamic personal law, while recognizing the right to inherit-
 ance of both sons and daughters, specifies that a daughter's share should be only
 one-half of a son's. Under the tribal land system, notably in Bihar, tribal women
 do not have the right to own land; the traditional practice of putting women to
 death there as "witches" is closely linked to the denial of property rights.
 India has thousands of grassroots organizations working for social justice and eco-
 nomic advancement of women. These efforts are usually supported by the Govern-
 ment, despite strong resistance from traditionally privileged groups. This resistance
 is illustrated by a case in September 1992 in which a women's rights activist in
 rural Rajasthan was gang -raped by men who objected to her advocacy against child
 marriage. Although the case was referred to the Central Bureau of Investigation,
 as of late October the five men accused by the victim had not been arrested.
 Children.-The Government places a high priority on children's health and wel-
 fare, but its resources are often overwhelmed by demographic pressures. A recent
 government report estimated the population under 6 years of age at 130 million. A
 arment of Women and        ldDevelopment functions under the Human Re.
 sources Ministry. The Department's 1992-93 budget accounted for about 0.44 per-
 cent of total gvernment expenditures. India has a large  pulation of street chil-
 dren, with peinaps as many as 100,000 in major cities such as Delhi, Bombay, and
 Calcutta. Child prostitution in these cities is rampant. Child marriage, a traditional
 practice in northern India, was outlawed by the Child Marriage Restraint (Amend-
 ment) Act of 1976. This law raises the age of marriage for giris from 15 to 18, but
 enforcement is uneven. (See Section 6.d. on child labor.)
 Because of a strong cultural preference for male offspring, sex-determination tests
 (amniocentesis and sonogram) are widely used, resulting in a disproportionate num-
 ber of abortions of female fetuses. Human rights gups estimate that at least
 10,000 cases of female infanticide occur each year throughout India, primarily in
 poor rural areas. Female foeticide and infanticide have produced a steady decline
 in the ratio of females to males in the Indian population. Tis figure has gone from
 972 per 1 000 at the turn of the century to 955 per 1,000 in 1981 and 927 per 1,000
 in 1991. Parents often give priority in both health care and nutrition to male infants
 over females. Women's rights groups point out that the burden of providing an ade-
 quate dowry for girls is one factor in making female births less desirable. Although
 abin or taking dowry is theoretically illegal under the Dowry Prohibition Act of
 1961, it is still widely practiced.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specify historically disadvantaged scheduled castes and tribes which are enti-
 tled to affrnmative action in employment and other benefits. Scheduled tribes con-
 stitute about 8 percent of the Indian population and scheduled castes about 16 per-
 cent. Scheduled castes and tribes benefit from targeted development funds, govern-
 ment hiring quotas, and special training programs. However, spaces in national edu-
 cation institutions reserved for tribals and lower castes are often taken by more in-
 fluential  ople from other backgrounds. A national commission on scheduled castes
 and cheduled tribes reports annually on the status of tribal peoples and inves-
 tigates specific complaints about deprivation of rights of scheduled castes and tribes.
 The seven-member commission was established through a constitutional amendment
 in March 1992. Although the commission was given the powers of a civil court to
 call witnesses and investigate abuse, it has yet to issue a report and has had no
 impact thus far.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 rovided additional legal protections for these disadvantaged groups. However, it
 has not checked atrocities committed against them. Scheduled castes and scheduled
 tribes continued to be the victims of murder, rape, robbery, burning, and beating
 because of their status. The Welfare Ministry told Parliament in 1993 that in the
 states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Delhi, not a single trial in-
 volving atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes had been com.eted since
 1986.
 Although the practice of untouchability was in theory outlawed by the Constitu-
 tion and the 1955 Civil Rights Act, it remains very much a part of life in India.

 The resulting intercaste violence claims hundreds of lives each year. In Karnataka,
 2 people were killed and 51 injured when police fired on a precession of dalits (un-
 touchables) protesting against atrocities and discrimination by higher caste Hindus.
 The Innerline Regulations, enacted by the British in 1873, still provide the basis
 for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of northeastern India.
 These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other states, from
 going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber, wax, ivory, or
 other forest products may be carried out of the protected areas without prior author.
 izaticn. No outsiders are allowed to hold land in the tribal areas without approval
 from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 are ofen ignored. There has been encroachment (including by illegal immigrants
 from Bangladesh) on tribal land in almost all the states of eastern India, and busi-
 nessmen, flouting the Innerline Regulations, have taken out forest and mineral re-
 sources. These violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding
 protection of land and property rights, including the Jharkhand movement in Bihar
 and Orissa and the Bodo movement in Assam.
 Religious Minorities.-There is no obvious discrimination against religious minori-
 ties in civil rights areas such as jobs, housing, and education.
 Pople with Disabilities.-India has a long history of concern for its disabled. The
 country's first NGO dedicated to rehabilitation of the blind was created nearly a
 century ago. With over 12 million Indians suffering from physical disabilities, ac-
 cording to the Government, demand for services often exceeds supply.
 The Government's Ministry of Welfare has principal responsibility for programs
 for the disabled and targets comprehensive rehabilitation services to India's rural
 population through 16 district centers. A national rehabilitation plan commits the
 Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each of India's more than 400 dis-
 tricts, but services are now concentrated in urban areas. The Government reserves
 3 percent of positions in official offices and parastatal enterprises for people with
 visual, hearing, or orthopedic disabilities. Other support programs include: special
 railway fares; assistance for purchase and fitting of aids and appliances; customs
 exemptions under bilateral agreements for donated rehabilitation supplies; edu-
 cation allowances; and scholarships. The Welfare Ministry also provides substantial
 funding to severai hundred NGO s involved in rehabilitation and training of special
 educators.
 National education policy emphasizes the mainstreaming of handicapped children
 and stipulates that all educational and vocational programs must provide for the
 special needs of people with disabilities. The Department of Education provides
 funding to state governments and NGO's to install necessary facilities. Although the
 Government is developing legislation modeled on the Americans with Disabilities
 Act, there is currently no requirement for provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution uarantees the right of association.
 Workers are guaranteed the right to form and join unions of their own choosing
 without prior authorization, including in export processing zones (EPZ's). Several
 trade union centrals also exist. Most trade unions have some tie to a national or
 local political party. However, trade unions stress their formal independence from
 political parties and, on occasion, differ from their respective political allies on labor-
 related issues. According to available data, somewhat less than 25 percent of work-
 ers in the modern sector-roughly 2 percent of the total work force-are organized.
 Trade unions have the legally protected right to strike, but public sector unions
 mustgive at least 14 days' notice prior to striking. Some states ave laws requiring
 workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to ive prior strike notice. The Essen-
 tial Services Maintenance Act allows the central Government to ban strikes and re-
 quires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries. Legal mechanisms
 exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope of this
 Act. In 1992 (the last year for which data are available) there were 894 strikes. The
 Trade Unions Act of 1926 specifically prohibits employers from taking retribution
 against striking workers.
 Human rights abuses against nationally organized unions or unionized workers
 have generally not been a problem in India. However, as with other peripheral
 groups in Indian society, unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers cannot
 always avail themselves of protections and rights guaranteed by law. The investiga-
 tion into the 1991 murder of Shankar Guha Niyogi, a tribal union leader, is yet to
 be completed. The judicial inquiry that was to investigate the killing of more than
 18 of Niyogi's followers during a protest sitdown in July 1992 has not yet com-
 
 
 1353
 
 menced. In June a "peoples tribunal" inquiry held state government authorities re-
 sponsible for the massacre.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations. For ex-
 ample, the Indian National Trade Union Congress is affiliated with the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions aCFTU) and the All India Trade
 Union Congress (AITUC) is affiliated with the formerly Soviet-controlled World Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions (WFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize (includ-
 ing protection against antiunion discrimination) and to bargain collectively has ex-
 isted in Indian laws for decades. Trade unions carry out these activities independ-
 ently and without government or, in general, employer interference. Although ham-
 pered by long delays and a severe backlog of unresolved cases, a system of special-
 ized labor courts exists to hear and adjudicate labor-related complaints.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in the organized industrial sector, and trade unions are usually vigorous in defend-
 ing worker interests in this process. When collective bargaining fails to establish lo-
 cally equitable wage levels, the Government may set up tripartite boards, including
 trade umion representation, to determine them. The Trade Union Act prohibits dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers, and employers may be penal-
 ized if they discriminate. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the 1926 Act
 and reinstated workers dismissed for union activity.
 There are seven EPZ's in India. Physical access to the EPZ's ordinarily is limited
 to those who work in them, and union organizers are not exempt from these limita-
 tions. While workers in EP~Z's have the legal right to oranize and bargain collec-
 tively, trade union activity is rare. Women workers constitute the bulk of the work
 force in the EPTs.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitutionprhibits forced
 labor, and legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of"bonded labor."
 A Supreme Court decision defined "forced labor" as work at less than the minimum
 wage (minimum wages are usually set by the states, not the central Government).
 Under this definition, "forced labor" is widespread throughout India, particularly in
 rural areas. "Bonded labor," the result of a private contractual relationship whereby
 a worker incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt
 (plus extensive interest), is illegal but prevalent. While violations are punishable by
 imprisonment for up to 3 years, individual state labor departments are responsible
 for law enforcement, and prosecutions are rare.
 Based on reports from the states, the Government estimates that between enact-
 ment of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31,
 1993 approximately 251,424 bonded workers had been released, of whom 223,108
 had teen "rehabilitated" by March 31, 1992. Other sources, including the Bandhua
 Mukti Morcha and the Gandhi Peace Foundation, have estimated that those re-
 leased represent only one-tenth of the total number of bonded laborers in India. Pri-
 vate and autonomous social organizations, such as trade unions, the Council for Ad-
 vancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Technology, and Action for Welfare and
 Awakening Rural Environments, attempt to identify cases of bondage and pursue
 them with the appropriate officials. However, even with better coordination and in-
 creased resources to overcome the complicated jurisdictional division between
 central and state governments, the eradication of bonded labor is proceeding slowly.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Article 24 of the Constitution jro-
 hibits employment of children under 14 years of age in factories, mines, or ot er
 hazardous employment; Article 45 encourages states to provide free and compulsory
 education for all children up to the age of 14. A law passed in 1986 banned the em-
 ployment of children under 14 in hazardous occupations (such as glass making, fre-
 works match factories, and carpet weaving) and regulated their employment in oth-
 ers. The Factories Act of 1948 limits the working hours of children between the ages
 of 15 and 18 to 5 hours per day. However, these constitutional and legal provisions
 have had little impact on the use of child labor. Government statistics put the total
 number of child workers at 17.5 million in 1985. The International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO) put the number at 44 million, while NGO's cite a still higher figure of
 55 million. As in the case of bonded labor, the central Government often faults di-
 vided jurisdiction with state governments for its inability to curb the practice. The
 continuing prevalence of child labor can be attributed to social acceptance, a wide-
 spread official belief that poverty causes child labor, and the failure of the state gov-
 ernments to make primary school education compulsory.
 Two German-funded International Labor Organization (ILO) projects begun in
 1992 aeek to end child labor in the formal sector and reduce it elsewhere through
 promotion of primary school and vocational training alternatives. Some 25 activities
 of different NGO's have been approved under the projects thus far. The Tamil Nadu
 
 
 1354
 state government and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched a
 joint program to eradicate child labor by promoting primary education, with state
 authorities pledging to enact legislation making it compulsory.
 Certain industries, especialy carpet weaving, have expanded their presence in the
 export market by exploiting the low cost of child labor. The South Asian Coalition
 on Child Servitude (SACCS) promoted consumer education campaigns in the United
 States and Germany (the world's two largest markets for South Asian carpets) as
 well as other European nations and lobbied for the selective boycott of carpets pro-
 duced by child labor. SACCS' efforts induced a significant portion of the industry
 in India to join hands with NGO's and the Indo-German Export Promotion Project
 to formulate a certification process for carpets made without child labor. SACCS has
 lobbied states to enact universal, compulsory primary school education laws and
 force political leaders, irrespective of their party affiliation, to take a stand on the
 issue.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the "unorganized sector," each state sets
 separate minimum wages for agricultural workers, which are not well enforced.
 While the basic minimum wage varies according to the state and sector of industry,
 most "organized" workers receive much more than the minimum wage, especially
 when legislatively mandated bonuses and other benefits are included. The minimum
 wage is considered adequate only for the most minimal standard of living.
 The Factories Act established an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, a 24-hour
 rest period each week and various standards for working conditions. These stand-
 ards are generally eniorced and accepted in the modern industrial sectors but tend
 not to be observed in the more extensive older, smaller, and less economically robust
 industries. State governments are responsible for enforcement of the Factories Act.
 However, the large number of industries covered by a small cadre of factory inspec-
 tors and their limited training and susceptibility to bribery make for lax enforce-
 ment. Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely in general
 neither state nor central government resources for inspection and enforcement of
 standards are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's. Workers
 are not guaranteed the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment. The ILO, in conjunction with the Inter-
 national Social Security Administration and the Indian National Safety Council,
 held its 13th World Congress on Occupational Safety and Health in New Delhi in
 April. This was the first time this ILO Congress was held in a developing country.
 Although the congress evoked a good response from foreign and Indian practitioners
 in this field, it failed to generate interest among India's general public.
