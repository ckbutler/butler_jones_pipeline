 HAITI
 The attempt to establish democracy in Haiti after 30 years of
 dictatorship was thwarted by violence and murder on election
 day, November 29, 1987. The November elections had been
 designed to provide a peaceful and orderly transition of power
 from the current caretaker military-dominated National
 Governing Council (CNG) to a freely elected constitutional
 civilian government. However, on election day, squads of
 armed men, many of them believed to be followers of the ousted
 dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier, attacked polling places
 throughout Haiti, killing at least 34 people. There is
 evidence that some Haitian military personnel participated in
 the carnage on election day. The independently appointed
 Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), charged under the
 Constitution with overseeing the electoral process, cancelled
 elections to avoid further bloodshed. In violation of the
 Constitution the CNG subsequently dissolved the CEP, repealed
 the electoral law, and appointed another electoral council of
 its own choosing. The CNG then scheduled new elections for
 January 17, 1988 to be followed by the installation of an
 elected civilian president on February 7, 1988. In the
 opinion of many Haitians the criteria necessary to make these
 elections credible have not been fulfilled.
 After the ouster of the Duvalier Government, the CNG was
 established to steer the country through the transition
 period. This ruling council is currently composed of Lt.
 General Henri Namphy, Major-General Williams Regala (two
 original members), and a civilian, Luc B. Hector.
 The Haitian Armed Forces (Forces Armdes D'Haiti--FAD'H)
 perform both defense and police functions, as an integrated
 organization of navy, army, air force, and police elements.
 The military came under criticism due to involvement of
 security force elements in human rights abuses and the
 Government's failure to investigate or prosecute these cases.
 Haiti's most pressing problem remains its systemic economic
 distress. The poorest and most densely populated country in
 the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is plagued by malnutrition,
 infectious disease, and illiteracy. Soil erosion,
 deforestation, and periods of drought afflict the agricultural
 sector. The dire poverty of the majority of the population
 affects all aspects of Haitian life. Although expectations
 were raised and hopes were high following the fall of the
 Duvalier dictatorship, most Haitians still live in conditions
 of abject economic misery.
 The human rights record of the CNG, even prior to the November
 electionq, was mixed. The major accomplishment of 1987 was a
 referendum in which 42 percent of the population
 overwhelmingly approved a new Constitution establishing the
 legal basis for democratic institutions in Haiti. The
 Constitution provides for legislative, judicial, and executive
 branches of government headed by an elected President who
 appoints a Prime Minister; a bicameral legislature
 representing the nine regions of the country; and fundamental
 rights and freedoms for all Haitians.
 Violence erupted in June and July as many Haitians perceived
 the CNG's promulgation of an election law restricting the
 powers of the constitutionally mandated independent electoral
 council as an attempt to subvert or circumvent the new
 Constitution. Weeks of violent antigovernment street
 demonstrations resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, some
 
 
 511
 HAITI
 the result of inappropriate crowd control actions by Haitian
 security forces. Violence again rose steadily several weeks
 prior to the November elections, and the CNG failed to stop
 the violence or to provide the necessary security for a fair
 and orderly-election.
 Following the end of the Duvalier'dictatorship Haitians
 enjoyed a freedom of expression and association which had not
 been possible under that regime. Political parties ranging
 across the political spectrum organized, recruited members and
 presented candidates for public office. A vigorous press
 frequently and openly criticized the Government. Since the
 aborted November elections, some political groups and
 journalists have toned down criticism and political activity
 in apparent fear of government reprisal. At the time of the
 aborted elections two radio stations often critical of the CNG
 were temporarily put out of commission by vandals and
 arsonists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is substantial evidence that elements of the Haitian
 military were involved in the killings which took place on
 election day, November 29, 1987. Several reliable
 eyewitnesses have reported seeing uniformed soldiers, in army
 vehicles, participating in-the electiod carnage. It does not
 appear that the violence was directed at any specific
 individuals but rather was designed to prevent voters from'
 participating in the'elections. The Government, which failed
 in its promise to provide security for voters on election day,
 appointed a commission to investigate the incidents. However,
 there have been no arrests or punishments stemming from the
 November 29 killings. There is widespread skepticism that the
 investigation will'yield significant results.
 In June and July, military and police forces were responsible
 for *anumber of deaths during demonstrations over political
 issues. Approximately 40 people were killed and 70 wounded
 during antigbvernment demonstrations. There has been no
 government or independent investigation into.any of these
 .deaths and no reliable number or list of names of those killed
 has been published. There are several well-documented cases
 of deaths involving the security forces. Soldiers fired
 indiscriminately into a group of taunting youngsters on July
 4, killing a 13-year-old boy. During an antigovernment
 demonstration on July 29 which most eyewitnesses claim was
 progressing peacefully, a small group of soldiers fired
 randomly into the crowd. Nine people are believed to have
 been killed. On August 1 police shot and killed 3 people in a
 crowd which had earlier attacked the driver of a truck
 carrying cerpses from the Central Hospital to a burial ground.
 In other cases, police and military personnel, acting in an
 unofficial capacity, were responsible for numerous deaths. In
 July an off-duty policeman fired into a 'crowd of peaceful
 protestors, wounding six and reportedly killing one woman.
 The identity of the policeman is known; however, no
 investigation or prosecution has occurred.
 There is evidence that security forces premeditatedly
 targeted, or colluded in the death in October of politician
 
 
 512
 HAITI
 speech in front of the Port-au-Prince police station.
 Eyewitness accounts contradicted the official police version
 of the killing and indicated that Volel's attackers emerged
 from police headquarters. It is not known whether his
 assailants were members of the security forces or were acting
 independently with the collusion of some police elements.
 Although the police publicly stated they were pursuing an
 investigation, no results were ever released.
 Less information is available regarding the deaths of
 presidential candidate Louis Eugene Athis and two of his
 colleagues in early August. Athis and his associates were
 killed by local peasants who accused them of being
 Communists. Although the Information Ministry stated that
 four locals had been arrested in the case and that an
 investigation was being prepared, the status of the four
 detainees is unknown, and no report was ever released.
 Other unexplained killings have been attributed to hit squads
 or to men in green uniforms, who are accused of causing a
 "reign of terror" throughout the country. The arrests in
 February and September of two gangs revealed that, although
 gang members wore uniforms, none were members of the military.
 They and others perpetrating these murders and many lesser
 crimes appear to be common criminals, ex-Tonton Macoutes
 (members of the outlawed volunteers for National Security, the
 Duvalier family's brutal militia) and military personnel
 acting independently to take advantage of the chaotic
 situation, particularly in rural areas.
 There have also been incidents of violence against soldiers.
 In July, a soldier was killed by persons who fired on him from
 a private vehicle. During the summer's unrest, homes of
 soldiers and police were frequent targets of mob violence.
 b. Disappearance
 The Constitution stipulates that all arrests occur openly,
 with warrants, and that all arrestees be brought before a
 judge. In the days preceding and immediately following the
 November 29 elections, approximately 50 young people who had
 organized "vigilante brigades" to protect their Port-au-Prince
 neighborhoods from preelection violence in the absence of
 police protection were reportedly rounded up by army units.
 Conclusive information regarding their whereabouts is
 unavailable. There are some claims that they are still being
 held, and other allegations that they were executed.
 Government officials state that they have no information
 concerning these alleged disappearances.
 The disappearance of Charlot Jacquelin, following an attack on
 a police station in 1986, remains unsolved. Members of a
 terrorist, criminal gang arrested in February 1987 claimed
 that they and other members of the group, including Jacquelin,
 had carried out the police station attack, and that they
 afterward murdered the wounded Jacquelin to avoid his being
 interrogated and betraying them. These allegations have not
 been verified. To further complicate the Jacquelin question,
 a Haitian Communist Party leader claimed in October 1987 that
 Jacquelin had been a member of the Communist Party and that
 his death may have been connected with Communist activities.
 
 
 513
 HAITI
 c. Torture and Other, Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The new Constitution specifically prohibits physical brutality
 during interrogation and provides for the right of the accused
 to have a lawyer and witness present during the interrogation
 process. While there is no indication of torture, evidence
 indicates that police beatings-of prisoners remain common
 practice in Haiti. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 of the Organization of American States visited Fort Dimanche
 prison in January 1987 and criticized substandard prison
 conditions and noted claims by many prisoners of routine
 beatings upon arrest.
 In 1987, in two cases well documented by U.S. consular
 officials, examples of cruel treatment were noted. In the
 first case, an American citizen of Haitian birth, suspected of
 plotting to overthrow the Haitian Government, was held in
 solitary confinement in an earthen underground compartment for
 almost 4 months. Food provided by.his family to supplement
 the poor prison diet was denied him by prison guards. In the
 other case, an Americnn citizen of Haitian origin, arrested
 for a minor altercation, was severely beaten by club-wielding
 police immediately after his arrest.
 Severa public complaints-were made regarding the army's abuse
 of peasantsin its ,search for Bernard Sanrsaricq following his
 short lived revolt.
 Prison condtins arepoor, and prisoners are likely to
 encounter limited hygienic facilities, inadsequate food and
 health cnre, and ill-treatment by prison staff.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under Haitian law, a person may be arrested or detained if
 apprehended during the commission of.a crime or pursuant to a
 judicial warrant based on evidence justifying the arrest. In
 all other cases, the person arrested must be brought before a
 judge within 48 hour.s~to determine the legality of his
 detention. If the judge determines that a .legal basis for the
 arrest exists, the person may be detained-for further legal
 process; otherwise, he must be released. In practice,.
 weaknesses in the judicial system usually lead to lengthy
 pretrial detention.
 Haitian law requires that a suspect be formally charged at
 least 2,weeks before trial. By law the accused is permitted
 to meet with an attorney immediately before trial, although
 defendants are often able to meet informally with counsel
 shortly after.arrest. There is no public defender or system
 of bail in Haiti. However, judges may, and often do, grant
 provisional liberty to a prisoner. Civilian cases may be
 brought before a jury, and, in the case of military personnel,
 before a rourt-martial.
 In February 1987 four members of an organization known as the
 Liaison Committee for Democratic Forces were arbitrarily
 arrested while conducting a political meeting on the grounds
 of the national university. Initially accused of subversive
 activity and related protests which were planned for the first
 anniversary of the fall of Duvalier, they were released-
 without charges by a judge after 2 1/2 days of detention.
 
 
 514
 HAITI
 Local and international human rights groups believe that many
 other arbitrary arrests have secretly taken place and that
 detainees are being held without due process of law. Amnesty
 International published one list of five persons reportedly
 detained in Haiti. Independent sources were able to verify
 the safety and whereabouts of only one person named on that
 list. Both the Haitian Government and a reputable local human
 rights group denied knowledge of the other names on the
 Amnesty International list.
 In October 1987, national attention focused on the case of
 Jean-Raymond Louis, said to have been arrested during a
 demonstration in July 1987. Human rights groups claim that
 Louis and perhaps many more prisoners, have been held or are
 being held by the criminal investigations division of the
 Haitian police since the summer's civil unrest. It was while
 protesting the apparent detention of Louis that lawyer Yves
 Volel was killed in front of the Port-au-Prince police
 station. Jean-Raymond Louis was released in December. No
 specific charges were ever filed against him.
 The Constitution prohibits deportation or forced exile of
 Haitian citizens.- Returning exiles have 2 years in which to
 renounce foreign nationality and regain Haitian nationality.
 In two controversial incidents, persons who were originally
 Haitian and who had adopted foreign nationality while in exile
 were expelled from the country. In January a U.S. citizen of
 Haitian origin was expelled as an undesirable alien following
 antigovernment remarks. In October a declared candidate for
 mayor of Port-au-Prince and an active critic of the Government
 was forcibly expelled, reportedly as a result of engaging in
 antigovernment activities and political affairs in Haiti while
 retaining Canadian citizenship.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not employed in Haiti.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public
 trial, but weaknesses in the judicial system deny this right
 in practice. Misunderstanding, illiteracy, and a fear bred of
 30 years of dictatorship caused many Haitians to ignore the
 summons for jury duty. Several trials scheduled for the
 spring judicial session had to be postponed for lack of
 jurors. During the 1986-1987 judicial session, public trials
 of several Duvalier era officials were completed. Other cases
 involving human rights abuses, notably the deaths of students
 in Gonaives prior to the fall of Duvalier, were still pending
 at year's end.
 Arraignments and trials are held in public and often receive
 extensive media coverage. Defendants have the right to be
 present and to be represented by a lawyer. In several well
 publicized cases, such as the arrests of journalist Jean-Max
 Blanc (July) and the organizers of the CATH Labor Union Strike
 (June), arrestees were released within days of their arrest
 when judges found no reason to lay charges and conduct a trial.
 In remote rural areas, a swift vigilante style justice,
 particularly in cases of theft, is often meted out by
 peasants. The Government, with its extremely limited
 resources, often does not investigate such incidents.
 
 
 515
 HAITI
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no evidence of direct government interference with
 individual privacy, or the sanctity of the family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression for all citizens is provided for by the
 ConstitVtion and in practice public dialog flourished after
 the departure of Duvalier. There are several privately owned
 daily'and weekl3 newspapers and radio stations, including
 influential-stations owned and operated by the Protestant and
 Catholic ciupches. The Government operated the newspaper
 Haiti-Liberee, which ceased publishing in July 1987 apparently
 for financial reasons, Radio Nationale, and a television
 station.  A privately owned cable television system also
 operated independently. Print'and broadcast media, both
 public and government-owned, were highly critical of the
 Government prior to the November erections, giving voice to
 political'and, civic organizations across the spectrum. Since
 November 29 the government-owned television and radio stations
 have followed a staunchly progovernment editorial line.
 Privately ownedradio, television, and print media remain
 uncensored..
 Under th' CNG several formeriy prohibited publications were
 freely available. Foreign publications were sold and
 distributed without interference. - Cable facilities provided'
 access to television programs from abroad, with no government
 censorship.
 In spitpof progress ,in freedom of.the press, the civil unrest'
 of the summer precipitated incidents of serious harassment of
 journalists. In at least five separate incidents, members of
 the FADH threatened both foreign and Haitian journalists who
 were legitimately pur~uing their professional duties.
 Journalist.Jean-Max Blanc was arrested and held in detention
 for several days before he was released by a judge.
 Journalists present at the death of )ves Volel were roughed up
 and caieras and film'were confiscated by Volel's assailants.
 Cameras,. without film, were later returned without explanation
 by police authorities. '
 At the height.of the.summer's disturbances, seven local radio
 stationswerete t;argets of gunfire during the night by
 unknown perso6ns. Critics claim that the army was responsible
 but the Government denied the charges. No investigations are
 known to have been carried out.
 Immediately preceding the elections armed attacks were again
 made on radio stations. Transmitters of four independent
 influential radio stations were firebombed, and the stations
 were rendered inoperative. Two stations have subsequently
 undergone repairs and returned to the air. The Government has
 not yet conducted an investigation.to discover.the
 perpetratorsof these attacks.
 On election day, the armed gangs which disrupted the voting
 process deliberately fired upon members of the local and
 international press corps. Dominican cameraman Carlos Grullon
 was killed and several journalists were wounded in election
 
 
 516
 HAITI
 day violence. The Government has not thus far undertaken
 investigations to identify or punish perpetrators of these
 attacks.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are provided for
 by the Constitution. Political parties and human rights
 groups as well as other private organizations have been very
 active since the overthrow of Duvalier in 1986.
 In response to the summer protest activities, in July the CNG
 announced a decree requiring prior notification to government
 authorities for public meetings or marches. The organizers of
 a march must identify themselves and the plans for their
 demonstration. The organizer is held personally responsible
 for the good behavior of the participants and exhortation or
 invocation to crime or disorder can lead to fine or
 imprisonment. Thereafter, the police are supposed to assure
 the protection of the orderly demonstrators. However, the
 first protest to be held after the announcement of this decree
 on July 29 was characterized by police violence and several
 deaths. Subsequently several small demonstrations followed
 the outlined procedures and received government cooperation
 and protection.
 There are currently 17 officially registered political
 parties, recognized by the Haitian Ministry of Justice in
 conformity to the July 1986 law which outlined procedures for
 recognition of parties. In addition, numerous other parties
 ranging across the political spectrum were allowed to function
 though they have not as yet fulfilled all registration
 requirements or in some cases even applied for registration.
 In addition to political organizations, freedom of
 association was evident in various human rights, civic,
 fraternal, and recreational groups which functioned unimpeded
 by government interference.
 Haitian labor unions remain in their infancy due to social,
 historic, and economic reasons. Forbidden under the Duvalier
 dictatorship until 1981, they were then allowed to operate
 only within strictly circumscribed limits. It was not until
 Duvalier's departure that unions were finally allowed to
 operate freely. Even with no government interference the
 relatively new phenomenon of trade unionism has not developed
 quickly in Haiti, where unemployment is estimated to affect 50
 percent or more of the available work force, and where
 employers, used to working without unions, resist organizing
 efforts. The few operating unions depend largely on outside
 sources for their financial support. No unions are known to
 subsist on dues paid by their members. Union contracts do not
 yet exist; rather, informal, unofficial, unwritten agreements,
 in some cases tacit acceptance, allow the presence of unions
 in plants. Formal management recognition of unions as
 bargaining agents is not yet the norm even in those plants
 where unions have organized.
 The Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), the
 Federation of Union Workers (FOS), and the Autonomous Central
 of Haitian Workers/Latin American Workers Central (CATH/CLAT);
 are the three major union federations. Until the unsettled
 election period, all had open contact with international labor
 organizations: FOS with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Union; CATH/CLAT with the-Christian Democratic
 World Confederation of Labor; and CATH with Canadian unions.
 
 
 517
 HAITI
 It is impossible to judge accurately the size of their
 membership, because each claims thousands of unemployed or
 peasant members. It is estimated that each probably has fewer
 than 3,000 members actually engagdd in full time employment
 .who are-members of local unions, which usually represent all
 workers in individual factories. Strikes occur from time to
 time, usually over nonsalary issues, and seem, on the whole,
 to be settled largely without the representation of the union
 federations. -.Union leaders usually play a behind-the-scenes
 role since most managers-will not deal with them directly.
 In June the Government dissolved the trade union CATH after
 the union called a general strike which resulted in widespread
 rumors.of violence. After substantial popular protest, the
 union was allowed to reopen within a month. CATH has operated
 without interference since then. The Government stressed that
 the ordercclosing CATH.was issued not because of'CATH's labor
 activities, but because of alleged unconstitutional, political
 actions. There were no~other. reports of government
 interference in legitimate union operations during 1987.
 In 1987 the M.inistry of-Social Affairs initiated work on a new
 labor code, as much to encourage union-management interaction
 as to make needed changes in the code. However work has
 proceeded slowly because of mistrust on both sides'of the
 bargaining table,'and. few are optimistib that the code will be
 completed soon.-
 c. iFreedom of Religion
 Religionis an integral part of Haitian life and culture and
 is practiced widely with no interference from the Government.
 Roman Catholicism is embraced in varying degrees by about 75
 percent of the population. Voodoo,a mixture of African
 animism-and Christianity, is also practiced-by:a majority of
 Haitians. Various Protestant denomihations and foreign
 missionary--groups openly proselytize in Haiti. There are no
 government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations
 with overseas coreligionists or religious instruction and
 publishing-. The CNG criticized alleged Catholic and
 Protestant Church political activity following the November 29
 elections, but made no attempt to curtail freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within. the Country, Foreign.
 Travel.,. Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not normally restrict domestic travel of
 citizens or foreigners. An irregular network of military
 checkpoints operates across Haiti and foreigners and
 interurban travelers infrequently are asked to register when
 entering certain towns. There are no restrictions on persons
 changing their residences or place of employment.
 The CNG eliminated the need for reentry visas for Haitian
 citizens in late 1986 and abolished the requirement for exit
 visas in 1987. These two changes were incorporated in the new
 Constitution. Every Haitian citizen is eligible for a
 passport, and generally speaking travel documents are neither
 issued nor denied on the basis of political considerations.
 However, since November 29, 3 Haitian citizens who were
 prominent in the electoral process have been prohibited from
 leaving Haiti, as has one anti-CNG political activist. These
 restrictions were applied in the final days of December 1987
 and the first days of 1988, and their final outcome is still
 unresolved. Haitians who departed under the Duvalier regime,
 
 
 518
 HAITI
 particularly those with skills or professions, have been
 encouraged by the CNG to return to Haiti.
 Economic migrants continue to leave Haiti, bound for
 destinations in the United States or for more prosperous areas
 of the Caribbean. Pursuant to a 1986 U.S.-Haitian agreement
 on the interdiction of undocumented migrants, around 3,000
 illegal migrants were repatriated from international waters to
 Haiti by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1987. Immigration and
 Naturalization Service officers are embarked on the Coast
 Guard vessels to interview potential applicants for political
 asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Through most of 1987, Haitian political activity focused on
 the movement toward an elective democratic system. After 30
 years of dictatorship, Haitians engaged in efforts to
 establish a democratic system and had made notable progress
 toward establishing democratic institutions. Political
 parties emerged, and a civic motivation campaign was designed
 to encourage democratic participation. The first successful
 exercise of political rights came with the March 1987
 constitutional referendum in which all Haitians were able to
 exercise their fundamental right to vote. They voted*
 overwhelmingly for a new Constitution which accords a wide
 range of human and civil rights, including freedoms of speech,
 assembly, religion, and press. The Constitution also contains
 provisions designed to prevent the concentration of power in
 the hands of any one governmental sector, and it bans political
 activity by the armed forces.
 The democratic process received its first setback in July when
 the Government refused to promulgate the election law drafted
 by the constitutionally mandated independent Election Council
 and substituted its own election law instead, This led to an
 oubreak of violence, which in turn led to the postponement of
 local elections. The Government subsequently withdrew its
 election law and accepted a new law written by the independent
 Election Council. Progress toward elections resumed after the
 summer's disruptions, and political parties and candidates
 campaigned openly. As the November 29 election day neared,
 the campaign and electoral process were increasingly
 undermined by a climate of violence which included attacks on
 party headquarters, election centers, printing presses, and
 radio stations. These activities were generally believed to
 have been instigated by followers of the Duvaliers who hoped
 to regain control of the country. The Government made no
 significant effort to suppress the violence.
 The violence which disrupted the November elections has at
 least temporarily thwarted the democratic process and has
 threatened hopes for the establishment of democratic
 institutions.   CNG-supervised elections were to be held
 January 17, 1988 with inauguration of the elected civilian
 president scheduled to take place on February 7, 1988, (the
 date also envisioned in the original electoral schedule).
 However, many social and political parties, including those of
 the four major presidential candidates, urged a boycott of the
 government-sponsored elections.

 Several internal hUman rights;6rganzati6ls exist. The
 groups' leaders are active in politics, some inb&rganizing
 opposition to the CNG. The Government has not impeded the
 formation of human rights groups nor prevented them from
 making international contacts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Ninety-five percent of Haitians are descendents of African
 slaves who gained their independence fromFrance in 1804, and
 the rest are mulatto, mostly mixed African-European ancestry.
 A small number are of European or Middle Eastern descent.
 Under Haitian law no distinctions are made with regard to race.
 Haiti has two official languages, French and Creole. All
 Haitians speak Creole, but French is primarily limited to the
 educated classes.. The question of which language should
 dominate is a politically charged issue. There is no official
 linguistic discrimination, but social class divisions can be
 drawn closely on linguistic lines.
 The role of women in Haiti is limited by tradition, but there
 is no legal discrimination.between the sexes. Women enjoy
 equal legal rights in education, property, and voting.
 Peasant women are largely confined to traditional occupations
 such as farming, marketing, and domestic tasks. Middle class
 women make up a large proportion of the work force and
 dominate the secretarial, nursing, and teaching professions.
 Greater opportunities have recently opened up to women in the
 government and senior-level private sector jobs. Men and
 women are generally paid equally for equal work.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Conditions of labor in Haiti are strongly influenced by the
 general economic situation in the country. At less than $400
 per year, Haiti's per capita income is the lowest in the
 Western Hemisphere. Some economists estimate that Haiti has
 an unemployment and underemployment rate of 50 percent of the
 working population.
 The labor code, revised in March 1984, governs individual
 employment contracts, protects apprentices and women, and
 
 
 520
 HAITI
 establishes minimum health and safety standards, particularly
 for hazardous occupations. The code sets the normal workday
 at 8 hours. The work week is 48 hours with 24 hours rest on
 Sunday. The code provides for paid annual leave of at least
 15 consecutive days. Workers may take up to 15 days annual
 sick leave. The labor code also mandates a daily minimum wage
 of $3.00 in the Port-au-Prince area and $2.64 in the rest of
 the country. Minimum age for factory employment is 12, and
 fierce adult competition ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in the industrial sector. In both rural and urban
 areas children often work at odd jobs to help supplement the
 family income.
 The Government does not have the machinery to systematically
 enforce labor laws regarding wages and minimum safety
 regulations, but they seem to be generally adhered to by the
 industrial sector. Many Haitians support themselves privately
 by acting as middle men in the extensive second economy. For
 these marginally employed workers there.is virtually no safety
 net between them and abject poverty. There are few
 educational, health, hygienic, public housing, or other social
 services available to the average Haitian, particularly
 outside of Port-au-Prince.
