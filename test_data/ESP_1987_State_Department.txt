 SPAIN
 Spain is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional
 monarch. The fundamental freedoms of speech, assembly, press,
 religion, movement, and participation in the political process
 are provided for in the Constitution of 1978. The rights to
 these freedoms are extended to all citizens and are respected
 in practice. At all levels of government, elections must be
 held every 4 years. Voter participation is high in these free
 and open elections.
 The Spanish economy is mixed, with primary reliance on private
 initiative and market mechanisms. Although the economy is
 healthy, Spain continues to experience high unemployment.
 This is due in part to government and private efforts to
 increase the efficiency of the economy, and in part to the
 entry of new workers into the labor force. Women and youths
 are disproportionately affected by the unemployment.
 Human rights enjoy great respect in Spain. Charges of abuse
 of human rights most often occur in connection with political
 terrorism. The antiterrorist law's provision for 10 days of
 incommunicado detention has been criticized, and its
 constitutionality is being reviewed by the judiciary. The
 Government has proposed modifications in the law to reduce the
 detention period. The Government has prosecuted cases of
 alleged police abuse of detainees, and some law enforcement
 officers have been found guilty and sentenced to prison
 terms. In September 1987, the Spanish Senate ratified Spain's
 accession to the 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Punishment.
 RESPECT FOR HU-AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 According to the Ministry of Interior, there were 180 terrorist
 actions in Spain from January 1 through the first week of
 October 1987, killing 37 persons. Unofficial statistics show
 an additional 113 persons injured in terrorist attacks through
 the end of September. Most of the casualties resulted from
 actions claimed by or attributable to the Basque Separatist
 Group ETA (Basque Fatherland and Freedom). The Interior
 Ministry attributes 100 of the actions and all but one of the
 deaths to ETA. An ETA car-bombing of a Barcelona supermarket
 in June killed 21 civilians and marked a clear change in
 tactics from targeting members of the military and security
 forces to striking purely civilian targets.
 The Government, while signaling willingness to talk with the
 ETA, has made a major and successful effort to arrest and
 prosecute ETA terrorists. Cooperation between the French and
 Spanish Governments in this respect has led to the
 apprehension by French police of a large number of suspected
 Spanish Basque terrorists based in southwest France. Many of
 those apprehended have been delivered to Spanish authorities
 for prosecution.
 b. Disappearance
 Police or government security forces do not carry out secret
 arrests or kidnapings.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 According to the Ministry of Interior, 464 persons were
 detained under-the provisions of the antiterrorist law between
 January 1 and the first week of October 1987. Persons
 detained under the antiterrorist law frequently charge that
 they were subjected to police abuse during their detention.
 In its Report for 1986 covering 1986, Amnesty International
 expressed concern that such persons frequently were tortured
 and ill-treated. The Government asserts that such detainees
 routinely lodge complaints of police brutality or torture,
 whether or not there is cause. Nevertheless, the courts
 during 1987 prosecuted and convicted several civil guard
 officers accused of torturing detainees in previous years.
 The actual incidence of abuse by police is believed to have
 decreased significantly from earlier years. An improved
 police attitude with respect to human rights may be attributed
 to several factors: The willingness of the Government to
 punish improper police behavior, publicity in the press, and a
 new concern by the police unions themselves with denouncing
 police misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary arrest
 and detention, and normally a suspect may not be held more
 than 72 hours without a hearing. However,'the antiterrorist
 law provides that a suspected terrorist may be detained by the
 police for an additional 7 days, during which time the
 detainee is held virtually incommunicado. This aspect of the
 antiterrorist law has been severely criticized, and its
 constitutionality is being reviewed by the Constitutional
 Tribunal. The Government announced its support for
 modification of the law, the main goal being to reduce the
 period of detention.
 There is no exile or forced labor in Spain.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution assures the right to a fair public trial, and
 this right is observed in practice. The law provides for an,
 expeditious judicial hearing following arrest. Defendants may
 always appeal to the next highest court, and up to the Council
 of Europe in cases concerning human rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of home and correspondence is protected by the
 Constitution. Under the Criminal Code, government authorities
 must obtain court approval before searching private property,
 wiretapping, or interfering- with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the
 Minister'of Interior to act prior to obtaining court approval
 "in cases of emergency." However, there have been no
 complaints that the Minister has abused this discretion.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government scrupulously observes the provisions for free
 speech and press provided by the Constitution. Opposition
 
 
 1021
 SPAIN
 viewpoints are freely expressed in speech and through the
 media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As provided in the Constitution, all groups have the right of
 free assembly and association for political or other purposes.
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. About 14 percent of the
 Spanish work force is unionized. Trade unions are not
 subjected to official harassment. They freely maintain ties
 with recognized international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain. Catholicism is the
 predominant religion, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. Adherence to a particular faith
 neither enhances nor diminishes a person's secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Spanish citizens have complete freedom to.travel in and outside
 the country. The Government restricts neither emigration nor
 repatriation. In 1987 a section of the law controlling the
 residence of aliens was found unconstitutional and was
 modified to give the courts discretion to suspend an expulsion
 order against an alien. The law on aliens permits detention
 of a person for up to 40 days prior to expulsion, but specifies
 that the detention may not take place in a prison-like setting.
 The Government is attempting to resolve the grievances of
 non-Spanish residents of the Ceuta and Melilla enclaves in
 North Africa, some of whom have been denied Spanish citizenship
 in spite of family residence through several generations and
 service in the Spanish armed forces.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which
 all citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote.
 Opposition groups exist openly and take active part in the
 political process. Free and actively contested regional and
 local elections were held in 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains good relations with international
 human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as with
 national groups, such as the Spanish Human Rights Association.
 The Foreign Ministry, through an Office of Human Rights
 Affairs, takes an active interest in human rights issues
 internationally.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Spain's Constitution provides for.equal rights for all
 citizens. Education and economic and social services are
 
 
 1022
 SPAIN
 generally available to all without discrimination of any kind.
 The Constitution assures equal rights for women. The
 Government is dedicated to eliminating discrimination against
 women wherever it occurs. The Women's Institute is a
 government agency staffed by some 100 full-time employees
 under the Ministry of Culture. It is active in promoting
 social equality and the participation of women in political,
 cultural, economic, and social life. In 1987 the Women's
 Institute developed a comprehensive plan of action for
 government ministries in the fields of family law, social
 conditions, education and culture, employment, and health.
 Women comprise approximately 6.5 percent of the Congress of
 Deputies and 5.5 percent of the Senate.
 Gypsies are a minority group representing 3 percent of the
 Spanish population. Although like all citizens they enjoy
 equal rights under the Constitution, in practice they suffer
 discrimination in housing, schools, and jobs. Legal mechanisms
 exist by which they can seek redress, for example, from
 discrimination by an employer. As a practical matter,
 however, Gypsies do not normally seek such redress. The
 Government is committed to securing equal rights and treatment
 for Gypsies. A representative of the Gypsy community serves
 as special advisor to the Minister of Interior.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Workers in general have substantial, well-defined rights. A
 40-hour week was established by law in 1983. Spanish workers
 also enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and a month's paid
 vacation. A minimum wage tied to the cost of living is
 provided by law. Children under 16 years of age may not be
 employed. Working and health conditions are generally good.
 Workers in the underground economy, estimated to be as high as
 7 percent of the labor force, do not have the same protection
 and benefits as those in the open economy.
