DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a long demo-
 cratic tradition. It has a unicameral legislature of
 179 members, elected proportionally by a complicated
 system that allows representation for virtually every
 minority. A spirit of compromise has largely overcome
 the problems created by a multiplicity of parties and
 has fostered the creation of a society marked by hu-
 manitarianism and a highly developed social welfare
 system. There is broad public support and consensus
 for strong human rights policies in Denmark.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Fulfilling the basic needs of the population for food,
 shelter, health care and education are major objectives
 of Danish Government policies. These policies include
 full consideration for less privileged elements of the
 society. A comprehensive social welfare policy includes
 provisions of health and medical services, welfare
 services, various family benefits, pensions, and
 disability and unemployment insurance. Ombudsmen have
 the power to investigate charges that these or any
 other government programs are not carried out fairly
 or that they violate the rights of private persons.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emi-
 gration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic
 fashion. The labor movement, a dominant social and
 political force, fully guarantees the rights of both
 sexes, a policy backed up by advanced and compre-
 hensive public welfare legislation- There is respect
 for civil and political liberties, both on a theoreti-
 cal level and in practice.

 4. Gcvernment Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Denmark has conceptually and in practice been a leader
 in the field of human rights. It has supported human
 rights in international fora and been in the vanguard
 of those furthering the rights of women, the disad-
 vantaged and the poor. Denmark holds its human rights
 record open for international appraisal, recently
 defending itself before the European Commission on
 Human Rights when charges of insensitivity were brought
 by one of its citizens. Denmark is party to the Inter-
 national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (in-
 cluding the optional protocol), the Covenant on Eco-
 nomic, Social and Cultural Affairs, and the European
 Convention on Human Rights.
