 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has been a one-party
 constitutional state since May 1984, when the provisional
 government, established after the 1980 coup d'etat, was
 abolished. General Joao Bernardo Vieira serves as President
 of the Council of State and Head of State, Commander-in-Chief,
 and General Secretary of Guinea-Bissau's sole political party,
 the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and
 Cape Verde (PAIGC). According to the 1984 Constitution, the
 National Assembly decides fundamental questions of internal
 and external policy, but it meets infrequently. Effective
 power and day-to-day control rests in the hands of the
 President and the Council of State. Although the President is
 the most powerful member of the Council, decisionmaking is
 collegial. rather than autocratic. The party selects all
 candidates for office.
 The armed forces (FARP) are responsible for state security,
 both external and internal. FARP leaders are usually members
 of the PAIGC and often hold key positions in the Politburo or
 Central Committee. Persons accused of political crimes are
 tried by military tribunals.
 Guinea-Bissau remains one of the world's least developed
 nations and depends upon foreign aid for its survival. The
 Government's postindependence efforts to exercise central
 control over the economy resulted in chronic shortages of most
 basic commodities, high unemployment, and a weak national
 currency. Beginning in late 1986, the Government launched a
 new series of reforms to promote long-term economic growth by
 shifting from a state-run centralized economy to a free market
 system. While the reforms resulted in strong growth of the
 private sector and improved agricultural production, inflation
 remained high, and urban residents witnessed a sharp drop in
 their standard of living and purchasing power.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 1988. In March the Government released its most prominent
 political prisoner, Raphael Barbosa, cofounder of the PAIGC,
 on humanitarian grounds. Approximately 40 men remain
 imprisoned on an island in the Bijagos Archipelago. Most of
 these prisoners are serving sentences for complicity in an
 October 1985 plot to overthrow President Vieira. There have
 been no executions in Guinea-Bissau since six leaders of the
 1985 plot, including former Vice President Correia, were
 executed in July 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment.
 However, security authorities employ severe interrogation
 
 
 151
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 methods, and Amnesty International (AI) has, in the past,
 received allegations of the use of torture in security cases
 and deaths in custody due to mistreatment. Prison conditions
 are unsanitary, and prisoners' families must routinely bring
 them food and medical supplies to supplement scanty rations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined and the use of arrest warrants is the
 exception rather than the rule. The legal system, inherited
 from the Portuguese colonial regime but modified by the
 Constitution, includes important procedural rights, such as
 the right to counsel and the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of detention. Bail procedures are observed
 erratically. The Government has held persons, sometimes for
 extended periods of time, without charge or trial, including
 in incommunicado detention. For example, several years ago
 the Government briefly detained without charge members of the
 Yanque-Yanque movement, on the grounds the group's activities,
 which included mutilation of members in initiation ceremonies
 and killing enemies, posed a danger to society.
 In August 1987, AI submitted a memorandum to the Government
 detailing its concern about the long-term detention without
 trial of suspected government opponents and allegations of
 torture and ill-treatment of detainees. One of Amnesty's
 concerns was the case of Raphael Barbosa. In March the
 Government released Barbosa from a prison camp on the island
 of Formosa. Barbosa had been serving a life sentence for
 having collaborated with Portuguese secret security police
 during Guinea-Bissau's independence struggle.
 The Government has legal authority to exile prisoners but has
 not done so in recent years. Conscientious objectors are not
 exempt from military service.
 For regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and many
 urban dwellers continue to bring judicial disputes to
 recognized traditional counselors. The official judicial
 system is based on the Portuguese model, with some exceptions.
 Intervals between arrest and trial are often lengthy. All
 defense lawyers are court-appointed, as private legal practice
 is prohibited. The judiciary is a part of the executive
 branch. Trials involving state security usually are not open
 to outside observers and are conducted by military tribunals.
 FARP members are tried by military courts for all offenses.
 The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both
 civilian and military cases except those involving national
 security matters, in which instance the Council of State
 reviews all decisions. The 1986 treason trials of 56 accused
 conspirators took place before the Superior Military Tribunal,
 the highest military court. The 12 persons sentenced to death
 appealed to the Council of State for clemency and, as a
 result, 6 had their death sentences commuted to 15-year prison
 terms. Of those convicted in the 1986 trials, an estimated 40
 men remain incarcerated at a prison labor camp on an island in
 the Bijagos Archipelago. Although isolated from outside
 observers, the prisoners reportedly are able to move about the
 island and are responsible for growing much of their own food.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional guarantees of the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence are not generally respected in
 cases of serious crimes or state security. The use of search
 warrants, for example, is rare. International and domestic
 mail is subject to surveillance and censorship.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of intellectual,
 artistic,-.and scientific expression, with the significant
 exception of cases in which these rights are exercised in a
 manner "contrary to the promotion of social progress." In
 fact, the Government controls all information media and views
 the press as a vehicle of the party. Journalists are
 government employees and practice self-censorship. However,
 the media is permitted to criticize and question some
 policies, although it may not criticize individual officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, and government approval is not required for
 peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies and demonstrations.
 However, all existing organizations and associations are
 linked to the Government or the party, including the sole
 labor union, the National Union of the Workers of
 Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), and antigovernment meetings are not
 tolerated.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and has
 been respected. Christians, Muslims, and animists worship
 freely, and proselytizing is permitted.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau.
 Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship revoked
 for political reasons. Thousands of persons have emigrated
 for economic reasons. Return of expatriates is encouraged,
 although the 1986 deaths of two opposition members in a car
 accident during their forced repatriation from Senegal
 convinced some government opponents that they would not be
 welcomed back to Guinea-Bissau. While sympathetic to the
 principle of asylum, Guinea-Bissau does not host significant
 numbers of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the ability peacefully and legally to
 change the Government or the form of government.
 Guinea-Bissau is led by the PAIGC party and military elite,
 headed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira. By the terms of the
 Constitution, all political activity takes place within the
 
 
 153
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 party/state structure. The 1984 electoral slates for the
 National Popular Assembly at the district, regional, and
 national levels were party-prepared lists. The President,
 members of the Council of State, and National Popular Assembly
 deputies are elected to 5-year terms. There are provisions
 for constitutional amendments and national referendums to be
 initiated by the National Popular Assembly, but the Assembly
 has never taken such an initiative. No single ethnic group
 dominates party or government positions, but Papel and Creole
 (mixed-race) groups, predominantly located in and around the
 capital of Bissau, are disproportionately represented in the
 Government. Women have legal equality with men and hold some
 influential jobs within the party and the Government. The
 current Minister for Labor and Social Security and the
 President of the National Assembly are both women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although international human rights groups have visited
 Guinea-Bissau, their visits have always been tightly
 controlled. The Government invited an AI mission to visit in
 1986. AI delegates held discussions in June 1986 with
 President Vieira and many other officials and attended one
 session of the treason trial. The Government's response, if
 any, to AI's 1987 memorandum on human rights has not been made
 public. There are no local human rights groups in
 Guinea-Bissau.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of Guinea-Bissau comprises diverse tribal
 groups, each with its own language, customs, and social
 organization. The Fula, Mandinga, Balanta, Manjaca, and Papel
 are important groups. Creoles enjoy an advantageous position
 within the society, due to their generally higher level of
 education and their links abroad. Although the President and
 other influential leaders regularly urge the nation to
 overcome ethnic differences, economic dominance by Creoles
 (and to a lesser extent Fulas) has created resentment among
 other ethnic communities. Most of the defendants in the 1986
 treason trial were members of the Balanta, the largest ethnic
 group (30 percent).
 Discrimination against women, while officially prohibited,
 continues within certain ethnic groups, especially the Muslim
 Fulas and Mandingas of the North and East. Among those groups
 female circumscision is still practiced, despite official
 prohibition and educational campaigns against this custom.
 Women enjoy higher status in the societies of the Balanta,
 Papel, and Bijagos groups living mainly in the southern
 coastal region.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately one-half the population of Guinea-Bissau is of
 working age. While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 association, only one labor union, the National Union of the
 Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), is organized in Guinea-
 Bissau. With strong ties to the PAIGC, the UNTG more closely
 resembles a mass organization than a union. The UNTG has
 
 
 154
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 neither aggressively nor effectively promoted worker rights.
 The UNTG is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions and is a member of the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity. Strikes, while not specifically
 forbidden, do not occur. Since the Government's use of force
 to disperse students attempting to strike in 1981, the
 public's perception has been that strikes, like antigovernment
 meetings, would not be tolerated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Of the 25,000 salaried workers in the country, approximately
 60 percent are employees of the Government. Only 4,000
 persons comprise Guinea-Bissau's small manufacturing sector.
 The scarcity of salaried jobs has forced employees to focus on
 obtaining and keeping employment rather than on organizing and
 bargaining. While public employees are permitted to join the
 UNTG, the union's activities do not encompass organizing
 employees (whether public or private) for the purpose of
 collective bargaining. The Constitution and labor laws do not
 provide a right to organize and bargain, and, at present, the
 right is neither protected nor practiced. There are no export
 processing zones in Guinea-Bissau. Labor laws are applicable
 throughout thecountry.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Guinea-Bissau.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government in 1987 approved a new labor code which set a
 minimum age of 14 for general factory labor and of 18 for
 heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. In an
 overwhelmingly rural and agricultural society, traditional
 division of labor practices both between sexes and age groups
 continues to prevail. Children in all rural communities work
 in the fields and at home for no pay. The Government does not
 attempt to discourage this practice and, in fact, delays the
 opening of schools until the rice season has ended.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Even in the small wage sector, labor laws are ill-defined and
 unevenly enforced, due primarily to the extreme economic
 underdevelopment of the society. However, there are
 government regulations covering such matters as job-related
 disabilities and vacation rights. The normal workweek is 35
 hours. Although not consistently enforced, a minimum wage of
 approximately $11 per month has been established by the
 Ministry of Civil Service, Labor and Social Security. That
 wage is inadequate to maintain even a minimum standard of
 living. Existing legal health and safety standards for
 workers are not enforced in a uniform and comprehensive manner.
