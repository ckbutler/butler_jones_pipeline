 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected president and a unicam-
 eral legislature selected by both direct and proportional voting. Kim Dae Jung was
 elected president in a free and fair election in December. The judiciary operates
 independently of the executive branch.
 Responsibility for maintaining internal security lies with the National Security
 Planning Agency (NSP), the Korean National Police (KNP), and the Defense Secu-
 rity Command (DSC). Legislation passed in 1993 restricts the NSP and DSC from
 interfering in domestic politics and grants the NSP investigative authority only in
 cases involving terrorism, espionage, and international crime organizations. The
 Government revised this law in 1996 to allow the NSP to investigate members of
 domestic organizations that are viewed as supporting the North Korean Govern-
 ment. There continued to be credible reports that some members of the security
 forces were responsible for occasional human rights abuses.
 After a period of sustained growth averaging about 9 percent per year, the econ-
 omy slowed somewhat, with 1997 growth in gross domestic product projected at
 around 6 percent. By the end of the year the country had entered into a severe fi-
 nancial crisis as foreign exchange reserves were inadequate to meet short term obll-
 gations, and a number of major private sector conglomerates went into bankruptcy.
 At year's end, an international assistance effort led by the International Monetary
 Fund was underway to shore up Korea's reserves and foster structural economic re-
 form.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. The use or threatened use of the National Secu-
 rity Law (NSL) continued to infringe upon citizen's civil liberties, including the right
 to free expression. There was no progress toward reform of the NSL, but judges con-
 tinued to demonstrate their independence. The standards for issuing detention war-
 rants were made more stringent, substantially reducing the number of suspects de-
 tained before they were indicted. However, in November, following complaints from
 prosecutors that the new system was administratively cumbersome, the National
 Assembly voted to amend these roles to ease standards for issuing warrants. The
 Ministry of Justice continued to implement guidelines requiring that suspects be
 told at the time of arrest of their right to remain silent and their right to a lawyer.
 Nevertheless, credible sources reported instances in which police subjected detainees
 to verbal and physical abuse. Women continued to face legal and societal discrimina-
 tion. Violence against women and physical abuse remain serious problems. There is
 still insufficient legal redress for these problems. Ethnic minorities face legal and
 societal discrimination. Although labor statutes were revised to expand freedom of
 association, they remained below international standards in some respects.

 The Government continued to require released political prisoners to make regular
 reports to the police under the Social Surveillance Law, and it still has not author-
 ized independent investigations of the cases of some prisoners who received sen-
 tences on charges believed to have been fabricated by previous governments. Some
 of these prisoners reportedly were subjected to torture to extract confessions and re-
 ceived trials that did-not meet international standards of fairness.
 RESPECT F~OR HUMAN EIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In February a North Korean defec-
 tor living in Seoul was killed. The authorities suspect the killing was carried out
 by North Korean agents.
 There were no other reports of political or extrajudcial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punis hment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits mistreatment of suspects; the Government has ordered in-
 vestigating authorities to protect the human rights of suspects; and allegations of
 abuse by authorities of those in custody for questioning continued to decline. None-
 theless, prosecutors continued to p lace much emphasis on securing convictions
 through confessions. The Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained after a sus-
 pect had been deprived of sleep during an interrogation could not be used in court.
 In spite of the court ruling and government directives discouraging sleep deprivation
 as a technique for obtaining confessions, there continued to be reports of police ques-
 tioning suspects through the night. Credible sources also reported that in sme
 cases police verbally or physiclly abused suspects, including beatings, threats, and
 sexual intimidation in the course of arrest and police interrogation.
 In November a district judge in Suwon convicted a policeman of excessive use of
 force during a February 1996 incident. The victim, a 38-year-old man, had entered
 a police station while intoxicated and became abusive when speaking with an officer
 on duty. He resisted when the policeman pushed him out of the building, and in
 the resulting struggle he hit his head on the ground and died. The court imposed
 a jail sentene of 1 A years on the policeman.
 Former detainees who claimed that they had been tortured by officials of past
 military governments continued to request compensation. However, the Government
 has not provided an effective mechanism for redress, such as an independent bedy
 to investigate complaints of past human rights violations. Officials accused of abuse
 or harassment of suspects have rarely been prosecuted.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. Prison diets are adeqate, but the facilities offer
 little protection against cold in winter and heat in tha summer. Some prisoners
 claim that these conditions damaged their health and that medical care has been
 inadequate. Guards have occasionally been criticized by inmates for using excessive
 force or needlessly putting prisoners in manacles. Inmate access to reading mate-
 rials and television broad casts has improved significantly in recent years.
 There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions, although representa-
 tives of human rights groups may visit certain prisoners at the discretion of the
 prison warden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law is often vague, and prosecutors
 have wide latitude to interpret the law. The NSL defines espionage in broad terms
 and permits the authorities to detain and arrest persons who commit acts viewed
 as supportive of North Korea and therefore dangerous to the Republic of Korea. Au-
 thorities arrested not only persons spying on behalf of North Korea but also those
 who praised North Korea, its former leader Kim II Sung, or its "self-reliance"
 ("juche) political philosophy The United Nations Human Rights Committee has
 termed the NSL "a major obstacle to the full realization of the rights enshrined in
 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." The Government arrested
 over 300 dissidents under the NSL during the year, accusing most of them of trying
 to undermine democracy by aiding North Korea.
 The NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of anyone who Awith the
 knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State or the basic
 order of free democracy, praised, encouraged, propagandized for, or sided with the
 activities of an antistate organization." The legal standard for knowing that one
 might endanger the security of the State is vague. Consequently, a number of Kore-
 ans have been arrested for what appeared to be the peaceful expression of opposing
 views, which the authorities apparently considered pro-North Korean or antistate
 views. For example, Duksung University student Kim Eun Hee was arrested in Jan-
 uary for posting a unification greeting from North Koreans on a college bulletin
 board. She was convicted under the NSL and given a suspended sentence. In March
 
 
 authorities arrested members of a labor group, Saminchong, for violating the NSL.
 Human rights groups say~ that Saminchong is a Socialist group, that does not en-
 dorse juche ideology and has been critical of North Korea.
 The Government's rationale for retaining the NSL is that North Korea is actively
 trying to subvert the Government and society, and that due to this special cir-
 cumstance, some forms of expression must be limited to block the greater danger
 to freedom and democracy posed by totalitarianism. The effect sometimes is to re-
 lieve the Government of the burden of p roof in a court of law that any particular
 speech or action does, in fact, threaten the nation's security. For example, the Gov-
 ernment has prosecuted citizens for unauthorized travel to North Korea (see Section
 2.d.). In February novelist Kim Ha Ki was convicted under the NSL after making
 a trip to North Korea in July 1996.
 The Criminal Code requires warrants to be issued by judges in cases of arrest,
 detention, seizure, or search, except if the person is apprehended while committing
 a criminal act, or if a judge is not available and the authorities believe the suspect
 may destroy evidence or escape capture if not quickly arrested. In such emergency
 cases, judges must issue arrest warrants within 48 hours after apprehension, or, if
 a court is not located in the same county, within 72 hours. Police may detain sus-
 pects who voluntarily come in for questioning for up to 6 hours, but must notify the
 suspects' families. The police generally respected these legal requirements.
 The standards for issuing warrants were tightened in 1997, resulting in a signifi-
 cant decline in the number of detention warrants approved. According to one study,
 the number of suspects detained upon arrest in the first 5 months of the year de-
 clined 75 percent compared with a similar period in 1996. The change in the stand-
 ards made the legal system conform more closely to the principle that defendants
 are innocent until proven guilty. Several nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 consider the change in warrant procedures to be the most favorable human rights
 development of the year.
 However, in November, following complaints from prosecutors that the new sys-
 tem was administratively cumbersome, the National Assembly voted to amend these
 rules to ease standards for issuing warrants. Authorities normally must release sus-
 pects after 30 days unless an indictment is issued. Hence, detainees are a relatively
 small percentage of the total prison population.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to representation by an attor-
 ney, but lawyers are not allowedto be present during police interrogation.
 The Government began in 1993 to permit suspects to consult with "duty lawyers"
 during breaks in interrogation. These duty lawyers are hired and paid by the indi-
 vidual suspects, but often bill at reduced fees as a public service. The Justice Min-
 istry also issued guidelines in 1995 requiring police to inform suspects at the time
 of arrest about their right to be represented by a lawyer, and there were no reports
 of access to legal counsel being denied. However, in at least one case, a lawyer al-
 leged that attorney-client confidentiality was infringed by a prosecutor who refused
 to leave a consultation room. There is a bail system, but human rights lawyers say
 that bail generally is not granted when detainees are charged with committing seri-
 ous offenses.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The President appoints the Chief Justice and most justices of the Constitu-
 tional Court. Although judges do not receive life appointments, they cannot be fired
 or transferred for political reasons. In recent years the judiciary has shown increas-
 ing independence. Judges in some district courts have ruled, for example, that activ-
 ists' exchange of faxes with North Korean students or meetings with North Korean
 representatives in third countries were not, in themselves, sufficient grounds to con-
 vict them of violating the NSI, contrary to prosecutors' assertions.
 Local courts are presided over by judges who render verdicts in all cases. There
 is no trial by jury. Defendants can appeal a verdict to a district appeals court and
 to the Supreme Court. Constitutional challenges can be taken to the Constitutional
 Court, which was created in 1988.
 The Constitution provides defendants with a number of rights in criminal trials,
 including the presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, free-
 dom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the
 right of appeal. When a person is physically detained, the initial trial must be com-
 pleted within 6 months of arrest. These rights are generally observed. Trials are
 open to the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he believes spectators
 may seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense. Cases involving national security and criminal matters
 
 
 825
 are tried by the same courts. Although convictions are rarely overturned, appeals
 often result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 Human rights groups believe that many dissidents tried under past military gov-
 ernments during the 1970's and 1980's were sentenced to long prison terms on
 trumped-up charges of spying for North Korea. Furthermore, these persons, dozens
 of whom are still in jail, reportedly had been held incommunicado for up to 60 days
 after their arrest, subjected to extreme forms of torture, forced to make "confes-
 sions," and convicted after trials that did not conform to international standards for
 a fair trial. Political prisoners have been denied early parole because they refused
 to renounce real or alleged communist beliefs. Some released political prisoners
 were required to report their activities regularly to the police.
 In a landmark 1996 decision, former Presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae
 Woo and several of their close associates were convicted for their roles in the mili-
 tary takeover of the government in 1979 and 1980, the military action in the
 Kwangju civilian uprising in 1980, and corruption while in office. Chun, who argued
 that the court proceedings were unconstitutional because the statute of limitations
 had expired for these offenses, was sentenced to death. Roh was sentenced to a pris-
 on term of more than 20 years. These sentences were reduced on appeal to a life
 sentence for Chun and 17 years for Rob.
 The two former presidents were released from prison on December 22, following
 a pardon by President Kim Young Sam. Twenty-three other former officials con-
 victed in connection with these cases also received amnesty. President-elect Kim
 Dae Jung agreed to the pardons during a meeting with President Kim.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the rights of free
 speech or association or were detained for committing acts of violence or espionage.
 Some human rights monitors estimate the number of political prisoners at over 500.
 However, these monitors' definition of political prisoner often includes all persons
 imprisoned for acts that were politically motivated, without distinction as to wheth-
 er the acts themselves included violence or other criminal behavior. The number of
 poitical prisoners and detainee  s defined by international standards appears to
 number under 200.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security servies onducted varying degrees of surveillance, including wiretaps, of
 political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the NSP were de-
 signed to curb government surveillance of civilians, and appear largely to have suc-
 ceeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out brad conditions under which the monitoring
 of telephone calls, mail, and other forms of communication are legal. It requires gov-
 ernment officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the
 event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for
 those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable
 amount of illegal wiretapping still is taking place, and they assert that the lack of
 an independent body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps
 hinders the effectiveness of the Antiwiretapping Law.
 Citizens are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or read
 books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are doing
 so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausible claims
 that government informants are posted around university campuses. Persons with
 backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult to obtain some forms
 of employment or advance in such fields as government, broadcast media, and edu-
 cation.
 In July the Constitutional Court struck down regulations that previously prohib-
 ited members of the same "clan-some of which contain more than a million mem-
 bers-from marrying.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While most political discourse is unrestricted,
 under the NSL the Government limits the expression of ideas that authorities con-
 sider Communist or pro-North Korean. Broad interpretations of the NSL allow for
 restrictions on the peaceful expression of dissenting views.
 Although the Government has abandoned direct control over the news media, it
 continues to exercise indirect influence. Some officials reportedly lobby journalists
 aggressively to discourage them from writing stories critical of the Government, al-
 though this practice reportedly has significantly declined. Newspapers played an in-
 strumental role during the year in bringing to light political influence peddling asso-
 ciated with Hanbo Steel, which resulted in jail sentences for many senior govern-
 ment officials and political figures, including a son of President Kim. Nevertheless,
 
 
 the latent threat of tax investigations against parent media companies and govern-
 ment pressure on advertisers is still widely believed to encourage newspapers and
 broadcasters to soften criticism. Moreover, while the Government's anticorruption
 campagn curtailed politicians' payments of money to reporters, it did not eliminate
 them, Nevertheless, press criticism of the Government is extensive in all fields, and
 authorities have not used repressive measures to stop media reporting. Many radio
 and television stations are state supported, but they maintain a considerable degree
 of editrial independence in their news coverage.
 Journalists allege that the libel laws are used to harass publications for articles
 that are unflattering but not necessarily untrue. For example, staff of the
 Hangyoreh Sinmun daily newspaper and Mal monthly magazine were sued in Au-
 rst by the Government after publishing articles alleging that the Defense Security
 Command had posted agents on campuses to gather information on the student
 movement. Some human rights lawyers have argued that the publications had con-
 fidential documents that gave them, at a minimum, reason for believing the story
 might be true. The libel case has not yet been adjudicated.
 A foreign radio journalist was detained on December 19, based on a complaint by
 a Seoul newspaper, and charged with malicious slander for overseas reporting from
 Seoul that the Seoul newspaper corporation was in serious financial ifficulty. At
 year's end the case was unresolved, but the journalist's release on bail appeared im-
 minent.
 Prosecutors continued to indict dissidents under the NSL for producing, selling,
 or distributing pro-North Korean or pro-Communist materials. Court precedents
 allow citizens to possess these kinds of publications for purely academic use, profit,
 or curiosity, but not with the intent of subverting the State. Prosecutors have wide
 discretion in determining motives for possessing or publishing such material.
 The Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, substantial media cov-
 erage of North Korea. Television networks continued to broadcast edited versions of
 North Korean television programs, and reported extensively on United States and
 South Korean talks with North Korean officials.
 The Government Censorship Board, which screens movies for sexual or violent
 content, has followed more liberal guidelines in recent years and allowed a broader
 range of films to be released.
 In November Suh Jun Shik, the publisher of a daily human rights newsletter in
 Seoul, was arrested along with several other activists under the NSL for attempting
 to screen an allegedly pro-North Korean movie. The fim "Red Hunt," depicted the
 Cheju Island insurgency of the late 1940's. Suh and his human rights group
 Saran bang had struggled with authorities over showing "Red Hunt" and other
 films for several months. They organized a festival in the fall to present human
 rights-related movies from a number of different countries and refused, on principle,
 to submit the films to government authorities for approval. The law on censorship
 is unclear. Although the Constitutional Court ruled last year that prescreening by
 a censorship boar no longer is required, the Government apparently still has the
 authority to prevent a fim from being shown due to its pornographic or political
 content.
 Suh's organization had planned to screen "Red Hunt" and other films at Hongik
 University in Seoul, but the University canceled the festival, reportedly as a result
 of government pressure. This led to demonstrations at the University and attempts
 by student groups to show the films despite the lack of university approval. Ulti-
 mately, authorities arrested Suh and several other activists, searched the offices of
 Sarangbang, and confiscated material on the festival.
 In 1994 authorities began investigating eight Kyongsang University professors on
 the grounds that their textbook on Korean society endorsed North Korean ideology.
 This investigation was regarded by much of the scholarly community as a serious
 infringement of academic freedom. However, prsecutrs who sought to arrest sev-
 eral of the professors under the NSL were denied warrants by a judge who con-
 cluded that authorities had not provided evidence of the scholars' pro-Communist
 activities. This investigation has been closed, and no instances of prosecution for
 scholarly writing were reported during the year. However, student groups plausibly
 report the presence of government informants on university campuses (see Section
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine public order.
 The law forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authori-
 ties and requires that the plice be notified in advance of demonstrations of all
 types, including political rallies. Police must notify organizers if they consider the
 event impermissible under this law.
 
 
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and there are no registration
 requirements. Associations except those whose aim is deemed by the Government
 tobe the overthrow of the State operate freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens are allowed to move freely throughout the country, but
 police may restrict the movements of some former prisoners. Foreign travel is gen-
 erally unrestricted, but travel to North Korea must be approved by the Government.
 To obtain approval, potential visitors must demonstrate that their trip does not
 have a political purpose-that is, to praise North Korea or criticize the South Ko-
 rean Government. Travelers to NorthKorea who do not receive government permis-
 sion are likely to be arrested upon their return to South Korea. For example, novel-
 ist Kim Ha Ki, who traveled to the North in 1996, was sentenced in February to
 31/2 years in prison. The court said that the novelist revealed state secrets to North
 Korean authorities during his visit.
 In the past, the Government forbade some Koreans convicted of politically related
 crimes from returning to Korea, and some citizens still face sanctions if they return.
 In 1994 the NSP lifted the entry ban on composer Yun I Sang, a dissident who had
 been living in Berlin for many years. However, the Government required that he
 refrain from any political activity while in Korea and that he give an accounting
 of his political activities overseas before authorities would allow him into the coun-
 try. Yun refused these conditions and decided against returning to South Korea. He
 died abroad in 1995.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Government
 guidelines provide for offering temporary refuge in the case of a mass influx of asy-
 lum seekers. However, the issue of provision of first asylum did not arise in 1997.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they had a
 fear of persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to elect their own government. The Constitution, as
 amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for a mixed
 system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral National
 Assembly. The President serves a single 5-year term and may not be reelected. The
 National Assmblys term is 4 years. All citizens 20 years of age or above have the
 right to vote, and elections are held by secret ballot.
 Because of cultural traditions and discrimination, women occupy few important
 positions in government. The only woman in the Cabinet is the Second Minister for
 Political Affairs, whose portfolio is Women's Affairs. Nine female legislators were
 elected to the 299-seat National Assembly, one of whom chairs a special committee
 on women's affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights, and they operate without government restriction. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, Sarangbang, the Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the National Council of Churches in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, and
 "Mingahyup," an association of the families of political prisoners. These groups pub-
 lish reports on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 both inside and outside the country. Government and ruling party officials generally
 have been willing to meet with international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and equal opportunity statutes forbid discrimination on the
 basis of race, sex, religion, disability, or social status, and the Government respects
 these provisions. However, traditional attitudes limit opportunities for women and
 the disabled. Ethnic minorities face both legal and societal discrimination.
 Women.-Violence against women remains a problem, and some women's rights
 groups maintain that such violence, including spousal abuse, has worsened in the
 past few years. The law does not provide adequate protection to victims of abuse.
 Rape remained a serious problem, with about 5,500 cases reported in 1996 (the
 last year for which statistics are available). Many incidents of rape go unreported
 because of the stigma associated with being a rape victim. The activities of a num-
 ber of women's groups have increased awareness of the importance of reporting and
 
 
 828
 prosecuting rapes, as well as offenses such as sexual harassment in the workplace.
 According to women's rights groups, cases involving sexual harassment or rape gen-
 erally go unprosecuted, and perpetrators, if convicted, often receive very light- sen-
 tences.
 The amended Family Law, which went into effect in 1991, permits women to head
 a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's property, and al-
 lows a woman to maintain greater contact with her offspring after a divorce. Al-
 though the revisions helped abused women, divorce remains a social taboo, and
 there is little government or private assistance for divorced women. These factors,
 plus the fact that divorced women have limited employment opportunities and have
 difficulty remarrying, forces some women to stay in abusive situations. The Govern-
 ment has created some shelters for battered women and increased the number of
 child care facilities, giving women in abusive situations more options, but women's
 rights groups say that they fall far short of effectively dealing with the problem.
 A conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to men socially
 and economically. Despite the passage of equal employment opportunity legislation
 in 1988, few women work as company executives. Women have full access to edu-
 cation, and social mores and attitudes gradually have begun to change. The major
 political parties, for example, are making more efforts to recruit women; the Min-
 istry of Women's Affairs continued its efforts to expand employment opportunities;
 and the military, for the first time, placed a woman in command of a training regi-
 ment.
 Children.-The Government provides high-quality elementary education to all
 children free of charge, and most obtain a good secondary education. High-quality
 health care facilities are widely available to children.
 Child abuse does not appear-to be a significant problem, but it has not been stud-
 ied extensively, and statistics on such abuse are limited. About 80 cases were re-
 ported during the year. Although experts believe that a number of cases go unre-
 ported, instances of child abuse still appear to be relatively rare. The Seoul metro-
 politan government runs a children's counseling center, which investigates reports
 of abuse, counsels families, nd cares for runaway children. In the absence of a spe-
 cific law against child abuse, however, it is not possible to prosecute and punish
 child abusers unless they commit a crime punishable under a separate law.
 The traditional preference for male children continues, although it is less evident
 among people in their twenties and thirties. Although the law bans fetal testing ex-
 cept'for those cases when a woman's life is in danger, a hereditary disease would
 be passed along, or in case of rape or incest-such testing and the subsequent termi-
 nation of pregnancies with female fetuses frequently occur. The Government has ex-
 pressed concern about the widening disparity in male and female birth rates.
 People With Disabilities.-Although measures aimed at creating opportunities for
 the disabled have been taken, public facilities for their everyday care and use re-
 mained inadequate. However, there is no legal discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services.
 In 1995 the Government expanded job training programs, medical benefits, and
 welfare facilities for disabled citizens. Since 1991 firms with over 300 employees
 have been required by law either to hire disabled workers or pay a fee. Surveys indi-
 cate that most companies either paid the fee or evaded the law. After human rights
 groups had publicized one such survey in 1996, the Labor Ministry increased the
 subsidies provided to companies that hire the disabled. Nonetheless, hiring of the
 disabled remains below target levels. New public buildings are required to include
 facilities for the disabled, such as a ramp access to entrances, a wheelchair lift, and
 special parking spaces. The Health and Welfare Ministry has announced that exist-
 ing government buildings must be retrofitted with these facilities over the next 7
 years.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant size. Citizenship is based
 on blood, not location of birth, and Koreans must show as proof their family geneal-
 ogy. Thus, ethnic Chinese born and resident in Korea cannot obtain citizenship or
 become public servants, and may have difficulty being hired by some major corpora-
 tions. Due to legal as well as societal discrimination, many formerly resident ethnic
 Chinese have emigrated to other countries since the 1970's. The law permits only
 fathers to transmit citizenship. Therefore, children born with Korean mothers but
 foreign fathers have difficulty obtaining citizenship. Amerasian children usually are
 able to obtain citizenship when their biological fathers are not identified.
 Amerasians face no legal discrimination, but informal discrimination is prevalent,
 making it more difficult for them to succeed in academia, business, or government.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of public sector employees and teachers, the right to free association. In the govern-
 ment sector, unions are restricted to organizing blue-collar workers in such agencies
 as the postal service, railways, telecommunications, and the national medical center.
 As few as two employees may form a union. Until 1997 the Trade Union Law speci-
 fied that only one union was permitted at each workplace. However, labor law
 changes in March authorize the formation of competing unions from the year 2002.
 All unions are required to notify the authorities when formed or dissolved. About
 10 percent of workers belong to a union.
 In the past, the Government did not formally recognize labor federations that
 were not affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor groupings-the
 Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Independent Korean Federa-
 tion of Clerical and Financial Workers. In the past several years, however, the
 Labor Ministry officially recognized some independent white-collar federations rep-
 resenting hospital workers, journalists, and office workers at construction firms and
 government research institutes. The courts ruled in 1992 that affiliation with the
 FKTU was not required to be registered as a legal labor federation. In March the
 National Assembly passed a labor reform bill that cleared the way to authorize dis-
 sident federations, such as the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).
 However, the KCTU allowed the outlawed teachers union to affiliate with it, and
 consequently in May the Government refused to grant it official authorization. In
 practice, labor federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry have oper-
 ated without government interference.
 The Government arrested and tried unionists who allegedly instigated violent
 strikes or illegally disrupted normal business operations. The Government also in-
 dicted unionists who participated in a general strike in January conducted to pro-
 test the passge in December of a labor law bill that labor groups believed was un-
 favorable to labor, and was passed in an undemocratic manner. However, unionists
 ultimately were not punishe for their participation in the general strike.
 The Government retained the ban on teachers unions, arguing that organizations
 such as the Korean Teachers Union (Chonkyojo) are essentially political organiza-
 tions with radical aims. Several teachers were suspended temporarily from their
 jobs because they were union leaders.
 Labor laws prohibiting political activities by unions were rescinded in March. Cur-
 rently unions are regulated by election laws that apply to other social organizations.
 These regulations prohibit donations by unions (and other social organizations) to
 political parties. Some trade unionists have temporarily resigned from their union
 posts to run for office.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, unions in enterprises determined to be of "essential public inter-
 est," including public transportation, utilities, public health, banking, and tele-
 communications, can be ordered to submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu
 of striking. In practice, however, the Government rarely imposes arbitration. The
 number of labor disputes has declined in recent years. According to Labor Ministry
 statistics, about 90 strikes occurred in 1996, the last year for which complete data
 are available. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act requires unions to notify the
 Labor Ministry of their intention to strike, and it mandates a 10-day "cooling-off pe-
 riod" before a work stoppage may legally begin, 15 days in public interest sectors.
 Labor laws prohibit retribution against workers who have conducted a legal strike
 and allow workers to file complaints of unfair labor practices against employers.
 The FKTU and KCTU are affiliated with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU). Most of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain af-
 filiations with international trade secretariats, as does the KCTU Metalworkers
 Council. In February the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on
 Freedom of Association criticized some aspects of the labor laws, such as the prohi-
 bition on organizing unions for teachers and government employees.
 In recent years, the Government has cultivated a more neutral stance in labor dis-
 putes. Authorities rarely sent police to quell labor disturbances, and there were no
 reports of employer-hired squads assaulting workers in 1997.
 Since July 1991, South Korea has been suspended from the U.S. Overseas Private
 Investment Corporation (OPIC) insurance programs because of the Government's in-
 fiingements on freedom of association and other worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivel.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law provide for the right of workers to collective bargaining and collec-
 tive action. This law also empowers workers to file complaints of unfair labor prac-
 tices against employers who interfere with union organizing or practice discrimina-
 
 
 830
 tion against union members. Employers found guilty of unfair practices can be re-
 quired to reinstate workers who were fired for union activities.
 Extensive collective bargaining is practiced, even with unions whose federations
 are not legally recognized by the Government. The labor laws do not extend the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to teachers, defense industry workers, or
 government employees, including workers at state- or publicly-ran enterprises.
 There is no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiautonomous agency of the Labor Ministry that adjudicates dis-
 putes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjstment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is omposed of equal numbers of representatives of labor and management, plus
 neutralexports who represent the "public interest." Local labor commissions are em-
 powered to decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices
 and to medate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. Arbitration can be
 made compulsory in sectors of the economy (e.g., utilities and transportation) that
 are deemed essential to public welfare.
 In the past, regulations forbade intervention in disputes by so-called third-parties,
 such as labor federations not recognized by the Government. Labor laws were re-
 vised in March to lift the ban on third-party intervention and allow dissident federa-
 tions to assist member unions involved in a strike.
 Enterprises in the two export processing zones (EPZ's) had been designated by the
 Government as public interest enterprises. Workers in these enterprises, whose
 rights to organize were formally restricted, have gradually been given all the rights
 enjoyed by workers in other sectors of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor, including forced labor by children, is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ermnent prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition (see
 Section 6.c.). The Labor Standards Law prohibits the employment of persons under
 the age of 15 without a special employment certificate from the Labor Ministry. Be-
 cause education is compulsory through middle school (about age 14), few special em-
 ployment certificates are issued for full-time employment. Some children are allowed
 to hold part-time jobs such as selling newspapers. To obtain employment, children
 under age 18 must have written approval from their parents or guardians. Employ-
 era may require minors to work only a limited number of overtime hours and are
 prohibited from employing them at night without special permission from the Labor
 Ministry. Child labor laws and regulations are clear and usually enforced when vio-
 lations are found, but the Government employs too few inspectors to carry out regu-
 lar inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage in 1988, and the minimum wage level is reviewed annually. As of September,
 the minimum wage was raised to approximately $1.63 (1,485 won) per hour. Compa-
 nies with fewer than 10 employees are exempt from this law. Due to the tight labor
 market, however, most firms pay wages well above the minimum to attract and re-
 tain workers. The FKTU and other labor organizations assert that the current mini-
 mum wage does not meet the basic requirements of urban workers. In fact, a worker
 earning the minimum wage would have difficulty in providing a decent standard of
 iving for himself and his family, despite the fringe benefits, such as transportation
 expenses, with which companies normally supplement salaries. (However, the
 money an average blue-collar worker takes home in overtime and bonuses signifi-
 cantly raises the total compensation package.) According to the Ministry of Health
 and Welfare, 3.1 percent of the population lived below the poverty level in 1996.
 Foreign workers, most of whom come from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh,
 Nepal, and Pakistan, often face difficult working conditions. The Government sought
 to ameliorate the problems of illegal workers by creating a program that allowed
 about 60,000 foreign workers to enter Korea legally to work at established wages
 with legal safeguards. Illegal foreign workers, who number more than 100,000, still
 suffer significant hardships in the workplace. It is difficult for illegal workers to
 seek relief for loss of pay or unsatisfactory living and workin conditions because
 they face the threat of being deported. The Government has, however, established
 counseling centers that hear complaints from illegal foreign workers about such is-
 sues as overdue wages and industrial accidents. Foreigners working as language
 teachers have complained that language institutes that hired them frequently vio-
 lated employment contracts, for which the legal system provided insufficient re-
 dress.
 Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in 1989 brought the maximum
 regular workweek to 44 hours, with provision for overtime to be compensated at a
 
 
 831
 higher wage. The law also provides for a 24-hour rest period each week. Labor laws
 were revised in March to establish a flexible hours system, according to which em-
 ployers could require laborers to work up to 48 hours during certain weeks without
 paying overtime, as long as average weekly hours for 2-weeks did not exceed 44.
 If a union agreed to a further loosening of the rules, management could ask employ-
 ees to work up to 56 hours in a given week. The legislation established a daily cap
 on the working day of 12 hours. Labor groups claim that the Government does not
 adequately enforce maximum workweek provisions at small companies.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the accident rate is unusu-
 ally high by international standards. However, this rate continues to decline gradu-
 ally due to improved occupational safety programs and union pressure for better
 working conditions. The Labor Ministry still lacks enough inspectors to enforce the
 laws fully. The Industrial Safety and Health Law does not guarantee security for
 workers who remove themselves from dangerous work environments.
