 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy with an elected
 president and legislature. Except for a coup attempt in 1981,
 The Gambia has had a history of political stability under the
 leadership of its only President since independence in 1965,
 Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP)
 has dominated the unicameral Parliament, but several
 opposition parties participate in the political process,
 including two new political parties formed in 1986. In the
 parliamentary and presidential elections held in March 1987,
 President Jawara was reelected by a large margin, and PPP
 candidates won an overwhelming majority in Parliament.
 The confederation between The Gambia and Senegal, established
 in 1982 following the coup attempt, formally ended in
 September 1989, following Senegal's withdrawal of its security
 forces from The Gambia. The two countries disagreed over the
 function and ultimate purpose of the confederation, with The
 Gambia insisting upon its sovereignty and Senegal favoring a
 more fully integrated economic union. The Gambia has a small
 army with an attached naval unit organized and trained by
 British officers. Its gendarmerie forces, formerly headed by
 Senegalese officers, are now under Gambian leadership. The
 combined confederal battalion, which had been two-thirds
 Senegalese and one-third Gambian, was disbanded in September
 1989.
 The Gambia's estimated population of 784,000 consists largely
 of subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts (peanuts),
 the country's primary export crop. The Gambia in 1989
 continued a stringent program of economic reform which met the
 targets agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, the
 World Bank, and other donors. The program has allowed The
 Gambia to reschedule its external debt and to receive new loan
 and grant assistance.
 The Gambia has made particular efforts to promote observance
 of human rights, including the subject in its Constitution of
 April 24, 1970. In June the Organization of African Unity's
 (OAU) Commission on Human and People's Rights established its
 headquarters in Banjul. The Gambian Government founded a
 Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, in conjunction
 with the OAU headquarters, to serve as a research institution
 and training center for human rights issues.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no instances of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no allegations of torture in 1989. The
 Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, and
 degrading punishment.

 THE G .BIA
 Prison conditions are severe, and there have been occasional
 reports of mistreatment of prisoners. The deaths of several
 inmates in 1988 at one prison due to inadequate diet was
 investigated by a Presidential Commission on Prison
 Conditions. The Commission found nutritional deficiencies and
 some overcrowding, and its recommendations led to prison
 reforms, including the passage of legislation specifying an
 adequate prison diet. The Government allows prison visits by
 representatives of the local Red Cross and by close family
 members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, well-developed constitutional
 and le~al proceduxes govern the arrest, detention, and trial
 of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, a
 detained person must be brought to trial within 1 week of
 arrest. This waiting period, however, can be extended twice,
 making 21 days the maximum period of detention before trial.
 In 1987 the Government detained several suspected members of
 the MovemenO for Justice in Africa, which was banned in 1980.
 They were later released without charges being brought on
 political grounds, although some were charged and tried for
 possession of cannabis. There were no political detainees
 being held at the end of 1989. There are some self-exiled
 opposition elements who would be arrested for suspected
 involvement in the 1981 coup attempt if they returned to The
 Gambia, e.g., the alleged leader of the plot, Kukoi Samba
 Sanyang.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is observed in
 marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers
 marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure
 and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on
 English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context,
 governs criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Sharila, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, an& the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, an accused person may face
 charges indefinitely, since there is no maximum time limit for
 completing the investigation and bringing the case to trial.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the
 Court of Appeals, the country's highest tribunal.
 While the judiciary operates independ6ntly and is free of
 government interference, judges are appointed by the
 Government. Because of the shortage of legal professionals in
 The Gambia, the legal system is staffed in part by j-odges and
 prosecuting and defense attorneys from other English-speaking
 countries having the same basic legal system as the Gambia.
 An opposition journalist, Sana Manneh, editor of The Torch,
 accused four cabinet ministers of corruption in 1988 and
 
 
 132
 THE GAMBIA
 subsequently was charged with libeling three of them in
 October 1988. A 4-month trial ensued, avidly followed by the
 private press and the public. In April Manneh was acquitted
 on two counts of libel and given a warning for a third, less
 serious count. The Government appealed this decision, and a
 hearing date is set for March 1990.
 The Government released 40 prisoners in December 1988 in honor
 of the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights. In February 1989, in commemoration of Gambian
 independence, President Jawara announced the release of 50
 more prisoners, some of whom had participated in the 1981 coup
 attempt. Currently, there are no known political prisoners in
 The Gambia.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property. It
 does permit a search to which a suspect submits voluntarily or
 if it is reasonably required in the interest of nationai
 defense or public welfare. Under the Gambian criminal code,
 search warrants based on probable cause are issued by
 magistrates upon application by the police. The code also
 specifies that police may conduct a search of a private
 residence while a crime is in progress. There are a few
 police and military checkpoints in and around Banjul, which
 periodically stop drivers and search vehicles.
 The rights of family are of extreme importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not normally intrude in family
 matters. Family planning is encouraged but not enforced.
 There is no effort to censor or control personal
 correspondence or communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 While opposition parties have been relatively inactive since
 the 1987 elections, members freely express their opinions
 about the Government and ruling party.
 The Government does not attempt to censor published materials,
 whether they originate within or outside the country. In
 practical terms, The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, multilingual population, does not support
 an active press. There are no daily newspapers. The
 Government and the People's Progressive Party have newspapers
 which are published on a biweekly or monthly basis. There are
 several independent, intermittently published, mimeographed
 newssheets. Both the opposition and the independent press are
 openly critical of the Government. A biweekly mimeographed
 paper, sponsored by a legal Socialist party, has been
 particularly vocal in condemning the governing party. There
 is, however, some degree of self-censorship in the government-
 owned media, which exercises restraint in reporting criticism
 of the Government. During the libel trial of the journalist
 who accused four cabinet ministers .of corruption, Radio Gambia
 and the official press ceased coverage after the first week of
 
 
 133
 THE GAMBIA
 the trial. However, the Socialist paper reported on the daily
 events of the trial and was widely distributed; the
 international press also covered the story.
 There is no television in The Gambia, although Seneglese
 broadcasts can be received. The Government dominates the
 media through Radio Gambia. There have been no reported
 instance, of government interference with the one commercial
 radio station, which mainly broadcasts music. Foreign
 magazites and newspapers are available in the capital. There
 is no university in The Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In gendral, there is no interference with the freedom of
 association and assembly which is provided for in the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 peaceful assembly but requires that these meetings be open to
 the public. However, the Movement for Justice in Africa,
 which was suspected of involvement in the 1981 coup attempt,
 is banned.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, ane religion are observed in practice. The State is
 secular, although Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a sftall Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related activities openly and freely.
 There is no evidence of discrimination in employment,
 education, or in other areas of Gambian life on religious
 grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals.
 There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Internally, police and military checkpoints exist in
 and around Banjul, but there is no evidence that police harass
 travelez. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the "
 iphabitants of Senegal- Guinea-Bisgau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and
 Mauritanf*. people tend to move freely across borders, which
 are poorly markedPanrd-difficult to police. Under the
 confederation treaty of 1981, neither Gambians nor Senegalese
 have needed passpirts or visas to travel to or reside in the
 other country. It is not clear whether this will change as a
 result of the recent dissolution- of the confedeation. The-
 Gambia'alsb-recognizes the Economic Comsmunity"of West frfican
 States' (ECOMAS) protocol which allows entry of ECOWAS country
 citizenw for up to 9Q days without visas.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The President and the Members of Parliament are popularly
 elected, as are the district councils and the chiefs, who
 exercise traditional authority in the villages and compounds.
 Presidential and parliamentary elections are held every 5
 years. Citizens must be at least 18 years of age to vote.
 Balloting is secret, and measures are employed to assure that
 illiterate voters understand the choices and voting
 procedure. A functioning multiparty system exists in The
 Gambia even though the People's Progressive Party under the
 leadership of President Jawara has been in power since
 independence. The principal opposition party, the National
 Convention Party (NCP), contests both national and district
 elections. Two newly formed opposition parties, the Gambia
 People's Party (GPP) and the People's Democratic Organization
 for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS), contested for office
 in the March 1987 presidential and parliamentary elections.
 Campaigning was vigorous, active, and open to all parties.
 The ruling PPP won by an overwhelming majority and now holds
 31 of 36 elective seats in the Parliament. The NCP was the
 only opposition party to win seats. The opposition charged
 that the election was manipulated by the Government but did
 not provide evidence to support its allegations. The
 opposition also charged, with some justification, that the PPP
 benefited from its control of Radio Gambia and access to
 government vehicles for campaigning.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to charges of human rights
 violations and permits visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of detainees and the
 trial process. There were no reported requests by such
 organizations for investigation of alleged human rights abuses
 in The Gambia during 1989. The Gambia is an active member of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission and of the
 Organization of African Unity's (OAU) Commission on Human and
 Peoples' Rights. It took the initiative in persuading the OAU
 to locate the Commission in Banjul which opened in June 1989.
 The Government has also established the African Centre for
 Democracy and Human nights Studies in conjunction with the OAU
 Commission, which held its first colloquium in November.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Gambian population is overwhelmingly Muslim and rural,
 with 85 percent living in villages. While personal initiative
 and choice are valued, there is considerable emphasis on the
 collective aspects of rights and privileges. Traditional
 views, especially about the role of women in society, are
 changing, but very slowly. Marriages are still often
 arranged, and Muslim tradition allows for polygamy. Domestic
 violence (wife beating) and female circumcision are common
 practices in The Gambia as in the region, reinforced by
 traditional beliefs. As a result, the Government has been
 passive in attempting to counter these practices. However,
 the Women's Bureau in the Office of.the President conducted a
 study in late 1989 of women's rights, including specific
 
 
 questions on domestic violence, that will be used as the basis
 for recommendations to the law reform commission. The Women's
 Bureau conducts an ongoing campaign in the rural areas to make
 women aware of their legal rights-in divorce, property
 matters, and in cases of assault.
 In villages the women continue to perform work in the field
 and provide for the majority of local food production. Women
 also play an important role in the small, modern wage sector
 of the economy. Most are in semiskilled jobs (e.g., assembly
 work, handicraft shops, bus conductors), very few are in
 skilled trades (e.g., carpentry, auto repair), and a small but
 growing number are in midlevel supervisory positions (e.g.,
 civil service, tourist hotels, and banks). There is no wage
 or benefits discrimination for jobs that are performed both by
 men and women. Females comprise over one-third of the
 students in primary school, and, with growing educational
 opportunities, women are beginning to participate increasingly
 in the professions and in political life.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Administration Act specifies that workers are free
 to form associations, including trade unions. However, less
 than 20 percent of the work force is engaged in the modern
 wage sector of the economy, where unions normally are active.
 The Gambian Workers' Confederation (GWC) and the Gambian
 Workers Union (GWU), are the two main independent and
 competing umbrella organizations, and both are recognized by,
 and have a good working relationship with, the Government.
 The Labor Administration Act authorizes strikes. However,
 because of a required 14-day cooling off period (21 days in
 essential services), government conciliation efforts, and the
 poor bargaining strength of the unions, few strikes actually
 occur. In September about 200 workers of the China Building
 Material Company outside of Banjul went on strike following
 the dismissal of a worker; the outstanding issues appeared to
 be differences between the Chinese management and Gambian
 labor practices.
 As a result of an incomplete merger effort between the GWC and
 the GWU, both organizations claim affiliation to the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU);
 however, the ICFTU continues to recognize the GWU as its
 affiliate. Both unions are affiliated with the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity. In addition, there are two
 other Gambian labor confederations, the Gambian Labor
 Confederation, which is affiliated with the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions, and the Gambian
 Trade Union Congress, which is affiliated with the World
 Confederation of Labor. The Gambia is not a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the Labor Administration Act, workers have the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. While trade unions are
 small and fragmented, collective bargaining agreements in May
 resulted in revised minimum wage rates for categories of
 workers in construction, carpentry, electrical engineering,
 transportation, shipyards, hotels, and other occupations.
 There is no export processing zone in The Gambia. Labor laws
 
 
 136.
 THE GAMBIA
 are applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Criminal Code prohibits compulsory labor. There is no
 evidence of forced or compulsory labor in The Gambia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The official minimum age for employment is 18. However,
 because of the paucity of secondary school opportunities, most
 children complete their formal education by age 14 and
 informally enter the work force. Control of child labor does
 not apply to customary chores on family farms or street
 trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages and hours of work are determined by the Joint
 Industrial Council, pursuant to the Labor Administration Act,
 which has representation from employees, employers, and
 government. For example, the minimum wage for an unskilled
 laborer is approximately $1.20 per day, usually supplemented
 with transport and other allowances. The wages are higher for
 various skilled laborers, with the minimum under the May 1989
 agreement set at $2.89 per day for foremen and hotel chefs.
 The private sector generally has provision for overtime pay.
 These minimum wages do not provide for a decent standard of
 living. However, most Gambians do not live on one worker's
 earnings and rely on the extended family system, including
 often some subsistence farming.
 The workweek for government workers is four 8-hour days, with
 a half day on Friday. Allowance is made for half-hour lunch
 breaks. For the private sector, there are four 8-hour days
 with half days on Fridays and Saturdays, making a 40-hour
 workweek. Government employees are entitled to 1 month's paid
 leave after 1 year of service; private sector employees
 receive 15 days of paid annual leave.
 Under the Factory Act, the Minister of Labor is given
 authority to regulate factory health and safety, accident
 prevention, and dangerous trades and to appoint inspectors to
 ensure compliance. However, this system is less than fully
 satisfactory, owing to the shortage of inspectors. The
 Government announced in 1987 that it would submit to
 Parliament a new labor code to replace obsolete-labor laws;
 and a new industrial injluries compensation act to replace the
 existing workmen's compensation act. However, no action to
 this end had been taken by the end of 1989.
