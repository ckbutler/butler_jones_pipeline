 GHANA
 Ghana continues its transition from a single-party, authoritarian system to a con-
 stitutional democracy. Flight Lieutenant (ret.) Jerry John Rawlings has ruled the
 country for 16 years. He became the first President of the Fourth Republic following
 controversial elections in 1992. This ended 11 years of authoritarian rule under
 Rawlings and his Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), which had seized
 power from an elected government in 1981. The opposition fully contested the De-
 cember 1996 presidential and parliamentary elections, which were described as
 peaceful, free, and transparent by domestic and international observers. President
 Rawlings was reelected with 57 percent of the popular vote. Rawling's National
 Democratic Congress (NDC) party won 133 of the Parliament's 200 seats, just short
 of the two-thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. The Constitution
 calls for a system of checks and balances, with an executive branch headed by the
 President, a unicameral parliament, an independent judiciary, and several autono-
 mous commissions, such as the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative
 Justice (CHRAJ). In reality this system of checks and balances is circumscribed by
 a parliament monopolized by the President's p arty, a hesitant judicial service, and
 a system-wide lack of resources that hobbles the effectiveness of all three branches.
 The presence of a significant number of oppositionpariiamentarians since January
 has led to increased scrutiny of the Government's activities. The judiciary is subject
 to executive influence and lacks adequate resources.
 Several security organizations report to various government departments. The po-
 lice, under the jurisdiction of an eight-member Police Council, are responsible for
 maintaining law and order. A separate department, the Bureau of National Inves-
 tigations (BNI), handles cases considered critical to state security and answers di-
 rectly to the executive branich. Although the security apparatus is controlled by and
 responsive to the Government, monitoring, supervision, and education of the police
 in particular remain poor. Credible allegations continue of police involvement in
 human rights abuses, especially in areas remote from the capital.
 
 
 The economy remains highly dependent on agriculture, with about 45 percent of
 gross domestic product and 70 percent of employment derived from this sector. Gold,
 cocoa, and timber are the traditional sources of exort earnings, with gold growing
 in importance. The economy grew at an estimated rate of 5.5 percent in 1997, up
 from the 5.2 percent recordedin 1996. Increased gold p roduction and a good cocoa
 harvest accounted for the slightly higher gwth rate. There was improved growth
 in service industries and manufactuing,ut mining slowed. The privatization of
 state-owned enterprises continues, but the pace of divestiture remains slow. Infla-
 tion fell from 45 percent at the end of 1996 to an average of 30 percent during the
 year. The gross domestic product per capita is approximately $340.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, but problems remain
 in several areas. Police used excessive force, which resulted in a number of
 extrajudicial killings, as well as injuries during attempts at crowd control. There
 were continued credible reports that members of the police beat prisoners and other
 citizens; arbitrarily arrested and detained persons; and infringed on citizens' rights
 to privacy. Municipal security forces, which fall outside the regular police service,
 injured a number of persons by using excessive force to control street vendors and
 public demonstrations. Prison conditions remained harsh, and prolonged pretrial de-
 tention remained a problem. In a prison riot in April in Kumasi, prison officers in-
 jured five prisoners. Inadequate resources and a system vulnerable to political influ-
 ence compromised the integrity of the overburdened judicial system. The Govern-
 ment closed its case on the deaths of four demonstrators during a 1995
 antigovernment protest without any investigation and did not press charges in most
 of the fatalities caused by police and customs officers. It did not press charges in
 the shooting deaths of two demonstrators in a protest in Kumasi against the semi-
 autonomous energy company.
 The Government continued to pressure the media. It resorted to a rarely used
 criminal libel law to prosecute three independent journalists, and many observers
 feared that these cases signaled a renewal of press harassment by the Government.
 The trials were postponed repeatedly, and one of the cases subsequently was
 dropped. The independent press continued its vigorous and outspoken criticism of
 various government policies. Seven independent radio stations operated in Accra
 and new stations opened throughout the country. In April the Government issued
 a white paper rejecting some of the adverse findings against three government offi-
 cials in the 1996 report issued by the CHRAJ. The CHRAJ issued a rebuttal to the
 white paper.
 Traditional practices still result in considerable discrimination against and abuse
 of women and children, with violence against women a particular problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, on at least six separate occasions in attempting to control crowds,
 poorly trained and ill-equipped police killed at least five citizens and injured at least
 seven, reportedly as a result of stray bullets from warning shots. In at least five
 other incidents, police or customs officials shot and killed five suspects
 extrajudicially. One police officer was remanded for shooting a taxibus driver's as-
 sistant to death after the driver failed to stop following a traffic violation. Although
 the Government acknowledges and often denounces the actions of the police, the
 Government has been unable to curb police excesses. The Government took no ac-
 tion against police officers responsible for accidental killings in December 1995 and
 January 1996.
 In March police fired warning shots into a crowd of demonstrators in Kumasi who
 were protesting against the semiautonomous energy company and killed two per-
 sons. The Minister of Interior stated that the police were to blame and rec-
 ommended that the Government compensate the families of the victims. However,
 the police officials responsible were not identified or disciplined.
 Stray bullets fired by po ie killed two teenagers during a riot over months of ac-
 cumulated rubbish in an Accra slum on October 30. After police and military forces
 quelled a riot by some 600 residents, 1 demonstrator died on the scene and another
 2 were critically injured, 1 of whom died subsequently. Press accounts say that two
 teenagers died, but the police maintain only one died and that the two who were
 critically injured are still alive. Rubbish pits in Nima, one of Accra's worst slums,
 were choked with refuse, including human excrement, after not having been cleaned
 for months. Residents of the predominately Muslim area protested by piling garbage
 in the middle of a main street and carting trash to the doorstep of their assembly-
 man. The assemblyman reportedly called for reinforcements, including the police,
 
 
 134
 the Inspector General of Police, the mayor, and the Interior Minister. The police
 claimed they tried to quell the riot with tear gas and used live ammunition to fire
 warning shots after running out of rubber bullets. Authorities allegedly arrested
 people in their homes and tried to extract others from a mosque to arrest them. It
 took 8 hours to restore order. A total of 76 people were arrested. The Interior Min-
 ister testified before Parliament that the lives of the police were threatened before
 they resorted to the use of arms.
 Polie shot and killed a 43-year-old auto mechanic during an antinarcotics raid
 on November 9 in Ho, the Volta regional capital. A joint pice-nmitary task force
 had cordoned off the well-known criminal neighborhood of Bankoe-Muviefe and ap-
 peared to be seeking the victim, known as Rasta Napo, who had a previous criminal
 history. The task force of about 20 men went to the victim's house and, during a
 confrontation, shot the victim. According to relatives, the shooting occurred when
 Na    was trying to go back inside his house, and a police officer shot him in the
 bar- He allege y was shot again and stabbed with a police bayonet. According to
 police, Napo charged the police with a bayonet and dagger, refusing to retreat ater
 a whistle and a warning shot. Another shot was fired, hitting Napo in the head.
 In response to the shooting, about 250 youths staged a 3-hour march during the fol-
 lowing morning to protest what they described as an extrajudicial killing and an act
 of barbarism. They asked the district chief executive for an independent investiga-
 tion of the incident, which was initiated but was without result at year's end (see
 Sections Lc. and 1.d.).
 One civilian and one police officer were killed during a clash between police and
 citizens on November 1, after 35 police officers stormed the Akwatia diamond mar-
 ket to arrest illegal alien diamond dealers. A mob, which eventually numbered
 5,000, attacked the police. Human rights activists contend that a police warning
 shot intended to disperse the crowd killed one civilian. However, the Interior Min-
 ister told Parliament that the civilian death resulted from a mob member's reckless
 firing of a gun seized from the police in the melee. The mob seriously injured nine
 police officers, including one who later died. On November 16, police arrested 2,000
 people in apparent retaliation for the attack. Authorities conducted a dawn raid in
 Akwatia, and rousted males from their beds beating them with weapons, batons,
 and ropes, and hauled them to the police station. Eventually, a majority of those
 arrested were released.
 On November 30, a policeman shot and killed a taxibus driver's assistant in
 Kaneshie, a neighborhood of Accra, when the vehicle failed to stop after driving
 through a one-way lane. The driver was later caught and beaten by army and police
 personnel. The policeman responsible for the killing was jailed p ending "immediate
 and full-scale investigations,  according to the police commander, who denounced
 the action regardless of whether the driver had violated a traffic law. At year's end,
 the policeman was in custody awaiting the Attorney General's advice and deter-
 mination of charges.
 Customs officers were responsible for the shooting deaths of two individuals, a
 man suspected of driving a stolen car and a man suspected of smuggling. On Sep-
 tember 30, one man was shot after ignoring an order to stop on reaching the barrier
 at Dabala near the Togolese border. He was suspected of driving a stolen car. In
 early November, another man was killed after also ignoring an order to stp at the
 Dabala customs check point. The customs officer chased the victim by car and shot
 him in a nearby village. At year's end, investigations were continuing.
 Police in Acera fired on a car full of youths in the predawn hours of December
 21, killing a 20-year-old man and injuring another. A police sokesman stated that
 the officers were responding to a report otan armed robbenr.  en they approached
 the site of the alleged robbery, the students' vehicle reportedly refusedto yield the
 right of way or heed the police vehicle's lights and siren and, instead, turned off
 its lights and accelerated. Suspicious of this behavior, the police fired "warning
 shots aimed at the car's tirs theat passed through the rear window and killed one
 of the passengers. The spokesman confirmed that one of the officers is in custody
 and that the case is under investigation.
 On December 12, security forces killed one person and injured two others while
 attempting to control a mob in Wa in the Upper West Region. The crowd was at-
 tempting to free 14 people arrested in the waesof a violent incident between Mus-
 lim sects 2 days earlier (see Section 2.c.).
 In August the authorities filed murder charges against two policemen and a police
 laborer in the unexplained death of a man in an Eastern Region police cell in Feb-
 ruary 1996.
 The Government again refused to launch an independent inquiry into the deaths
 of four demonstrators during a protest against government tax policy in May 1995
 and finally closed its case inconclusively. There was no further action on the libel
 
 
 case by the Youth and Sports Minister against an independent newspaper that re-
 ported on the 1995 U.S. Government report on humax rights practices in Ghana
 and his possible involvement in the 1995 killings of four demonstrators. The Gov-
 emrnent has held unresolved lawsuits over certain journalists, effectively cir-
 cumscribing their reporting.
 In 1995 the police beat a Tetrem man in the Ashanti region who subsequently
 died. A police service inquiry determined that one of the two officers involved was
 primarily responsible for the suspect's death. This officer was disciplined by the de-
 partment by being confined to his barracks for 2 weeks and denied his salary for
 months. At the request of the Attorney General, the other officer was charged,
 tried, and awaits sentencing.
 Journalists were unsuccessful in their continued efforts to persuade the Govern-
 ment to investigate extrajudicial killings in the early years of PNDC rule, despite
 police professions in 1993 of willingness to investigate such killings. Journalists con-
 tinued to raise this issue; however, the Government ignored their requests.
 The press reported numerous cases of vigilante-style "instant justice" conducted
 by anry citizens and mobs in local communities on suspected criminals and sus-
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the dignity of all persons shall be inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from human dignity. Nonethe-
 less, there were continued credible reports that members of the police and customs
 officials beat prisoners and other citizens. It is generally believed that severe beat-
 ings of suspects in police custody occur throughout the country but go largely unre-
 ported. Police used excessive force in attempting to control crowds, at times result-
 ing in citizens' deaths (see Section L.a.). In February poorly trained police in Kumasi
 and mining security guards injured two people during an environmental protest, re-
 portedly as a result of stray bullets from warning shots. On October 4, a policeman
 shot a third-year secondary school student in Cape Coast. The student was an unin-
 volved spectator injured when police attempted to quell a fight between football
 players and spectators. At year's end, the case was still under investigation. Police
 conducted a dawn raid in the town of Akwatia on November 16, in apparent revenge
 for a bloody clash with illegal diamond traders the previous week during which nine
 police officers were injured, one of them fatally. Police rousted males from their
 beds, beat them with weapons, batons, and ropes, and hauled them to the police sta-
 tion. Police also threatened and beat women (see Sections L.a. and 1.d.).
 The International Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) released its 1997 post-
 election Public Opinion Report, which stated that 43 percent of the population has
 little or no faith in the police service. In November 1996, a police task force burned
 three villages in the Western Region as it searched for a suspected killer. Hundreds
 of people lost their homes and property. Public suspicion of the police was such that,
 in at least nine incidents, citizens in remote villages attacked police who were re-
 portedly attempting to enforce the law. Eight police stations were ransacked, forcing
 the officers to flee and abandon their sites. Although the police may have been at-
 tempting to enforce the law, their unprofessional approach triggered the public reac-
 tion. Police presence was reestablished in some areas by year's end.
 In late 1997, officers of the Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service (CEPS) bru-
 talized two doctors at checkpoints in two well-publicized incidents in the Volta Re-
 gion. Following the second incident, the Ghana Medical Association (GMA) called for
 a public declaration of disciplinary action taken against the CEPS officials, com-
 pensation for the victims, and disclosure of steps being taken to prevent a recur-
 rence. A OMA official characterized CEPS personnel in the Volta Region as a "public
 liability in view of their improper use of firearms in recent times.'
 Security forms outside the control of the police service made a high-profile debut
 in 1996 and proved a threat to civil liberties. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly
 (AMA) dispatched a specially trained for, known as the City Crime Combating and
 Cleaning Unit, to eject forcefully unlicensed street vendors from city streets. The
 special form inflicted physical injuries on a number of vendors and destroyed much
 of their property. After withdrawing the form for retraining, the AMA disbanded it.
 In 1997, however, the force reappeared as the Chameleon Bombers dispatched and
 organized by the AMA's office. They continued to infict injury and destroy property.
 Two members were arrested in August after brutalizing two street market women
 during an attempt to decongest Accra's overcrowded streets.
 Two of the five defendants on trial for an alleged 1994plot to overthrow the Gov-
 ernment reportedly were severely tortured by BN  officias prior to this year. Both
 had scars as a result of hot metal applied to their backs'while in BNI cells.
 
 
 136
 Machomen, private security enforcers hired by citizens to -settle private disputes
 and vendettas, caused injury and property damage. The Machomen are not legally
 constituted, but organized privately and operate outside the law. None, however,
 have been arrested for any illegal action, and police, to some extent, appear intimi-
 dated by them.
 Prisons are in most cases very porly maintained, and conditions are extremely
 harsh. In 1996 the CHRAJ publis ed its long-anticipated report on prison condi-
 tions. It described prisons that are unsanitary, overcrowded, and poorly ventilated.
 Prisoners are malnourished (the daily food allowance per prisoner is about $0.35)
 and prisoners also suffer from lack of medicine unless paid for by the inmates or
 provided by their families. The report concluded in part that prison conditions are
 a flagrant violation of the individual's fundamentai human rights." The CIRAJ's
 findings and recommendations generated much positive press coverage and some
 changes, but while the Government concurred with the 1996 findings, it stated that
 lack of funding in 1997 prevented further improvements. Families still supplement
 prisoners' food and bribe prison guards for visitation rights.
 In April prisoners inKumasi rioted over lack of food and five prisoners were in-
 jured by police officers. Prisoners cited inadequate food and refusal by authorities
 to emt    rsntiesas prompting the riot.
 W  eJ has access to monitor the prisons, the Government resisted
 .rbrr A        t heren  , or Exile.-The Constitution provides for protection
 against arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile and states that an individual detained
 shall be informed immediately, in a language the detained person understands, of
 the reasons for the detention, and of the right to a lawyer and to an interpreter,
 at state expense. It also requires judicial warrants for arrest and provides for ar-
 raignment within 48 hours. In practice, however, many abuses occur, including de-
 tention without charge for longer than 48 hours and failure to obtain a warrant for
 arrest. The government press reported that the Inspector General of Police and the
 Northern Region police commander were sued in 1996 by a private businessman for
 unlawful arrest and detention.
 Authorities do not routinely notify prisoners' families of their incarceration; such
 information is often obtained only by chance.
 The court has unlimited discretion to set bail, which can be excessive. It may
 refuse to release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without charge for an
 indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. It is common to
 remand a prisoner to investigative custody. The Constitution requires, however, that
 a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonable" time shall be released ei-
 ther unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure that he appears at
 a later date for court proceedings.
 Despite the provisions of the law, abuses occur. People are sometimes detained
 for trivial offenses or on unsubstantiated accusations. Approximately 30 percent of
 the prison population consists of pretrial detainees. There has been no meaningful
 policy implemented by the Government to reduce the numbers of pretrial detainees,
 although the independent press has called for reduction of harsh bail conditions for
 suspects who do not pose a threat to society. Many credible sources report that pri-
 vate citizens pay the police to arrest business associates in deals gone awry. In one
 such case in Tema, the detainee was held for 2 months without treatment for a seri-
 ous medical problem. The CHRAJ reported one case of a 16-year detention. Re-
 manded suspects may languish in prison without trial for up to 9 years.
 The 1996 CHRAJ report on prison conditions recommended improvement in the
 administration of criminal justice, which currently denies many citizens their con-
 stitutional rights to be charged within 48 hours, to have bail posted within the same
 period, and to a speedy trial. The report concluded that the "penal system is unwit-
 tingly but inexorably punishing the innocent." In response the Attorney General
 asked the CHRAJ for a list of those detained for 6 years or more in order to inves-
 tigate their cases and the CHRAJ provided such a list. According to the Attorney
 General's office, a committee is investigating how the remanded prisoners can either
 be brought to trial quickly or released.
 The Government unlawfully detained two policemen for 27 days in June and July
 after a theft at the residence of the Minister of Justice/Attorney General. After the
 media exposed the case, the Government released the detainees and accepted re-
 sponsibility for the violation. The Attorney General denied knowledge of the viola-
 tion and admitted a possible police over-reaction in keeping the policemen detained
 beyond the constitutionally permitted 48-hour limit without charge. The Minister of
 Interior submitted a statement to Parliament in which he apologized to the  lice-
 men who were detained and said that thepolice had acted outside the law. The In-
 spector General of Police subsequently undertook a campaign to emphasize the 48-
 
 
 137
 hour rule to police officials throughout the country, and improved adherence to this
 provision resulted. The BNI paid $11,000 in damages to a detainee held 72 hours
 in a case of mistaken identity. Others unlawfully detained were released as they
 were discovered. One Tema man was released after a spot check revealed that he
 had been imprisoned 6 years without being charged.
 In the wake of an October 30 riot in the Nima slum, authorities allegedly arrested
 76 people, many in their homes, and reportedly tried to extract people from a
 mosque to arrest them.
 In November police arrested 2,000 men in the town of Akwatia, after a mis-
 handled sting operation. Police killed one civilian and beat both men and women
 (see Sections L.a. and 1.c.).
 There were no known political arrests. However, the case of an army captain,
 charged in 1996 with plotting to overthrow the Government, was dismissed for lack
 of merit in October.
 The Government does not practice forced exile and encourages citizens with valu-
 able skills who are living abroad to return, including dissidents. Some former gov-
 ernment and discredited PNDC officials have returned and resumed careers and po-
 litical activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the judiciary is subject to executive influence. The Constitution
 allows the Government to nominate up to 15 members of the Supreme Court; con-
 firmation is the responsibility of a Parliament dominated by the President's party.
 Furthermore, the Chief Justice is empowered to impanel the justices of his choice
 to hear cases. These provisions, along with a debilitating lack of resources, have hin-
 dered the Court's role as a balance to the power of the executive branch. There were
 no official charges of judicial corruption, but a recent survey revealed that 66 per-
 cent of citizens believe that money influences the judicial system. Furthermore, the
 integrity of the legal system is compromised by a severe lack of financial, human,
 and material resources. Police, however, arrested two persons who offered bribes to
 the police officer handling the prosecution of cases from the Akwatia riot.
 The Constitution establishes two basic levels of courts: superior and lower. The
 superior courts include the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court, the High Court, and
 regional tribunals. Parliament may establish lower courts or tribunals by decree.
 Legal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defendants are presumed
 innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be present, to be rep-
 resented by an attorney (at public expense if necessary), and to cross-examine wit-
 nesses. In practice the authorities generally respect these safeguards.
 The CHRAJ's charter provides for it to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights and take action to remedy proven violations. It continues to hold workshops
 to educate the public, traditional leaders, the police, and the military on human
 rights issues. It mediates and settles cases brought to it by individuals with griev-
 ances against government agencies or private companies. In 1996 the CHRAJ re-
 ceived 12,409 petitions in its offices around the country and completed action on
 over 8,775. Forty percent of the cases were resolved through mediation. This effort
 compares with 1995 when the CHRAJ received 6,173 petitions in its offices around
 the country and completed action on over 3,700 from 1995 and previous years. The
 majority of the complaints lodged with the commission were from those who felt
 they suffered injustice as a result of abuse of power, unfairness, and high handed-
 ness. CHRAJ figures for the number of petitions received and acted upon during
 1997 had not been compiled by year's end. In October 1996, the Commission con-
 cluded its lengthy corruption probe of high government officials. The Commission's
 report, which detailed adve  findings against three public officials and exonerated
 a fourth, evoked an aggressive government rebuttal and a questioning of the scope
 of the CHRAJ's mandate that finally led the CHRAJ to request in 1996 a Supreme
 Court interpretation of its rights and responsibilities. The case has been argued be-
 fore the court; however, at year's end there was no verdict (see Section 4).
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers to
 mediate local matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing
 with such matters as divorce, child custody, and property disputes. However, a num-
 ber of laws passed during the PNDC era (1981-92), as well as the 1992 Constitu-
 tion, have steadily eroded the authority of traditional rulers and vested it in civil
 institutions, such as courts and district assemblies.
 Attorneys for five defendants on trial for an alleged 1994 plot to overthrow the
 Government (see Section 1.c.) criticized prison officials for impeding their access to
 their clients. At year's end, the attorneys had access to their clients.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within the pri-
 
 
 vacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication. This article has yet
 to be tested in court. Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do
 not always obtain them in practice. Observers assume that the Government contin-
 ues to engage in surveillance of citizens engaged in activities that it deems objec-
 tionable. In the past, this included monitoring of telephones and mail. Several politi-
 cal activists reported being followed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and opposition political parties and others have used these free-
 doms to criticize the Government. The Government has allowed more control of
 print and electronic media to be transferred to the private sector. The Government
 pressures certain newspapers indirectly by allowing pending lawsuits to continue
 unresolved.
 There are 15 newspapers including 2 government-owned dailies, 2 government-
 owned weeklies, and 11 independent newspapers published weekly, biweekly, or tri-
 weekly. One of the government-owned dailies has national circulation. However,
 most newspapers circulate regionally, and many of the smaller independent news-
 papers are available only in the capital. Accra has eight radio stations (one of which
 is government-owned). While seven stations are independent, they cannot be charac-
 terized as outspoken critics of the Government. The number of independent radio
 stations outside of Accra also expanded. The government-owned television station is
 the only station that broadcasts nationwide. Two other television stations began
 broadcasting during the year; one is independent, the other is partially owned by
 the Government. Both stations' broadcasts could be received only in Accra. Govern-
 ment-owned media did not seem to receive government subsidies. Neither, however,
 was there any real movement toward their divestiture.
 The government-owned media occasionally reported charges of corruption or mis-
 management in government ministries and government-owned enterprises, but they
 never directly criticized the Government's policies or President Rawlings' activities.
 The Government occasionally disciplines or dismisses journalists working in govern-
 ment-subsidized media for articles deemed unacceptable. The Government ended
 subsidies to the stat-owned publishing companies, and the newspapers are pub-
 lished by profit-making printing companies but have not been offered for public sale.
 The independent press was often harshly critical of the Government's policies and
 its coverage of President Rawlings, his wife, and his regime often bordered on the
 profane. Although the Government did not overtly suppress the independent media,
 authorities remained suspicious and wary of them. The Government and govern-
 ment officials used civil suits, and occasionally criminal libel suits, to threaten inde-
 pendent editors and journalists. In the most flaring case, the Government continued
 to prosecute two independent journalists under a rarely used sedition law for alleg-
 edly libeling President Rawlings and his wife and, through them, the State. The
 trials, repeatedly postponed, were seen by many observers to signal a renewal of
 press harassment. There was a particularly overt sign of the regime's suspicious and
 distrustful attitude toward press freedom in May when the Government asked an
 accredited diplomat, who had criticized the country's criminal libel laws, to leave the
 country.
 The Government readily granted accreditation to foreign journalists. Foreign peri-
 odicals were sold in Accra and other major cities and circulated freely even when
 they contained articles critical of the Government. Most citizens obtain their news
 from the government-owned electronic media and the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion radio service.
 There were no new developments in the case of the Minister of Youth and Sports
 who charged an independent newspaper with libel for its reporting on his possible
 involvement in the May 1995 deaths of four demonstrators (see Section L.a.).
 There was no restriction of academic freedom on university campuses. The Na-
 tional Union of Ghanaian Students, one of the more vocal critics of the Government,
 is allowed to organize and hold meetings. In August the threat of a large protest
 helped avert an increase in electricity charges (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in
 practice. The Government does not require permits for demonstrations. Parliament
 passed a public order law in late 1994 requiring that all organizers of "special
 events" or "processions" inform the police of their intentions so that the police can
 institute precautionary measures. The law also provides for curfews and arrest
 without warrants in specified instances. The authorities did not abuse the provi-
 sions of the law during the year.
 
 
 139
 In August the threat of a large demonstration organized in part by the National
 Union of Ghanaian Students and the Trades Union Congress helped pressure the
 Government to suspend an increase in electricity rates.
 In November 1996, five workers demonstrating in favor of union demands for im-
 proved working conditions were injured by bullets fired by the police. They were
 treated at a police hospital and the company assumed subsequent medical costs. No
 action was taken against the police.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. NGO's are required to register with the Reg-
 istrar General's office, but this registration is routine. However, there is a possible
 threat of government interference in a bill that has been languishing in a par-
 liamentary committee for nearly 3 years that would establish a government body
 with the authority to deny, suspend, or cancel an NGO's right to operate.
 Political parties must be accredited by the Electoral Commission. The parties
 must show evidence of a "national character," such as official representation in all
 10 of the country's regions. The Electoral Commission evaluates whether the party
 has shown evidence of a viable national support base before granting accreditation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advantages or disadvantages
 attached to membership in any particular sect or religion. Foreign missionary
 groups have generally operated throughout the country with a minimum of formal
 restrictions.
 In December there were two violent confrontations between Islamic sects in the
 northern part of the country involving theological rather than political issues, which
 resulted in two deaths and significant property destruction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights as an aspect of the provision
 for personal liberty, and the Government generally respects these provisions in prac-
 tice.
 Citizens and foreigners are free to move throughout the country without special
 permission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide to prevent smuggling, but most are
 left unmanned during daylight hours. There were numerous reports that police used
 checkpoints to solicit bribes. Citizen complaints about police harassment caused the
 Government to reduce the number of checkpoints from 125 to the 38 most essential
 posts. Government roadblocks and car searches are a normal part of nighttime trav-
 el in larger cities. Taxi drivers in Tamale struck in protest against persistent har-
 assment by the police.
 Citizens are generally free to travel internationally and to emigrate or to be repa-
 triated from other countries.
 Ethnic tension and violence in the Northern Region resulted in the deaths of an
 estimated several thousand citizens in the Northern Region in 1994-95 in the most
 recent outbreak of land-related ethnic conflict, which has existed since the early
 part of the century. During the year, the ethnic groups maintained an uneasy calm.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Ghana
 has a liberal policy of accepting refugees from other West African nations. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum. It provided first asylum in recent years to Togolese
 refugees, most of whom have returned to Togo as part of the UNHCR's organized
 voluntary repatriation program. It continued to provide first asylum to some 5,907
 Togolese, approximately 14,600 Liberians, 490 Sierra Leoneans (including 302 who
 were granted refugee status in December), and 27 Nigerians. There were no reports
 of persons not being allowed to request asylum. There were no reports of forced re-
 turn of persons to a country where they feared persecution. There were no forced
 expulsions of refugees with a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, and
 citizens exercised this right through a democratic process in presidential elections
 held in December 1996. The country continued its transition from a one-party state
 to a more established constitutional system. The political system includes recognized
 opposition parties which express their views freely within Parliament.
 President Rawlings was reelected in 1996 for a final 4-year term with 57 percent
 of the popular vote. The NDC retained control of the 200-member Parliament with
 133 seats, while opposition parties took 67 seats, including 1 in June that was de-
 layed by a court injunction. The NDC fell one seat short of commanding the two-
 thirds majority required to amend the Constitution. To a large degree, opposition
 
 
 members are frustrated by impediments the executive branch imposes by refusing
 to support opposition amendments to proposed legislation. Parliament is still work-
 ing to develop effective oversight of the workings of the executive branch.
 There are no obstacles to the participation of women in government; however,
 they compose a small minority in government and politics. In 1997 there were 18
 female parliamentarians. Several ministers and Council of State members also were
 women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 NGO's interested in human rights continued to grow in number and strength, and
 there were 17 NGO's in the field at year's end. These NGO's operated without gov-
 ernment interference and without control by the Government (see Section 2.b.).
 Prominent NGO's include the Red Cross, Amnesty International, the International
 Federation of Woman Lawyers (FIDA), Women in Law and Development in Africa,
 and Ghanalert.
 The Government cooperates with international humanitarian organizations, in-
 cluding the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Although not an NGO, the CHRAJ, at the invitation of President Rawlings, began
 investigations in November 1995 into a series of allegations of corruption and other
 acts of impropriety made in the press against public officials. The CHRAJ completed
 its report in October 1996 and detailed adverse findings against three public offi-
 cials; it exonerated a fourth. The Government issued a white paper in April, reject-
 ing some of the adverse findings in the CHRAJ report and recommending that inter-
 pretations of certain laws be forwarded to the Attorney General's office. The CHRAJ
 issued a rebuttal to the white paper. In addition the CHRAJ submitted an interim
 report in November on corruption allegations against a senior government official
 of the Cocoa Board. The Commission found the allegations to be false. The CHRAJ
 issued a report on its investigations at the "witches" camps in the Northern Region.
 The report detailed the living conditions of the women in the camps and proposed
 how to reintegrate the women into society. The plan involves an educational cam-
 paign in conjunction with the Center for National Culture and the House of Chiefs.
 The Commission has also provided periodic updates to various sections of its report
 on prison conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status. The courts are specifically empowered to enforce
 these prohibitions, although enforcement by the authorities is generally inadequate,
 in part due to limited financial resources.
 Womren.-Violence against women, including rape and wife beating, remains a sig-
 nificant problem. These abuses usually go unreported and seldom come before the
 courts. The police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes. However, the media
 increasingly report cases of assault and rape. The FIDA wrote a handbook and pre-
 sented a workshop on domestic violence and aided poor women for free. However,
 FIDA believes that women's shelters must be built in order for legal intervention
 to be effective.
 Women continue to experience societal discrimination. Women in urban centers
 and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but resistance to
 women in nontraditional roles persists. Few women enter college. Women, especially
 in rural areas, remain subject to burdensome labor conditions and traditional male
 dominance. Traditional practices and social norms often deny women their inherit-
 ances and property, a legally registered marriage (and with it, certain legal rights),
 and the maintenance and custody of children, all provided for by statute.
 Rural women can be punished with banishment by traditional village authorities
 for teenage pregnancy or suspected witchcraft. The press reported that hundreds of
 women accused of witchcraft were sent to penal villages in the Northern Region by
 traditional authorities such as a shaman. Two villages contained 400 elderly women,
 and 1 village contained 2,000 women and family members, all sentenced by a village
 male or chief who claimed to have the power to divine witches. Although the women
 face no formal legal sanction if they leave, most fear that they would be beaten to
 death if caught. The CHRAJ is mounting a campaign to end this traditional prac-
 tice, which violates the victims' constitutional rights.
 Women's rights groups are active in educational campaigns and in programs to
 provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to women. The Government
 is also active in educational programs, and the President and First Lady are among
 the most outspoken advocates of women's rights. Although there has been no con-
 
 
 crete policy change on the national level, the 1995 United Nations Conference on
 Women and the resulting platform for action continued to generate widespread posi-
 tive discussion about the status of women in the country.
 Children.-Within the limits of its resources, the Government is committed to pro-
 tecting the rights and welfare of children. There is little or no discrimination
 against females in education, but girls and women frequently drop out of school due
 to societal or economic pressures. Although the percentages increased in several
 areas from 1996, participation is still low. Statistics show that from grades 1 to 6,
 peent of pupis are girls; from grades 7 to 9, this number drops to 43 percent.
 In t e grades equivalent to high school (grades 10 to 12), the number of girls drops
 to 36 percent of students, and drops even further to 23 percent at the university
 level.
 There are several traditional discriminatory practices that are injurious to female
 health and development. In particular, female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health, is a serious problem. According to one study, the percentage
 of women who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 30 percent, al-
 though most observers believe 15 percent to be more accurate. FGM is practiced
 mostly in Muslim communities in the far northeastern and northwestern parts of
 the country. As of 1994, FGM became a criminal act. Officials at all levels have spo-
 ken out against the practice of FGM, and local NGO's are makin some inroads
 through their educational campaigns to encourage abandonment of FGM and to re-
 train  ractitioners. There were, however, no arrests during the year. The two idi-
 viduas arrested in 1996 for practicing FGM were convicted, but at year's end, had
 not been sentenced.
 Although the Constitution prohibits slavery, it exists on a limited scale. Trkosi,
 a traditional practice found among the Ewe ethnic group and primarily in the Volta
 region, is an especially severe abuse and a fgrant violation of children's and wom-
 ens rights. It is a system in which a young girl, usually under the age of10, is made
 a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegediy committed by a member of the girl's
 family. The belief is that if someone in that family has committed a crime, such as
 stealing, members of the family may begin to die in large numbers unless a young
 girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense. The girl becomes the
 property of the fetish priest, must work on the priest's farm, and perform other la-
 bors for him. Because they are the sexual prouprty of the priests, most Trekosi
 slaves have children by him. Although the girls' families must provide for their
 needs, such as food, most are unable to do so. There are at least 4,000 girls and
 women bound to various shrines in the Trokosi system, a figun re that does not in-
 aude the slaves' children. Even if released, generally without skills or hope of mar-
 riage, a Trokosi woman has continued obligations to the shrine for the duration of
 her life. When the fetish slave dies, the family is expected to replace her with an-
 other young girl for the fetish shrine.
 Although the Constitution outlaws slavery, Parliament has yet to pass a law ex-
 plicitly prohibiting Trokosi. The practice persists because of deeply entrenched tradi-
 tional beliefs, and it is therefore unlikely that any legislative prohibition alone
 would eliminate the practice. Over the past few years, the CHRAJ has conducted
 an awareness campaign with traditional leaders and practitioners in an effort to
 bring the practice to an end. The CHRAJ's efforts have been taken in conjunction
 with an NGO called International Needs, which has had some success in approach-
 ing village authorities and fetish priests at 10 of the 76 shrines, winning the release
 of 474 Trokosi slaves to date, and retraining them for new professions. The organi-
 zation is working for additional releases. Including work by other organizations, the
 total number of slaves released was 672 at year's end.
 Another traditional practice that violates the rights of children is forced childhood
 marriages. The prostitution of female children exists, despite its illegality. Forced
 labor also occurs at the camps for women accused of witchcraft.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution specifically provides for the rights of
 p~eople with disabilities, including protection against exploitation and discrimination.
 Inpractice the disabled are not discriminated against in any systematic or overt
 manner. The Constitution also states that "as far as practicable, every place to
 which the public has access shall have appropriate facilities for disabled persons."
 In practice, however, this provision has yet to be implemented.
 Religious Minorities.-eIn December there were two violent confrontations between
 Islamic sects in the northern p art of the country, involving theological rather than
 political issues, which resulted in two deaths and significant property destruction.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government plays down the
 importance of ethnic differences, its opponents occasionally complain that it is domi-
 nated by the Ewe ethnic group from the eastern part of the country. The President
 
 
 and many of his close advisers are Ewe, but many ministers are of other ethnic ori-
 gins. In the 1997 IFES Report on Public Opinion, 25 percent of the respondents said
 that they felt discrimination because of their tribal background.
 The Government created a permanent negotiating team in 1995 comprised of reli-
 gious leaders, NGO's, Council of State members, and other interested parties to help
 resolve the continuing tensions between the Konkomba and other ethnic groups in
 the north. Ethnic tension and violence in the Northern Region resulted in the
 deaths of an estimated several thousand citizens in the Northern Region in 1994-
 95. The Permanent Peace Negotiating Team (PPNT) is a facilitative body whose pri-
 mary purpose is to mediate disputes, most of which relate to chieftancy and land
 issues dating from olonial times. In 1996 a series of highly publicized "peace-
 making" ceremonies were held at which tribal leaders pledged to solve their dif-
 ferencs through negotiations. In response to reports of latent insecurity, the PPNT
 extended its activities to some northern parts of the Volta Region in October and
 in December supervised a peace accord among all parties to the conflict residing
 there. The primary issue is land. There were numerous violent confrontations be-
 tween and within ethnic groups related to chieftaincy issues, particularly those of
 succession. Beyond regular pleas by government officials for peace, there has been
 little effective intervention.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, the Government has not interfered with the right of workers to associate
 in labor unions and has not refused to register any unions.
 About 9 percent of workers belong to unions, a figure that is likely to increase
 following the formation of a new federation called the Ghana Federation of Labor,
 which will serve as an umbrella organization for several other labor unions not en-
 compassed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), previously the only federation. The
 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), initially written in 1958, and amended in 1965 and
 1972, governs trade unions and their activities. In recent years, the TUC has been
 led by experienced union leaders who, aided by a revised union constitution and by-
 laws, continued to define an autonomous role for the TUC within the NDC regime.
 Since the 1992 elections, the TUC has taken a somewhat more confrontational
 stance toward the Government and has criticized some of its economic policies. Civil
 servants have their own union, the Civil Servants Association, which operates out-
 side of the TUC umbrella.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. Under the IRA, the Government estab-
 lished a system of settling disputes, first through conciliation, then through arbitra-
 tion. A union may call a legal strike if negotiations and mediation fail. However,
 because no union has ever gone through the complete process, there have been no
 legal strikes since independence. The IRA prohibits retribution against strikers, and
 this law is enforced. There has been no progress in implementing the Government's
 declared intention to establish labor tribunals to arbitrate industrial disputes cer-
 tified as deadlocked, which has been pending for many years.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies. The TUC is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity headquartered in Accra and is
 also a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiunion discrimination.
 Trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits for both private
 and state-owned enterprises without government interference. The Government,
 labor, and employers negotiate together, however, through a tripartite commission
 to set minimum standards for wages and working conditions. The law requires em-
 ployers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities. No union leaders have been detained in recent years for union or other
 activities.
 There is legislation that authorizes export processing zones (EPZ's), and a sec-
 retariat exists. The Secretariat provides data on designated EPZ's, educates the
 public and potential investors on export provisions and concepts, and facilitates es-
 tablishment of businesses within designated EPZ's. There are a few EPZ's in oper-
 ation. Existing labor law applies in any EPZ, including the right to organize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery.
 The law also prohibits forced or bonded labor, including that performed by children;
 however, at least 4,000 women and girls are bound to shrines through the Trokosi
 system (see Section 5). Apart from the Trokosi system, forced or bonded labor by
 children is not practiced. The International Labor Organization (ILO) continues to
 urge the Government to revise various legal provisions that permit imprisonment,
 
 
 with an obligation to perform labor for offenses that are not countenanced under
 ILO Convention 105.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Labor leg-
 islation sets a minimum employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain
 types of hazardous labor for those under 18 years of age. In practice child employ-
 ment is widespread, and young children of school age often perform menial tasks
 during the day in the market or collect fares on local buses. An ILO survey con-
 ducted in three rural districts between 1992 and 1993 concluded that 11 percent of
 school age children were employed for wages and another 15 percent without remu-
 neration. Observance of mimmum age laws is eroded by local custom and economic
 circumstances that encourage children to work to help their families.
 The law prohibits forced or bonded labor, including that performed by children;
 however, at least 4,000 women and girls are bound to shrines through the Trokosi
 system (see Section 6.c.).
 Officials only occasionally punish violators of regulations that prohibit heavy labor
 and night work for children. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social Wel-
 fare are responsible for enforcement of child labor regulations. They visit each work-
 place annually and make spot checks whenever they receive allegations of viola-
 tions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were set by a tripartite commission composed of representatives
 of the Government, labor, and employers. The daily minimum wage, revised in 1996,
 combines wages with customary benefits, such as a transportation allowance. The
 daily minimum wage of 2,000 cedis is less than $1.00. This sum is insufficient for
 a single wage earner to support a family. Furthermore, there is widespread violation
 of the minimum wage law. In most cases, households have multiple wage earners,
 and family members engage in some family farming or other family-based commer-
 cial activities.
 The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours, with one break of at least 36
 consecutive hours every 7 days. Through collective bargaining, however, the basic
 workweek for most unionized workers is 40 hours.
 In 1996 Spintex workers filed petitions with the CHRAJ, the Ministry of Employ-
 ment and Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Labor concerning working hours. They
 have withdrawn the case from administrative review and, instead, taken the case
 to court. Hearings were in process at year's end.
 Occupational safety and health regulations are in effect, and the Labor Depart-
 ment of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare occasionally imposes sanctions
 on violators. Safety inspectors are few, however, and poorly trained. They take ac-
 tion if matters are called to their attention, but lack the resources to seek out viola-
 tions. Workers have the right-to withdraw themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment, although they rarely exercise this
 right.
