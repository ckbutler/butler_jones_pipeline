 LATVIA
 Latvia, an independent state between the two World Wars, was
 forcibly annexed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 (U.S.S.R.) in 1940. The United States does not recognize the
 forcible incorporation of Latvia into the U.S.S.R.
 Like the other Baltic states, Latvia has been subjected to the
 same centralized rule, the same constitution and judicial
 system, and the same restrictions on civil and political
 liberties as in the Soviet Union. Political power has been
 exercised by the leadership of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union, which has tightly controlled the activities of
 local government and Communist Party structures.
 Since 1988 Latvians have seized greater control over their own
 affairs. Responding to mass public pressure demanding
 democracy and respect for human rights and following the
 example of the other Baltic states, the Latvian Supreme Soviet
 (parliament) adopted a "Declaration of Sovereignty" and
 constitutional amendment in July 1989, declaring that its laws
 took precedence over those of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. In
 response to both the Latvian declaration and related
 developments in other republics, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
 Presidium voted on November 10, 1989, to instruct all 15
 Republic Supreme Soviets to bring their laws into conformity
 with all-Union law and the Soviet Constitution. By the end of
 1989, however, no action had been taken to enforce this
 declaration.
 The primary law enforcement organization in Latvia is the
 militia (police). The powerful Committee for State Security
 (K.G.B.), special troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs
 (M.V.D.), and the regular Soviet armed forces, which maintain
 a significant presence in Latvia, take orders from authorities
 in Moscow. Although K.G.B. surveillance of political and
 human rights activists is assumed to continue, there were few
 reports of human rights violations in 1989.
 The standard of living in Latvia is higher than the Soviet
 average, but the margin is shrinking. Latvians resent the
 fact that much of their national income is transferred to
 other republics and that most major economic enterprises are
 controlled by central ministries in Moscow. They are also
 concerned about a continuing decline in the quality and
 quantity of food and consumer items. In July the Latvian
 Supreme Soviet adopted a plan for transition to economic
 autonomy to commence January 1, 1990. The U.S.S.R. Supreme
 Soviet in November voted to grant Latvia control over its
 land, resources, banks, and a portion of state-run industry.
 The human rights situation in Latvia continued to improve in
 1989. The authorities tolerated public expression of Latvian
 national sentiment and independent political views which
 previously would have been repressed. For the first time
 since annexation by the Soviet Union, relatively free
 elections were held for representatives to the U.S.S.R.
 Congress of People's Deputies and local government councils
 (soviets). Most successful candidates were supported by the
 Latvian Popular Front, which declared at its second congress
 in October that its goal is an independent Latvian state. The
 Latvian Supreme Soviet on December 28 voted to repeal the
 constitutional provision giving the communist party the
 leading role in Latvia. Limited progress was made, both in
 Latvia and the Soviet Union, toward legislative reforms that
 would help to institutionalize human rights improvements.

 LATVLIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of.political or other extrajudicial
 killing in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Latvia, as in the Soviet Union, harsh treatment of prisoners
 occurs during both interrogation and confinement in labor
 camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals. Physical and
 psychological abuse, as well asextremely unhealthful
 conditions, are common.- Latvians remained concerned'in 1989
 about allegations that Latvian youths are subjected to brutal
 and degrading treatment in the Soviet armed forces, leading in
 some cases to physical injuries, psychological trauma, and
 even suicide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written so broadly that many people have been
 imprisonedfor trying to exercise their basic human rights.
 In 1989,,however, the authorities in Latvia rarely used these
 laws to arrest political activists.
 In one exceptional case, several picketers were detained in
 Riga in March for violating rules on holding demonstrations
 and meetings. The detentions led to an outcry of protest from
 Latvian activists) and the picketers were soon released.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite provisions for judicial impartiality in both. the
 Latvian and Soviet Constitutions, the State retains the
 ability to control the judicial process and arbitrarily
 determine the outcome of trials. Nominal safeguards, such as
 the right to a public trial and to a defense attorney, are not
 sufficient to guarantee fair trials when the accused are
 charged with political crimes. One law was passed by the
 U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet.-to increase the independence of the
 judiciary. Other reforms to strengthen-the rights of
 defendants have been proposed but not yet enacted. There were
 no known trials on.purely political charges in 1989, and at
 year's end no Latvians were known to be in prison for purely
 political reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government continued to interfere in personal life through
 the use of informers, monitoring of mail and telephones, and
 surveillance. Security-police in 1989 did little, however, to
 intimidate Latvians or to hinder the rapid growth of social
 
 
 1172
 LATVIA
 and political activism. Advocates of Latvian independence
 reported that overt surveillance of their movements declined
 in 1989. Contacts between Latvians and foreign visitors
 continued to be monitored, but at the same time the authorities
 facilitated a very considerable increase in such contacts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Soviet Constitution provides for most internationally
 accepted political liberties on condition that their exercise
 does not run counter to the interests of the working class.
 In Latvia this notion continued to be interpreted more
 liberally in 1989 than it had been in early 1988. In addition,
 the Latvian Constitution was amended in 1988 to include the
 provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights, as well as other internationally recognized human
 rights instruments, as "an inseparable part of the legal
 system."
 Freedom of speech was widely respected in 1989. The
 authorities tolerated criticism of Soviet officials, demands
 for independence, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of
 Soviet "occupation" troops from Latvia.
 The range of subjects covered by official Latvian media
 continued to grow. Print and electronic media highlighted the
 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Nonaggression Pact
 between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, together with the
 secret protocols that became the basis for the Soviet
 occupation and annexation of the three Baltic states. The
 Pact and protocols were reprinted in 1989 and widely circulated
 in the Latvian press, which also provided extensive commentary
 on the Soviet Union's 1940 occupation.
 The Latvian media gave wide coverage to political campaigning
 in the elections for the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies
 and the December 10 local elections. They routinely presented
 the views of Baltic deputies to the Soviet Parliament, even
 when these views sharply contradicted those of the political
 leadership in Moscow. The media did not shy away, for example,
 from publicizing deputies' calls for the repeal of article 6
 of the Soviet Constitution, which enshrines the leading role
 of the Communist Party in virtually all aspects of Soviet life.
 On December 28, the Latvian Supreme Soviet voted to remove
 mention of the leading role of the Communist Party in Latvia
 from the Latvian Constitution. Articles advocating the
 reestablishment of Latvian independence appeared in numerous
 publications. Official censorship was apparently used only to
 prevent the publication of military information that the
 Government considered (on grounds of alleged secrecy) too
 sensitive for public release.
 Although most publications remain under the formal control of
 the Communist Party, independent journals are produced legally
 in Latvia by such organizations as the Latvian Popular Front,
 whose journal Atmoda claims a circulation of 165,000.
 Unauthorized publications (samizdat) were also produced and
 distributed without hindrance from the authorities. The
 opinions in such publications are increasingly expressed in
 the official press as well. A new draft press law, now under
 consideration by the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, may ease
 restrictions on the right to publish such journals.
 
 
 1173
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is controlled by the
 authorities, wh6 ietain the power-to prohibit public
 gatherings. Soviet guidelines on demonstrations and meetings
 are contained in a 1988 decree confirmed by the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet, but the Latvian Supreme Soviet adopted a more
 liberal version in 1989.
 In practice, Latvians held frequent mass meetings and
 demonstrations, largely without hindrance from the authorities.
 Many such meetings took place on the anniversaries of
 historical events, the commemoration of which had been
 repressed in previous years. Leading Latvian Communist Party
 and government officials participated, along with Popular Front
 leaders, in public ceremonies attended by thousands of people,
 such ap-he March 25 remembrance of Latvians deported to
 Siberia in 1941.' Hundreds of thousands of Latvians joined
 hands August 23 in a human chain that extended through Estonia
 and Lithuania as a sign of protest marking the 50th
 anniversary of the signing of the ollotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
 Participants-included members of the Latvian Popular Front and
 many other~nonofficial otganizations (e.g., the Latvian
 National Independence Movement) as well as leaders of the
 Latvian copmunist Party and Govepnment. An estimated 500,000
 people pgrticipkted'in a peaceful rally in Riga on November
 18, the independence day of the interwar Latvian Republic,
 which was celebrated in Latvia as a legal holiday for the
 first time since-.1939.
 The Latvian Constitution formally provides for the right to
 associate in public organizations, but this right has been
 circumscribed in the past by proscriptive laws and repressive
 practice.. Throughout 1989, however, the authorities
 acquiesced in the rapid growth of both registered and
 unregistered clubs, professional qss6ciations, and other
 popularly based organizations.. There were no reports of
 significant harassment-again5t any of these groups.
 A coalition of organizations, including the Latvian National
 Independence Movement and the human rights group Helsinki-86,
 undertook in 1989 to form Latvian Citizens' Committees and
 eventually.o qonvene a Latvian Citizens' Congress. Latvian
 citizens were defined as persons who had been citizens of the
 Latvian Republic in 1940 and their descendants, as well as
 others who were committed to'the ind<pendence of Latvia.
 Despite an official ban by the authorities, who feared that
 the Citizens' Committees w6uld represen a form of parallel
 political power, well ov&r 700,000 persons had registered
 without hindrancd'by late 1989.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unioi, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Soviet Constitution provides for the right to profess, or
 not to profess, any religion. Both the party and Government,
 however, while promoting atheism continued to improve their
 relations with oiganized religion in.1989. Christmas was
 again celebrated as an officially sanctioned holiday (official
 recognition came only in 1988), and religious services were
 sometimes shown-6n television. High-level Latvian political
 leaders held widely publicized meetings with leaders of local
 religious communities, and there were no reports of significant
 
 
 1174
 church-state conflicts. State control of religion nevertheless
 continued to be formally governed by repressive 1929 Soviet
 legislation, as neither the U.S.S.R. nor Latvian Supreme
 Soviet adopted a new law to guarantee freedom of conscience.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 respected in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate by choice is
 not recognized by Soviet law, and persons wishing to leave
 temporarily are generally required to present an invitation
 from abroad. Some Soviet Jews in Latvia were denied permission
 to emigrate in previous years, but the upsurge in Soviet Jewish
 emigration has had a positive effect on Jewish emigration from
 Latvia as well.
 Although travel abroad is limited by restrictive legislation
 and arbitrary enforcement, bureaucratic procedures are
 considerably less cumbersome in Latvia than in the Soviet
 Union as a whole. For the second consecutive year, there was
 a dramatic increase in the number of Latvians visiting the
 United States and other Western countries, including leading
 figures in the Popular Front and groups favoring immediate
 Latvian independence.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Until 1989 the peoples of Latvia and the Soviet Union had not
 been free to change government leaders or the system of
 government. For the first time in postwar Latvian history,
 however, representatives to the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's
 Deputies (the federal legislature) and to Latvia's local
 government councils were chosen by secret ballot on the basis
 of universal suffrage in relatively free multicandidate
 elections, in-which over 70 percent of eligible voters
 participated.
 As in-the other Baltic ztates, alternative parties could not
 formally participate in the Latvian elections, but nominating
 prooedures were sufficiently flexible to permit momination of
 candidates from a wide political spectrum. There was no
 evidence of manipulating the registration process against
 opponents-of the existing regime. Most successful candidates
 campaigned with the active support of the Latvian Popular
 Front, which was able to nominate candidates on its own
 authority in the local elections. Latvian Popular Front
 representatives won 26 of 34 contested seats. In heavily
 Russian districts, however, successful candidates included
 conservative party leaders.
 aelsinki-86 and some-other proindependence groups refused to
 take part in elections to fill seats in the legislature of an
 "occupying power," but some leaders of the Latvian National
 Independence Movement did participate. They gained significant
 media coverage but were not successful in defeating the First
 Secretary of the Communist Party, as they had hoped.
 Elections to the Latvian Supreme Soviet are scheduled for
 March 18, 1990.

 LAT IA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government has adopted a-more forthcoming approach
 to foreign criticism of its human rights record in recent
 years, acknowledging that human rights are a legitimate
 subject of official diplomatic contacts. Although there were
 few allegations of human rights violations in Latvia in 1989,
 the Latvian Government generally welcomed foreign and
 nongovernmental observers on any subject.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Laniuage, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited by the U.S.S.R. Constitution. Tensions between
 ethnic Latvians and Russians are always near the surface,
 however. A low Latvian birthrate and an official policy of
 encouraging ethnic Russian settlement in Latvia has lowered
 the ethnic Latvian propbrtion of the population to
 approximately 52'percent. In 1989 these tensions were
 expressed in heated debates over a number of issues. Ethnic
 Latvians continued to complain that they could not always
 conduct business in their own language, that immigrants from
 the Soviet Union receive favored treatment in the provision of
 housing and other social services, and that nonresidents
 frequently visited Latvia in order to shop in the Republic's
 relatively well-stocked stores.,
 The Latvian Supreme Soviet adopted a detailed language law
 requiring that people holding certain specified management and
 service positions be bilingual and providing Latvian language
 training for those incumbents who are not. Regulations were
 issued to prevent nonresidents of Latvia from purchasing goods
 which are in short supply, and economic measures to control
 immigration'were adopted in 1989. Work also continued on a
 law to define the criteria for Latvian citizenship.
 Ethnic Russian and other Russian-speaking residents of Latvia
 were generally concerned by the Latvian language law and
 proposals for a citizenship. law, fearing that they could be
 disenfranchised or in some other way converted into
 second-class citizens.
 While major ethnic tensions in Latvia divide the Latvian and
 Russian populations, most ethnic grQups, including Russians,
 have formed officially recognized cultural societies which
 work closely with the Latvian Popular Front on proposals to
 enhance their cultural autonomy.
 Over the past 10 years, discrimination and persecution has
 been directed against Latvians who sought to express their
 national and cultural identity,,against independent political
 and religious activists, and against Jews and Pentecostalists
 wishing to leave the country.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men. Under the
 Constitution, they are accorded the right to participate as
 equals in all spheres of Soviet life. An extensive system of
 day-care service and maternity benefits assists women in
 obtaining and retaining jobs. Equal pay for men and women in
 the same job has been the rule since World War II.
 
 
 1176
 LATVIA
 Latvian statistics on the problem of violence against women,
 including wife beating, are unavailable. The official Soviet
 press in 1989 discussed the issue, and the Council of Ministers
 established a special branch (headed by a woman) to study the
 problems of women. Human rights and women's rights groups in
 Latvia are aware of the issue but have focused their efforts
 thus far on the broader question of independence and freedom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Soviet labor law and practice have generally been enforced in
 Latvia. There has been no right of association as defined by
 the International Labor Organization. Although the
 Constitution grants Soviet citizens the right to form trade
 unions, attempts to exercise this right independently of the
 state-controlled union had always been repressed. New
 professional associations with no ties to Moscow and an
 independent "Latvian Workers' Union" were created in 1989, but
 it is not yet clear whether they will effectively exercise
 trade union functions.
 The Latvian press reported a few brief strikes. There were no
 reports of repressive actions against strikers in 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Legislation governing collective bargaining and organizing is
 pending in the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet. To date, workers in
 Latvia generally have not been able to organize or resort to
 collective bargaining. There are no economic incentive
 zones. Virtually all workers in the Soviet Union
 automatically become members of an affiliate of the official
 Soviet trade union orgnization, the All-Union Central Council
 of Trade Unions, in order to be entitled to government social
 welfare benefits.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor. Most prisoners are confined to camps where they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16.
 There is no indication of widespread violations of this norm.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions are similar to those in the Soviet Union.
 According to the Soviet State Statistical Committee, the
 average monthly wage in Latvia for blue- and white-collar
 workers in September 1989 was $410 and for collective farm
 workers $402 at the official exchange rate. The minimum
 monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $140. (The ruble is not a
 convertible currency, and its value here in terms of the U.S.
 dollar does not represent actual purchasing power for
 international purposes.)
 The average workweek is 40 hours for most white-collar workers
 and 41 hours for most blue-collar workers. Soviet law
 establishes minimum conditions of health and safety. Press
 reports suggest, however, that the laws on maximum hours of
 work and health and safety standards are widely ignored.
