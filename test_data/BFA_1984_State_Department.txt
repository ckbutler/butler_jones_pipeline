 BURKINA FASO
 Burkina Faso is ruled by the military, with Captain Thomas
 Sankara in the leadership position of President of Burkina
 Paso and of the National Council of the Revolution. Sankara,
 who came to power in a military coup in August 1983, appoints
 the members of the Government in the name of the National
 Council, and utilizes a Council of Ministers as the main forum
 for ongoing political decisions.
 The country has experienced a series of political upheavals
 since 1980, and the current leadership has changed the name
 from Upper Volta in an effort to institutionalize its
 revolutionary authority.
 The Government and National Council undertake their actions in
 the name of the people, but political parties remain suspended
 (since 1980) and there is no talk of returning the country to
 constitutional rule. Instead, the Government is using a
 growing network of Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution (CDRS), organized at national, regional, and local
 levels, to mobilize the population and promote its
 revolutionary goals. The national CDR leadership is appointed
 by the Government, and it organized elections during 1984 to
 select local committee leaders.
 The Sankara regime's human rights record was mixed for 1984.
 The Government released ex-Ministers held under house arrest
 following the 1983 coup in August 1984. However, throughout
 the year it made arbitrary arrests, and imposed brief
 detention without trial or charges of labor leaders, potential
 political opponents, and others suspected of being hostile to
 the regime. The Government also conducted political trials of
 former government and political leaders outside the
 traditional judicial system in "peoples courts' where
 defendants had no recourse to legal counsel, and it sanctioned
 the execution in June of seven people, five military and two
 civilians, following a summary court martial convicting them
 of coup plotting. In addition, the Government dismissed or
 retired civil servants, military, and police accused of
 hostility to the revolution for reasons ranging from
 misconduct to inappropriate attitudes. The only independent
 newspaper suspended publication in June following the burning
 of its presses by unidentified armed men.
 Burkina Paso is one of the poorest countries in the world.
 Its economy is based on agriculture and animal husbandry.
 This former French colony has a literacy rate of about 9
 percent and about 90 percent of its 7 million inhabitants live
 in rural areas. Donor assistance is valued at nearly twice
 the national budget.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In a total break with the traditional judicial process and
 even a departure from procedures of the peoples court system
 instituted in 1983, seven people charged with coup-plotting
 were sentenced to death by a secret court martial on June 11.
 They were executed a few hours later. Although the Government
 press published what it called "confession' letters, many
 
 
 34
 BURKINA FASO
 people doubt the Government's allegations. In July the Deputy
 Chief of the Armed Forces was gunned down in Ouagadougou in a
 gangland style attack after dark. His assailants have never
 been caught.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture being inflicted on prisoners
 or of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment, although the
 poverty of the society in general results in poor prison
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ministers from the previous regime, who had been put under
 house arrest at the time of the 1983 coup, were released in a
 gesture of reconciliation in August, on the first anniversary
 of the coup. Only former President Jean-Baptiste Ouedraogo is
 known to remain in custody without charges, and no time has
 been set for his trial or release. Reports of arbitrary
 arrest followed by detention without charges for as much as
 four or five days are increasing. Some of these arrests have
 been publicized, such as the arrest of labor leaders in March,
 which provoked a teachers strike; but others, such as purged
 leaders of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution
 (CDR) in August, have never been acknowledged. Several
 prominent intellectuals and former government officials remain
 out of the country in self-imposed exile. Habeas corpus does
 not exist in Burkina Faso. Laws permitting preventive
 detention for a maximum of 72 hours, renewable once in
 criminal cases, are followed in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Between January and June 1984 the People's Revolutionary
 Courts, created in late 1983 with jurisdiction over state
 security and political crimes, heard the cases of nearly 100
 people. The accused included about 30 high-ranking government
 officials from the Third Republic (1978-1980) and the Zebro
 Government (1980-1982) and their associates. Charges centered
 on misuse of government funds, embezzlement, and *illicit
 enrichment.' Former President Lamizana, who led the country
 from 1966-1980, and several other defendants were acquitted.
 Sentences for others ranged from modest fines and suspended
 prison sentences to several years in prison and fines of
 several thousand dollars. The Court President was a
 magistrate appointed by the Government to head the tribunal
 composed of magistrates, military, and CDR members. The Court
 President led the process of asking questions directly of the
 defendant. There was no role for a public prosecutor, and the
 accused had no right to counsel. Witnesses could be called by
 the court or they could present themselves to give testimony.
 In the case of ex-President Lamizana, unsolicited witnesses
 testified to his genuine concern for the people. Currently
 there are no further trials scheduled in the people's courts,
 but President Sankara has said they should be viewed as a
 permanent feature of the country's judicial system. The
 traditionally independent judiciary has continued to function
 for criminal and civil cases. The Supreme Court, abolished in
 
 
 BURKINA PASO
 late 1983, has been replaced with two high appeals courts:
 one for public, and one for private, criminal and civil cases,
 in accordance with French judicial practice. The average
 citizen traditionally receives a fair trial and is represented
 by counsel. Still, high illiteracy in a largely rural
 population limits awareness of individual rights and legal
 benefits.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government authorities are not known to interfere in the
 privacy, family, home, or correspondence of ordinary
 citizens. Homes may be searched under a warrant issued by the
 Attorney General, a procedure adhered to in practice. There
 is no monitoring of private correspondence or telephones. The
 security apparatus is not used to survey family life. While
 the Government encourages participation in the Committees for
 the Defense of the Revolution, there is no pressure
 ontcitizens to join these committees, nor discrimination
 against those who choose not to participate. International
 radio broadcasts are not jammed. A recent government practice
 having great impact on family life is that of arbitrary
 dismissal of military, civil servants, police, and
 teacherslfor primarily political reasons. These individuals
 must turn to the underdeveloped private sector for future
 gainful employment, or remain dependent on their families for
 the foreseeable future.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no formal censorship, external or internal, in
 Burkina. However, in 1984 the prevailing high level of
 revolutionary rhetoric, with its frequent references to
 enemies of the state at home and abroad, undoubtedly inhibited
 both government-employed journalists and ordinary citizens
 from taking advantage of their theoretical right to express
 critical views. The same inhibition, further stimulated by
 the frequency of sudden dismissals from government service, as
 well as by reports of arbitrary arrests, has dampened a lively
 tradition of discussion on political topics.
 The media in Burkina are now entirely government-owned,
 consisting of a daily newspaper, a weekly magazine, a daily
 mimeographed news bulletin, and a government-operated
 radio/television station. There has not been a single case of
 criticism of the Government in the media, which are charged
 with carrying official news to the people while defending the
 revolution. The government daily, Sidwaya, was created in
 April 1984. Not long afterwards, on June 10, the only
 independent daily, l'Observateur, went out of business when
 its printing plant was burned by armed intruders. The
 incident occurred shortly after Committees for Defense of the
 Revolution in Ouagadougou had denounced l'Observateur for
 printing an international wire service story on alleged coup-
 plotting. The Government subsequently denounced the burning
 of l'Observateur as the work of counter-revolutionary
 vandals. However, no official investigation of the affair has
 been announced. The Government maintains that the daily
 Sidwaya is free to print criticism and independent judgments,
 and denies that Sidwaya criticism of foreign governments is
 official in nature. Underground tracts circulated by elements
 
 
 36
 BURKINA FASO
 critical of the Government continue to be a feature of
 political life, although their frequency has diminished in
 1984. Foreign newspapers and magazines continue to enter the
 country freely. Foreign journalists and local representatives
 of foreign press organizations continue to travel and file
 stories without censorship or hindrance and enjoy easy access
 to Government officials up to and including the President.
 There are no formal limitations on academic freedom. However,
 university professors and administrators have been criticized
 for 'elitism" and dismissed for alleged counter-revolutionary
 tendencies. University students are now subject to political
 education, but still retain considerable independence. The
 major student organization remains dominated by a left-wing
 group, aligned with Albania, which regards the present regime
 as insufficiently revolutionary. In the arts, movies are
 subject to possible censorship by a review board which
 includes religious authorities as well as government officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned, and administrative permission is
 generally required for assemblies of any kind. During 1984,
 as the new Government consolidated its power, there was little
 effort by opposition groups, with the partial exception of
 labor unions, to organize meetings.
 Labor continues to be an important feature of the political
 scene. Four labor federations and a number of anonymous
 unions exist. They range in orientation from two old-line
 moderate federations, traditionally unrestricted in their
 adversary relationship with the Government, to a much more
 radical federation of civil service locals. One federation is
 affiliated with the Brussels-based International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions, a second with the World Confederation of
 Labor, and a third with the World Federation of Trade
 Unions.   The civil service federation has no international
 affiliation.
 The right to strike was restored early in 1983. In its only
 test thus far, the independent primary school teachers union
 attempted a strike in March 1984, after two of its leaders
 were arrested for anti-government statements. The Government
 charged the strike was illegally organized and politically
 motivated and broke it by firing the strikers. Subsequent
 efforts to organize a new, pro-government teachers union have
 apparently failed. An amnesty was extended to the fired
 teachers in August, but teacher union leaders remain under
 detention. In August, the Government cracked down on the
 left-wing Patriotic League for Development and dismissed the
 head of the radical labor federation from his government job.
 Unions have continued to exercise their rights to hold
 conferences, train workers, and attend international
 congresses.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burkina Faso is a secular state, and there is no
 discrimination on religious grounds. Islam and Christianity
 exist side by side, with about 25 percent of the population
 Muslim and about 10 percent Christian. Both Muslim and
 Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays.
 Social mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither
 
 
 BURKINA PASO
 linked to, nor restricted by, religious affiliations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is generally unimpeded in Burkina,
 although travelers are often stopped at police and internal
 customs check points. A strictly enforced curfew has existed
 throughout 1984. Foreign travel for business and tourism is
 not restricted. Exit permits, once required to limit movement
 of workers to the neighboring countries--particularly to the
 Ivory Coast where one million or more Burkinabe continue to
 reside and work--are no longer enforced. Refugees are
 accepted freely in Burkina and attempts are made to provide
 for their care in cooperation with the United Nations High
 Commission for Refugees. Some Ghanaians, who entered Burkina
 after the 1980 coup in Ghana, continue to reside in Burkina.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since the military coup of August 1983, Burkina Faso has been
 ruled by President Captain Thomas Sankara in the name of the
 National Council for the Revolution, the composition of which
 has never been disclosed. There is no legislative body nor
 are there any recognized political opposition groups.
 Sankara, in the name of the National Council, appoints his
 Cabinet which currently consists of 21 posts, 4 held by
 military and the rest by civilians, including 3 women.
 Ministers include individuals known to be affiliated with
 several different and apparently antagonistic groups, such as
 the Union of Communist Struggle and the Patriotic League for
 Development.
 The Government has not given any hint of plans for elections
 or a return to constitutional government. With political
 parties banned, the Government is using Committees for the
 Defense of the Revolution to consolidate power and to allow
 for a limited measure of public participation. These
 committees are charged with various tasks, including the
 surveillance of administrative affairs at the local level. In
 practice the Government exercises tight control over the
 committees and in 1984 dissolved committees which challenged
 national leadership.
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the
 inner circles of the Government, as are the dominant Mossi who
 comprise 50 percent of the population. Government decisions
 do not favor one ethnic group over another. One announced
 reason for the increase in administrative regions from 11 to
 30 since the August 1983 coup is to improve access of minority
 groups to local administrative authorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 During his October 4, 1984 speech before the U.N. General
 Assembly, President Sankara spoke in opposition to apartheid
 in South Africa. A government-supported organization,
 MOVORAP, lobbies against apartheid and other racial
 oppression. The Government was visibly upset by foreign
 criticism of its June executions, including the reported
 refusal of the French Socialist Party to receive a high-level
 
 
 BURKINA FASO
 Burkinabe envoy. There has been no effort to restrict or
 hinder international human rights organization of A
 representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross
 visited Burkina during 1984 to investigate prison conditions.
 There has been no comment by Amnesty International on events
 in Burkina during 1984. During 1983, before Captain Sankara
 came to power, Amnesty expressed concern about the detention
 without trial of trade unionist and other senior officials of
 the Lamizana regime. Freedom House's 1984-85 Report rated
 Burkina Faso "not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burkina is overwhelmingly tied to subsistence agriculture,
 with 90 percent of the population living in rural areas and
 less than 1 percent employed in the monetized sector of the
 economy. Gross national product per capita was $210 in 1982.
 Living standards are generally higher in the few urban centers
 than in the countryside. Although the country suffers from
 recurring drought, agricultural production is gradually
 increasing. Meat, vegetables, and grain are available, though
 costly for families without their own fields and seldom
 plentiful in drier sections of the country. Approximately 25
 percent of the population has access to safe water, with a
 disproportionate number of those people being in urban areas.
 The general poverty of the country adversely affects.the
 availability of social services. The literacy rate is
 estimated at 9 percent, with only 20 percent of school age
 children enrolled, 25 percent of them males and 16 percent of
 the females. Further, the population is growing at the rate
 of 2.5 percent per year as of 1984, despite an infant
 mortality rate of 178 deaths per 1,000 live births. Life
 expectancy at birth is 45 years. The primary causes of death
 and morbidity are malaria, and gastrointestinal, infectious,
 and parasitic diseases. Population pressure is somewhat
 ameliorated by large-scale annual migrations to neighboring
 countries for seasonal agricultural work.
 Most of Burkina Faso's people belong to two major west African
 cultural groups, the Voltaic and the Mande. The Voltaic are
 the most numerous and include the Mossi who make up about 50
 percent of the population.
 The current Government has emphasized in public statements its
 awareness of the plight of women and its commitment to
 involving them in the country's economic life. Their
 political role has been limited, but with expanding
 educational opportunities women are slowly assuming a larger
 role in the society. The Ministry of Social Affairs works to
 promote greater participation by women in the nation's
 economic, social, and political life. Three women are
 ministers in the current cabinet and others have been
 appointed high commissioners in several provinces and
 magistrates in the judicial system.
