 BURMA
 For 26 years Burma was a single-party, Socialist dictatorship.
 In a popular, essentially nonviolent uprising unprecedented in
 the nation's history, millions of Burmese demanded in August
 and September 1988 that the regime step down in favor of a
 democratic system. On September 18-19, the old leadership
 reasserted control by a military takeover which lethally
 suppressed peaceful demonstrators all over Burma and returned
 the nation to formal military rule.
 After independence from the British in 1948, Burma embarked on
 a path of national development with an essentially democratic
 political system. Factionalism, insurgencies, and economic
 problems led to a military coup in 1962, headed by General Ne
 Win. The 1974 Constitution established the Burma Socialist
 Program Party (BSPP) as the sole legal political party, with
 the authority to "lead the state." Personnel for government
 and party positions were drawn largely from the military, the
 tool by which Ne Win ran and controlled the nation.
 Following demonstrations by students and workers in June 1988
 protesting police brutality, repression of political rights,
 and the Government's mishandling of Burma's economy, the
 authorities closed the campuses and police drove trucks into a
 group of high school student demonstrators, killing several.
 At this point, the demonstrations escalated into
 antigovernment riots. Ne Win abruptly resigned the FSPP
 chairmanship on July 23. The choice of U Sein Lwin, widely
 regarded as responsible for numerous deaths of protesters
 during earlier demonstrations, as his successor touched off
 new antigovernment demonstrations. Efforts to suppress them
 by lethal force provoked even larger-scale demonstrations,
 forcing Sein Lwin's resignation after only 17 days in office.
 Sein Lwin was succeeded by Dr. Maung Maung, a moderate and
 respected civilian. Confronted by continuing demonstrations,
 Dr. Maung Maung pledged a national referendum for a multiparty
 system to be followed by elections if the referendum passed.
 Popular distrust of the Government, however, resulted in a
 rejection of this concession and continuing demonstrations and
 strikes, which brought the country to a standstill. Law and
 order also deteriorated as the Government withdrew all police
 from the cities and concurrently released large numbers of
 prisoners from the nation's jails. The army then swept Dr.
 Maung Maung aside and formally took power. Army loyalties to
 Ne Win remain strong and most observers see the former ruler's
 hand behind the military takeover and subsequent forceful
 repression of demonstrators. As it suppressed opposition by
 massive application of force, the military leadership vowed
 its intention to relinquish power shortly and to hold
 multiparty elections; however, that did not happen. A large
 number of parties have registered to contest the elections,
 including the successor of the BSPP, the National Unity Party.
 Burma has fought various insurgencies since independence.
 Some of the ethnically based insurgents are fighting for a
 measure of autonomy, if no longer for outright independence,
 and against what they perceive to be domination by the
 majority ethnic group, the Burmans. But most insurgent groups
 are no more than narcotics syndicates with private armies.
 The Burma Communist Party, the only insurgent group w~th
 stated political objectives based in ideology, also receives
 most of its revenue from drug trafficking. Though these
 groups have engaged only in small-scale fighting in their own
 areas on Burma's borders in recent years, the Government used
 
 
 BURMA
 their continued existence to justify in part the need for
 continued authoritarian rule, including the operation of an
 extensive security apparatus.
 Over the last 26 years, Ne Win's "Road to Socialism" reduced
 what was once the richest.country in Southeast Asia to one
 designated by the United Nations as a "least developed
 country." As Burma began to experience political upheaval in
 1988, its official economy was already staggering; the regime
 was beginning to renege on foreign debt, had virtually no
 foreign exchange reserves, and was dependent primarily on
 foreign aid--now halted due to the political upheavals--to
 remain solvent. Burmese consumers relied on a thriving black
 market, which the regime had been forced to tolerate, for many
 goods the official economy was incapable of supplying in
 adequatequantity. Aware of popular discontent with the
 economy, Ne Win in August 1987 promised badly needed economic
 reform, but no meaningful reform was implemented.
 The already poor human rights situation in Burma worsened
 significantly during 1988, as a result of regime efforts to
 quell its aroused population. Negative developments have
 included the killing of peaceful demonstrators, credible
 reports of arbitrary arrest and torture, compulsory labor, and
 the disappearance of political detainees.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Burmese law prohibits summary executions and Buddhist
 tenets stress the sanctity of life, 1988 saw large-scale
 indiscriminate killings of Burmese citizens by the regime's
 security forces. Official versions of these incidents were
 widely at variance with numerous eyewitness accounts by
 foreign diplomats, journalists, and other observers. The
 regime admitted that in March 41 student demonstrators died by
 suffocation after being forced by police into an overcrowded
 paddy wagon. Government efforts to cover up this incident
 failed in the face of eyewitness accounts, photographs, and
 public pressures. Other students were killed or wounded by
 police or died in jail during the March disturbances, but
 government secrecy makes it impossible to arrive at a reliable
 estimate of casualties. Some responsible observers place the
 March death toll in the hundreds.
 Observers estimate that in Rangoon several hundred were killed
 by police during antigovernment riots in June, although again
 it is impossible to confirm these figures. In one instance,
 police drove three trucks into a group of peacefully
 demonstrating high school students, killing four or five.
 Enraged crowds killed seven policemen in retaliation. During
 the March and June riots, students and workers destroyed some
 Government property. During August 8-13, troops opened fire
 on peaceful, unarmed citizens protesting Sein Lwin's ascension
 to power. Numerous eyewitness accounts confirm that troops
 chased and killed fleeing demonstrators and fired
 indiscriminately at onlookers and into houses. On August 10
 troops fired into a group of doctors, nurses, and others in
 front of Rangoon General Hospital, killing or wounding several
 doctors and nurses, who were pleading with troops to stop
 shooting. Thirty minutes later, the same troops returned and
 
 
 742
 BURMA
 again opened fire. In other areas of Rangoon, eyewitnesses
 report soldiers bayoneted female students and kicked the
 bodies of teenage student victims. Four separate eyewitness
 accounts of an August 10 incident in North Okkalapa, a working
 class suburb of Rangoon, describe in detail how soldiers knelt
 in formation and fired repeatedly at demonstrators in response
 to an army captain's orders. The first casualties were five
 or six teenage girls who carried flags and a photograph of
 Burma's assassinated founding father, Aung San. All four
 eyewitnesses reported large numbers of dead and wounded and
 estimated several hundred casualties on the.scene.
 Eyewitnesses report similar incidents throughout Rangoon
 during the August 8-13 period. Deaths probably numbered over
 2,000, but actual numbers can never be known. In many cases
 as soon as they finished firing, troops carted off victims for
 surreptitious mass disposal in order to mask the extent of the
 carnage.
 On September 19, troops throughout Burma opened fire without
 warning on peaceful demonstrators protesting the military
 takeover. In full sight of U.S. Embassy personnel, troops
 fired from concealed positions at demonstrators in front of
 the Embassy, killing at least two, one of whom was a vendor,
 and wounding many others. In several instances, after
 shooting people, soldiers refused to let Red Cross workers
 come to the aid of the wounded, and in one case shot and
 injured a Red Cross employee who attempted to do so. Residents
 of Rangoon heard prolonged and repeated bursts of gunfire and
 volleys throughout September 19 and 20 and were afterwards
 told of numerous accounts of indiscriminate killings of men,
 women, and children by troops. From eyewitness accounts of
 shootings, body counts in the hospitals, and photographic
 evidence, U.S. and other observers estimate possibly 1,000
 people were killed in Rangoon during the September 19-21
 period. Though the army's show of force succeeded in imposing
 an uneasy quiet throughout Burma by September 22, sporadic
 looting, mostly by desperately poor citizens, continued as of
 early October. The army's response was to shoot looters on
 sight. From August 25 to September 18 there was a period
 during which troops and police-withdrew from the streets of
 Rangoon and other major cities and all government services
 ceased. The population formed neighborhood watch committees
 and local vigilante groups to maintain law and order. The
 security situation was aggravated by large-scale releases of
 prisoners from jails across the country. In some cases, the
 vigilantes killed looters; in others they attacked security
 personnel in retaliation for the deaths of civilians. Many of
 the latter victims were beheaded. A rough estimate puts the
 total number of these deaths at about 50. While the number
 and the exact causes could not be determined by year's end,
 there is credible evidence that some of the returned students
 who fled Rangoon after the September 18 military takeover were
 subsequently arrested and died while in military custody.
 For security reasons, Burmese authorities did not allow U.S.
 and other diplomats to travel to areas of heavy insurgent
 activity. Therefore, U.S. officials were not able to gather
 directly information about human rights practices of the
 Burmese Government or of the insurgents in these areas.
 Government-controlled media cite numerous examples of insurgent
 violence that resulted in the deaths of civilians. Although
 it cannot be confirmed, it is reasonable to believe there were
 violations on both sides. The brutality inflicted by the army
 on fellow Burmans in 1988 adds credence to reports over the
 years of the military's severe mistreatment of ethnic
 
 
 743
 BURMA
 minorities, traditionally regarded by majority Burmans as
 inferior.
 b. Disappearance
 The Government did not divulge the whereabouts of the large
 numbers of persons detained following the March and June
 disturbances. Bowing to mounting public pressure in August,
 the Government released most of these detainees, although not
 everyone arrested was accounted for. On August 24, Amnesty
 International (AI) reported that on the basis of official
 arrest and release figures over a period of several months,
 between 842 and 1664 people are missing. Though it is not
 possible to estimate how many, a number of demonstrators
 rounded.up during the August 8-3 and September 19-21 shootings
 remain unaccounted for. The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon received
 inquiries from various individuals or organizations outside
 Burma about the whereabouts of Burmese and resident foreigners,
 mostly South Asians, who were jailed or disappeared. In
 virtually all cases, Burmese authorities did not reply to
 Embassy requests for information.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the 1974 Constitution provides that punishment shall
 not be in violation of human dignity, police and security
 forces at times use psychological coercion and torture during
 investigations in both criminal and political and security
 cases. The Government officially denies that torture or
 inhuman treatment is practiced. Prison conditions are poor,
 due in part to Burma's poverty. While several recently
 released, high profile, political prisoners reported that they
 were not ill-treated, there are numerous accounts of
 mistreatment of students jailed during the March and June
 riots, including repeated but unconfirmed accusations that
 several girls were raped by prison officials. After the
 September 18 military takeover, many people reported being
 verbally abused, slapped, and otherwise humiliated by troops.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no provision in Burmese law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. In serious cases involving national security, some
 persons may not be formally charged but held under an
 antisubversion act in indefinite detention without trial. In
 less serious political and security cases, detention under the
 act is nominally limited to 180 days, but this may be extended
 with Cabinet approval. In practice, the term "crimes against
 the State" is broadly applied. In common criminal cases,
 police may detain suspects for up to 24 hours, after which a
 court order must be sought from competent judicial authorities.
 These renewable court orders authorize 14-day extensions of
 the detention until charges are formally brought before a
 court. Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during the
 period of investigation and interrogation but normally are
 allowed visitors thereafter.
 During the March and June riots and the August 8-13 and
 September 19-21 shootings, large numbers of antigovernment
 demonstrators were rounded up by authorities and detained,
 without being formally charged or brought to trial. By early
 October, military authorities were still searching for and
 detaining people involved in opposition activities. It is
 
 
 744
 BURMA
 difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the numbers detained
 during the March-June period. Authorities arrested prominent
 opposition leader Aung Gyi and 10 others July 20, including an
 Associated Press correspondent, a Burmese citizen. The
 Government announced they had been arrested to "protect the
 State" and would face criminal charges and trial for
 antigovernment activities. They were released August 25
 during mounting public pressure for a change of government.
 Refugees and other stateless persons are regarded as illegal
 immigrants subject to arrest. If they cannot be repatriated
 after serving sentences for illegal entry, they may be detained
 indefinitely. Several hundred illegal immigrants from a number
 of Asian countries previously under detention were released
 and expatriated when the Government inexplicably opened most
 of Burma's prisons during the week of August 21-27.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is not independent of the government leadership,
 which can influence both verdict and sentence, particularly in
 political and security cases. Influence, payments, and favors
 are often factors in lower court decisions. Tight control
 through party channels and the mandatory use of three-judge
 panels tend to restrain judicial activism. At the same time,
 lower court judges, being more easily swayed by local political
 and financial pressures, are not always accountable to the
 higher court. The legal code is based upon the British
 colonial system of law, as modified and expanded by the
 present Constitution and other legal measures imposed by the
 Government. The Constitution provides for public trials in
 most cases, and this practice is followed in common criminal
 cases. In political and security cases, special judiciary
 committees may be named by the government leadership. The
 public normally is allowed to attend such trials. The burden
 of proof is on the prosecution in both common criminal and
 political and security cases. The accused has the right to
 counsel in both types of cases, and legal counsel is provided
 for indigent defendants faced with a possible sentence of 7
 years or more. Normally, defendants can consult freely and
 privately with their lawyers. The verdicts of civil,
 security, and military courts may be appealed to the next
 higher court up to the Council of State.
 Following mass arrests of demonstrators in March, June, August,
 and September, individuals were detained as far as can be
 determined without being formally charged or brought before
 judicial authorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In political and security cases, security forces are not
 subject to judicial procedures and usually enter homes without
 warrants. In areas of insurgency, forced entry and warrantless
 searches are carried out by government security forces and
 rebel groups alike. It is widely believed that security
 personnel selectively monitor private correspondence and
 telephone calls. A well-developed system of neighborhood
 informers reports on dissidents and criticism of the
 Government. Following the September 18 military takeover, the
 Government authorized soldiers to search private homes and
 vehicles, during which many individual soldiers abused
 
 
 745
 BURMA
 civilians and stole money and valuables. In common criminal
 cases, however, police officials are required to have a valid
 search warrant or to be accompanied by a member of the local
 People's Council at the time of search. Search warrants are
 issued by local or state judges' committees.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press in Burma is severely restricted.
 The Constitution contains provisions for freedom of speech,
 expression, and publication but stipulates that the exercise
 of such freedoms should not be "contrary to the interest of
 the working people and socialism." In practice, opposition
 viewpoints and public criticism of the Government are not
 tolerated. Anyone criticizing the Government's leadership in
 public or private is subject to arrest.
 The Government owns and operates the mass media in Burma,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers
 (now one). There are some private periodicals. Newspaper
 editors are appointed by the Ministry of Information, and
 editorials must be approved in advance. Journalists are
 subject to strict guidelines as to what can be broadcast or
 published, especially on domestic matters. International news
 is subject to prior review and selection. Foreign shortwave
 radio broadcasts are not jammed. Criticism of government
 officials is not permitted in the press, although cartoons and
 editorials will sometimes criticize local administration
 indirectly. All forms of communications--domestic and
 imported books and periodicals, stage plays, motion pictures,
 and musical recordings--are subject to government control and
 censorship. The Government monitors academic inquiry in the
 social sciences.
 For a brief period in August, the Government tolerated
 relative press freedom in response to public pressures for
 democracy. Buoyed by changed conditions, independent printers
 started up a flurry of "instant" street corner publications.
 This new press freedom ended abruptly with the September 18
 military takeover, following which troops roughed up and
 arrested vendors and pkinters of the new newspapers, and
 authorities resumed strict control of all government media.
 Similarly, large numbers of people who addressed rallies and
 crowds of demonstrators in August and early September were
 picked up and detained by the authorities or went into hiding.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for the right of assembly
 and association, it exists only for those organizations
 permitted by law. Until the recent provision allowing for the
 registration of political parties, the Government did not
 permit private associations, except for innocuous social
 purposes and then only on a very limited basis. All
 organizations must be registered formally with the Government
 and, in effect, are subject to government control. Public
 meetings must be sanctioned by the Government. Although
 authorities allowed large-scale demonstrations to take place
 in late August and early September, they have once again
 cracked down. Following the September 18 takeover, military
 authorities decreed that people were not allowed to gather in
 groups of more than five. Large numbers of government workers
 were sacked for having participated in antigovernment
 
 
 746
 BURMA
 demonstrations. On September 30, military authorities
 announced a new law severely limiting the formation of
 associations and organizations and the definitions of both.
 The law stated that, in the future, prospective groups or
 organizations would have to apply for a permit from the
 Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs.
 The Government in recent years promulgated two directives that
 limit Buddhist monks' right to assembly and association.
 Acting through the government-controlled hierarchy of the
 monkhood (Sangha), the State has prohibited monks from
 attending various forms of public entertainment. While this
 has been done, in part, ostensibly to maintain the moral
 purity of the Sangha, it is also aimed at curbing the political
 activities of monks, one of the most influential groups in
 Burmese society and heavily involved in the past year's
 antigovernment protests.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state dominated by the Burman ethnic
 group. Freedom of religion is provided for in the
 Constitution and, with some exceptions, is observed in
 practice. The great majority of Burmese are Buddhist,
 although there are sizable Christian, Muslim, and animist
 minorities based principally in various minority ethnic
 groups. While minority religious groups are allowed to
 practice freely, security services monitor the activities of
 some religious communities closely. Some persons of mixed
 Burman and ethnic minority ancestry have been known to become
 Buddhists as a way of strengthening their claim to be
 considered ethnic Burmans.
 There is considerable social prejudice against Muslims in
 Burma. Occasionally this erupts in violence and has led to
 government action which infringed on the practice of the
 Muslim religion. Following several instances of communal
 violence in several towns and cities in Burma in July,
 authorities in Rangoon placed restrictions on numbers and
 kinds of animals slaughtered for a feast marking the Muslim
 holiday of Id Bakri. Fearing a spread of violence to their
 community, Rangoon's Muslim leaders observed the restrictions.
 Religious groups can and do maintain links with coreligionists
 in other countries: for example, the Roman Catholic church
 maintains ties to the Vatican. Foreign religious
 representatives are usually allowed only tourist visas and are
 not permitted to preach, proselytize, or remain to carry out
 missionary work. So far as is known, there are no foreign
 missionaries resident in Burma. All religious organizations
 are required to register with the Government. Religious
 publications are subject to the same government control and
 censorship as other publications. On occasion, the Government
 has used a nationalization law to take control of the property
 of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution assures Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, Burmese citizens can travel freely within
 the country but must inform local authorities of their
 
 
 747
 BURMA
 temporary place of residence. Noncitizen residents, including
 persons born in Burma who hold foreigners' registration cards,
 must obtain prior permission to travel. Legal requirements
 and bureaucratic procedures cause long delays in obtaining
 passports, and the right to emigrate is usually, though not
 always, denied. Severe limits are placed on what emigrants
 are allowed to take with them. Before traveling abroad,
 emigrants normally must reimburse the Government for their
 university and professional education and pay income tax in
 advance.
 Persons who retain Burmese citizenship and who left the
 country legally are generally allowed to return to visit
 relatives. Burma does rot recognize dual citizenship;
 acquiring citizenship in another country results in the loss
 of Burmese citizenship. Those who take citizenship in another
 country are banned from returning to Burma. Emigrants wishing
 to return permanently are required to reapply for Burmese
 citizenship. Burmese who leave the country illegally cannot
 legally return. There are reported instances of Burmese
 abroad being denied permission to enter Burma to visit ill or
 dying parents. Burma does not permit foreign refugees or
 displaced persons to resettle or seek safehaven within Burma.
 The Government treats persons claiming to be refugees as
 illegal immigrants and imprisons them. A group of illegal
 Vietnamese imprisoned in Rangoon were released in August when
 the Government inexplicably opened-prisons and jails throughout
 Burma. The Vietnamese were sent to resettlement countries,
 with the help of third-country embassies. Authorities have
 twice imposed a curfew on Rangoon (June and September) and
 have imposed curfews on other major towns throughout the
 country. In October, all of Burma was under an 8 p.m. to 4
 a.m. curfew.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the Constitution, Burmese citizens do not enjoy the
 right to change their Government. Authorities-forcefully
 suppressed the Burmese people's widespread and peaceful
 demonstrations for democracy; but in response to such
 demonstrations, the Government promised elections under a
 multiparty system at an unspecified future date. In this
 context, laws have been promulgated governing the registration
 of political parties. Opposition figures have formed and
 registered political parties. Representatives of legally
 registered parties are allowed to gather and to speak but must
 refrain from antigovernment remarks. The Government retains
 the right to disband these parties if they violate the
 parameters established by law for their operation.
 Ethnic Burmans continue to dominate the political system.
 Under the 1982 Citizenship Law, ethnic Burmese, including
 indigenous minorities, enjoy advantages that are not available
 to immigrants and their immediate descendants. The law
 significantly limits the political, residential, and ownership
 rights of immigrants (primarily ethnic Chinese and Indians)
 whose parents or grandparents are not citizens. Full
 citizenship is conferred only on those whose ancestors lived
 in Burma prior to the First Anglo-Burman war in 1824.  Women
 are underrepresented in the Government relative to their
 percentage of the general population. There are no women in
 the senior ranks of government service above the rank of
 director general.
 
 
 748
 BURMA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 According to AI, the Government responded directly it for the
 first time in August to inform it of the release of prominent
 opposition leader Aung Gyi and others who had been arrested in
 July. Otherwise the Government does not permit investigations
 of its human rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss
 human rights problems with outside governmental or
 nongovernmental organizations.
 In early September, opposition members established an office,
 calling itself Amnesty International of Burma, to monitor the
 human rights situation. Since the September 18 military
 takeover, local human rights observers have largely avoided a
 public role. Burma does not actively participate in
 international or regional human rights bodies. The Government
 has permitted visits by U.N. organizations such as the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
 discuss a few specific issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages. Economic development among minorities
 has lagged, and many still live at the subsistence level.
 This is due in part to geographic factors which impede
 economic development in rugged, isolated, ethnic minority
 populated border areas. Burma's chronic insurgencies, many of
 which are based on minority grievances and on the proceeds
 from narcotics production and trafficking, also play a large
 role in lagging economic development. Minorities are
 underrepresented in the Government, are largely excluded from
 the military leadership, and suffer other forms of
 discrimination. Persons of nonethnic Burmese ancestry,
 primarily Indians and Chinese, while denied full citizenship
 status and excluded from government positions, continue to
 play an important role in the economy, a factor resented by
 the majority Burmans.
 Women in Burma have historically played an active role in
 society, but this varies with cultural traditions and ethnic
 backgrounds. In general, Burmese women enjoy most of the same
 legal rights as men. They keep their own names after marriage,
 are active in trade, and often control family finances. As of
 1987, more women were entering universities and the civil
 service. However, this was tempered by "quota systems" which
 ensured that these fields would not be dominated by women,
 resulting in a disproportionately large male domination of
 both fields.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no genuine trade unions and no independent labor
 movement in Burma. Workers do not have the right to organize
 independently, to bargain collectively, or to strike. Prior
 to the events of July-September 1988, the labor force was
 organized into workers' and peasants' mass organizations
 controlled by the only legal political party, the BSPP. Most
 of the leaders of these organizations were party officials,
 
 
 749 ,
 
 BURMA
 and their national leadership was made up of ranking party and
 government officials. On September 30, military authorities
 announced new laws strictly governing the formation of groups
 and organizations. Those wishing to form organizations must
 apply for permission to the Ministry of Home and Religious
 Affairs. Outlawed organizations include those that attempt to
 "incite, encourage, or assist in undermining or stopping the
 operation of state administrative machinery." Approved groups
 or organizations may gather and make speeches but may not
 speak out against the Government. Labor organizations and
 other professional associations are not permitted to maintain
 independent relations with international private bodies.
 Burma is a member of the ILO, although it has been consistently
 criticized by the ILO's Committee of Experts on the Application
 of Conventions and Recommendations (CACR) for failure to
 observe ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of Association which
 Burma ratified in 1955. In 1988, as in many previous years,
 the CACR urged the Government to bring its legislation and
 practice into conformity with the Convention.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 As noted above, workers have no right to bargain collectively.
 Labor disputes in both the public and private sectors are
 mediated by arbitration boards composed of worker, management,
 and government representatives. In practice, these committees
 are under strict control by the Government. In the past,
 since many public sector workers, management, and government
 representatives were all BSPP officials, the process had
 little meaning. For a short time during the August and early
 September demonstrations and general strike, workers began to
 form independent labor unions and strike committees in
 virtually every government ministry and economic organization.
 These were quickly dissolved following the military takeover.
 At the end of 1988, there was no reason to believe workers
 would be granted any greater freedom to organize or bargain
 collectively under the new military authorities.
 No special economic zones exist in Burma.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Burma's legal code does not contain any statutory prohibition
 of forced labor. The Burma Army frequently conscripts civilian
 males in the vicinity of military operations (primarily in
 areas populated by ethnic minorities) to serve as porters.
 Some of these porters are killed by mines planted by insurgents
 and in military engagements. In mid-October the Government
 revealed that 1,120 people had been rounded up for labor and
 porter service against the various insurgencies facing the
 Government (many sources, including eyewitness accounts,
 indicate that by the end of December this figure had increased
 significantly and the practice is still continuing). Many of
 those seized are reportedly being sent to active military
 units. Others allegedly are employed cleaning streets and
 rebuilding the partially destroyed Insein prison. Women have
 also been conscripted, some being required to work in the
 women's ward of Insein prison. Insurgent groups also
 press-gang villagers into service as recruits or porters.
 Following the September 18 military takeover, troops forced
 people to remove neighborhood barricades, sometimes making
 them push concrete pipes aside with their heads. There are
 unconfirmed reports that in some cases the people were then
 shot.
 
 
 750
 BURMA
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 At present the minimum age for workers is 13. Children
 between 13 and 15 may work for 4 hours a day. The penalty for
 employees who disregard this regulation is 2 years in prison.
 However, the regulation is not strictly enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees-in the public
 sector and a 6-day, 44-hour workweek for private and parastatal
 sector employees, with overtime paid for additional work.
 However, public sector employees seldom actually work more
 than 6 1/2 hours a day. Workers have 21 paid holidays a year,
 and there are numerous legal provisions to protect workers'
 health and safety, but these are not strictly enforced. The
 minimum legal wage is about $1 per day at current official
 exchange rates, although at the more realistic free market
 rate, this works out to about 25 cents a day. Wages commonly
 have lagged far behind inflation and are not nearly enough for
 subsistence, particularly in the case of large or extended
 families. In the private sector the minimum wage law applies
 only to cheroot-rolling plants and rice mills. There are
 rules governing health and safety conditions at workplaces,
 pertaining to room size, ventilation, fire hazards, and
 availability of latrines and drinking water. In practice,
 these are seldom enforced, particularly in the private sector.
