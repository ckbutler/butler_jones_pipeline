 INDONESIA
 President Soeharto and the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
 --which include-the military services and the police--are the
 preeminent institutions in Indonesia's Government, which came
 to power in the mid-1960's after an abortive Communist-backed
 coup. Since 1967 executive authority has been exercised by
 retired and active-duty military officers and civilian  -
 technocrats under President Soeharto's leadership. The partly
 elected, partly appointed Parliament (DPR) considers but does
 not initiate legislation. The People's Consultative Assembly
 (mPR)--consisting of 500 appointed members and the 500 DPR
 members--meets every 5 years to approve guidelines for
 government policy and elect the President and Vice President.
 Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world and
 the largest in Southeast Asia. Since independence, Indonesian
 governments have sought to create a unique national identity
 and to accommodate a diversity of ethnic, linguistic,
 religious, and social groups, while assuring internal security
 and cohesion. The centerpiece of the Soeharto Government's
 political program is "Pancasila," an eclectic state ideology
 emphasizing onsultation and consensus and composed of five
 broad principles: belief in one supreme god, belief in a just
 and civilized-humanity, Indonesian national unity, democracy,
 and social jvistice.
 The armed forces number about 416,000. A little less than
 half serve in the army, which is primarily concerned with
 internal security. Under a "dual function" concept, many
 military officers serve in Parliament and the civilian
 bureaucracy at all levels. Frequent military operations took
 place in East Timor and Irian Jaya, where Fretilin and
 Organization for a Free Papua (OPM) rebels continued sporadic
 activities in low-level insurgencies.
 Although Indonesia's mixed economy involves the State in
 nearly all sectors, the Government is pursuing a set of
 policies designed-to give greater freedom to the private
 sector. Beginning with-the collapse-of oil prices in the
 early 1980's, deregulation aimed primarily at stimulating
 growth in nonoil sectors has been a major government
 objective. A large devaluation in 1986, and a subsequent
 flexible.exchange rate, has helped strengthen the rupiah and
 boost nonoil exports. The oil sector accounted for -less than
 50 percent of Government revenues and foreign exchange
 earnings in 1988.. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in
 1988 was 5.7 percent and the industrial growth rate much
 higher. Despite substantial increases in real incomes in the
 past 20 years, the country remains poor and wide disparities
 in wealth continue. Corruption and influence peddling are
 endemic and restrict growth and economic opportunity.
 Despite progress in some-areas, including greater freedom of
 movement for Indonesians and foreigners to and within East
 Timor, continged tolerance for ethnic, racial, and religious
 differengeli, a broadened political debate, including enhancing
 the role of parliament vis-a-vis the executive, ew government
 regul-ations that protect working women and formalize the
 mininmum wage structure, and the conviction and sentencing to
 jail terms of several police officers for mistreatment or
 killing of detainees, serious human rights problems remained.
 These included harsh treatment of Muslim activists' efforts to
 organize opposition, discrimination against ethnic Chinese,
 reports of excessive use-of force in quelling violence in
 Lampung, periodic detentions of East Timorese suspected of
 
 
 850
 INDONESIA
 Fretilin sympathies, killings of civilians in East Timor,
 harsh sentences meted out in several subversion trials,
 continued significant restrictions on freedoms of the press
 and movement, and pervasive political controls which ensure
 continued military domination of the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Casualties in Lampung Province in a clash in February between
 members of an Islamic sect and the military, responding to an
 officer's kidnaping and.murder, officially numbered 38, most
 of-.them-civilians. The background of the incident remains
 obscure, but persistent allegations of a significantly higher
 death toll than officially announced raise concern about the
 military's possible use of excessive force in restoring order.
 A presidential autobiography published in Aprilexplained that
 the "mysterious killings" or summary executions of thousands
 of suspected criminals from 1982 to 1985 were a deliberate
 policy to stem increased crime. At that time, officials
 attributed the killings to criminal gang warfare. An
 estimated two dozen or more civilians were killed by the
 military in East Timor in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 Temporary disappearance of persons held for interrogation by
 security forces occurred periodically, particularly in East
 Timor and Irian Jaya. Reports were often unspecific and
 difficult to confirm, but in some cases authorities appeared
 to act outside the law.
 No exact figures are available on the number of permanent
 disappearances widely believed to occur yearly. Newspapers in
 May publicized the cases of Nano and Soni Abdullah, brothers
 who reportedly disappeared following arrest in Pekanbaru in
 1984. Regular International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 access to prisons in East Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia has
 helped to locate some missing persons in past years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible reports of torture and mistreatment of criminal
 suspects, detainees, and prisoners were frequent. Police
 .treatment of detainees, even in minor incidents, often results
 in physical abuse. Several students detained in the wake of
 the Pope's visit to East Timor in October were reportedly
 beaten. The practice of "shooting to wound" suspected
 criminals allegedly attempting to elude arrest in Medan
 declined in 1989. The local press, nonetheless, continued to
 report at least one incident each month in which police shot a
 suspect in the leg, often repeatedly. Officials have publicly
 acknowledged and condemned police brutality  nd unacceptable
 prison conditions and in 1989 took disciplinary action in
 several cases against criminal suspects. Among other
 instances, the Yogyakarta military court dismissed two
 policemen and sentenced them to jail terms of 2 years 3 months
 -and 2 years 6 months, respectively, for beating to death
 17-year-old Bakri Budi Santoso, and a military court in
 
 
 851
 INDONESIA
 Cianjur sentenced two police officers to 17 and 15 years,
 respectively, for killing a student, Apud Mahpudin. There
 were no known instances of officials being punished for
 mistreatment of political prisoners or detainees. East
 Timorese Bishop Belo and others alleged mistreatment and
 torture by security forces in East Timor of persons detained
 on suspicion of aiding or sympathizing with the Fretilin
 guerrillas, charges denied by officials. Similar allegations
 were made concerning mistreatment of persons in Irian Jaya
 suspected of ties with or sympathies for the Organization for
 a Free Papua (OPM) rebels. Rebels in both East Timor and
 Irian Jaya reportedly harassed and terrorized civilians from
 time to time.
 d' Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The criminal procedures code (KUHAP) contains protections
 against arbitrary -arrest and detention and specifies the right
 of prisoners to legal counsel and notification of family.
 These safeguards are often disregarded in practice, notably in
 cases of alleged subversion. KUHAP provisions are respected
 ,more regularly in urban areas than in small towns or remote
 areas. Security agencies arrest and detain persons to
 intimidate and inhibit activities they consider undesirable.
 Legal'mechanisms for redress of such actions are inadequate.
 The Jakarta district court rejected a suit by student
 demonstrators against police for alleged unlawful detention on
 the grounds that the students were interrogated as witnesses,
 not suspects,'and thus not entitled to challenge the legality
 of their detention.
 Detainees in cases of alleged subversion can be held up to a
 year without charges. In the past the number of persons
 detained without trial was estimated to be as many as 500,
 although this figure could not be verified, and no more recent
 estimates were available. Security forces in East Timor on
 several1 odoasions detained persons for days or weeks on
 suspicion-of subiversive activity. Most were subsequently
 released without'charges. Implementation of a 1987
 Presidential Decrde on remission of prison terms produced
 uncertainty about the status of some prisoners, including
 several reportedly still in jail despite apparent expiration
 of their sentences. Mrs. Sundari Abdulrahman,-a former
 official in the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI)'whdse case
 was under consideration by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, was
 released from prison in August. A number of East Timorese
 left prisons in Jakarta and Dili'after finishing sentences for
 involvement with Fretilin.
 The precise functions and powers of the Agency 'for
 Coordination'of Assistance for the Consolidation of National
 Security (BAKORSTANAS) remained unclear. In Lampung and
 elsewhere, elements of it appeared to exercise the emergency
 security'prbvisiohf- accorded its predecessor, the Command for
 the Restoration of Security and Order (KOPKAMTIB). 'KOPKAMTIB
 was permitted exceptions from KUHAP procedures and wide,
 special powers to detain and interrogate persons thought to
 threaten national security, particularly in cases of suspected
 subversion, sabotage, secession, or corruption. BAKORSTANAS
 may have retained those powers. Indonesian law does not
 provide for the right to judicial review of such actions or
 for the right to protection or legal aid for the detainees.
 Their cases are rarely if ever publicized.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see section 6.c.
 
 
 852
 INDONESIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A quadripartite judiciary, consisting of general, religious,
 military, and administrative courts, exists below the Supreme
 Court, the highest court of appeal. Parliament passed a law
 in December that will permit--once implementing regulations
 are drawn up--the religious courts used by many Muslims to
 effect judgments without consent of the general courts and to
 exercise jurisdiction over a somewhat widened field of family
 law matters. The independence of the judiciary is
 significantly constrained by the facts that judges are civil
 servants of the executive branch and that the Supreme Court
 cannot annul laws passed by Parliament.
 Panels of three judges conduct most trials, hear evidence,
 decide guilt or innocence, and assess punishment. The right
 of appeal from district court to high court to Supreme Court
 exists. The Supreme Court does not consider material aspects
 of a case, only the application of law by lower courts.
 Initial judgments are rarely reversed, although sentences are
 occasionally changed. Most court sessions are open to the
 public and most defendants, if they can pay, have access to
 counsel. However, such access is in some cases significantly
 delayed and there are occasional reports of official efforts
 to influence the choice of counsel. If destitute, defendants
 can find private legal help such as that provided by the Legal
 Aid Institute (LBH). Alternatively, the courts have
 discretion to provide a limited amount of aid for those unable
 to afford legal assistance. The State must dssure legal
 assistance in capital cases. Government support for programs
 to improve legal awareness and literacy, legal training, and
 legal research capabilities is a positive step toward
 addressing the legal system's deficiencies.
 Corruption permeates the Indonesian legal system. In civil
 and criminal cases, bribes can influence decisions,
 prosecution, conviction, and sentencing. Use in trials of
 forced confessions and limitations on the presentation of
 evidence by the defense are reportedly common. The Government
 has occasionally taken action against flagrant offenders, but
 by and large these abuses continue unchecked.
 Conviction is virtually automatic for persons accused under
 Indonesials broad 1963 subversion provisions, which among
 other things forbid advocacy or actions in support of
 secession or creation of an Islamic state, as well as
 criticism of Pancasila. President Soeharto said in August
 that comparative study of foreign ideologies, including
 Communism, with Pancasila is permissible. The Government
 tried or announced preparations to try some 70 persons for
 subversion in 1989. A student and an employee at Yogyakarta's
 Gajah Mada University were sentenced to prison terms of 7 and
 8 years, respectively, for circulating, possessing, or
 advocating banned writings. Appeals are expected. Trials of
 some defendants from the February incident in Lampung produced
 sentences of life imprisonment in five cases and 20 years in
 another. All but one of these defendants refused the
 Government's offer of legal assistance. Trials also began in
 Jakarta and Sumbawa of persons charged with seeking to
 establish an Islamic state.
 The Government does not provide data on the number of persons
 serving sentences under antisubversion laws. Some observers
 estimate there may be at least 400. These estimates include
 persons sentenced for involvement in the 1965 coup attempt and
 
 
 853
 INDONESIA
 alleged Muslim extremists, many of whom, some observers
 believe, -were convicted for peaceful protest activity.
 The President (through the Coordinating Minister for Political
 Affairs and Security), the Minister of Justice, and the
 Attorney General, criticized as too lenient a district court
 decision in March which sentenced a convicted smuggler to a
 year's probation. Smuggling is classified as a subversive
 offense and subject to a maximum penalty of death. In April a
 national legal association called on its Jakarta chapter to
 deny legal counsel to persons charged with smuggling and
 corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases
 involving suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption., However, forced or surreptitious entry by
 security agencies reportedly occurs regularly, especially in
 East Timor. Security agencies also conduct surveillance of
 persons and residences to intimidate and are believed to
 monitor selectively local and international telephone calls,
 without legal restraint. Correspondence generally is not
 monitored, although letter mail to and from East Timor may
 still be an exception. Government security officials try to
 monitor the movements and activities of up to 2.5 million
 former members of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and
 approximately 20 mil-lion former members of its front groups.
 Even relatives of such persons can suffer adverse
 consequences, e.g., loss of government employment.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Significant restrictions on freedom of speech and press
 exist. Laws delimiting the rights of individual persons and
 the Government are applied by different government agencies
 with considerable discretionary authority and without
 effective.judicial review. Public statements or publications
 which criticize or could be perceived as critical of the
 Government, Pancasila, top leaders, their families, or
 particular religious and ethnic groups are strongly
 discouraged if not strictly forbidden. Trials and convictions
 of some persons under the subversion law periodically
 demonstrate these limitations.
 The media generally avoid or exercise great caution in
 disseminating y~ews of government critics, including prominent
 opposition figures, because of the risk of official disapproval
 or informal government instructions not to publish them. The
 general lack of specific, clear guidelines on what is
 permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press.
 Nonethplesrs, the limitp of government tolerance are regularly
 tested, and public discussion and media reporting of a number
 of topics generally regarded as sensitive to the Government
 (including human rights issues) increased significantly in
 1989. Some representatives of nongovernmental organizations
 attending an April conference in Belgium went beyond the
 governmental bounds, however, and officials publicly and
 privately chastised them for voicing criticism outside
 Indonesia of the alleged negative social and human rights
 impact of certain development projects.
 
 
 854
 INDONESIA
 The Government operates the national television network. It
 was criticized by the Minister of Information for airing songs
 the Government judged to be of low moral value and by
 -religious leaders-for showing a film considered offensive to
 Muslims. A private company which offers a subscription
 television-service to viewers in the Jakarta area received a
 government warning for advertising and programming considered
 culturally inappropriate. Satellite dishes are used by the
 media and �he elite to monitor television broadcasts from the
 United States and other countries. Television signals from
 neighboring countries are received in some parts of
 Indonesia. While more than 400 private radio stations operate
 in ndonesia, they may use only government-provided news
 programs. The Minister of Information warned the many
 Indonesians who listen to shortwave radio broadcasts not to be
 mnduly influenced by reports critical of the country.
 while academic freedom is guaranteed, constraints exist on the
 activities of scholars. They sometimes refrain from producing
 written materials, including dissertations, which they believe
 might provoke government displeasure. Publishers are unwilling
 to accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues.
 The press is largely privately owned. Civilian and military
 officials regularly maintain that, in accordance with
 Pancasila, the press is "free" but also "responsible." The
 Government expects the media to support national development
 and stability; to be educational; and to uphold professional
 standards. Government officials regularly advise editors and
 reporters about news which cannot be reported and closely
 monitor media outlets for material unacceptable to the
 Government. The Government issues oral or written warnings
 for published material found objectionable. If ignored,
 warnings could result in a circulation ban or revocation of
 the license to publish. The number of newspaper licenses is
 limited, and regulations control the amount of advertising and
 the number of pages. In 1989 the press received warnings for
 reports on land disputes, student demonstrations, and
 subversion trials; for speculation about future political
 leaders; for publication of sexually provocative pictures; and
 for "isquotation of officials. The Attorney General banned as
 culturally inappropriate an Indonesian-language translation of
 a children's educational book depicting the human reproductive
 process. Several-other foreign and domestic books were banned
 for assertedly subversive ideological content.
 Chinese-language publications, with the exception of one
 officially sanctioned daily -newspaper, can neither be imported
 nor produced domestically. Although-organized private
 instruction of Chinese is discouraged, there are some private
 school classes, informal circles, and private teachers. No
 laws prohibit the speaking of Chinese, but the Government lays
 heavy stress on the learning and use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia.
 The Government clvsely regulates visiting and resident foreign
 correspondents and occasionally reminds the latter of its
 prerogative to deny requests for visas or visa extensions.
 One foreign correspondent was denied entry in 1989; no foreign
 correspondents were denied visa extensions.
 The importation of foreign publications and video tapes, which
 must be reviewed by government censors, requires a permit.
 Importers usually avoid foreign books critical of the
 Government or dealing with topics sensitive to the Government,
 
 
 INDONESIA
 such as human rights..,Foreign periodicals, readily available
 in Indonesia, are subject to censorship prior to
 distribution. Importation of some foreign newspapers and
 magazines and all Communist publications is prohibited. In
 1989 the Attorney General and Supreme Court banned first the
 importation of "The Satanic Verses" and then its domestic
 circulation..,Censorship of imported newspapers and other
 written materials generally was more relaxed in 1989.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations must havegovernment permission to hold
 regional-and national meetings. Local jurisdictions often
 require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While
 obtaining such approval .is fairly automatic and apparently was
 eased in 1989, authorities withhold permission on occasion.
 Officials refused ..to approve a-Christian youth gathering in a
 predominantly Muslim areain-southeast Sulawesi. Student
 gatherings haye often been-Lthe target of disapprovals, and
 overt political activity at universities remains forbidden
 under the.-"campus life normalization" (or "NKK") law of 1978.
 Nonetheless, student'activism, including peaceful
 demonstrations,, increased markedly.in 1989. Reactions from
 civilian and-military- officials and university rectors varied
 considerably,. Sometimes students were applauded for bringing
 issues to public attention- other..times tolerated, warned, or
 'expelled;.andion several occasions-forcibly dispersed.
 Several student .protestora were hospitalized in September
 following a'clash with security forces in Yogyakarta.
 -Authorities detained and arrested several students for
 participating in protests. Two of these went on trial on
 criminal charges. A demonstration by about a score of
 students displaying nationalist banners which took place at
 the conclusion of the Pope's mass in East Timor was broken up
 by security forces. Credible reports say several students
 were detained; others sought refuge in the local-bishop's
 residence.-
 The 1985 "Social Organizations" (or "Ormas") Law requires all
 organizations, including-recognized religions and
 associations, to adhere to Pancasila. This-provision, which
 limits-political activity, is widely understood as.prohibiting
 groups.which advocate making indonesia an Islamic state. The
 law. dmpawerp the. Sovernment toidisband any organization it
 believes to be acting against, the tenets of Pancasila and
 requires pxior government approval for-any organization's
 acceptance of foreign funds.. Security forces have infiltrated
 and broken up Islamic study groups which met privately to
 advocate strict obedience to Islamic law.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions., see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees religious freedom for four
 -state ecognized religions-Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and
 -'induism--and also permits the practice of mystic and animist
 religion ("aliran kepercayaan"). Although most Indonesians
 are Muslims, Indonesia has traditionally displayed a high
 degree of religious tolerance, and the practice and teachings
 of the other recognized faiths are respected. The Catholic
 church operates freely in East Timor.
 
 
 856
 INDONESIA
 There are, however, a number of restrictions on religious
 activity. According to official statistics, nearly 400
 "misleading religious cults" are banned, including some
 Islamic groups considered heretical. These bannings affect
 perhaps 20,000 adherents or more. New bannings occur
 periodically. Membership in Jehovah's Witnesses and the
 Baha'i faith is banned, although several thousand Jehovah's
 Witnesses are believed to practice in Jakarta alone. A
 central Java court in 1989 sentenced two persons to jail terms
 of 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 years, respectively, for spreading
 Jehovah's Witnesses' teachings and allegedly causing unrest.
 Authorities have occasionally harassed or discriminated
 against Baha'is. Twelve members of a banned Muslim sect were
 reportedly arrested in south Sumatra in September en route to
 Aceh for proselytizing. Because the first tenet of the
 Pancasila is belief in a supreme being, atheism is forbidden.
 The legal requirement to adhere to Pancasila extends to all
 religious and secular organizations. The Government often
 tolerates private practice of banned religions, although local
 authorities occasionally harass adherents or pressure them to
 convert.
 The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advocate
 establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic
 law, both of which are outlawed. An estimated 120 alleged
 Muslim extremists are serving prison terms on charges of
 subversion. Several foreign Muslim fundamentalist teachers
 reportedly found proselytizing while on tourist passes were
 deported during the year with some publicity.
 There is no legal bar to conversion between faiths, and
 conversions occur. However, proselytizing between the
 recognized religions or in areas heavily dominated by one
 religion or another--excluding mystic and animist
 religions--is considered potentially disruptive and
 discouraged. Foreign missionary activities are relatively
 unimpeded. In recent years, however, some foreign
 missionaries have had difficulty renewing visas or residence
 permits. On the basis of laws and decrees issued in the
 mid-1970's, the Government does not allow foreign missionaries
 to spend more than 10 years in Indonesia (15 in exceptional
 circumstances only). With rare exceptions, enforcement of
 this policy does not discriminate by sect or nationality.
 Exceptions to the 10-year rule have also been granted to
 foreign religious workers in the remote areas of Irian Jaya
 and Kalimantan since late 1987. The Government says it
 intends over time to reduce the number of foreign missionaries
 in order to encourage employment of Indonesians. Foreign
 missionary work is subject to the funding stipulations of the
 "Ormas" law discussed above.
 Indonesian Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists maintain active
 links with coreligionists inside and outside Indonesia and
 travel abroad for religious gatherings. The Government
 permits a set number of pilgrns to make the hajj annually.
 Such trips are available only though government-organized
 tours. The Pope visited Indonesia in October, offering mass
 to Catholics in Medan, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Flores, and East
 Timor. During his visit, he praised Indonesia's respect for
 the ethnic, cultural, and religious pluralism among its
 citizens. More than 100,000 Catholics from East and West
 Timor attended the service in Dili at which the Pope
 officiated.
 
 
 857
 INDONESIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and'Repatriation
 Restrictions on freedom of movement exist. Permits to seek
 work in a new location are required in certain areas,
 primarily to-control the further shift of population from'
 rural to urban areas.'
 The Government said noncitizen ethnic Chinese who did not take
 advantage of a 1988 offer of immigration amnesty would be
 tried as illegal immigrants. Estimates of the number of
 persons potentially affected vary considerably, and no such
 trials have yet taken place. In the past, some ethnic Chinese
 encountered legal and bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining
 citizeAship, despite official encouragement of naturalization.
 Officials baried 60 ethnic Chinese citizens from foreign
 travel for a year for visiting China without proper
 authorization.
 By administrative action; the Government periodically
 prohibits foreign travel of domestic critics and others in
 disfavor. Although reliable figures are not available, it'is
 estimated that some 5,000 Indonesians--including some
 prominent &ast civilian and'military officials--currently may
 not leave the country. Some critics, however, are free to
 travel abroad, and-a person banned at one-time may be
 permitted totravel subsequently. Students do not need
 government pdrmitsion to go abrdad for'study. In April the
 Government 'abolishdd the exit visa requirement for active-duty
 and retired members of the armed forces, state officials,
 civil servants, and their families, a step potentially
 affecting an estimated 11 percent of the population.
 Restrictions on movement by Indonesian and foreign citizens to
 and within parts of Irian Jaya continue, officially based on
 the grounds of security risk or the cultural vulnerability of
 indigenous peoples. Beginning in January 1989, restrictions
 on movemenf to, from, and within East Timor eased considerably
 under a policy of "normalizing" East Timor's status.
 Nonetheless, frequent security checks-affect virtually all
 transportation and travel in East Timor outside Dili. Curfews
 and other restrictions'bin movement are often in force at times
 of military operations in a given area. Family visits back to
 East Timor by East Timorese now living in Australia began in
 1988 and.continued in 1989.
 Former political detainees, including those associated with
 the abortive'1965colp, must notify authorities of their
 movements and may.not change their residence without official
 .permission. Members'or alleged supporters of the banned
 Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) outside Indonesia have been
 allowed to return only on a case-by-case basis.
 Under its refugee policy, Indonesia has given first asylum to
 over 106?00 Indochinese-refugees since 1975. The Indochinese
 refugee populatibn at Indonesia's Galang facility'stood at
 about 6,600dt' the" end of October. Of this number, 1,200 are
 classified as'refuqees under the Compiehensive Plan of Action
 on Indochinese refugees (CPA) adopted at the"June
 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees in Geneva;
 the rest are classified as asylum-seekers pending screening by
 Indonesian authorities for refugee status eligibility. Since
 May Indonesia accepted refugee boats pushed off from Malaysia
 with a tbtal of 2,500 Indochinese asylum seekers.

 XNDONESIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Parliament, political parties, and the general public have
 little ability to influence government decisions or to change
 the system or its leadership. President Soeharto and a small
 group of active-duty and retired military officers and
 civilian technocrats exercise governmental authority. The
 military, under a dual-function doctrine of defense/security
 plus social/political responsibilities, is preeminent in most
 areas of government activity, although in some parts of the
 Government its presence has declined in recent years. The
 Constitution provides Parliament a mechanism to call the
 President to account in extraordinary circumstances but
 whether it could be used effectively is in doubt. Government
 leaders do seek out and receive public opinion informally. In
 several cases in 1989, petitions to ministers and the
 Parliament about inequitable land decisions and other
 demonstrable injustices received wide publicity. Reflecting a
 strong cultural preference, Indonesian leaders emphasize the
 importance of decisionmaking through "consultation leading to
 consensus," rather than voting, to resolve disputes.
 In 1989 lively public debate among elites on the need for
 political openness to keep pace with and support economic
 progress focused attention on the paternalistic political
 system and the challenge of managing change. When asked
 publicly whether there is a need for changes in electoral
 procedures, political party leaders responded that the current
 electoral system is appropriate and adequate.
 The Parliament--whose membership must be acceptable to the
 Government--considers bills presented to it by government
 departments and agencies and does not draft laws on its own,
 although it has the constitutional right to do so. The
 Government seeks to resolve potential parliamentary concerns
 before bills are officially presented. Parliament changes the
 text and occasionally the intent of bills it reviews, and in
 1989 significantly altered major bills on the national
 education system and religious courts.
 Only three political organizations are allowed by law. The
 United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic
 Party (PDI) are not considered opposition parties. By law,
 they embrace the Pancasila, and they seldom espouse policies
 much different from the Government's. The third, GOLKAR, is a
 longstanding, government-sponsored organization of functional
 groups which acts as a political party. Former members of the
 Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and some other banned parties
 may not run for office or be active politically.
 The leaders of the three legal political organizations are
 approved, if not chosen, by the Government, and their
 activities are closely scrutinized and often guided by
 government authorities. GOLKAR maintains close institutional
 links with the armed forces and KORPRI, the nonunion
 association to which all civil servants automatically belong.
 Civil servants may join any of the political parties with
 official permission, but most are members of GOLKAR.
 General elections for Parliament and for provincial and
 district assemblies-are held every 5 years. GOLKAR won 73
 percent of the vote in the 1987 elections. All adult
 citizens, except active-duty armed forces personnel, convicted
 criminals serving prison sentences, and some former PKI
 
 
 859
 INDONESIA
 members, are eligible to vote. Voting is not mandatory, but
 strong social pressures ensure participation. Protest votes
 take the form of blank or deliberately spoiled ballots. As in
 1988, voters in several villages in Java rejected government-
 proposed candidates running unopposed for the position of
 village head.
 Under the 1985 election law, the Parliament elected in April
 1987 consists of 500 members, 400 elected by the voters and
 100 appointed by the Government from the armed forces. The
 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) consists of Parliament
 plus 500 other members appointed by the President and by
 regional governmen's. The MPR, Wihich convenes every 5 years,
 ended its most recent session in March 1988 after approving
 guidelines for government policy for the next 5 years and
 reelecting President Soeharto to a new 5-year term, with
 retired Lt. Gen. Sudharmono as Vice President. For the first
 time an alternate candidate vied for the Vice Presidency in
 1988, until he ultimately withdrew from contention.
 Participation in the political process by Indonesia's many
 ethnic groups and minorities varies. Some are well and
 prominently represented; some are underrepresented-and without
 influence;,and others have a significant voice only through
 informal channels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Al has been refused access to Indonesia; Asia Watch
 visited in 1988 and 1989. Access specifically to East Timor
 by representatives ofsuch organizations--which the Government
 considers biased--has traditionally been restricted. However,
 AI and Asia Watch have not yet tested the new East Timor
 "normalizajion4 policy, which ippears to have loosened those
 restrictions. Diplomats and some journalists are encouraged
 to visit the province. The Government ignored calls by
 domestic human rights groups and acfivists for impartial
 investigations of the February Lampung incident and detentions
 of radical preachers in Sumbawa in March. While various
 domestic organizations and persons interested in human rights
 operate energetically, the Government uses its considerable
 powers to discourage sustained, meaningful human rights
 activities, including maintenance of close ties with foreign
 human rights organizations.
 The ICRC is authorized by the Government to visit persons
 jailed in connection with armed resistance in East Timor One
 press report in 1989 suggested that many have not been visited
 despite the Government's pledge. The ICRC provides medical
 and food-aid to prisoners and their families; carries out
 medical'and nutritional Surveys in villages in East Timor;
 arranged family reunification in East Timor and abroad (mainly
 Portugal); qna arranges repatriation to Portugal of former
 Portuguese civil servants and their families in East Timor.
 The ICRC opened an office in Irian Jaya in 1989 to assist
 future border crossers returning from camps in Papua New
 Guinea and to monitor conditions of persons jailed in
 connection with OPM activities. In 1988 and 1989, the ICRC
 
 
 860
 INDONESI1A
 visited and interviewed all remaining prisoners convicted of
 participation in the 1965 Communist-backed attempted coup.The
 Government does not allow access by the ICRC or any other
 international humanitarian group to the numerous Muslim
 activists held prisoner.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Indonesia generally exhibits considerable tolerance for
 ethnic, racial, and major religious differences, although
 official and informal discrimination against ethnic Chinese is
 a significant exception. They are pressured to take
 Indonesian names. Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have
 been denied the right to run businesses in rural Indonesia.
 Government regulations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese
 schools and institutions of higher learning, formation of
 exclusively Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and
 public display of Chinese characters. However, these
 restrictions are not always observed in practice. Many people
 of Chinese ancestry have been successful in business and the
 professions. Social and religious groups which are, in
 effect, all-Chinese are not proscribed and do exist.
 Performances of a Chinese opera from Taiwan in Jakarta and of
 a play about Chinese in Medan were canceled by the Government.
 Women are equal before the law, with the same rights,
 obligations and opportunities afforded men. Indonesia has
 ratified the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of all Forms
 of Discrimination against Women. Some Indonesian women enjoy
 a high degree of economic and social freedom. Women occupy
 important midlevel positions in the civil service, educational
 institutions, labor unions, the military, the professions, and
 private business. Women make up approximately 37 percent of
 the work force, with the majority in the rural sector.
 Despite legal guarantees of equal treatment, women seldom
 receive equal pay for equal work. The Minister for the Role
 of Women, Mrs. A. Sulasikin Murpratomo, has called public
 attention to women's undue burden of illiteracy, poor health,
 and poor nutrition. Traditional practices ("adat") can also
 in some cases undercut state policy. Spouses of civil
 servants are strongly encouraged to participate in a
 government-sponsored women's organization. Several voluntary,
 private groups work actively to advance women's legal,
 economic, and political rights. The media periodically report
 instances of rape and other abuse against women and subsequent
 legal proceedings against the perpetrators. However, reliable
 data concerning the extent of violence against women is not
 available. The Government has recognized publicly that
 domestic violence is an emerging problem for Indonesian
 society. In May it held a seminar to encourage efforts to
 understand and overcome this problem. Several university
 centers studying the role of women focus some attention on
 domestic violence. One Jakarta-based organization provided
 counseling to victims and families in 210 cases of domestic
 violence in 1988 and in 94 cases as of April in 1989. The
 Ministry of Religious Affairs also offers counseling to
 married couples. However, cultural, social, psychological,
 and other factors inhibit reporting of such abuse and recourse
 to counseling and legal protection.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Private-sector workers'are free to form or join unions without
 previois authorization, but such unions, in order to be able
 to bargain collectively, must belong to the All Indonesia
 Workers Union (SPSI), which, for all practical purposes, is
 the only legal trade union organization in Indonesia. About 5
 percent of the total labor force of nearly 75 million is
 organized. The SPSI now consists of 9 departments covering
 broad industrial sectors and 9 specialized institutes. It has
 representation in all 27 provinces. It estimates that it has
 about 10,000 local units at the plant level and over 3 million
 members. A number of groups and professional associations,
 e.g., the teachers' and journalists' associations and the
 Joint Secretariat of Industrial Unions, function as
 quasi-trade unions and operate openly, although they do not
 have the right to engage in collective bargaining. The SPSI
 and its local units draw up their own constitutions and rules
 and elect their representatives.
 The Government views unions as an essential component of its
 development plans, with the role of increasing worker
 participation in development., maintaining industrial peace,
 and elucidating the Government's philosophy of Pancasila as it
 applies to industrial relations. Labor-management relations
 in Indonesia are supposed to be carried out.within the
 framew6rk of' ancasila principles, which emphasize
 consultation among the parties and avoidance of
 confrontation. There is pressure on SPSI officials to join
 GOLKAR, and'GOLKAR" members dominate the leadership.
 The Ormas law discussed in Section 2.b. governs the activities
 of the SPSI tnd the quasi-unions. Government approval is
 -needed for meetings ohtside SPSI headquarters. Permission is
 routinely given to the SPSI and to nonregistered organizations
 overtly functioning as unions. A union may be dissolved, as
 with other mass organizations if the Government believes it is
 acting against Pancasila tenets. There are no laws or     -
 regulations laying out the procedures for the dissolution of a
 union, and there have been no cases of union dissolution.
 Although the SPSI maintains extensive interhational contacts,
 it is not affiliated with any international trade union
 organization, except the ASEAN Trade Union Council--a regional
 body consisting almost exclusively of affiliates of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). As
 a fallout of the 1985 restructuring of the SPSI, there has
 been no formal ICFTU presence in Indonesia since 1986.
 International trade union secretariats retain links with some
 elements of the SPSI, such as the port and maritime workers.
 The "Joint Secretariat," grouping elements of the SPSI and the
 unions not legally recognized by the Government, has links
 with the World Confederation of Labor. The SPSI is seeking to
 affiliate'with the ICFTU.
 All organized workers have a legal right to strike with the
 exception of civil servants and employees in the 21 industries
 designated by a Presidential Decree in 1963 as vital to the
 national interest. Many of the installations and projects
 covered by the decree no longer exist or have been absorbed
 into other agencies and departments. Those that remain cover
 about 170,000 workers. -
 
 
 862
 INDONESIA
 State enterprise employees and civil servants must belong to
 KORPRI, the Indonesian corps of civil servants--a nonunion
 association chaired by the Minister of Home Affairs. The
 central board of KORPRI and its secretariats at the provincial
 level have employee relations bureaus, which are responsible
 for settling employee disputes. Some government departments
 have specific agreements with the Department of Manpower which
 call for the convening of a labor committee to resolve
 disputes.
 A private-sector union must notify the local Department of
 Manpower office that its attempts to resolve disagreements
 through negotiations have failed and that the union will go on
 strike. No approval is required. During 1988 and 1989, there
 were 53 reported strikes involving 11,456 workers. Most
 strikes are brief, spontaneous, and nonviolent. Some observers
 believe that for every officially recorded strike, there may
 be 4 to 5 others.
 The strike outcomes varied. A review of approximately 20
 strikes near Jakarta showed some employee demands were met.
 Some involved conciliation by the local branch of the
 Department of Manpower, some were resolved through
 negotiations with management, and others resulted in the
 firing of union officials for ostensibly work-related reasons.
 Private-sector industrial disputes are submitted to tripartite
 administrative tribunals. These tribunals hear arguments and
 issue executable, enforceable decisions. Decisions of the
 tribunals and private arbitrators can be enforced through the
 courts. The Minister of Manpower can nullify decisions of the
 administrative tribunals on legal or national interest
 grounds. Although technically the Minister's decisions can be
 appealed to the courts, in practice it is rarely done. Under
 the law the parties can elect binding arbitration in lieu of
 the tripartite settlement mechanism. However, this provision
 is seldom used; most cases are handled by the Department of
 Manpower's mediation and conciliation service.
 Indonesia has ratified International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 98 on the Right to Bargain Collectively, but has
 not ratified Convention 87 on the Freedom of Association.
 The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO) believes that Indonesian workers are
 denied the right of association. Specifically, it alleges
 that the SPSI is dominated by the Government and is an agent
 of government labor policy, that the Government unilaterally
 denies the right to strike in certain industries, that the
 Government regularly guarantees a nonunion environment to
 foreign investors, and that public employees may not organize
 or strike. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association
 (CFA) has under consideration a 1987 complaint by the ICFTU
 which alleges that Indonesian legislation restricts trade
 union rights, particularly the rights of government employees,
 contrary to the principles of freedom of association and the
 provisions of ILO Convention 98. The Committee requested at
 its November 1988 session that the Government take steps to
 amend its legislation in some areas and to provide additional
 information on others. The Government said in its February
 response that freedom of association and collective bargaining
 are fully respected and that Indonesia is now in the process
 of developing "the most suitable pattern" of applying these
 rights. In May 1989, the CFA still found that a large section
 of the Indonesian work force does not have freedom to form or
 
 
 863
 INDONESIA
 join a workers' organization of their own choosing and
 requested the Government to amend its legislation to permit
 government employees to-establish unions outside the KORPRI
 structure and to remove other restrictions.
 b. The Right to Organize and-Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaii ng is guaranteed by law; the Department of
 Manpower vigorousrlypromotes collective agreements as
 instruments of Pancasila industrial relations. The
 overwhelming majority of the SPSI's collective bargaining
 agreements are negofidted and concluded bilaterally with the
 employer. Once an employer has been notified that 25
 employees have joined a union, he is under an obligation to
 bargain* As a transitional stage to encou-age collective
 bargaining, regulations require that every-company which has
 25,or mdre employees Must issue company regulations defining
 the terms and conditionsof employment. Of the approximately
 10-,000 local SPSI units, only about-half have executed
 collective bargainingagxeements. In what the Department of
 Manpower has characterized as an-effort to promote voluntary
 negotiations between employees and employers, it has
 encouraged the organization of unions. The Minister of
 Manpower.has set a target of 2,000 collective bargaining
 agreements over the next 5 years. By regulation, negotiations
 are, to-'conclude within 30 days; If not, the matter is to be
 submitted to~the Department of Manpower for mediation and
 conciliation/arbitration. In practice, most negotiations are
 concluded before the end~of the 30-day peniod. Agreements are
 ,valid for 2 years and can be extended for 1 year.
 The law protects-collectdve bargaining agreements and the
 negotiat-n% process'by-imposing obligations on both the union
 and the qmployer. Both-paTtiesare obligated to execute the
 agreements and to bargain in good faith. The law applies
 equally in the export processing zones: Some companies in
 these zones have SPSI-units; however, none has negotiated a
 col-lective bargaining agreement.
 Regulations expressly forbid employers fTom prejudging or
 harassing employees because-of union membership, and employees
 are urged to'report harassment-tO the4Government. The SPSI
 claims, supported by reported-incidents,-that.-;some employers
 discriminate against its members and those wishing to form
 SPSI units.- Charges of antiunion discrimination are handled
 by the administrative tribunals.
 - Workers canyorganize without restriction in a private
 enterprise even if it is designated vital by the Government.
 If the State has a partal interest, the enterprise is
 considered to be in the public service domai-n,-but this does
 not legally limit organizing. There are a signilicant number
 of government/priVate joint enterprises which h-ave labor
 unions and which bargain collectively.
 The AFL-CIO also alleges that Indbnesia denies workers the
 right to organize and bargain collectively. The AFL-CIO has
 charged that the Government routinely denies permission for
 union meetings and subverts collective bargaining by routinely
 substituting compulsory arbitration for genuine collective
 bargaining. The 1987 ICFTU complaint alleged that Indonesian
 regulations permit only the SPSI to register legitimately,
 thereby failing to encourage and promote collective
 bargaining, and that the laws do not satisfy the antiunion
 discrimination requirement of ILO Convention 98.
 
 
 864
 INDONESIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is strictly prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In 1987 the Indonesian Department of Manpower issued new
 regulations on child labor, acknowledged a class of children
 under age 14 who for socioeconomic reasons must work and noted
 that Indonesia's child labor laws have not been properly
 enforced. These laws provide detailed safeguards, including
 requirements for parental consent, prohibition of dangerous
 work and night work and limiting the workday to 4 hours.
 Employers must also cooperate with public authorities to
 assure that children under 14 comply with the 1989 National
 Education Law, which requires that children complete 9 years
 of school beginning at age 7. However, these regulations are
 inadequately enforced, and some observers have called for
 national enforcement procedures.
 The new regulations call for improved enforcement of the child
 labor law. Employers are now required to report in detail on
 every child employed, and periodic inspections are to be
 carried out by the Department of Manpower. Employers not
 complying with the law and regulations will be subject to
 fines of $65 and/or up to 3 months in jail for each infraction.
 The Manpower Department, as a follow-up to its new
 regulations, has issued directives to remind local Department
 of Manpower offices of their inspection obligations.and to
 increase inspection in the informal sectors. However,
 according to the Department, as of March 1989 there were only
 4,749 children registered as employed in Indonesia. Some
 local observers claim that as many as 2 milion youths under
 the age of 14 are working one-half to full time or more,
 though most of these are thought to be employed in family-run
 businesses in the informal sector and at agricultural sites
 where normal enforcement mechanisms are difficult to
 implement. The Department of Manpower admits that employer
 compliance with the new regulations is far less than ideal and
 that it still lacks qualified inspectors to carry out the
 inspections. It estimates that less than 50 percent of
 companies employing children have registered.
 Present efforts to control child labor focus primarily on
 instituting educational programs for children who must work.
 Future programs call for allocation of special funds to
 provide educational opportunities for working children
 cooperating with self-help institutes which will provide
 educational programs, and increased government inspection.
 The Government, however, still relies upon persuasion and
 teaching employers rather than penalizing them.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks,
 with one-half hour of rest for each 4 hours of work. The
 daily overtime rate is one and one-half the normal hourly rate
 for the first hour, and twice the hourly rate for additional
 overtime. Regulations allow employers to deviate from the
 normal work hours upon request to the Minister of Manpower
 with agreement of the employees.
 In the absence of a national minimum wage, minimum wages are
 established for each region, and for sectors and subsectors
 
 
 865
 INDONESIA'
 within the region, by regional wage councils working under the
 supervision of the National Wage Council. This is a
 quadripartite b6dy consisting of representatives from labor,
 management, government, and univeksities. It also establishes
 a basic "physical needs" figure fot each province--a-monetary
 amount considered'sufficient to enable a single worker or
 family to meet basic needs of nutrition, clothing, and
 shelter. The annually calculated figure reflects changes in
 the local Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food, clothing,
 housing, transportation, and other family needs. Factors
 considered by the wage councils ir setting minimum rates
 include changes in the local CPI, the shill level of workers,
 the local supply of manpower, and the ability of firms to
 pay. Minimum wage rates fall short of providing the decent
 standard of living the Government envisages. GDP per capita
 in 1988 was $434. Figures from 1983, the latest available,
 show that 26 per cent of the urban dwellers and 44 per cent of
 the rural population live below the absolute poverty level as
 defined by the World Bank. The minimum wage in the capital
 city of Jakarta ranges between $0.89 and $1.18 per day,
 depending on the industry.
 A 1989 regulation on minimum wages calls for a review of
 minimum wages every 2 years, forbids employers from lowering
 wages already higher than the minimum, and provides mechanisms
 for enforcement and penalties for employer noncompliance. It
 also gives the Department of Manpower a legal basis for
 entering the place of work to carry out inspections.
 Labor law and ministerial regulations provide workers with
 vacation pay, maternity leave, social security insurance,
 workplace accident insurance, 12 paid public holidays,
 generous overtime-and sick leave pay, guaranteed severance and
 service pay, paid leave for personal and family occasions, and
 protection from delay in payment. In addition, workers
 usually receive transportation allowances, food allowances in
 cash or in kind or both, and holiday bonuses. Workers in more
 modern facilities often receive health benefits, social
 security contributions, and free meals.
 Observance of the minimum wage varies from sector to sector
 and from region to region, and there are no reliable figures
 on compliance. Employer violation of overtime and minimum
 wage regulations, however, is considered to be fairly common.
 Manpower officials,--backed by the new minimum wage regulation,
 have threatened to audit companies not paying the minimum wage
 and to take tougher action.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of
 industrial health and safety. Five new health and safety
 regulations have been promulgated in the last 4 years. A
 national Health and Safety Council was created to oversee the
 enforcement efforts of the over 6,000 company safety
 committees. The Department of Manpower conducts yearly
 national campaigns to promote public awareness of health and
 safety needs among workers and employers and administers a
 country-wide comprehensive inspection system.
 Workers are obligated to report hazardous working conditions
 and employers are prevented by law from retaliating against
 those who do. An ILO-sponsored program to enhance the
 technical capabilities of government inspectors and plant
 personnel in the area of chemical and major hazards control
 was signed in 1988, and the Government has sought additional
 technical assistance from other countries to increase
 
 
 866
 INDONESIA
 inspection capabilities. Safety and health programs in the
 country's over 100,000 larger, registered industries in the
 nonoil sector are hampered by a limited number of qualified
 inspectors--less than 1,300; the slowness with which the firms
 established the required plant safety committees (only about
 6,000 as of May 1989); and the need for more and better
 training of government inspectors and plant safety personnel.
