 SPAIN
 
 The Government of Spain, with the support and collabo-
 ration of the major political parties, continues to
 make impressive progress toward consolidating and
 permanently guaranteeing the full range of political,
 social and economic freedoms. Without exception, the
 Government has strengthened and expanded the gains
 reported last year. Spanish practice continues in
 many cases to be more liberal than Spanish law, most
 of which still dates from the Franco era. However,
 the new democratic Spanish Constitution, approved by
 national referendum December 6, 1978, establishes
 Spain as a constitutional monarchy with the Executive
 responsible to the Parliament, and codifies in con-
 siderable detail a broad range of political and socio-
 economic rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. It and other freedoms addressed in this
 section are explicity guaranteed by the new Constitu-
 tion.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Spanish Government prohibits the practice of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Spanish Government continues to enforce law and
 policy against arbitrary arrest and detention.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 
 (488)
 
 
 489
 The Spanish judiciary is independent and increasingly
 respected, and the judges are promoted on a strict
 merit system. Fair public trial is provided for by
 law and observed in practice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the domicile is protected in practice
 by the Spanish Government And is guaranteed by the new
 Constitution. Isolated instances of invasion of the
 home reported in last year's human rights report appear
 to have been eliminated.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Basic Needs for Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Spain is a democracy and the country's least privi-
 leged are an important political constituency courted
 by all of the major parties. While Spain's welfare
 system is not as extensive as that of some other
 European countries, most Spaniards receive sufficient
 food, shelter and health care. The Government is
 attempting to mitigate the plight of the unemployed
 by broadening unemployment benefits and increasing
 public investment to create more jobs, particularly
 in areas where unemployment is most severe. The
 Government is also placing higher priority on job
 creation in its economic planning for the next two to
 three years. Opportunities for education are expand-
 ing because of university reform and a new law on
 public education. The approval of the Constitution is
 expected to accelerate this process. For the first
 time, far-reaching fiscal reform establishes a func-
 tioning, progressive tax system. The Constitution
 specifically guarantees the right to food, shelter,
 health care and education. Reforms in existing laws
 and non-enforcement of others have enhanced women's
 rights. The new Constitution provides inter alia for
 non-discrimination as to sex. There is no evidence
 that significant amounts of national resources go to
 elites because of corruption.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These and the full range of basic political freedoms
 are guaranteed in practice by the Government and are
 given pride of place in the new Constitution. The
 only notable exception of which the Department of
 State is aware is the incarceration in Barcelona of
 four members of a mime troupe (Els Joglars) who were
 sentenced to two years imprisonment by a military
 court for insulting the armed forces in one of their
 pantomines. Such judicial aberrations continue to be
 possible (though are almost always avoided) only
 because of the difficulty of reforming the entire
 legal code and the concomitant necessity to depend
 meanwhile on the non-enforcement of many laws from
 the Franco era. Both the Government and the opposi-
 tion are treating the case as an unfortunate exception.
 Meanwhile, the parents of the four and several Catalan
 politicians, lawyers, doctors and other professional
 people are petitioning the King for a pardon for the
 four.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Fmigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement,
 foreign travel or immigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Free democratic elections were held June 15, 1977 and
 new national elections are scheduled for March 1, 1979,
 to be followed by municipal elections. The new Con-
 stitution guarantees in great detail the right of
 Spaniards from the age of eighteen to participate in
 the political process. It also refers explicitly to
 the fundamental importance of political pluralism and
 to the role of political parties in guaranteeing that
 pluralism.

 Such labor rights as the right to strike are specifi-
 cally recognized in the new Constitution, as they
 already are in practice. Racial discrimination is
 notable by its absence in Spain and is explicitly
 prohibited by the new Constitution.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Spain has shown no antipathy to
 independent outside investigations of Spain's human
 rights situation. We know of no up-to-date indepen-
 dent report on Spain.
