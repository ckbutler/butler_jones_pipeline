 GUATEMALA
 In 1985 Guatemala made an orderly and open transition from a
 military regime to civilian rule through elections for the
 presidency, congress, and municipal governments. The general
 elections provided a broad array of political options,
 including the formerly persecuted Social Democrats, who
 returned from voluntary exile to participate in the 1985
 elections. Sixty-nine percent of the eligible voters cast
 ballots in the November 3 elections, choosing 2 presidential
 run-off candidates, congressional deputies, and mayors.
 Sixty-one percent cast ballots in the December 8 presidential
 run-off election. International observers characterized the
 elections as efficiently run and free of fraud. The military
 maintained strict neutrality throughout the campaigning and
 voting; military, police, and military commissioners were
 prohibited from voting. Though insurgent groups carried out
 an active propaganda campaign against the elections, there
 were no reported insurgent attempts to disrupt the voting.
 Vinicio Cerezo, the Christian Democratic presidential
 candidate, was elected to a 5-year term in the December 8
 Presidential run-off elections.
 Guatemala is primarily an agricultural country, with a dual
 culture in which the indigenous population continues to
 preserve its cultural traditions. The economy experienced a
 deep recession in 1985, exacerbating tensions and curbing the
 Government's ability to respond to recognized social needs.
 The Special Rapporteur for Guatemala of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commissioner (UNHCR) noted improvement in overall
 human rights conditions during 2 visits to Guatemala in 1985,
 citing the movement towards democratization and elections.
 Politically-related deaths continued to decline and
 kidnappings and disappearances also decreased. While
 politically motivated abductions continue, they are now at the
 lowest level in this decade. Amnesty for insurgents remained
 available. Government and military sensitivity to human
 rights questions grew modestly. Some 245 policemen were
 dismissed for crimes or corruption, and 4 members of a civil
 defense patrol were sentenced to prison for murdering a
 villager. Although sporadic abuses still occurred at the
 local command level, the military displayed an increasing
 awareness of the importance of human rights. The succesful
 elections, and the road building and model village programs
 have taken much of the initiative away from the guerrilla
 organizations. Insurgents still engaged in military actions
 during 1985, but the number of such incidents decreased, and
 the number of reported combat deaths was approximately 60
 percent of 1984 levels.
 A local human rights group, the Mutual Support Group (GAM),
 continued to function openly. However, one of its members was
 found tortured and murdered, and another member, along with
 her son and brother, died under suspicious circumstances. The
 Government accepted visits by foreign human rights groups and,
 in fact, extended invitations to several of them. Press
 freedom was evident; labor union activities continued
 relatively unimpeded. The rights to private property and to
 pursue private interests remained untrammeled. Among the
 negative aspects of the year's developments were the
 continuation, although at a significantly reduced rate, of
 killings, disappearances and other abuses by both guerrilla
 
 
 543
 GUATEMALA
 and security forces. The officer corps is still immune from
 prosecution, and the justice system is unable to respond to
 human rights violations by government officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were an estimated 304 civilian non-combatant deaths in
 Guatemala in 1985, a significant decline from the 491 killings
 the previous year. Some of the dead were believed to be
 victims of the Guatemalan security forces or civil defense
 patrols, while others were killed by insurgents. In all,
 approximately 597 persons are believed to have been killed
 either for political reasons or in combat in 1985 compared to
 an estimated 992 in 1984.
 While there were fewer reports of politically motivated
 violence in the countryside, there were still allegations of
 abuses against the Indian population. Most of the alleged
 incidents reported in 1985 involved persons in the western
 highlands, where clashes between insurgents and the army are
 still frequent and often fierce. However, there were no
 credible reports of massacres during the year. A report that
 125 Indians had been massacred in April at Santa Anita las
 Canoas, department of Chimaltenango was proved false by an
 onsite inquiry made by U. S. Embassy officials.
 At least 50 policemen and 7 military commissioners were killed
 in 1985. Insurgents tortured and executed an army corporal
 and an army specialist in the department of Suchitepequez.
 They also assassinated the chief of the military police
 intelligence service in August. Insurgents continued their
 campaign against members of the civil defense .forces, killing
 33 in 1985.
 Victims of violence by the 4 Marxist-led guerrilla
 organizations in their program of physical intimidation in
 1985 included municipal workers, farm owners and managers, and
 other civilians. Guerrillas in the departments of San Marcos,
 Retaleheu, Quetzaltenango, Escuintla, Chimaltenango, and Santa
 Rosa executed 11 farm owners. Four small businessmen were
 blown up in 2 hand grenade attacks by guerrillas in the
 department of El Peten, and 2 farm managers were killed near
 Lake Atitlan. During a May attack on the Santa Ana Berlin
 military detachment in Coatepeque guerrillas killed 3
 civilians, including a woman and a child. In July, near Chico
 Zapote, guerrillas shot to death 4 civilians, including 2
 minors, whom they apparently mistook for army guides. In
 their most spectacular act of violence, guerrillas blew up an
 airplane carrying the Norwegian honorary consul, his
 son-in-law, and 2 others, on October 23, as it landed at a
 small airstrip; all were killed.
 The response of Guatemalan security forces to insurgent
 violence has on occasion been excessively violent. For
 instance, following the killings of 2 military commissioners
 and several civil defense patrol members in Patzun the local
 military commander carried out a series of abductions and
 assassinations. By the time reprisal and counter-reprisal had
 
 
 544
 GUATEMALA
 finished, 22 people were reported dead by the local press.
 Town records, however, show 10 people dead and 42 kidnapped;
 of these 42, at least 10 have reappeared.
 Killings have also been attributed to some of the 900,000
 members of the civil defense patrols, sometimes in clashes
 between neighboring patrols or between civil defense members
 and civilians over land disputes, and sometimes in personal
 vendettas. There continued to be allegations that civil
 defense patrol members summarily executed some guerrillas or
 suspected guerrillas.
 The Government has not generally punished members of the
 security forces for such extra-judicial killings, although
 some offenders have been dismissed or jailed. In August a
 police spokesman said that 245 policemen were dismissed during
 the previous month for "illegal activities", and, in October,
 4 members of a civil defense patrol were given 20-year prison
 terms for murdering a villager. The Guatemalan army continued
 its unwillingness to punish offenders. After a series of
 killings and disappearances in Patzun were linked to the local
 military commander, the army transferred the officer to
 another post, but it brought no charges against him.
 It is difficult to assign responsibility or motive to many of
 the killings in Guatemala. The guerrillas on occasion use the
 same weapons, tactics, and uniforms as the army in an effort
 to place blame on the government forces. Security forces have
 been charged with using the same tactic. Bodies normally
 appear without any group taking responsibility for the
 killings, and even without any evidence that the killings were
 politically motivated. Such cases, in which there is much
 speculation and few facts, comprise the bulk of the killings
 in Guatemala.
 Examples of the kind of violence endemic in Guatemala include
 the March murders of two professors from the National
 University of San Carlos; the March murder of Manuel Francisco
 Sosa Avila, a retired general and former Director of the
 National Police and Minister of Government; the June murder of
 a university board member and professor; and the August
 killing of Roberto Castaneda Felice, a prominent businessman
 and private sector leader. Although any of these deaths might
 have been politically motivated, there is no evidence which
 definitively links the deaths to the victim's political or
 professional activities, and no group has taken responsibility
 for any of these killings.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of kidnapings and disappearances fell in 1985 to
 the lowest level in the 1980's. An estimated 198 people were
 abducted in 1985, compared with 425 in 1984 and 307 in 1983.
 As in the past, the government s9curity forces were accused of
 abducting people in order to question them about subversive
 activities. For instance, the local leaders of the Christian
 Democratic party in Chichicastenango charged security forces
 with kidnapping a party member in May, and in July an
 agricultural workers' union in the same town accused the civil
 defense force of abducting a union member. Security forces
 have also been linked to the May disappearance of three Rafael
 Landivar University extension workers. The security forces
 
 
 545
 GUATEMALA
 generally deny knowledge of the whereabouts of disappeared
 persons in response to inquiries.
 The insurgent groups used kidnaping to commandeer labor and to
 punish government collaborators. In March guerrillas in the
 department of Chimaltenango kidnapped a civil defense patrol
 member, a catechist, and a farm owner. Insurgents operating
 in the department of El Quiche kidnaped a supervisor of the
 National Institute for Electrification at the Chixoy
 Hydroelectric Project site. Guerrillas also kidnaped whole
 villages in order to use the villagers as "masas," or
 providers of food and labor. Occasionally, the army announces
 the freeing of such groups. In June the army declared that it
 had rescued 105 residents of the village of El Tumbo,
 department of El Peten, who, according to the army, were being
 abducted to Mexico by insurgents.
 Students and faculty at the National University of San Carlos
 continued to be kidnaped in 1985, and some of these cases were
 attributed to government security forces acting against
 suspected insurgents or their supporters. In March 2 members
 of student associations at the university were reported
 kidnaped, and in July a student social promoter was abducted
 in Quetzaltenango. Violence affecting university students and
 faculty is neither unusual nor easily attributable to specific
 perpetrators or motives. San Carlos has an enrollment of over
 50,000 students, many of whom attend on a casual basis for
 many years. Thus, a victim's association with the university
 may be only coincidental. The university also is a center of
 narcotics trafficking and drug-related crime is common.
 The Mutual Support Group (GAM), formed in 1984 and comprised
 largely of families of missing students, named 3 relatives as
 victims of disappearances in the first 6 months of 1985. This
 compares to 40 reported disappearances in 1984.
 As with killings, it is difficult to assign responsibility or
 motive for most disappearances and kidnapings. Besides
 political reasons, kidnapings have also been carried out for
 criminal purposes (ransom gangs and narcotics traffickers) and
 for personal vengeance. Among the factors limiting the
 ability to link a disappearance to a definite faction or group
 are the inaccuracy of media reporting, the unwillingness of
 relatives and friends in some cases to reveal the occurrence
 (especially if a large ransom was paid), and the difficulty of
 separating political from other motives.
 Some disappearances were found to have other explanations.
 For instance, in August the National Police announced that
 among the missing person cases they had solved, one "victim"
 had been working as a maid in Guatemala City, another had
 joined the army, and a third had run away with her boyfriend.
 In July a librarian at the University of San Carlos in
 Quetzaltenango was reported missing. Later, she was
 discovered at the home of some relatives in the capital city.
 Also, persons involved with the insurgency are known to leave
 the country for travel to Soviet bloc countries, including
 Cuba, or to Mexico, by pretending to disappear; friends and
 relatives report them as kidnaped or disappeared. In March
 the army reported that a guerrilla captured at Sayaxche, in El
 Peten, admitted that he and several workers from a mill in
 Escuintla, whose photos had appeared in the Guatemalan press
 as "disappeared," had really gone to Cuba to receive military
 training.
 
 
 546
 GUATEMALA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the civil and criminal codes expressly prohibit
 physical and mental torture, the practice continues. The
 press regularly reports the discovery of bodies of persons who
 had been tortured. In only a few cases has the identity of
 the perpetrators been established, but it appears that torture
 is employed by many groups. Government security forces,
 vigilante groups, guerrilla organizations, and criminals have
 all been held responsible for such acts.
 There is strong evidence that harsh treatment and torture are
 inflicted on some detained persons by government security
 forces. For instance, in October the police claimed that a
 young man, Cesar Ramos, attempted suicide in the bathroom of a
 Guatemala City police station by shooting himself in the head
 with a pistol he stole from a police officer. Family members,
 however, charged police with beating and then shooting the
 young man. In September a Guatemalan mother claimed that she
 was abducted and forced to watch alleged Government security
 agents beat her son, who had been abducted a day earlier by
 men identifying themselves as policemen.
 The guerrillas also have not hesitated to use torture to
 intimidate and to punish government collaborators. In August,
 4 Indian members of a civil defense patrol who had been
 abducted by insurgents were found bound, tortured, shot, and
 with their throats slashed. The bodies were left on the
 Coatepeque-Port Ocos Road, department of Quetzaltenango.
 Guerrillas in Suchitepequez tortured and killed an army
 corporal, and in May a farmer in Chimaltenango was abducted,
 beaten, and shot by insurgents. In October, the Guatemalan
 army rescued 62 peasants who had been held by insurgents near
 the municipality of San Juan Cotzal. The rescued peasants,
 all of whom were in poor health and suffering from
 malnutrition, were used as camp workers by the guerrillas.
 Included among them were 37 children.
 Several human rights groups have accused the Government of
 operating secret prisons where torture is used during
 interrogation. The Government denies these allegations, and
 their accuracy has never been confirmed. The United Nations
 Human Rights Commission's Special Rapporteur for Guatemala,
 Viscount Colville of Culross, announced in August that he had
 found no evidence of secret jails. An Amnesty International
 group inspected police facilities in Guatemala City without
 finding clandestine detention centers. In September,
 following rumors that secret jail cells had been found in the
 basement of the Ministry of Finance, reporters and television
 news crews were given free access to the building. They found
 no cells.
 Allegations that the "model villages" constructed under the
 "Development Poles" rural resettlement program are
 concentration camps are not credible and do not accurately
 reflect the views of inhabitants or most outside observers.
 Two of the 50 communities under development in the model
 village program, Sarraxoch and Acamal, serve as "half-way"
 houses for guerrillas who have taken advantage of the
 Government's amnesty program. Access to these 2 villages by
 nonresidents is controlled.
 
 
 547
 GUATEMALA
 As in 1984, the principal government prison, Granja Penal
 Pavon, was the site of a riot in which several prisoners were
 killed and others wounded. Government officials acknowledge
 that the prison population is in excess of the facility's
 capacity, and that the budget is inadequate for the number of
 prisoners. Prison officials blame overcrowding and gang
 warfare for much of the violence. There is no policy of
 physical punishment at Pavon or at the other prisons, and the
 facilities do not have a reputation for inmate mistreatment.
 However, in 1985 a7-Guatemalan court indicted prison guards for
 their role in a 1984 riot at Pavon, and several top prison
 officials were dismissed after the death of several inmates
 during rioting in 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government does not use involuntary exile as a form of
 punishment, nor are critics of the Government arrested and
 convicted on unrelated charges. During 1985 the Government
 facilitated the voluntary departure from Guatemala of several
 people who sought protection in the Colombian, Venezuelan, and
 other diplomatic missions. As a matter of policy, the
 Government regarded these people as "guests" of the diplomatic
 missions in which they requested asylum and refused to refer
 to them as "asylees."
 The Government claims that service in the civil defense
 patrols is voluntary. However, in many rural areas it is
 required of able-bodied males. In areas where service is
 required, exemptions may be obtained for medical reasons or by
 paying another man to perform the service. In a recent
 pastoral letter, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Guatemala City
 criticized the civil defense patrols as "obligatory service"
 and said patrol members' time would be better spent providing
 for their families. In conversations with Embassy officials,
 heads of the civil defense patrols in conflict zones expressed
 little doubt about the important role the patrols played in
 protecting their villages from guerrilla attack.
 Under the legal code, persons may not be held for more than 48
 hours without being brought before a judge and charged with a
 crime. Despite this and other legal provisions, the illegal
 detention of individuals suspected of being insurgents or
 insurgent sympathizers continues to be a serious problem. The
 Government officially denies that any persons are held in
 custody for political reasons.
 In September, in response to 700 writs of habeas corpus filed
 by the Mutual Support Group, the Supreme Court advised that it
 had been unable to find any of those missing. In May the
 Mexico-based Guatemala Human Rights Commission, which is a
 front for the guerrilla movement known as the Organization of
 People in Arms (ORPA), requested 103 writs of habeas corpus.
 These writs also did not lead to the discovery of any
 detainees.
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced in
 Guatemala.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although there is little overt military interference in the
 operation of Guatemala's courts, judicial officers tend to
 
 
 548
 GUATEMALA
 respond to indications of special interest in particular cases
 by high government or military officials. The practical
 effect of such "influence" is that the judicial system is
 unable to respond to human rights violations committed by the
 authorities.
 Persons arrested in Guatemala are guaranteed the right to
 legal counsel at all hearings, and lawyers are provided by the
 state if the defendants cannot afford them. However, the
 lawyers provided are usually law students. Also, the majority
 of the nation's lawyers live near Guatemala City, and it is
 difficult to retain legal counsel in the countryside.
 Defendants may be released after posting bail at the
 discretion of the magistrate. However, the judicial machinery
 is cumbersome and slow and it is not unusual for defendants to
 spend several months in prison before the courts render a
 decision on their guilt or innocence.
 In 1985, the Constituent Assembly enacted new laws of habeas
 corpus and amparo which went into effect January 14, 1986,
 upon the inauguration of the civilian Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The new Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the home
 and of personal correspondence and private papers. During
 1985 the Government continued to set up roadblocks in the
 interior to check documents of travelers and to search
 vehicles for security reasons. The Treasury Police also used
 roadblocks to search for contraband and to interdict smuggling
 across Guatemala's 4 borders. Security forces have entered
 homes without warrants in search of guerrilla safehouses and
 arms caches. Government security agents have allegedly
 entered homes of kidnap victims without judicial authorization
 in search of weapons or other items.
 Charges that private correspondence is tampered with continue
 to be made. Postal authorities acknowledge that this
 sometimes happens and blame dishonest employees. Letters
 bearing checks to relatives of Guatemalans living in the
 United States are a particular target of mail theft. In
 September the Government initiated a new mail-handling system
 to counter such thievery. There have also been allegations of
 mail tampering and telephone tapping by security forces.
 Although the security forces have an intelligence network,
 there is no organized system of government informers or
 neighborhood watch committees in urban areas. However, civil
 defense patrols have served as a means of reasserting
 government control over the countryside. The involvement of
 large segments of the rural population obviously contributes
 to the Government's ability to monitor the movement of its
 citizens, an important function of the civil defense patrol in
 countering the insurgency. Guerrilla organizations have
 accused military commissioners--rural civilian representatives
 of the military--as well as other rural government employees
 of being "informers." Insurgents have assassinated a number
 of such persons.
 
 
 549
 GUATEMALA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government affirms these rights, and no major abuses were
 reported in 1985. There were no indications of any attempt to
 prevent the media from freely airing diverse viewpoints and
 actively covering the spectrum of political opinion during the
 election. In fact, there were concerns that the close
 relationship between parts of the media and some candidates in
 the Presidential election might threaten the "independent"
 stance of the media.
 This situation of press freedom contrasts sharply with that of
 recent years when newspaper reporters and broadcast
 journalists were frequent targets of political violence.
 Lingering fears still serve to limit the exercise of press
 freedoms somewhat. While opposition views and even criticism
 of the Government are aired freely, journalistic
 self-restraint results in only perfunctory coverage of topics
 dealing with the military, national security, official
 corruption, police investigations, and some judicial
 proceedings. Journalists are not prevented from entering or
 covering newsworthy events in conflict zones, but they rarely
 do so. Guerrilla organizations and civil rights groups,
 including the GAM, have access to the media through
 communiques and manifestos, the Government no longer
 preventing their publication. In fact, in September the
 Communist Guatemalan Workers' Party (PGT) published a message
 in the press on its anniversary.
 Radio is Guatemala's most pervasive medium, with over 100
 privately-owned stations operating throughout the country.
 The Government owns and operates 6 radio stations and one
 television station, which broadcast a variety of news,
 educational, and entertainment programs. Four major
 independent daily newspapers are published in the capital.
 The Government publishes one daily with official
 announcements, decrees, and selected news items.
 There is no censorship of either local or foreign books in
 Guatemala, but a few local writers and artists continue to
 live and work outside Guatemala. In March immigration
 officials confiscated several publications that a foreign
 priest brought into Guatemala. Authorities claimed the
 publications were Marxist literature but later returned them
 to the cleric.
 The main campus of the University of San Carlos has been a
 center of violence, political and other kinds, in recent
 years. Students and faculty continued as victims of
 disappearances and killings in 1985. Though'some of these
 acts were attributed to Guatemalan security forces, there
 rarely was evidence which strongly linked the disappearances
 and killings to the victim's association with the university.
 In September the army occupied the campus of the university
 for two days following a week of widespread rioting over bus
 fare and other price hikes. The Government charged that
 student groups headquartered on campus were using the
 economic-inspired unrest as an opportunity to provoke further
 civil disorder.
 
 
 550
 GUATEMALA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Basic Statute of Government affirmed the rights of
 petition, assembly, and political association. These rights
 have been reaffirmed through the process of democratization
 that began with the elections for the Constituent Assembly in
 July 1984, the political activities which followed that
 election, and the election of a civilian Government in
 November 1985.
 Twelve political parties met the requirements for running
 candidates in the November presidential, congressional, and
 municipal elections. Politically, these parties span the
 spectrum from social democrats on the left to extreme
 conservatives on the right. Beginning with the 1984
 Constituent Assembly elections, and continuing through the
 general elections of November 1985, freedom of political
 assembly has been respected by the Government. Although some
 political activities have been struck by violence, there is no
 indication that any such incident was linked to the Government.
 Workers have the right to organize, strike and bargain
 collectively in conformity with the labor code, which requires
 a process of negotiations and conciliation before a legal
 walkout can take place. These procedures often make it
 difficult to call a legal strike. However, the new
 Constitution which went into effect on January 14, 1986,
 specifically expands workers' rights, including the right to
 organize for government workers. The new Constitution
 requires a revision of the labor code and it is expected that
 many of the factors inhibiting strikes and other labor actions
 will be removed.
 There are approximately 300 active labor unions in the country
 and their organization is basically divided into two types:
 legally recognized and active centrals, and underground
 centrals. The largest and most significant legally recognized
 central is the AFL-CIO-affiliated Confederation of Sindical
 Unity (CUSG), a democratic confederation that follows the
 principles of the free trade union movement and emphasizes
 economic unionism. In mid-1985, it consisted of 11
 federations with approximately 150,000 members. The balance
 of 200,000 organized workers belong either to independent
 federations or to independent locals. The CUSG is an
 affiliate of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU).
 Two union organizations have links to Marxist groups. They
 are the Autonomous Syndical Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA),
 the trade union arm of the orthodox Guatemalan Communist
 Party, with some 6,500 members, and the National Workers
 Central (CNT), a Marxist-dominated ad hoc group of union
 locals without legal recognition, representing about 4,000
 members. Although local affiliates of these organizations are
 often active in labor disputes, the 2 parent groups are not
 active in Guatemala. However, they issue press bulletins and
 manifestos from outside the country.
 During 1985 there were several pending complaints against the
 Government before the Committee on Freedom of Association of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) about abductions of
 trade union leaders and legal advisors. These complaints had
 been filed by the International Confederation of Free Trade
 
 
 551
 GUATEMALA
 Unions (ICFTU) and by the Latin American Permanent Worker's
 Congress (CPUTAL). Also, the ILO cited Guatemala for
 noncompliance with Conventions 87 and 98, which affirm public
 workers' right to strike and the right of unions to engage in
 partisan political activities.
 Aside from trade unions, there are numerous professional and
 trade associations in Guatemala. These groups operate
 autonomously, without government interference, and often
 exercise considerable political influence.
 In 1985 labor leaders continued to be targets of violence. In
 March, Alfredo Castillo Jimenez, an agricultural labor leader,
 was killed in front of union headquarters in Jutiapa. The son
 of the CUSG's secretary general was kidnapped by unidentified
 persons and then released, as was Julio Celso de Leon, head of
 the Institute of Studies and Social Development (IGEFOS), part
 of the American Workers' Central (CLAT). Though violence
 against labor leaders has dropped considerably, the head of
 one union claimed that the "climate of violence" continued to
 inhibit union activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to freedom of conscience and to free exercise of
 religion is recognized and these rights are respected in
 practice. Legal recognition is granted to all denominations.
 More than 70 percent of the population practices Roman
 Catholicism. Many Indians, however, combine Roman Catholic
 tenets with elements of the traditional Mayan religion.
 Evangelical churches have grown rapidly, especially among
 Indians, and their followers number about one-quarter of the
 population. In addition, there is a small Jewish community.
 Foreign Catholic clergy and religious workers actively
 proselytize in Guatemala. Foreign Protestant evangelical
 clergy have been joined in their efforts by local
 representatives of Guatemala's growing evangelical movement.
 One result of this religious mixture has been some tension
 between Catholics and Protestants. Although authorities deny
 any deliberate policy of discrimination, evangelicals
 nevertheless have cited cases of intimidation by the National
 Police and other government officials.
 Catholics and evangelicals are freely permitted to preach and
 develop congregations. However, some have reported
 misunderstandings with local authorities over civil dafense
 patrol duties. In January, 5 evangelical ministers were
 abducted in the department of El Peten. Press reports
 attributed the kidnapings to military commissioners.  The 5
 have not reappeared. In March a Guatemalan Mennonite social
 promoter was killed in Santiago, Sacatepequez. In a case
 which drew international press coverage, the army captured an
 American Seventh Day Adventist, Thomas Greenley, transporting
 a boatload of medicines up the Rio Usumacinta on the
 Guatemala-Mexico border. Greenley, who carried no identifying
 documents, claimed he was on a medical mission for a Seventh
 Day Adventist clinic based in Mexico. The military, however,
 accused him of delivering medicines to the guerrillas.
 Despite this suspicion, the Government turned Greenley over to
 United States consular officials and expedited his departure
 from Guatemala.
 
 
 552
 GUATEMALA
 In 1985 the Guatemalan Catholic Church took outspoken stands
 on human rights issues. The Archbishop issued a pastoral
 letter in October which condemned violence and disrespect for
 human rights. The Guatemalan Bishops criticized the
 "democratic opening" as incomplete, since some elements of
 Guatemalan society supposedly feared to take part in the
 elections. The letter also expressed concern that the civil
 defense patrol leaders might try to force their patrol members
 to vote for a specified candidate (a fear which subsequently
 proved to be unfounded.) The Archbishop appeared in several
 newspaper advertisements calling on people to vote, and
 participated as a panel member in one presidential debate. In
 August the Archbishop called for respect for human life and
 law and for dialogue between the "factions" of Guatemalan
 society. He cautioned against blaming ary one sector of
 society for the violence which has beset Guatemala, claiming
 many groups were responsible.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not limit the freedom of movement of its
 citizens within the national territory. There are no
 restrictions on foreign travel or on the right to reenter the
 country. All citizens are free to migrate to other countries.
 The UNHCR estimated that approximately 46,000 Guatemalan
 refugees, mostly Indians from areas afflicted by insurgent
 activities, continued to live as refugees in Mexico, primarily
 in the border areas of the state of Chiapas. The Guatemalan
 Government has accepted this figure as accurate. Since 1982,
 the Government has followed a policy of encouraging "voluntary
 and orderly" repatriation of all displaced persons and
 assisting their reintegration into the country. In a recent
 speech to the United Nations, then-Foreign Minister Fernando
 Andrade said "the infrastructure" is in place to provide
 returning persons with security, housing, food, and the
 opportunity to become productive members of society. The
 Government tries to return displaced persons to their former
 villages. However, in cases where this is impossible, due
 either to the destruction of the village or the refugees'
 fears of reprisals, the Government places them in one of the
 model villages in the rural resettlement program. These
 villages are home to some 50,000 people, approximately 1.4
 percent of the highland population.
 Following a general decline in guerrilla activity, and the
 decision by Mexico to relocate the displaced persons to near
 the Bay of Campeche, away from the border, displaced persons
 began to return to Guatemala.. The number who returned in 1985
 is difficult to estimate, since most came in small groups and
 entered Guatemala the way they left, avoiding government
 immigration stations along the border. Some international
 refugee assistance organizations estimate that 3,000 refugees
 returned to Guatemala in 1985.
 Some foreign clergy familiar with the western highlands of
 Guatemala contend that it is not safe for many displaced
 persons to return. They assert that the refugees will be
 improperly identified as guerrillas and killed. The
 Government denies this, pointing out that many towns near the
 Mexican border, such as Nenton in the department of.
 Huehuetenango, are largely populated with people who returned
 
 
 553
 GUATEMALA
 safely from refugee camps in Mexico. Civil defense patrol
 leaders in towns along the border told United States Embassy
 officials in October that those displaced persons who were not
 part of the insurgency have nothing to fear in Guatemala.
 However, they did say that such persons who were regarded as
 having been active insurgents and having killed people would
 not be welcomed and could expect to be treated in the same
 manner as they had treated their fellow villagers before
 fleeing. There is no evidence that returning displaced
 persons have been singled out for persecution by government
 security forces.
 Some groups have charged that the model village program
 violates the right of freedom of movement by herding people
 into "concentration camps." This characterization is rejected
 by inhabitants of the model villages and most observers who
 have visited them. With the exception of two villages
 discussed in Section l.c., which act as "half-way" houses for
 once-active insurgents, there is no official policy of
 limiting movement into or out of the villages. However,
 especially in model villages located in conflict zones, the
 usual practice is for a villager to request a "pass" from the
 local civil defense patrol leader when the villager wants to
 travel outside of the village. The villager must present this
 pass to the civil patrol in each village he visits. Civil
 defense patrol leaders claim that this pass ensures the "safe
 conduct" of their villagers. They note that such a method of
 control is necessary to prevent guerrillas from infiltrating
 their towns. In some model villages, inhabitants have been
 restricted to the village area during the construction
 period. Later they have been free to leave if they wish.
 Many go to the coast for seasonal agricultural jobs. Some
 families have returned to their traditional mountain homes.
 In addition to those who sought haven in Mexico, a major
 by-product of the insurgency was the internal displacement of
 as many as 400,000 persons since 1981. Both government and
 private agencies working with displaced persons agree that the
 number is now substantially below that figure. As one measure
 of the decline in the number of displaced persons, the
 Guatemalan army noted that 244 displaced persons applied for
 assistance at model villages in the departments of El Quiche
 and Alta Verapaz during the first six month of 1985. This
 compares with 731 in 1984 and 975 in 1983. Various government
 programs have resulted in assistance to almost all the
 displaced and the permanent resettlement of the majority.
 Insurgent groups continued to set up roadblocks, extracting
 war taxes and haranguing the people they stopped. They
 carried out several ambushes on roads south of Lake Atitlan,
 robbing and killing several civilians. In October they also
 briefly occupied Tikal, a prime tourist attraction.
 Following a pattern that began under the Rios Montt Government
 in 1982, Guatemalans living in voluntary exile continued to
 return to the country in 1985. For instance, members of the
 formerly persecuted Social Democratic Party returned to
 Guatemala and participated in the November 1985 elections.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Guatemala was ruled throughout 1985 by a de facto
 military-controlled Government which took power following a
 
 
 554
 GUATEMALA
 coup on August 8, 1983. The Chief of State, General Oscar
 Humberto Mejia Victores, governed with the advice of a council
 of military commanders and a cabinet of ministers composed of
 both military officers and civilians.
 Constituent Assembly elections took place as planned on July
 1, 1984 when 1,157 candidates ran for the 88-seat Assembly.
 Of an estimated 3,500,000 eligible voters, 2,554,000
 registered to vote, and of these 72 percent cast ballots. In
 1985 the Assembly drafted a new Constitution, completing its
 work on May 31. The Constitution went into effect on January
 14, 1986, when the civilian Government was inaugurated. It
 guarantees individual rights and provides for a human rights
 commission which is to be composed of a deputy from each
 political party represented in Congress. Congress will select
 a human rights procurador, or ombudsman, from candidates
 proposed by the commission. The procurador will have judicial
 powers and the prerogatives of a member of congress and will
 be empowered to enforce constitutionally guaranteed human
 rights. The Assembly also drafted a new electoral law and new
 habeas corpus and amparo laws.
 National elections were held on November 3, 1985 and December
 8, 1985, in spite of a deteriorating economic situation,
 serious rioting in September, and an election-inspired upturn
 in guerrilla violence which seriously tested the army's
 ability to guarantee the safety of voters and polling places
 in the departments of El Quiche, San Marcos, and
 Huehuetenango. Some 2,750,000 citizens registered to vote in
 the general elections, an increase of 250,000 over the
 Constituent Assembly elections, .and 69.2 percent cast ballots
 in the general elections. Voters chose two presidential
 run-off candidates, Vinicio Cerezo and Jorge Carpio, from a
 field of eight candidates. Voters also chose 100 members of
 Congress and 330 Mayors. The Christian Democratic Party (DCG)
 won 38.6 percent of the presidential vote and 51 seats in the
 Congress. Its nearest competitor was the Union of the
 National Center Party, which won 20.3 percent of the
 presidential vote. The National Liberation Movement
 (MLN)/Institutional Democratic Party (PID) alliance won 12.5
 percent of the vote, and the United Anticommunist Party
 (PUA)/National Unity Front (FUN)/ Emerging Movement for
 Harmony (MEC) coalition trailed with 1.9 percent. The Social
 Democratic Party won 3.4 percent of the vote and elected 2
 members to Congress. In the presidential run-off election,
 Christian Democratic candidate Vinicio Cerezo won 68.37
 percent of the vote. His opponent, Union of the National
 Center candidate Jorge Carpio, garnered 31.63 percent of the
 vote.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Government maintained an open door to visits by human
 rights groups during 1985. Such visitors included the UNHCR
 Special Rapporteur for Guatemala; Americas Watch; The American
 Friends Service Committee; Amnesty International; the Faculty
 for Human Rights in El Salvador and Central America; the
 Fellowship of Reconciliation; the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission; the International Human Rights Law Group; the
 Peace Brigades International; the Nicaragua-Honduras Education
 Project; the Unitarian-Universalist Service Committee; the
 Washington Office on Latin America; and French and German
 parliamentarians.
 
 
 555
 GUATEMALA
 The UNHCR Special Rapporteur, Viscount Colville de Culross,
 visited Guatemala in February and August of 1985. He met with
 the Chief of State, the Foreign Minister, the Minister of the
 Interior, the President of the Supreme Court, the Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal, and the Auxiliary Archbishop. He also
 traveled to the interior. Mutual Support Group
 representatives chose not to meet with him. In public
 statements, Viscount Colville declared that the process of
 democratization was on track and that he looked forward to the
 elections with "great enthusiasm." He expressed concern about
 the unsolved disappearances and killings but also stated that
 the human rights situation continued to improve, and he
 suggested that such progress should be encouraged. He found
 no evidence of secret jails or clandestine interrogation
 centers.
 Human rights groups continued to criticize human rights abuses
 in Guatemala in 1985. Amnesty International, in its 1985
 Report on Guatemala (which covered events in 1984), charged
 that paramilitary groups "acting under government orders or
 with official complicity (the so-called 'death squads') were
 responsible for massive human rights violations, including
 arbitrary arrest, torture, 'disappearance' and extrajudicial
 executions." While acknowledging that many peasants had died
 in guerrilla attacks, Amnesty International claimed that "the
 majority of killings and other abuses of non-combatant
 civilians were carried out by uniformed and plainclothed
 military and security agents acting under orders."
 Americas Watch claimed in a report issued in September 1985
 that the "human rights situation under General Mejia was no
 better than under General Rios Montt."
 The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), in its August
 1985 report, "Security and Development in the Guatemalan
 Highlands," said the "rhetoric with which the military
 government presents its security and development programs is
 laudable and contains many positive elements." However, the
 report went on to conclude that the civil patrol system and
 some model villages "entail continuous and widespread
 violations of civil and labor rights."
 The Mutual Support Group (GAM), a Guatemalan human rights
 group formed in 1984 to locate missing relatives, continued
 its activities in 1985. In a June communique, GAM listed 693
 relatives as "detained-disappeared" since 1980. GAM's
 dissatisfaction with the efforts of the Tripartite Commission,
 founded by General Mejia in late 1984 to investigate cases of
 missing persons, led to a series of public protests. GAM's
 actions included demonstrations in Guatemala City and the
 peaceful occupation of the National Congress building and some
 government executive office buildings. In March, following
 one "occupation," a government spokesman warned GAM to obey
 the law. Shortly thereafter, the Chief of State said GAM was
 being unwittingly manipulated by subversives. Following this
 accusation, GAM member Hector Gomez Calito was abducted,
 tortured, and murdered by unidentified assailants. In early
 April, a GAM director, Rosario Godoy de Cuevas, was found dead
 in her automobile at the bottom of a ravine near Guatemala
 City. Dead along with de Cuevas were her child and brother.
 These killings led to a GAM-led protest march in Guatemala
 City which attracted international attention.

 GUATEMALA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guatemala has a population of over 8 million and it is growing
 at a rate of 3 percent annually. The per capita income of
 $1,055 has fallen by 14 percent during the last 3 years.
 Guatemala has sharp economic class distinctions. A small
 economic elite controls a significant portion of the
 commercial, agricultural, and financial resources of the
 country: approximately 50 percent of private investment, 20
 percent of coffee production, and 100 percent of the largest
 industries. The middle class accounts for less than 20
 percent of the population. Together, the upper and middle
 classes receive two-thirds of total income. According to the
 latest available figures, 21 percent of the urban population
 and 25 percent of the rural population are below the poverty
 line. The economy is divided into traditional and modern
 sectors. The traditional sector is rural and agricultural,
 and consists mostly of subsistence farmers and farm laborers.
 Of the 2,470,000 economically active people in Guatemala,
 approximately 1,482,000 work in the traditional sector,
 existing outside or on the edge of the money economy.
 The economy has been in recession since 1980. A combination
 of world-wide recession, political instability in Central
 America, low commodity prices in world markets, and the
 disruptive effects of the insurgency on internal demand have
 had a devastating impact. The unit of currency, the quetzal,
 has gone from parity with the U.S. dollar to an exchange rate
 of almost 3 to 1 in less than a year. Inflation is running at
 60 percent. Currently, 10 to 11 percent of the population is
 unemployed and 30 to 40 percent is underemployed. This
 situation is chronic and there is little hope for change in
 the near future. The economy is contracting and cannot supply
 nearly enough jobs for those who enter the work force each
 year, In 1983 the real rate of economic growth was minus 3.2
 percent and employment fell by 5 percent. One study estimates
 that of the 75,000 people who entered the work force in 1984,
 only 33,000 were able to find employment. The desperate
 nature of this situation is underscored by the fact that 55
 percent of the population is under 19 years of age.
 In 1982, the latest year for which statistics are available,
 the caloric supply available for consumption was 97 percent of
 nutritional requirements. Despite considerable public
 investment in potable water projects, medical centers, and
 clinics, health services and sanitation are generally poor in
 rural areas. In 1980, again the latest year for which figures
 are available, 45 percent of the total population, but only 18
 percent of those living in rural areas, had access to safe
 drinking water. Life expectancy at birth was 61 years in
 1985, but the infant mortality rate rose from 63 per 1,000
 live births in 1984 to 67 in 1985.
 The literacy rate was 46 percent in 1973; 53.6 percent for
 males and 38.5 percent for females. In 1983 the enrollment in
 primary school was 72 percent, with males 77 percent and
 females 66 percent. Because half the population of Guatemala
 are Indians, who learn Spanish as a second language, literacy
 is a particularly difficult problem. To attack it and address
 the educational needs of the Indian populace, the Government
 has developed a bilingual education program.
 The Government continued its model village rural resttlement
 
 
 557
 GUATEMALA
 program, a joint civilian/military effort to reconstruct and
 settle 49 villages on or near their original sites. Each town
 each has a potable water supply and electricity, at least one
 school, a church, postal and telegraph service, private bus
 service, and a health clinic. Some of the model villages have
 a military detachment nearby to provide security. In 1985, 24
 villages had been completed and are inhabited.
 Guatemalan workers are protected by a variety of laws which
 establish minimum wages, minimum working age, and maximum
 working hours, and attempt to establish minimum safety
 standards at the workplace. However, regulations are
 frequently ignored by employers, and the Government's ability
 to enforce these laws is less than adequate.
 Guatemala is a Latin society in which most women play
 traditional roles; there is no discrimination against women by
 law, but de facto discrimination is rooted in centuries of
 cultural practice. Although figures show that over one-half
 the female population has not been educated and that 94 per
 cent of the women residing in rural areas had less than 3
 years of schooling in 1978, it is estimated that 30 percent of
 the students enrolled in Guatemalan universities are women.
 They study education, law, business administration, pharmacy,
 humanities, and psychology and go on to careers as health
 workers, teachers, or office workers. The number of women
 occupying professional and managerial positions is small.
 Several women university graduates have been named to high
 government positions. General Mejia appointed Eugenia Tejada
 de Putzeys as Minister of Education in 1983. When de Putzeys
 resigned in 1985, General Mejia replaced her with another
 woman, Aracely Judith Samayoa de Pineda. Other women serve as
 judges of lower courts, principally in the area of family
 law. The Ministry of Labor established an Office of Women's
 Affairs which has responsibility for encouraging the
 advancement of women. There was a continuation of the
 participation of women in politics during 1985. Three women
 served in the 88-member Constituent Assembly. Only 3 other
 women had been elected to the National Congress in the
 previous 35 years, and none to past Constituent Assemblies.
 There are 7 women deputies in the new Congress, including one
 Indian woman from the Department of Chimaltenango.
 President-elect Vinicio Cerezo has announced that he will
 appoint Ana Catalina Soberanis Reyes as Minister of Labor.
