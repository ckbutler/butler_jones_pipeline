 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a free press,
 strong unions, and a longstanding commitment to democracy which enabled the
 country to withstand two attempted coupe durin 1992. For mere than 30 years
 pwer has passed peacefully between the two major political parties through open
 elections. In 1988 a third political party emerged as a sgiicant factor, in the 1992
 local elections, a fourth significant party emerged. In the immediate afterath of
 both coup attempts, the Government declared a state of emergency and, exercising
 its onstitu iona repubgative in such circumstances, suspended some constitutional
 guarantees, including fsedom of the press and the right to demonstrate. After the
 corst coup attempt on Februr 4, freedom of the press was restored within a few
 days, and full liberties were restored in April. After the second coup attempt on No.
 vember 27, the Government lifted restrictions on assembly for electoral purposes
 after 48 hours to enable campaigning for the December 6 nationwide local elections;
 a few days later a nationwide curfew was lifted and most constitutional guarantees
 were restored. Both coup attempts left the Government of Venezuela facing a severe
 and multi-faceted political/military crisis.
 The security apparatus has civilian and military elements, both accountable to
 pularly elected authorities. According to the US. Arms Control and Disarmament
 gency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $407 million. The proposed 1993
 budget provides for the fIrst real increase in several years. One of the branches of
 the military, the National Guard, has arrest authority and supplies the top leader-
 ship for one of the country's police forces. During the February coup attempt, the
 National Guard played a key role in the defense of the democratically elected Gov-
 ernment but also was used to enforce the suspension of seven constitutional guar-
 antees. In the course of the year civilian and military security personnel were re-
 sponsible for human rights abuses.
 The public sector dominates Venezuela's economy, particularly the petroleum in-
 dustry, which accounts for some 23 percent of the gross domestic product. The Gov-
 ernment is undertaking major economic restructuring to reduce its dependence on
 oil exports, privatize many public sector firms, and enable domestic business to com-
 pete more effectively in international markets.
 Venezuelans traditionally have enjoyed a wide range of freedoms and individual
 rights, including a free press, active unions, and free elections, but serious human
 rights abuses continued in 1992. They included arbitrary and excessively lengthy
 detentions, abuse of detainees, extrajudicial killings by the police and military, the
 failure to punish police and security officers accused ofabuses, corruption and gross
 inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems deplorable prison condi-
 tions, and violence and discrimination against women. Pofice sweeps of poor, crime-
 ridden neighborhoods resulted in increased incidents of extrajudicial killings and ar-
 bitrary arrests.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 (i.e, government-ordered) political killings in 1992. Instances of extrajudicial
 killings, however, continued. The press reported cases in which the police allegedly
 shot and killed criminal suspects without appropriate justification, security forces
 allegedly killed civilians, or arrested persons died while in police custody. Charges
 
 
 507
 are rarely brought against the perpetrators of such killings. If the perpetrators are
 prosecuted, sentences issued are frequently light, or more commonly, the convic-
 tions are overturned during the appeal process. Unlike common prisoners, police
 charged with crimes rarely spend much time behind bars.
 Immediately after the February 4 coup attempt, there were a number of credible
 allegations of extrajudicial killings by both sides. When restrictions on presa free-
 dom were lifted, it was reported that two officers, Jose Alberto Carregal Cruz and
 Cabrera Lacdacta, who fought in supprt of the coup attempt, had been surnmarily
 killed that day. Carrega Crukilledkilled after he had surrendered to two members
 of the Intelligence Police (DISIP). Carregal's body was exhumed by court order and
 it was determined that he had been shot behindthe ear at close range. The press
 (and local human rights groups) also reported that government forces summarily ex-
 ecuted four students andthree soldiers in Valencia on February 4. Three of the stu-
 dents had gunshot wounds in their temples; the fourth had been shot in the back,
 allegedl a  r    ice had beaten him. White the details of one of these shootings
 are in dispute, the annual report of the Venezuelan Program for Action and Edi-
 cation in Human Rights (PROVEA) says one student, Columba Guadalupe Rivas,
 was taken off a bus by uniformed police and national guardsmen. Her body was
 found the next day in the local morgue with a gunshot wound to the temple. This
 incident is still being investigated; there is as yet no agreement on the facts. DISIP
 reported that coup conspirators summarily executed three of its officers: Rafael
 Oramas Mayz, Jhon Edicto Cermeno and Gerson Castaneda.
 In the wake of the November 27 coup attempt, questions were raised about the
 killing of inmates in Reten La Catia prison. The Government claimed that coup
 leaders distributed arms to the prisoners the day of the coup. Human rights groups
 questioned the Government's assertion, however, pointing out that a police inven-
 tory of weapons found in the prison after a three day siege located only one gun
 and numerous knives. Most of the bodies ofprisoners at the local morgue had fatal
 gunshot wounds. The Government reported 63 prisoners killed at La Catia; a num-
 ber confirmed by human rights groups, who add that the fate of 25 additional pris-
 oners remained unknown. At the end of 1992, the Government had not yet com-
 pleted its investigation into this incident although the National Guard was ex-
 pected to file a report. The total killed in the November 27 coup attempt was about
 280, including from 90 to 100 civilians who were found shot dead in the streets,
 many of them caught in the crossfire between the National Guard and the rebels.
 Human rights organizations raised questions about extrajudicial killings by Govern-
 ment forces during the recapture of a television station; the rebels also wantonly
 killed three people during their initial takeover of the station. Witnesses in the vi-
 cinity of the Presidential palace also claimed that a National Guard commander had
 given the order to shoot demonstrators nearby.
 In its annual report on human rights abuses covering the period from October
 1991 through September 1992, PROVEA, Venezuela's foremost human rights orga-
 nization, reported 143 extrajudicial killings. Extrajudicial killings unrelated to the
 coup attempt continued throughout the year. Twenty-year-old Simon Caraballo, a
 student at the Experimental University of Guayana, was visiting family members
 in Caracas the evening of August 8 when he was shot by four members of the Na-
 tional Guard. He reportedly fell off his bicycle and while still on the ground was
 shot three times. Neighbors identified the vehicle of the guardsmen, and the Na-
 tional Guard is investigating the case.
 The Permanent Council of War, a military court in San Cristobal, Tachira, ruled
 in April 1992 that the 1988 shooting deaths of 14 fishermen by Venezuelan security
 forces in the town of El Amparo near the Colombian border was a legitimate mili-
 tary enggement, not a deliberate massacre as alleged by two survivors. Fourteen
 police officers who had been jailed because of their alleged involvement were freed.
 The Council's decision was a surprise to many, since two of the survivors disputed
 the military's contention that the victims were guerrillas. The Permanent Council
 of War submitted the case to the Martial Court for further consideration.
 On September 19 a group of heavily armed national guardsmen entered a poor
 neighborhood of Caracas in search of a criminal. After a gunfight near a playground,
 the criminal was wounded and arrested. Children in the nearby playground, upon
 hearing the gunfire scattered and hid in nearby shrubs. Reportedly, one of the
 guardsmen approached the playground and machine-gunned 16-year-old Efren
 Urbina, who was hiding in one of the shrubs, killing him instantly. The presumed
 killer later told the press "for this death no one will pay anything," and refused
 to make any statements about what had happened or to submit his gun for ballistic
 examination.
 No progress was made on charges of extrajudicial killings by security forces dur-
 ing the nots of February and March of 1989. The cases remained under consider-
 
 
 508
 ation during 1992 in both military and civilian courts. Of approximately 300 cases,
 only one has been adjudicated. a police officer was found guilty in 1991 of homicide
 and sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment.
 b. Disappearance.-In 1992 there were fewer reports of persons disappearing
 without explanation and only one report of a suspects disappearance while in police
 custody. On September 12, Junior Rafal Barco was forced into a police vehicle by
 police officials near his house; his family was never able to locate him. On February
 22 Helmeson Garcia Vertis was forcibly taken from his house by defense intelligence
 (DIM) officials and was never seen ag . Soldier Angel Hernandez Dimas was re-
 ported missing by his parents in mid-January. There is some concern that Dimas'
 disappearance may be linked to the coup attempt of February 4, since he was a
 member of the parachutists battalion which participated in the coup, and his last
 contact with his family was three days earlier.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law, but physical abuse of detainees continued in 1992. Ac-
 cording to local human rights rhonitors, this abuse includes cases of electric shock,
 beatings, rape, and near-suffocation. PROVEA reported 32 cases of torture in the
 first six months of 1992 and stated that instances of torture for political reasons
 increased after the coup attempt of February 4. According to PROVEA, torture in
 Venezuela "is done systematically, but is not yet massive or generalized." PROVEA's
 annual report tabulated the number of torture cases as follows: Military Police (19)
 State Police (5), Military Intelligence (6), DISIP (7), National Guard (10), Technicaf
 Judicial Police (11) and the Army (1).
 In April, police arrested 25-year-old Miguel Angel Delgado Mendez, the son of a
 military captain, after he witnessed a fight in a restaurant in the town of Los Cara-
 cas. While in custody he was reportedly beaten semi-unconscious and had acid
 poured on him. Delgado was subsequently abandoned semi-naked in a street. After
 regaining consciousness he found his way to the nearest office of the National Guard
 and was immediately taken to a military hospital for treatment of "severe burns and
 intoxication." The hospital later said he suffered first degree burns on 8 percent of
 his body. Delgado's father pursued the case and requested an investigation, but by
 the end of 1992 there had been no progress, and no action had been taken against
 Delgado's alleged assailants.
 A subcommittee of the Congressional Internal Political Committee initiated an in-
 vestigation of torture by police and National Guardsmen of prisoners in La Planta
 prison El Paraiso, Caracas. According to family members, on the night of the first
 coup attempt, when constitutional guarantees were suspended, police officers en-
 tered cells six and seven and beat and abused the prisoners there. The prisoners
 were allegedly told they could not denounce their torturers because "constitutional
 guarantees were suspended." The sub-committee has not yet issued its report.
 Prison conditions, which are generally very poor due to overrowding, are strongly
 condemned by human ri~hts groups and government officials. There are 30al for
 a  ris  population which, according to government figures, numbered 31,099 in
 1991. Of this number only 10,577 had been sentenced. Local human rights organiza-
 tions calculated that a detainee typically spends about three and a half years in jail
 before final disposition of his case. Sporadic prison riots occurred due to poor prison
 conditions such as overcrowding, ina uate diet, minimal health care, and physical
 abuse by guards and other prisoners. Violence within the prison system is growing.
 During the first 7 months of 1992, 129 prisoners were killed (compared to 124 for
 all of 1991) and 300 wounded, most by fellow prisoners, although an additional 90
 were allegedly killed by the National Guard during the November 27 coup attempt.
 In February the Government created the National Center for Prison Studies to
 reeducate and train prison personnel. Personnel from one prison were chosen to ini-
 tiate the experiment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the right to ju dicial determina-
 tion of the legality of detention is provided by law, a potential for abuse exists be-
 cause arrested persons or those under investigative detention legally can be held for
 as long as 8 days without a, formal detention order. During this time they may be
 held incommunicado. On the eighth day a judge, taking the police investigation into
 account, issues a formal arrest order, if no evidence is found, the police release the
 person. Arbitrary arrests and arrests without proper warrants are common, and
 time limits for holding persons are frequently exceeded.
 Prisoners complain about having to pay fees extorted by prison officials for trans-
 portation to judicial proceedings at which formal charges are made. Detainees with-
 out money to pay the unauthorized charges are sometimes unable to get to their
 judicial hearings.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Although the right to a fair trial is provided by
 law and some procedural safeguards exist, the accused (in criminal cases) bears the
 
 
 509
 burden of proof regarding innocence. Lengthy pretrial detention of 2 to 3 years and
 case backlogs are he norm. The justice system is overburdened, corrupt and ineffi-
 dent. The law provides public defenders tor those unable to afford a defense attor-
 ney but there are not enough public defenders in the country to meet this obligation.
 The Judicial Council, the governing body of the judicial branch, stated that there
 are 150 public defense attorneys with an average of 170 active cases each. Because
 of the unequal distribution of cases, some defenders handle as many as 250 cases.
 The judicial process Is written, requiring the costly and time-consuming produc-
 tion of voluminous reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at every stage. Some
 Venezuelan leaders and legal experts also blame delays and other irregularities on
 corruption and the use of personal influence. The civilian judiciary is legally inde-
 pendent, but connections to the two major political parties are important in the judi-
 cial selection process and political parties can and do influence judicial decisions
 in particular cases. Tiiis overburdened justice system also suffers from a lack of pub-
 lic credibility.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion can be tried by military courts as insur-
 gents. There is neither a statute of limitations nor a requirement for a speedy trial
 for cases in military courts, although persons convicted under the military justice
 system have the same right of appeal to the Supreme Court as those prosecuted
 under the civilian system. Military judges are appointed by the Supreme Court. The
 lack of deadlines in the military system combined with its procedural secrecy and
 tendency to 'close ranks," makes it unlikely that defendants undergo an impartial
 or timely prosecution. These factors can also result in military offenders being
 shielded from responsibility for human rights abuses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Ven-
 ezuela has constitutional safeguards protecting citizens against arbitrary inter-
 ference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. In general, these safe-
 guards are effective. Immediately after the February 4 coup attempt, the following
 constitutional safeguards were suspended: freedom of travel, freedom of speech,
 freedom to strike personal security and liberty, inviolability of one's home, the right
 to assembly, and the right to demonstrate. On February 17 the Government re-
 stored freedom of speech and travel and the freedom to strike. All constitutional
 safeguards were restored on April 9.
 In the aftermath of the November 27 coup attempt, the Government quickly re-
 stored all the suspended constitutional guarantees, except those of personal security
 and liberty and inviolability of one's home (an action intended to facilitate the Gov-
 ernment's continuing investigation of this coup attempt). At the end of 1992 it was
 still too early to determine whether any unusual abuses had occurred because of the
 temporary suspension of these rights.
 In recent years there have been many complaints of telephone surveillance; there
 were fewer reported cases in 1992. Both private individuals and the security forces
 were accused of illegal wiretapping.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press and free speech. These liberties, along with academic freedom, are almost uni-
 versally honored. Venezuela has a free and lively press, which frequently criticizes
 the Government and denounces instances of government interference in the media.
 After the February 4 coup attempt, the Government imposed censorship; in some
 instances weekly magazines and newspapers were seized, and officials of the Min-
 istry of the Interior screened articles at various ress offices. Security officials also
 impeded the distribution of specific newspapers, for example, the February 8 edition
 of El Diario de Caracas. As a result of domestic and international criticism, the Gov-
 ernment withdrew its censors.
 The Government did not impose censorship in the wake of the November 27 coup
 attempt, although it did order one radio station temporarily closed during the crisis
 for allegedly inciting the population. It also suspended broadcast of the television
 program of journalist Jose Vincente Rangel, one of the leading critics of the Govern-
 ment. The Government restored freedom of the press within  a  to ensure the con-
 tinuation of the campaigns for nationwide local elections on December 6.
 The Government has met regularly with the owners of the media to discuss issues
 the Government considers sensitive. The media do not practice self-censorship, but
 are aware of the Government's concerns; nonetheless, media criticism continues.
 Media owners have categorically rejected a proposed constitutional amendment by
 Congress which would restrict monopoly ownership of media and establish a legal
 "right of reply" to persons denounced in the press. The owners claim that both is-
 sues are covered by existing laws.
 
 
 510
 Individual journalists covering popular demonstrations have accused the security
 forces of specifically targe  them (for example, journalist Maria Veronica Tesari
 suffered a skull fracture on March 19 from the impact of a tear gas canister while
 she was covering a demonstration). The accusation was supported by the Inter
 American Press Association (IAPA) meeting in Caracas in July. In its annual report,
 PROVEA listed 125 cases of security forces roughing up journalists. On December
 10 the president of the journalists' union called the attacks against journalists "de-
 plorable" and "intolerable," noting that most took place during demonstrations. He
 accused police of deliberately attacking journalists to prevent them from publicizing
 demonstrations. According to the IAPA, freedom of the press is "being harmed" in
 Venezuela. The IAPA cited police brutality against journalists and the occupation
 and censorship of the print media during the brief period ater February 4, as well
 as the outright banning of some magazines and newspapers.
 Venezuela has 4 nationwide television networks (2 of which are government-
 owned), 3 regional television stations, 168 radio stations, and numerous newspapers
 and magazines, with 9 dailies In Caracas alone. The Government is a significant
 source of advertising revenue for the media, but there appear to be no recent in-
 stances in which government advertising was channeled for political ends.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is normally respected in Venezuela. Public meetings, including those
 of all political parties, are held generally without interference. Permits are required
 for public marches but are not denied for political reasons. Professional and aca-
 demic associations operate without interference.
 The constitutional provision guaranteeing freedom of assembly and association
 was suspended on February 4 and restored in April. Despite this suspension, there
 were many attempted demonstrations. Government security forces were criticized
 for excessive use of force in attempting to stop these unauthorized marches. Security
 forces were especially criticized for indiscriminately using tear gas near classrooms.
 Local human rights organizations reported about 532 demonstrations between
 January and July. Of these, 123 were stopped by the security forces, and 168 were
 considered violent. During these demonstrations, about 853 people were detained,
 340 people were injured, and 18 deaths were reported. All of these casualties were
 attributed to government security forces.
 c. Freedom of Religioan.-The population is predominantly Roman Catholic, al-
 though other religious grou ps enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize actively. For-
 eign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant are active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Freign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens and legal residents are free to travel within the country and
 to go abroad and return. Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, ex-
 iles, and displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American
 countries. They are given normal residence status and may be expelled only because
 of criminal activities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy with a government freely elected by secret
 ballot. Suffrage is mandatory for all those 18 years of age or older, and the political
 process is open to all. Elections for the President Congress, and state legislative as-
 semblies are held every 5 years. Governors and mayors were elected for the first
 time in Venezuelan history in 1989 for three year terms, and voters also were able
 to choose individual candidates by name, rather than selecting only from among
 party slates. Also, in 1989 the Congress revised the electoral law to allow election
 by name of half of the Federal Congress in 1993; the rest will be elected proportion-
 ately from party slates, as all currently are. On December 6, Venezuelans again
 voted for individual candidates on a local level.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the entire political spectrum
 contend for positions ranging from municipal council seats to the presidency. The
 two largest parties are entrist: the Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian
 (COPEparies. The Movement toward Sociaism (MAS), founded by disenchanted
 members of the Venezuelan Communist Party, has increased its share of the total
 vote in recent elections and draws between 5 and 10 percent of the vote. In the De-
 cember 6 local elections, Causa R, a workers' party, emerged as a significant fourth
 entity after its candidate was elected mayor of Caracas.    .   .       .
 Women and minoritiesparticipate fully in Government and _politics, albeit in
 smaller percentages than their proportionate numbers in society. There are no legal
 impediments to their free participation, but traditional attitudes produce some de
 facto impediments. Women and minorities are promoted into high-level positions at
 a slower rate than men.
 
 
 511
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A considerable number of local human rights groups are active (mainly in Cars-
 cas) and vigorously criticize perceived government inadequacies in redressing griev-
 ances. Since the coup attempt, human rights groups have emerged in other states.
 Some of the groups complain of police harassment, including the disruption of legiti-
 mate protests, unlawful entry into the homes of activists, and surveillance. Two re-
 gional groups-the Latin American Foundation for Human Rights and Social Devel-
 opment and the Federation of Families of Disappeared Persons-have offices in Ca-
 racas. These human rights organizations are able to operate free of government re-
 striction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Venezuelan law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin; however, mem-
 bers of the countr/9 indigenous population frequently suffer from inattention to and
 violation of their human rights. Venezuela is home to seven major indigenous ethnic
 groups, including the Yanomani, who live largely in the state of Amazonas border-
 ing Brazil, and the Guajiros, settled in the western state of Zulia along the border
 with Colombia.
 Article 77 of the Venezuelan Constitution provides for special laws governing "the
 protection of indigenous communities and their progressive incorporation info the
 life of the nation. There are a few indigenous Congressmen who are members of
 the dominant political parties. There is also an oranization of indigenous elected
 Congressmen, called the Indigenous Parliament of V    a. Indigenous groups re-
 peatedly have asked the Government to consider providing for proportional rep-
 resentation of ethnic minorities in the country's legislative bodies, as well as the
 right to preserve their ancestral lands and cultures. During the 1992 debate on re-
 form of the Constitution, indigenous gups met with the President and members
 of Congress to press these demands, However, the proposed constitutional amend-
 ment was not approved when the entire reform package was deferred indefinitely.
 Many of the country's indigenous people live iso lated from modern civilization and
 lack access to health and educational facilities theoretically available to all Ven-
 ezuelans. However, even groups that are more integrated into the social fabric com-
 plain of lack of access to medical facilities and care. A reflection of the inequality
 of access to public health care is the disproportionate number of reported deaths
 among the Indian population from cholera. The Minister of Health said that 80 per-
 cent of Venezuela's cholera cases occur among its indigenous population. Through
 September 1992, nearly 2,000 cholera cases were reported nationwide, with 41
 deaths.
 In 1991 the Government inaugurated the Upper Orinoco-Casiquiane Biospheric
 Reserve for use by the a pproximately 14,000 Yanomani Indians. The 32,038-square-
 mile reserve is designedto prevent development of and incursions onto Yanomani
 territory. No mining, farming, colonization, or proselytizing is permitted. The cre-
 ation of this reserve is widely seen as an important step toward preserving indige-
 nous culture and rights affecting about one-tenth of Venezuela's Indian peoples.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. According to wom-
 en's groups, there are serious problems facing Venezuelan women, including rape
 and assault (including by police officers), lack of access to education and medical
 care, and culturally ingrained discrimination that results in women's relative under-
 representation in leadership positions in the political structure, trade unions, and
 the private sector. The first two problems, violence and lack of access to public serv-
 ices, impinge especially, but not exclusively, on women from the lower economic
 strata. The perpetrators of acts of aggression against women are rarely punished.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs was abolished in 1992 as part of a broad govern-
 ment initiative to restructure the central Government in order to reduce expendi-
 tures. Congress is presently considering a law to create two institutions related to
 women: the first is the National Council on Women, an independent institute that
 would continue the same functions of the previous ministry. The second is a pro-
 posed National Office for the Defense of Women's Rights, to oversee the implemen-
 tation of federal laws and regulations on women's rights.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both constitutional and labor law recognize and en-
 courage the right of unions to exist. The comprehensive Labor Code enacted in 1990
 extends to all public sector and private sector employees (except members of the
 armed forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code man-
 dates registration of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but reduces the Ministry's
 discretion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper documents
 
 
 (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes and the membership list) are sub-
 mitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, ana then only for reasons listed in the
 law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the member-
 ship. One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers
 (CTV), and three small ones, as well as a number of independent unions, operate
 freely in Venezuela. About 25 percent of the national labor force is unionized.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 many union organizations play active international roles. The CTVs top leadership
 includes members of several political parties. The mjority are affiliated with the
 country's largest party, the AD. The CTV and the AD party reciprocally influence
 each other. The CTV, however, has repeatedly demonstrated its independence from
 the Government (in which the AD holds the presidency and a plurality of the seats
 in the congress) and from the AD party (as evidenced by its frequent criticism of
 the Government's economic policies).
 The right of public and private sector employees to strike is recognized legally and
 upheld in practice. The Labor Code extends the right to strike to all government
 employees (except members of the armed services), but states that it may only be
 exercised by public servants if it does not cause "irremediable damage to the popu-
 lation or to institutions." It also allows the President to order public or private sec-
 tor strikers back to work and to submit their dispute to arbitration if the strike
 "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or part of the population.* In
 recent years Venezuelan workers have seldom resorted to strikes, but a perceived
 decline in living standards has increased the willingness of workers to consider
 them seriously. ]uring 1992 most strikes occurred among government employees.
 In most cases, the threat to strike was sufficient to achieve a resolution satisfactory
 to the workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.--Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected and encouraged by the Labor Code and is freely practiced throughout Ven-
 ezuela. According to the Code, employers "must negotiate" a collective contract with
 the union that represents the majority of their workers. The Code also contains a
 provision stating that wages may be raised by administrative decree, provided that
 the Congress ap proves the decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Complaints regard-
 ing violations of these articles of the law are heard by Ministry of Labor inspectors,
 who can impose a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first
 infraction.
 Under the Code, union officials have special protection from firing. If a judge de-
 termines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled to back
 pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which var-
 ies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor relations law and practice is the same in Venezuela's sole export processing
 zone as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in Venezuela. The Labor Code states that no one may "obligate others to work
 against their will."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code allows children
 between the ages of 12 and 14 to work if given special permission by the National
 Institute for Minors or the Labor Ministry. Children between the ages of 14 and 16
 may work if given permission by their legal guardians.
 Minors may not work in mines, smelters, or in occupations "that risk life or
 health," in occupations that could damage intellectual or moral development, or in
 "public spectacles."
 Those under 16 must by law work no more than six hours a day or 30 hours a
 week. Minors under 18 may work only during the hours between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m.
 The law is enforced effectively by the Ministry of Labor and the National Institute
 for Minors in the formal sector of the economy, but much less so in the informal
 sector, which by the end of 1990 (latest available figures) accounted for 41 percent
 of total employment. Some children work as street vendors; there is no other occupa-
 tion in which employment of children is believed to be substantial.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-Venezuela has a national urban minimum
 wage rate and a national rural minimum wage rate. To these minimum figures are
 added mandatory fringe benefits that vary with the workers' individual cir-
 cumstances, but which in general increase wages by about one-third. This combined
 income provides a living wage, though the perception of the average worker, as
 enunciated by the labor unions, is that purchasing power has declined significantly
 over the last several years. Only domestic workers and concierges are legally ex-
 
 
 cluded from coverage under the minimum wage decrees. Under the Labor Code, the
 rates are set by administrative decree. The decree is then sent to Congress, which
 can either suspend or ratify, but may not modify the decree. Minimum wages are
 enforced effectively in the formal sector of the economy by the Ministry of Labor.
 There is no reliable information regarding compliance in the informal sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard work week to a maximum of 44 hours.
 Article 196 of the Code requires 'two complete days of rest each week." Some
 unions, such as the petroleum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime
 may not exceed 2 hours daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may
 not be paid at a rate less than time-and-a-half. These standards are effectively en-
 forced by the Ministry of Labor in the formal sector.
 The new Labor Code specifies that women may not be discriminated against with
 regard to remuneration or working conditions may not be fired during pregnancy
 and for a year after giving birth, ar entitled to unpaid leave (and compensation
 from the social security agency) for 6 weeks before the birth of a child and 12 weeks
 after, and are due 10 weeks of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3
 years of age.
 A health and safety law was passed in 1986, but its enforcement awaits imple-
 menting regulations. The delays are due largely to concern over the fact that the
 law provides penal sanctions against management when violations of health and
 safety occur, and ambiguity in the law over what constitutes a violation. The Labor
 Code states that employers are obligated to pay specified amounts (up to a maxi-
 mum of 25 times the minimum monthly salary) to workers for accidents or occupa-
 tional illnesses, regardless of who is responsible for the inury. It also requires that
 workplaces must maintain 'sufficient protection for health and life against sick-
 nesses and accident,' and it imposes fines of from oneuar to twice the mini-
 mum monthly salary for first infractions. Enforcement of the law by inspectors from
 the Ministry of Labor appears to be effective.
