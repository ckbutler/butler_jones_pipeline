 MALDIVES
 The Republic of Maldives consists of about 1,200 small
 islands, of which only 200 are inhabited, scattered over an
 area 500 by 75 miles in the Indian Ocean. Just under a
 quarter of the 173,000 Maldivians live on Male, the capital
 island, which is 400 miles west-southwest of Sri Lanka.
 Maldivians ethnically are similar to the peoples of Sri Lanka,
 but their culture has been influenced by centuries of contact
 with the Arab world and by their strong adherence to Islam.
 The Maldivian Government is highly centralized, with authority
 concentrated in Male in the hands of a strong president and a
 small educated elite. The President is assisted by a cabinet
 of ministers, whom he appoints, and a unicameral legislature,
 the Majlis, elected by universal adult franchise. This system
 reflects the authoritarian tradition of the Maldives, ruled
 almost continuously from the advent of Islam in the 12th
 century until 1968 by hereditary sultans, even while a British
 protectorate from 1887 to 1965.
 The Maldives has experimented with several forms of government
 since the 1930's, including an elected sultanate and a
 short-lived republic. The second republic was created by the
 present Constitution, which came into force in 1968. It
 guarantees basic human rights but does not define clearly the
 separation of powers among the president, Majlis, and
 judiciary. In 1979 the Majlis passed a motion seeking a new
 constitution. President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom suggested the
 model for a new, more liberal constitution in July 1981, and a
 draft was submitted for review by a 90-member Citizens Special
 Majlis. This body failed to complete the review by the first
 target date, December 22, 1982. Debate continues, but no new
 target date has been set.
 The Maldives' 1,000-strong National Security Service is
 responsible for maintaining law and order, protecting the
 president, defending the country, and preventing foreign
 fishermen from encroaching on Maldivian fishing grounds. The
 police division of the Service investigates crimes, makes
 arrests, and enforces house arrest. People held before trial
 are either under house arrest, under the jurisdiction of the
 Civil Prisons Department, or at an island detention center
 near Male.
 The human rights picture in the Maldives did not change in
 1984. The Maldivian Government respects individual human
 rights, and Maldivians in general do not regard their
 government as repressive. The Government has allowed the
 gradual development of a democratic political ethic, but
 habits of active political participation among Maldivians are
 only rudimentary at present. To be Maldivian is to be
 Muslim. Individuals are free to pursue private interests as
 long as they do not violate the civil law or the Shari'a, the
 Islamic legal code. A conscious effort is being made to
 broaden opportunities for women.
 Maldives is one of the world's least developed countries. The
 Government is trying to develop and modernize the economy. It
 has encouraged improvements in the main industry, fishing, and
 has supported the rapid growth of the tourist industry, often
 joining with private individuals or foreign investors to build
 tourist resorts.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 In 1984, there were no reports that individuals had
 disappeared.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution stipulates that 'under no condition shall a
 torture considered to be injurious be inflicted upon any
 person.' The Government neither condones nor practices
 torture, and there have been no reports or allegations of
 torture in 1984.
 Maldivians follow Shari'a (Islamic) law, and occasionally
 violators are flogged. Usually, punishment is confined to
 less physical means: fines, payment of compensation, house
 arrest, imprisonment, or banishment to a sparsely populated
 island where the prisoner must earn his daily keep. Although
 there are no prisons as such in the Maldives, there are two
 "detention centers' for imprisonment after trial of people who
 are deemed a danger to the state or to need protection. There
 have been no reports of unacceptable conditions in these
 centers. One form of punishment for convicted criminals is
 banishment to remote islands. Those banished are required to
 perform some work to support themselves, and normally are
 prevented from leaving until the end of their periods of
 banishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of persons being subjected to
 arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile. A person charged with
 arousing people against the lawful government could be
 banished for a number of years. No such cases are known to
 have occurred in 1984.
 The Constitution requires that "no person shall be apprehended
 or arrested, except on a verdict specified by Sharila or
 (civil) law.* Acting on information or complaints received,
 the Attorney General's office passes the case to the
 appropriate court and the judge then instructs the police to
 undertake an investigation. The suspect is questioned at
 police headquarters and may, depending upon the charges, be
 detained or placed under house arrest for 15 days while the
 case is investigated. If the case is not brought to trial
 within 15 days, the suspect is freed. Detention or house
 arrest may be extended after the first 15 days by authority of
 the President, but usually for not more than one month. There
 is no provision under Maldivian law for preventive detention,
 and incommunicado detention is not practiced.
 While there are no provisions for bail, an arrested person who
 has valid reasons to travel may receive permission to do so
 from the court handling his case.

 MALDIVES
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person accused of crime is given a trial. During a trial
 the accused may defend himself and call witnesses. He also
 may be assisted by a lawyer, but there are few lawyers and
 lawyers are not provided by the courts. The accused is
 sentenced by the judge, with the length and type of sentence
 as established by law and custom.
 The Republic of Maldives has a High Court and eight lesser
 courts in the capital at Male, each dealing with specific
 types of cases (e.g., debt, theft, property claims). On other
 islands there are courts that deal with all types of cases.
 Judges are trained in Islamic law, are appointed by the
 President and serve at his pleasure, and thus cannot be
 considered fully independent. Cases in island courts that
 present knotty legal points are referred to the appropriate
 specialized court at Male, whose judge may in turn refer the
 legal point to four judges attached to the Ministry of Justice
 for assistance. The High Court acts as a court of appeal and
 handles political cases, such as the trials of the
 participants in the 1980 attempted coup dletat and of four
 Majlis members found guilty of bribery in 1983.
 There are only a few Maldivians serving sentences 'for crimes
 which can be considered political acts: six persons found
 guilty of involvement in the 1980 coup still are banished to
 outer islands, and the four Majlis members found guilty of
 unconstitutional activity and taking bribes began their 11
 years of banishment in August 1983. A number of people
 sentenced for unconstitutional activities were either pardoned
 or had their sentences commuted by President Gayoom when he
 was inaugurated to his second term on November 10, 1983.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits the opening, intercepting, reading,
 or making public of letters, telephone conversations,
 telegrams, and wireless messages exchanged between persons
 'except in accordance with the specific provisions of the
 law." There have been no reports of complaints in 1984 that
 the Government monitors correspondence or telephone
 conversations or uses a system of informers. The Government
 does not interfere with the right to marry, or seek forcibly
 to resettle population.
 The Constitution also requires that private premises and
 dwellings be respected and "therefore they shall not be
 entered into except under conditions and in a manner
 stipulated in the law." There have been no reports of
 practices to the contrary. However, the Government announced
 in April 1984 that it had confiscated some property belonging
 to former President Ibrahim Nasir, who is now living in
 Singapore, but had paid him monetary compensation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Sharila and the law are
 not contravened.' Given their long tradition of authoritarian
 rule, Maldivians are careful when expressing their opinions to
 
 
 1326
 MALDIVES
 foreigners or in the media, but may be frank in private when
 discussing and criticizing the Government. Any citizen may
 criticize or complain to the Government without fear if he
 does so through recognized channels, such as via letters or
 oral complaints to the President, to a Majlis member, or to a
 civil servant or other person in authority.
 There are three privately owned newspapers, all required to
 register with the Government. Before 1983 there were no
 newspapers owned by the Government, which did not want to
 create an official press. In January 1983, however, it began
 issuing a newssheet for posting on walls on all islands where
 atoll offices are located, and in July expanded the program to
 cover all inhabited islands. In February 1984, the Government
 opened the media center in Male through which it hopes to
 convey to the public what it is doing to develop the country.
 There are no prohibitions on the importation of foreign
 publications, except pornography, and foreign broadcasts are
 not jammed.
 Although there is no prior censorship of newspapers, writers
 and editors are subject.to prosecution if articles contravene
 laws, such as the one which prohibits arousing opposition to
 the legally established Government. In the past, writers and
 editors have been questioned about articles, fined, and put
 under house arrest, but there were no reports of such
 incidents in 1984.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom. Maldivians
 are free to acquire and impart knowledge "in a manner that
 does not contravene Shari'a or civil law.' In July 1984, the
 Majlis passed a bill making students enrolled in government-
 run or government-assisted schools liable for government
 service for varying periods, depending upon their educational
 attainments. The bill was deemed necessary because of the
 drop in the number of young Maldivians entering government
 service.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association,
 but Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. The majority of rallies and meetings seem to
 be those sponsored or approved by the Government and commonly
 are addressed by officials or religious leaders. Clubs and
 other private associations, of which there are many, are
 permitted to function if they do not contravene Shari'a and
 civil law, and if they register with the Government.
 There are no trade unions and no reports of workers in the
 Maldives attempting to form unions in 1984. There is no
 prohibition of trade unions, though Maldivians are forbidden
 to be members of the trade unions of other countries. Until
 the 19701s, most Maldivians either were self-employed or held
 government jobs.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution makes Islam the official religion and all
 citizens are Muslims. There are no churches or shrines for
 the practice of other religions. Missionaries of non-Muslim
 faiths have not gone to the Maldives. Conversion of Muslims
 to any other faith would be a violation of the Shari a.
 However, there have been no reports of complaints about this
 
 
 1327
 MALDIVES
 restriction, or of Maldivians barred from any of the rights of
 citizenship because of a desire to profess a different faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to move about the country unless they are
 under house arrest or detention or banished. However, the
 Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most recent migrants have moved
 to Male which is becoming severely overcrowded. The
 Government reimposed regulations in 1982 that limit
 immigration to the capital island and its surrounding atoll,
 permitting migration to Male only for short periods in order
 to work, be educated, or receive medical treatment. At the
 same time, the Government has made a major effort to improve
 social and educational services and develop industry outside
 of Male.
 Maldivians are free to change jobs. There are no restrictions
 on foreign travel or on emigration, and there are no exit
 visas. The Government requires any Maldivian who has acquired
 another nationality to maintain Maldivian nationality
 concurrently. Such a person must enter and leave the Maldives
 on a Maldivian passport. As far as is known, the Government
 never has revoked the citizenship of any Maldivian. There are
 no refugees or displaced persons and, so far as is known, no
 Maldivians have been exiled or are refugees or displaced
 persons elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There are no political parties in the Maldives, though parties
 are not forbidden by law. President Gayoom said in a speech
 in July 1983 that political parties come into existence to
 protect, maintain, or obtain rights for certain ethnic groups
 or sects. As there are no religious or linguistic conflicts
 in the Maldives, he claimed, no one is deprived of his or her
 rights. Gayoom said that forming political parties would only
 be a cheap imitation of the West and inappropriate to the
 homogenous nature of Maldivian society.
 All individuals aged 21 or over may participate in the
 political process, and any qualified citizen may stand for
 election to the Majlis. Citizens choose their Majlis
 representatives by secret ballot. Of 48 members, 40 are
 elected (2 from each atoll and 2 from Male) and 8 are
 appointed by the President. The term of office for the Majlis
 is five years. There were 162 candidates for the 40 seats
 contested in the December 7 Majlis elections.
 The Majlis chooses by secret ballot, from as many candidates
 as are proposed by members of the Majlis, a single nominee for
 president. The nomination then is confirmed or rejected in a
 nationwide referendum, also by secret ballot. In 1983, the
 Majlis voted 47 to 1 to nominate Gayoom to a second, five-year
 term. Maldivians confirmed this nomination by giving Gayoom
 95.62 percent of their votes. At the time of this nomination
 and referendum, President Gayoom was long established in
 office and there was no serious competitor for the position.
 It is fair to assume that his leadership is widely accepted by
 the electorate. Some irregularities apparently occurred,
 however, during the referendum that confirmed his nomination,
 
 
 1328
 MALDIVES
 especially on outer atolls where island chiefs cast the
 ballots of all electors on their islands.
 There being no political parties, factions in the Majlis tend
 to coalesce around individuals or points of view and vary
 according to the issue. Any member may introduce legislation
 which, if it is seconded, must be considered by the Majlis.
 All laws must be approved by the Majlis or by a Citizens
 Special Majlis, such as the body which is reviewing the new
 constitution. The Majlis has the power to question ministers
 and to call for their removal. In practice, the Majlis
 generally supports the Government after carefully discussing
 and amending its proposals.
 Government control in this small, homogenous society is
 exercised by a limited group of individuals with a common
 background and outlook whose authority generally and
 traditionally is accepted by the population. Most of the
 ruling elite are from the capital, Male, and are relatively
 well educated.
 Habits of political participation and the organization of
 interest groups to pursue goals through the political process
 are not well developed. The Government has allowed the
 gradual development of democratic structures in the society,
 but these still are rudimentary.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for outside investigation of human
 rights violations in 1984. There are no local human rights
 organizations. Amnesty International did not include the
 Maldives in its 1984 annual report. Freedom House rates the
 Maldives "partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The dominant factor in economic and social life is the
 comparative isolation of Maldivians from the outside world
 and of the islands from each other.
 Maldives continues to be one of the world's least developed
 countries, with a per capita gross national product of $385 in
 1983. Calorie supply in 1977 was only 80 percent of
 requirements. Most Maldivians still work in traditional
 occupations: fishing, the largest industry involving about 46
 percent of the population; harvesting coconuts for copra and
 making rope; and some subsistence farming. The tourist and
 textile industries are providing much-needed new occupations.
 The Government is improving the standard of living, partly by
 working to increase production of traditional products such as
 fish and coconuts. It also is trying to tempt the inhabitants
 of Male to return to their native islands or atolls with
 prospects of employment and better social services there.
 Programs are under way to replace coconut trees with better
 strains, make better use of the limited arable land (only 10
 percent of total land), and to introduce vegetables in family
 gardens. There are efforts to increase the annual catch of
 fish through improved technology.
 The Government also has encouraged rapid expansion of the
 
 
 1329
 MALDIVES
 tourist industry. Until several years ago, the Government
 permitted development of tourist resorts only on islands not
 inhabited by Maldivians and around Male, where most educated,
 traveled, sophisticated Maldivians live, in part to lessen the
 impact of tourism on the conservative society of the
 Maldives. But, in the expansion of the tourist industry in
 the last several years, the Government has permitted new
 development of tourism on islands in Ari Atoll, in part to
 provide employment opportunities.
 One island, Gan, had a severe unemployment problem after the
 British closed an air base there in 1976. To provide new
 employment, the Government encouraged development of a textile
 industry with foreign investment.
 In 1984 the Government continued its programs to improve
 medical services to the people outside of Male. In addition
 to the central hospital in Male, which is fairly well
 equipped, a hospital was opened in a northern atoll and
 construction continues on two hospitals in southern atolls.
 The Government also has instituted a program to have a family
 health worker and a health center in every atoll. Three such
 centers were completed in 1984. Health care remains
 rudimentary but is improving. Life expectancy at birth is 53
 years, and infant mortality is 103 per 1,000. The population
 is 173,000 and the annual growth rate is 3.0 percent. Only 15
 percent of Maldivians (54 percent on Male) have access to
 potable water (1977 figures).
 Only 44 percent of Maldivians have completed primary
 education, and in 1984 there were not more than about 75
 college graduates in the country. The present government has
 made rapid progress in education. There is now a government
 school, with trained teachers and a broad curriculum, in every
 atoll. At present, these schools serve only the children on
 the islands where they are located. The Government's
 long-term goal is to have such schools on every inhabited
 island. The Government has built community education centers
 in every atoll. It has also established an advanced level
 secondary school and a vocational training center on Male
 Island, and plans to build vocational training centers in some
 of the outer atolls. It opened a teachers training center in
 Male in March 1984.
 The Government claims that overall literacy is 82 percent, with
 no significant difference between the rates for men and women.
 It says that rates do vary among different age groups, with
 highest literacy in the younger age groups. There are no
 universities in the Maldives. The Government seeks
 scholarships for promising students to universities in the
 Middle East, India, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
 By Islamic and Maldivian tradition, women play a lesser role
 than men in public life. No women were serving as members of
 the Majlis elected in 1980; President Gayoom appointed one.
 There are three women in the Citizens Special Majlis that is
 reviewing the proposed constitution. Women do hold
 responsible positions in the civil service and the President
 has appointed two women as aides and another to be his
 Director of Social Affairs. In 1982, President Gayoom
 appointed a National Women's Committee which is seeking ways
 to increase participation by women in the country's life. The
 Committee, which reports directly to the President, plans to
 send a sizable delegation to the World Conference on Women in
 1985.
