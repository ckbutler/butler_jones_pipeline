 BOLIVIA
 A constitutional, multiparty democracy with an elected president and bicameral
 legislature, Bolivia has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches with an
 attorney general independent of all three. The judiciary, while independent, is noto-
 riously corrupt and inefficient. The executive and legislative branches share these
 defects to some extent. Constitutional amendments to reform the political and judi-
 cial systems which were approved in August 1994 were only partially implemented
 by the end of 1995.
 The National Police have primary responsibility for internal security, although
 the army, navy, and air force can be called upon for help in critical situations. A
 special antinarcotics force (FELCN), including the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit
 (UMOPAR), is dedicated to antinarcotics enforcement. Civilian authorities maintain
 effective control of the security forces, but some members of these forces committed
 human rights abuses.
 Although rich in minerals and hydrocarbons, Bolivia has an annual per capita
 gross domestic product of about $1,000. Principal exports are minerals, natural gas,
 and other raw materials; traditional agriculture dominates the domestic economy.
 Poverty is endemic. Many Bolivians lack such basic services as water, electricity,
 sewers, and primary health care. The centralized economy has long depended heav-
 ily on foreign aid. To promote development and a transition to a market economy,
 the Government is carrying out a program of privatization, deficit reduction, to
 strengthen the banking system, and encourage increased exports and foreign invest-
 ment.
 
 
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 legal and institutional deficiencies prevented their ful protection. The Government
 launched several initiatives to improve this situation, but implementation was slow.
 The most pervasive human rights abuse continued to be prolonged incarceration of
 detainees due to antiquated procedures, inefficiency, and corruption in the judicial
 system. The Government's declaration of a state of siege in April, although per-
 mitted by the Constitution, was viewed by human rights groups and opposition poli-
 ticians as a violation of human rights. Controversy continued as to whether certain
 actions, such as temporary detentions, taken to implement the state of siege, were
 unconstitutional and constituted violations of human rights.
 There were credible reports of abuses by police, such as petty theft and extortion.
 Police remained reluctant to prosecute their own colleagues or offenses, although
 several policemen were discharged and arrested for rape and for culpable negligence
 in a prisoner's death. Investigations refuted claims by coca growers that the deaths
 of four farm workers in separate confrontations with police were extrajudicial mur-
 ders. Other problems include substandard prison conditions, violence and discrimi-
 nation against women, discrimination and abuse of indigenous people, abuse of chil-
 dren, and inhuman working conditions in the mining industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There were allegations of extrajudicial killings.
 Coca growers unions alleged that five deaths of farm workers in separate con-
 frontations with antinarcotics police in the Chapare region were extraiudicial mur-
 ders. Although some of the findings were disputed, investigations conducted by the
 executive and legislative branches indicated that two of the deaths resulted from
 justified use of defensive force by police, two were caused accidentally by other pro-
 testing farm workers, and one is still undetermined. The investigation continues. On
 July 21, a still-unidentified peasant died from shrapnel injuries sustained on July
 15 when a dynamite bomb was thrown into a police truck carrying police and
 arrestees during a large, violent confrontation over coca eradication in the Chapare.
 Police arrested several coca growers in September and charged them with having
 supplied and used the improvised bombs.
 In August a large group of armed peasants pursued an UMOPAR patrol which
 had arrested several coca growers and seized cocaine base, U.S. currency, and a
 shotgun. A second UMOPAR patrol fired warning shots, one of which-possily a
 ricochet--apparently struck and killed Juan Ortiz Dia. On August 18 UMOPAR
 officers shot and killed Jose Mejia Pisa after he had shot and seriousy wounded
 an UMOPAR member. On September 2, Roman Cresp Condori died o a gunshot
 wound sustained during a confrontation between peasants and UMOPAR forces. An
 auto psy revealed that Crspo's wound resulted from a shotgun pellet, a weapon com-
 monly used by peasants but not used by the UMOPAR. In November police shot and
 killed 13-year-old Janeth Veliz Vargas during confrontations between peasants and
 police. Both the executive branch and the Congress immediately sent investigative
 commissions to the Chapare in response to these incidents. The autopsies of Ortiz
 and Crespo were performed in the presence of nongovernmental observers. Leaders
 of the coca growers and some nongovernmental organizations disputed some of the
 findings in these cases, and the government investigations are still open; evidence
 available to date, however, refutes allegations that these deaths were extrajudicial
 killings or the results of unjustified police force.
 At the end of 1994, five police officials including a colonel were arrested and
 charged with culpable negligence in the death of a prisoner who succumbed to unno-
 ticed internal injuries shortly after his arrest.
 Former dictator General Luis Garcia Meza, convicted in absentia for political mur-
 der and other crimes committed during his 1980's regime, was extradited from
 Brazil early in the year and began serving his sentence in a maximum securitypris-
 on. The police officer accused in 1994 of murdering coca worker Felipe Perez Ortiz
 escaped from custody in September of that year and has not been recaptured.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government honors the constitutional prohibition on torture. However, there
 were widespread allegations that police used undue force in detaining labor activists
 under the state of siege and farm workers during antinarcotics operations. Although
 many clearly were politically motivated exaggerations, the similarity and volume of
 such allegations suggest that they had some basis in truth. However, no incriminat-
 ing evidence came to light, and no security personnel were charged or tried. In an
 
 
 334
 isolated case, three policemen were fired and held for trial for allegedly raping a
 juvenile prisoner.
 The Congressional Human Rights Committee issued a report in October resurrect-
 ing allegations that police officials had in past years tortured captured terrorists
 and recommending that criminal proceedings be opened against named officers. The
 report was awaiting action by the Conres at year's end.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and conditions can be life threatening for inmates with-
 out money. Ability to pay can determine cell size, visiting privileges, day-pass eligi-
 bility, and place or even length of confinement. Cell prices range from $20 to $5,000,
 pail to prior occupants or to prisoners who control cell blocks. In the poorest parts
 of La Paz' San Pedro Prison for example, inmates occupy tiny cells (3 by 4 by 6
 feet) with no ventilation, lighting, or beds. Crowding in some "low-rent" sections
 obliges inmates to sleep sitting up. Children up to 6 years old may live with an in-
 carcerated parent; an estimated 400 children do so. Authorities worked to get such
 children out of prisons, but many have nowhere else to go. The standard prison diet,
 according to a recent outside studycan cause anemia. Drugs and alcohol are readily
 available for those who can pay. There is no adequate health care within the pris-
 ons, and it is very difficult for prisoners to get permission for medical treatment out-
 side. There was at least one confirmed case in which a prisoner died while awaiting
 permission for outside emergency care. Affluent prisoners, however, can obtain
 transfers to preferred prisons for  medical" reasons. The Government permits visits
 by human rights and news media representatives.
 There were credible reports that coca growers unions used physical coercion and
 intimidation to prevent farm workers from cooperating with the Government in coca
 eradication.
 Indigenous communities in areas with little or no central government presence
 impose corporal punishment such as whipping on members who violate traditional
 laws or rures, although such punishment is forbidden by the national Constitution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exie.-Radcal labor union elements carried out
 frequent and increasingly violent demonstrations in an effort to defeat government
 privatization and educational reform programs. In response, the Government de-
 clared a 90-day state of siege on April 18. In the first 3 days of the emergency, secu-
 rity forces arrested more than 400 persons and sent over 300 of them to temporary
 confinement in military bases away from urban areas. Some detainees were released
 on April 19, and more were freed over the following 3 weeks. By May 4, all had
 been released except a handful who were being investigated for possible criminal of-
 fenses. These persons, too, were freed by mid-May. Except for a shortlived curfew
 and a ban on politically oriented gatherings, the Government imposed no extraor-
 dinary measures. When the state of siege expired, the Government renewed it for
 an additional 90 days.
 The state of sic . approved by the Congress, was a constitutional measure. There
 were complaints, however, that the detentions were not confirmed by courts within
 48 hours as the Constitution requires. Constitutional questions also arose from the
 arrest of an international group of coca advocates a few hours before the state of
 siege was formally proclaimed. These questions have not been resolved.
 Denial of justice through prolonged detention remains the most pervasive human
 rights problem. Judicial corruption, a shortage of public defenders, inadequate case-
 tracking mechanisms, and complex criminal justice procedures keep persons incar-
 cerated for months, or even years, before trial. Government and nongovernmental
 estimates agree that 85 to 90 percent of all persons in custody have yet to be sen-
 tenced. The Constitution provides for judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion. Prisoners are released if a judge rules detention illegal, but the process can
 take months. Prisoners may see a lawyer, but public defenders are overburdened.
 Bail exists, except in some drug cases, and is generally granted. Many persons, how-
 ever, cannot afford it. Persons tried under the counternarcotics law must await Su-
 preme Court confirmation or rejection of lower courts' verdicts-a process involving
 prolonged delays.
 The Government is addressing the problem of delay of justice by gradually imple-
 menting the 1994 constitutional reforms to streamline the judicial system. The 1994
 law ending imprisonment for debt has brought the release of hundreds of prisoners
 who could not afford to pay their creditors, attorneys, or court costs. At mid-year,
 the Congress a pproved five new magistrates to complete the Supreme Court bench,
 ending a periodof 18 months in which the court was not fully staffed or fully func-
 tional. The Minister of Justice introduced a draft law in the autumn congressional
 session that would permit pretrial release on personal recognizance, and provisional
 liberty for those declared innocent but awaiting review or appeal, or those already
 imprisoned longer than the maximum sentence for their alleged offense. The new
 law would also shorten the permissible time for various stages of the penal process,
 
 
 including preventive detention. Congress approved this law and it was promulgated
 February 2, 1996. The Minister of Justice proposed, and the Supreme Court ap-
 proved, pardons for 130 elderly and very young prisoners as recommended by public
 defenders.
 Children age 11 to 16 can be detained indefinitely for known or suspected of-
 fenses, or for their protection, simply on the orders of a social worker. There is no
 judicial review. It is estimated that over 700 children were detained in this manner
 in juvenile centers equivalent to jails at year's end. Within the centers, convicted
 child criminals are not segregated from children who are confined either as suspects
 or due to abandonment or by reason of mental disability. Medical care and rehabili-
 tation programs are scarce to nonexistent. The Government has acknowledged this
 problem but says that it does not have sufficient resources to correct it quickly. The
 National Agency for Minors, Women, and the Family (ONAMFA) began efforts to
 return 200 minors to their families in the hope that social workers might help to
 reintegrate them into society. In addition, ONAMFA plans to relocate juveniles who
 have no homes to private foster care or to other more appropriate centers.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent, but corruption and
 intimidation in the judicial system remain major problems. Poor pay and working
 conditions help make judges and prsecutrs susceptible to bribes. Five Supreme
 Court magistrates, including the newly elected president of the court, face investiga-
 tions and possible corruption charges. Several lower court judges, as well as some
 prosecutors, were the subjects of similar allegations during the year, resulting in
 some firings and pending legal actions.
 The judicial system has four levels: these are investigative, trial, and superior
 courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. Police present the case of an arrested
 person to a prosecutor. If the prosecutor decides to prosecute, the case is then sub-
 mitted to an investigative court which decides whether there is sufficient evidence
 to issue an indictment; if so, the case goes to a trial court. The trial court's decision
 may be appealed to superior court and, eventually, to the Supreme Court. Bail is
 usually available. Cases of persons arrested under the counterarcotics law go di-
 rectly from a special prosecuto to th  e a cor h  trial curt's decision must
 be reviewed by the district superior court which may confirm, lower, raise, or annul
 the sentence, or impose a sentence where there was none before. Both the district
 prosecutor and the defense attorney may make recommendations and comments at
 this stage. Superior court decisions in narcotics cases must be reviewed by the Su-
 preme Court whose decision is final. During this process, the accused must remain
 incarcerated, even if declared innocent by the initial trial court. There is no bail in
 narcotics cases.
 Authorities generally respect the constitutional guarantee of the right to a fair
 public trial. However, the maximum time periods permitted by law for different
 stages of the judicial process frequently are exceeded. Investigation, trial, and ap-
 peal procedures can take so long that prisoners may serve more time than the sen-
 tence for the crime with which they are charged. Defendants have the right to an
 attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal judicial decisions.
 The authorities generally honor these rights. Although the law provides for a de-
 fense attorney at public expense if needed, one is not always available. The highly
 formal and corrupt judicial system makes it difficult for poor, illiterate persons to
 have effective access to courts and legal redress.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens, and
 government authorities generally respect these provisions. There were credible alle-
 gations of UMOPAR abuses involving illegal searches and thefts of property from
 homes. However, residents in the coca growing areas generally are reluctant to file
 and pursue formal complaints, and there were no known prosecutions of UMOPAR
 officials. In August the Government and coca growers union representatives agreed
 to form a mixed commission with offices throughout the Chapare coca-growing re-
 gion, where most offenses allegedly occur. These offices would accept and pursue
 complaints of human rights abuses committed by anyone, including police, narcotics
 traffickers, or coca growers. The first such office began to function in Chimore in
 December.
 The Government respects the rights of individuals to determine family size, reli-
 gion, and political affiliations.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the fundamental
 right to express ideas and opinions freely by any means of dissemination. There are,
 therefore, no legal or institutional barriers to freedom of speech and press.
 State-owned and private radio and television stations operated freely. Newspapers
 are privately owned; most adopt antigovernment positions. Some reporters were ar-
 rested at union offices when the state of siege was declared, and others were slightly
 injured in the violent demonstrations that preceded it. Although news media por-
 trayed these incidents as targeted official interference with press freedom, they evi-
 dently were the accidental result of the journalists being in the wrong place at the
 wrong time. Those who were arrested in the union raids were released quickly once
 their media credentials were established. Injuries suffered by reporters in dem-
 onstrations were few and less severe than those suffered by some police and dem-
 onstrators in the same encounters.
 The Government respects academic freedom, and the law grants public univer-
 sities autonomous status. Some Marxist groups of teachers and students sought to
 deny academic freedom and to impose their political agenda on the education proc-
 ess. They aimed to paralyze the Government's education reform plan, which reduced
 the block revenue grants to universities and subjects teachers to academic quality
 controls by the Government and the community.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the rights
 of peaceful assembly and association, and the authorities respect them in practice.
 The Government routinely grants permits for marches and rallies and, as a rule,
 authorities try to avoid confronting demonstrators. Labor, political, and student
 gups carried out many demonstrations and rallies, often dangerously violent, in
 La Paz and other cities in the first quarter of the year. The prohibition of politically
 oriented gatherings pursuant to the state of siege was a constitutional measure. De-
 spite this general prohibition, however, authorities approved many public dem-
 onstrations including a labor federation march to celebrate May day.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism predominates, and the Constitution
 recognizes it as the official religion. However, citizens may practice the religion of
 their choice. About 400 religious groups, mostly Protestant, are active. Missionary
 groups must register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's); there was no indication that they were treated differently from other
 NGO's.. The Ministry did not disallow any registrations by missionary groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel. The law permits emigration and
 guarantees the right to return. The Government does not revoke citizenship for po-
 litical reasons. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Some refugees were accepted for resettlement. There were no reports of forced ex-
 pulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Political parties ranging from far left to moderate right function openly. The "pop-
 ular participation law  passed in April 1994 gave local communities greater influ-
 ence in government decisionmaking and control of more discretionary revenues. Its
 impact was greatest in rural areas which formerly had few or no financial resources
 and no voice in the way central government funds were spent. The Government con-
 ducted a nationwide campaign to register new voters, particularly those heretofore
 hampered by a lack of vital documentation.
 No legal impediments exist to women or indigenous people voting, holding politi-
 cal office, or rising to political leadership. Nevertheless, the number of women and
 indigenous people who have prominent positions in politics remains small, but with
 notable exceptions such as Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, an Aymara.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their indings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The Human Rights Com-
 mission of the Congress is very active and frequently criticizes the Government pub-
 licly.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, sex, language, religion,
 political or other opinion, origin, or economic or social condition. Nonetheless, there
 was significant discrimination against women, indigenous people, and the small
 black minority.
 Women.-Violence against women is pervasive. A study by the National Institute
 of Statistics covering the July 1992-June 1993 period found that 40 percent of all
 reported violent attacks in La Paz department were perpetrated against women.
 Ninety-five percent of the attackers were male; in 71 percent of the cases the
 attacker was closely related to the victim. Of these domestic violence complaints, 52
 percent involved physical mistreatment and 48 percent involved psychological abuse.
 A total of 11,069 complaints of violence against women were registered in La Paz
 during this period. The Government currently estimates that there are about
 100,000 incidents of violence against women annually nationwide and that as many
 as 95 percent of them go unpunished. The Congressional Committee on Women re-
 ported that an average of 3.5 cases of rape or statutory rape were reported each
 day for the first half of 1995 and estimated that twice that many cases were not
 The Government continued to implement a program for the protection of women.
 In 1994 the Conress adopted as national law the nter-Aerican Convention for
 the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women. In Decem-
 ber Congress passed the Law on Domestic Violence making rape a public crime. The
 Law was promulgated by year's end.
 Comprehensive legal services offices continued to be established to help and sup-
 port women. The first 15 such offices handled about 1,500 cases per month. Special
 family protection police units, staffed by 30 female officers, began operating in La
 Paz in January and responded to an average of 20 complaints per day in their first
 months. A shortage of female officers has slowed their expansion. Other steps in the
 program include revisions to school curricula and educating health care providers
 about the appropriate manner of dealing with female patients.
 Sexual harassment is not defined as a crime in the Penal Code. Individuals pros-
 ecuted for harassment must be tried under other penal provisions. A former Com-
 mander of the Navy, for example, accused of sexually harassing the wives of subor-
 dinates, was tried in a military court for abuse of authority and unethical official
 conduct. He was eventually acquitted. Two officials of a major city are under inves-
 tigation for alleged sexual harassment of a colleague. There are no statistics on the
 incidence of sexual harassment, but the problem is generally acknowledged to exist
 widely in a male-oriented society.
 Women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men. Many women
 do not know their legal rights; traditional prejudices and social conditions remain
 obstacles to advancement. Women generally earn less than men for equal work.
 Young girls often leave school to work at home or on the economy. Although not
 effectively enforced, the national labor law is over protective in some aspects, limit-
 ing women to a workday 1 hour shorter than that of men and prohibiting them from
 working at night.
 Children.-The Government is aware of the precarious situation of children and
 the need to provide legal and institutional infrastructures for their protection. How-
 ever, the Government has not given the situation sufficient political priority to en-
 sure that it will be met quickly and effectively. Government surveys suggest that
 about 1 million children (that is, about 1 child in 3) suffer physical or psychological
 abuse-13 percent of them at school, where corporal punishment and verbal abuse
 are common, and 87 percent at home. About 20 percent of all children suffer abuse
 severe enough to result in bruises, scars, or burns.
 The Government announced in August that a national network had been created
 to prevent and treat child abuse. The network comprises seven subsystems: legal,
 education, communication, family, community, information, and health. In April the
 Government approved a United Nations-supported program of night school for work-
 ing children and adolescents. The Government's child protective agency, ONAMFA,
 announced implementation of a multidisciplinary approach to treating families with
 mistreated children, beginning in October. All of these initiatives will depend on the
 continuing availability of resources to be fully effective.
 Although laws provide safeguards against children working, they are not effec-
 tively enforced, and many children (about 216,000 according to the National Insti-
 tute of Statistics) work, usually for family subsistence, in uncontrolled and some-
 times unhealthy conditions (see Section 6.d.). Statistics from the Ministry of
 Planning's Education Reform Team show that in rural areas, only 0.7 percent of
 
 
 338
 girls and 1.4 percent of boys finish high school; in urban areas, 26 percent of girls
 and 31 percent of boys do so.
 The National Institute of Statistics calculated that 47 percent of children in La
 Paz were chronically undernourished, and that 10 percent of the children migrating
 from rural areas showed evidence of acute malnutrition.
 Many children, particularly from rural areas, lack the birth certificates and iden-
 tity documents they need to secure society's benefits and protections. There were
 credible allegations that as many as 200 juveniles, for instance, were incarcerated
 as adults in the San Pedro jail for want of reliable civil documents proving their
 ages. The 1994 Education Reform Act sought to better the situation of children;
 even optimistic observers, however, noted it will take years for it to have an impact.
 The Minors Code promulgated in 1992 has proven inadequate, and the Government
 is working with interested NGO's on a revised Code to be considered in the 1995-
 96 congressional session. A revised labor law now in preparation would give the
 Government a stronger juridical framework in which to deal efrectively with child
 labor.
 The old practice of "criadito" service still persists in some parts of Bolivia.
 Criaditos are indigenous children of both sexes, usually 10 to 12 years old, whom
 their parents indenture to middle- and upper-class families to perform household
 work in exchange for education, clothing, room, and board. There are no controls
 over the benefits to, or treatment of, such children, who may become virtual slaves
 for the years of their indenture.
 People With Disabilities.-In December the Congress passed a law on disabilities
 drafted by the Senate Commission on Social Development and interested NGO's.
 The law guarantees equal employment and social rights to the disabled, provides
 incentives to employers, and requires national and local governmental agencies to
 strengthen or create units charged with responsibility for the disabled. The new
 electoral law made arrangements for blind voters. In general, however, there are no
 special services or infrastructure to accommodate people with disabilities. Social at-
 titudes have kept many disabled persons at home from an early age, limiting their
 integration into society.
 According to the director of the National Institute of Child Development, 96,000
 children have mental disabilities, 37,000 have physical disabilities, 4,000 have hear-
 ing impairments, and 2,500 have visual impairments. Because of scarce resources,
 only about 400 of these children were treated in government facilities.
 Indigenous People.-Discrimination against, and abuses of, indigenous people con-
 tinued. The Indian majority generally remains at the low end of the socioeconomic
 scale, facing severe disadvantages in health, life expectancy, education, income, lit-
 eracy, and employment. Lack of education, inefficient farnng and mining methods,
 indigenous cultural practices, inability to speak Spanish, and societal biases keep
 the indigenous people poor. They continued to be exploited in the workplace. Some
 rural indigenous workers are kept in a state of virtual slavery by employers who
 charge them more for room and board than they earn.
 The Government prepared a decree to make rural agricultural workers subject to
 the labor law to afford them better protection. Indigenous peoples complain that
 their territories are not legally defined and protected, and that their resources are
 exploited by outsiders. Specific offenders allegedly are coca growers and timber pi-
 rates.
 Indigenous groups have taken advantage of the Popular Participation Law to form
 municipalities that will offer them greater opportunities for self-determination. By
 the end of the year, they had established six municipalities. In August the Govern-
 ment formed a "National Committee for the International Decade of Indigenous Peo-
 ples" to plan evaluate, coordinate and publicize programs to increase self-deter-
 mination, and to set goals and objectives.
 At the end of 1994, the first 100 children graduated from a pilot program of bilin-
 gual education in Aymara, Quechua, or Guarani and Spanish. The President has
 stated his firm commitment to teaching all children in both their native language
 and Spanish. A lack of personnel qualified to teach in the indigenous languages in-
 hibits the expansion of this program.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may form and join organizations of their
 choosing. The Labor Code requires prior government authorization to establish a
 union, permits only one per enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve
 unions; however, the Government has not enforced these provisions in recent years.
 While the Code denies civil servants the right to organize and bans strikes in public
 services, including banks and public markets, nearly all civilian government work-
 ers are unionized. Workers are not penalized for union activities. In theory, the Bo-
 
 
 livian Labor Federation (COB) represents virtually the entire work force; however,
 only about one-half of the workers in the formal economy actually belong to labor
 unions. Some members of the informal economy also participate in labor organiza-
 tions. Workers in the private sector frequently exercise the right to strike. Solidarity
 strikes are illegal, but the Government has not prosecuted those responsible nor im-
 posed penalties.
 Significant strikes centered around annual negotiations over salaries and benefits
 for public employees. However, their real targets were the Government's economic
 and social reform programs. Most strikes were conducted and led by the militant
 Trotskyite element of the Urban Teachers Union. Other major disturbances occurred
 in the Chapare region where the coca growers unions opposed government eradi-
 cation efforts. Strikers and demonstrators marched, set up roadblocks, and used im-
 provised weapons including dynamite bombs against police and property. Normal
 activity in major cities was frequently paralyzed by rioting unionists until the Gov-
 ernment imposed a state of siege in April.
 Unions are not free from influence by political parties. Most parties have labor
 committees that try to influence union activity, causing fierce political battles within
 unions. Most also have party activists in the unions. The law allows unions to join
 international labor organizations. The COB became an affiliate of the communist,
 formerly Soviet-dominated, World Federation of Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers may organize and
 bargain collectively. In practice, collective bargaining, defined as voluntary direct
 negotiations between unions and employers without participation of the Govern-
 ment, is limited. Consultations between government representatives and labor lead-
 ers are common, but there are no collective bargaining agreements as defined above.
 In state industries, the union issues a list of demands and the Government concedes
 some points. Private employers often use public sector settlements as guidelines for
 their own adjustments, an some private employers exceed the Government settle-
 ments. The Government, conscious of International Monetary Fund guidelines, rare-
 ly grants wage increases exceeding inflation.
 The law prohibits discrimination against union members and organizers. Com-
 plaints go to the National Labor Court, which can take a year or more to rule. The
 court has ruled in favor of discharged workers in some cases and successfully re-
 quired their reinstatement. However, union leaders say problems are often moot by
 the time the court rules.
 Labor law and practice in the seven special duty-free zones are the same as in
 the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. However, the practice of criadito service and agricultural servitude
 by indigenous workers (see Section 5) constitute violations as do some individual
 cases of household workers effectively imprisoned by their employers.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. The Labor
 Code is ambiguous on conditions of employment for minors age 14 to 17, and per-
 mits apprenticeship for those 12 to 14 years old. This practice has been criticized
 by the International Labor Organization, and the Government is preparing legisla-
 tion reforming this and other provisions of the Labor Code.
 Responsibility for enforcing child labor provisions resides in the Labor Ministry,
 but it generally does not enforce provisions about employment of children. Although
 the law requires all children to complete at least 5 years of primary school, the re-
 quirement is poorly enforced particularly in rural areas. Urban children hawk
 goods, shine shoes, and assist transport operators. Rural children often work with
 parents from an early age. Children are not generally employed in factories or for-
 mal businesses but, when employed, often work the same hours as adults.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In conformity with the law, the minimum wage
 is subject to annual renegotiation and was adjusted in May to approximately $42
 (200 bolivianos) per month plus bonuses and fringe benefits. The minimum wage
 does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, and most
 workers earn more. Although the minimum wage falls below prevailing wages in
 most jobs, certain fringe benefits are pegged to it. The minimum wage does not
 cover about 20 percent of urban workers-vendors and shoe polishers, for example-
 nor does it cover farmers, some 30 percent of the working population.
 Only half the urban labor force enjoys an 8-hour workday and a workweek of 5
 or 5% days because the maximum workweek of 44 hours is not enforced. The Labor
 Ministry's bureau of Occupational Safety has responsibility for protection of work-
 ers' health and safety, but relevant standards are poorly enforced. Working condi-
 tions in the mining sector are particularly bad. Although the State Mining Corpora-
 tion has an office responsible for safety, many mines, often old and using antiquated

 equipment are dangerous and unhealthy. In some cooperative mines, miners earn
 less than $3 per 12-hour day. They work without helmets, boots, or respirators in
 mines where toxic gases abound; they buy their own supplies including dynamite,
 have no scheduled rest periods, and must survive underground from 24 to 72 hours
 continuously with little water and food. There are no special provisions in law defin-
 ing when workers may remove themselves from dangerous situations. Unless the
 work contract covers this area, any worker who refuses to work based on the indi-
 vidual's judgment of excessively dangerous conditions may face dismissal.
