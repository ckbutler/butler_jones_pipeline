 BAHRAIN
 The extended family of the Al Khalifa has ruled the State of
 Bahrain since the late 18th century and dominates Bahrain's
 society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir as
 hereditary ruler. He governs Bahrain with the assistance of
 his brother, the Prime Minister, and an appointed cabinet of
 ministers. The Government has suspended some provisions of
 Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles relating
 to the National Assembly which the Government disbanded in
 1975. In practice, there are few judicial checks on the
 authorities.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security,
 and has a large and effective police force at its disposal.
 Bahrain's leadership seeks to foster the open social and
 commercial environment needed to attract international
 business, while protecting the ruling family's preeminence,
 preventing sectarian violence, and thwarting externally
 inspired subversion. Bahrainis are divided between the Shi'a
 and Sunni sects of Islam. Unofficial estimates indicate that
 over two-thirds of the population is Shi'a. The ruling family
 is Sunni, and the Sunni community tends to be wealthier and
 more influential than the Shi'a, although there are conspicuous
 exceptions. While extreme poverty is rare and the Government
 attempts to assure full employment, the Shi'a as a group are
 disadvantaged, a situation which adds to the potential for
 externally inspired subversion. Two clandestine political
 groups with links to Iran have drawn support from some Shi'a,
 and two underground, secular leftist groups advocate violent
 political change.
 The human rights situation was unchanged in 1987. Civil
 liberties remain restricted and reports of serious abuses
 continued, as did arrests for antiregime political activities
 RESPECT FOR HU4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and discouraged by the Government.
 However, persons suspected of security offenses have in the
 past suffered physical abuse during periods of detention or
 arrest. It is not known what happens during detention in
 security prisons (where questioning may continue after
 sentencing) since visits by nongovernment persons are
 generally prohibited. Medical examinations by nonprison
 doctors have also been denied.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, Amnesty International
 reported that it had repeatedly expressed concern to the
 Government over reports of torture and mistreatment of
 political prisoners and detainees. Specific concerns included

 BAHRAIN
 the death in custody of Radhi Mahdi Ibrahim who reportedly
 died in prison as a result of torture or ill-treatment and
 inefficient medical care; the death in Al Qala prison in
 Manama of Dr. Hashim Ismail Al Alawi, reportedly from torture;
 the reported torture in Al Qala prison of five men held
 incommunicado in 1985. The five reportedly were convicted of
 membership in an illegal organization based solely on
 confessions obtained through torture. The report noted that,
 as in previous years, torture and ill-treatment apparently
 occurred primarily during the period immediately after unrest
 when detainees were held incommunicado.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Political activity is strictly controlled by the security
 forces, and persons are sometimes detained arbitrarily on
 suspicion of antiregime activity. Activities that could lead,
 under provisions of the security law, to questioning, warnings,
 or arrest include membership in subversive, illegal
 organizations, painting antiregime slogans on walls, joining
 antigovernment demonstrations, processing or circulating
 antiregime writings, preaching sermons with a radical
 political tone, or harboring or associating with persons
 committing such acts. In the past, detainees have sometimes
 been held incommunicado for lengthy periods, although family
 members can usually learn of a detainee's whereabouts.
 In its 1987 Report, Amnesty International expressed its
 concern about the pretrial detention without charge of
 political opponents of the Government.
 The Government prohibits the use of forced or compulsory
 labor, and it is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person arrested may be tried in either a civil court or the
 Security Court. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees,
 including open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid
 available to indigents), and the right to appeal. Security
 cases, however, are tried directly by the Supreme Court of
 Appeal, sitting as the Security Court. Trials are held in
 secret, there is no right to judicial review of the legality
 of arrests, and the Court is exempted from adhering to the
 procedural guarantees of the penal code. Sentences imposed by
 the Security Court can, at the discretion of the Court, be
 referred to the Amir for clemency, a procedure not customarily
 followed in civil court cases- The Bahrain Defense Force
 maintains a separate court system for military personnel
 accused of offenses under the military code. This court does
 not review cases involving civilian criminal or security
 offenses. Reliable estimates indicate that 50 to 100 persons
 are now being held for political reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry can authorize entry into private
 premises without judicial authorization. Telephone calls and
 correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer
 networks exist.

 BAHRAIN
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution assures the right "to express and propagate
 opinions," but in practice Bahrainis cannot freely challenge
 the legitimacy of the regime ih speech or writing. Political
 meetings are not permitted; gatherings which might take on a
 political tone are monitored through informers. Criticism of
 government policies and programs in such areas as municipal
 services and education is tolerated and commonly seen in the
 press.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media, *nd the press generally follows official policy closely.
 In the past, minor deviations have forced the closure of the
 offending newspapers.  There have been no closures since 1980,
 primarily-because editors fully understand the limits of
 government tolerance. Publication of a weekly newsmagazine
 was suspended temporarily in 1987 because of its publication
 of reports criticizing the Government's unemployment policies.
 In 1987 the Government expelled a United Press International
 correspondent'as a result of his refusal to comply with the
 conditions of his journalist visa. Bahrain is generally open
 to international media, .but the Government discourages
 unfavorable coverage of its domestic affairs. The State owns
 all radio and television stations. All newspapers are
 privately owned but subject to government censorship. A
 former Information Ministry official serves as the editor of
 the only Arabic-language daily paper, which is regarded as
 semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations or meetings are prohibited in
 Bahrain, although Bahrain's Constitution affirms the right of
 free assembly.
 A number.of professional organizations exist, including groups
 of lawyers, physicians, engineers, and businessmen. The large
 number of social and sports clubs have traditionally served as
 forums for discreet political discussion. The Government
 monitors the activities of these organizations, which are
 generally small and limited in scope. Permits must be
 obtained for meetings in public places.
 The Constitution recognizes the right of workers to organize.
 While trade unions are illegal, the Government has encouraged--
 and controlled--the formation of elected workers' committees
 in major companies. Workers' representatives are empowered to
 discuss wagesnd working conditions with management, but not
 to engage in(collective bargaining, and there is no right to
 strike. These committees now represent over 10 percent of the
 work force. The workers' committees choose members of a
 national committee. This body represents Bahrain in
 internatioial labor organizations. Expatriate workers, about
 60 percent of the work force, are denied these limited trade
 union rights.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The native population is overwhelmingly Muslim and, Islam is
 the state religion, but expatriate Christians (7 percent of
 the population) maintain places of worship and enjoy
 considerable freedom to practice their religion. Christian
 
 
 1111
 BAHRAIN
 publications are readily available in bookstores, but
 proselytizing is not permitted.
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims enjoy a
 more favored status among Bahrainis than the Shi'a, who form
 approximately two-thirds of the population. Sunnis are given
 preference for employment in sensitive positions, including in
 the defense force and the managerial ranks of the public and
 private sectors. Nearly half of the cabinet ministers,
 however, are Shi'a, although they do not hold key portfolios.
 Both Sunni and Shi'a religious assemblies are subject to
 government control and monitoring, but there is no
 interference with routine worship or religious activities.
 Public religious events, most notably commemorative marches by
 members of the Shi'a community, are permitted but remain
 closely watched by the police. There are restrictions on the
 number of Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a
 holy sites in Iran.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. Passports can be denied on
 political grounds. Some persons living abroad and suspected
 of political offenses may face imprisonment without public
 trial upon return to Bahrain. Refugees are not repatriated to
 countries they have fled, but are obliged to depart Bahrain
 immediately. There are some Iranian emigres who have fled
 Iran since 1979 and have been permitted to remain in Bahrain,
 but they have not been granted citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bahrai- has no formal democratic institutions. Consequently,
 most of its citizens do not have a say in the choice of
 leaders or in changing the political system. Bahrain is ruled
 by the Al Khalifa family, headed by the Amir. All Government
 positions are appointive. The average Bahraini influences
 government decisions only through the submission of written
 petitions and informal contact with senior officials,
 including through attendance at the Amir's regular public
 audiences. Neither political parties nor opposition
 organizations are permitted.
 There are four clandestine political groups that advocate
 violent revolution. The Islamic Front for the Liberation of
 Bahrain, the group responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, and
 the Islamic Call Party have ties to Iran and attract Shi'a
 support. Both call for the establishment of an Islamic
 republic. Two underground leftist groups, the Popular Front
 for the Liberation of Bahrain and the National Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain, have ties with radical Arab regimes and
 the Soviet Union.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations exist. Representatives
 of Amnesty International visited Bahrain in 1987 and were
 received at high levels within the Government. They were
 permitted to observe a trial before-the Supreme Civil Court of
 Appeal which was hearing the case of 18 individuals charged
 
 
 1112
 BAHRAIN
 with offenses relating to membership in, and activities for,
 the banned Bahrain National Liberation Front. Amnesty
 International did not issue a public statement during its
 visit to Bahrain. Its 1987 Report noted that it had repeatedly
 expressed its concern to and requested information from the
 Government, including a letter in August 1986 to the Minister
 of the Interior. The Government has not responded to these
 requests.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Bahrain's Shi'a, as a group, suffer from economic
 discrimination. Statistics are unavailable, but Shi'a tend to
 be employed in lower-paid, lesser-skilled jobs than Sunni
 workers. Social and municipal services in most Shi'a.
 neighborhoods, particularly rural villages, are markedly
 inferior to those found in Sunni communities. The Government
 has tried to remedy social discrimination, improve Shi'a
 living conditions, and encourage sectarian integration through
 the development of government-subsidized housing complexes,
 open to all Bahrainis on the basis of financial need.
 Many legal rights-of concern to women are subject to Islamic
 law. Specific rights-vary according to Shi'a or Sunni
 precedent, as determined by the individual's profession of
 faith. In general, women have rights to their own property,
 but daughters receive less inheritance than sons, and a widow
 must share her husband's estate with her children. Although a
 wife may divorce, she must specify grounds. Women must obtain
 the permission of the male head of the household to obtain a
 passport. With the development of the Bahrain economy, women
 have increasingly taken on jobs previously reserved-for men.
 Women constitute about 18 percent of the Bahraini work force.
 The Government has encouraged the trend toward equality, has
 enacted special laws to promote female entry into the work
 force, and is itself a leading employer of women. Most of
 their positions are clerical, but women hold some senior-level
 jobs. The labor law grants women 60 days of paid maternity
 leave, and nursing periods during the day. The status of
 women is a continuing subject of debate. Many women have
 traditional views of Islam and voluntarily adopt socially
 conservative roles.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Bahrain's labor law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs, provides for acceptable conditions of work for
 all adult workers, including adequate standards regarding
 minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health. In practice, however, expatriate workers (60 percent
 of the work force) are seriously disadvantaged by the
 requirement that all foreigners must be sponsored by Bahrainis
 in order to work. Under this system, sponsors can cancel the
 residence ?ermit of any person under their.sponsorship and
 blacklist individuals so that they cannot obtain entry or
 residencq visas from another sponsor. Such power contains the
 inherent potential for exploitation, and foreign workers are
 often unwilling to report abuses for fear of forced
 repatriation. Bahrain's labor law does not recognize the
 concept of equal pay for equal work. Asian workers are often
 paid less than Bahrainis or Westerners with the same
 qualifications, and women are generally paid less than men.

 BAHRAIN
 The minimum age for employment in Bahrain is 14 years.
 Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 receive special
 protection under the labor laws. They may not be employed in
 hazardous conditions or at night, and may not work over 6 hours
 per day or on a piecework basis. Employers are compelled to
 abide by juvenile labor laws largely through the threat of
 court action. Labor officers from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs conduct inspections and investigations both at
 random and in response to allegations of abuse. The Ministry
 is empowered to demand that an employer appear in its offices
 to answer any allegations. If the employer refuses to appear
 or to follow Ministry recommendations, the case is forwarded
 to the civil courts. If necessary, the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs will act as an attorney on behalf of a juvenile.
 Most observers agree that violations of the juvenile labor
 codes are rare.
