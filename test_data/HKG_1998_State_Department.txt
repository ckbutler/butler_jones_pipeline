 HONG KONG
 Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. As a
 Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, it enjoys a high de-
 gree of autonomy except in defense and foreign affairs and remains a free society
 with legally protected rights. The Basic Law, approved in 1990 by China's National
 People's Congress, provides for fundamental rights and serves as a "mini-constitu-
 tion." A chief executive, selected by a 400-person selection committee chosen by a
 China-appointed preparatory committee, wields executive power. A legislature com-
 posed of directly and indirectly elected members was sworn in on July 1. Upon re-
 version, China, which had objected to the electoral rules instituted by the British
 colonial government, dissolved Hong Kong's first fully elected Legislative Council.
 A 60-member Provisional Legislature, chosen by the selection committee that named
 the Chief Executive, took office on July 1, 1997. Critics contended that the selection
 of the Provisional Legislature had no basis in law and was designed to exclude
 groups or individuals critical of China. On July 1, a Legislative Council elected on
 May 24 replaced the Provisional Legislature. Twenty seats were elected on a geo-
 graphic basis through universal suffrage, 30 seats through functional (occupational)
 constituencies, and 10 seats through indirect election. Despite complaints that the
 election laws favored pro-China candidates in the geographical constituencies and
 
 
 876
 severely limited the franchise in the functional constituencies (the number of voters
 in the functional constituencies was reduced, from 2.5 million to 147,000), no parties
 boycotted the elections. The 53 percent voter turnout was the highest in Hong
 Kong's history. The parties and independents in the prodemocracy camp won 14 of
 the 20 seats elected on a geographic basis. The power of the legislature and of indi-
 vidual legislators is 'substantially curtailed'by restrictions on the legislation that
 members may introduce and by a requirement for majorities among members elect-
 ed from both geographic and functional constituencies. The judiciary is independent.
 A well-organized police force maintains public order under the firm control of ci-
 vilian authorities. The 4,000 Chinese troops sent to Hong Kong to replace the Brit-
 ish military garrison have maintained a low profile and did not perform police func-
 tions. There were reports that some members of the police committed human rights
 abuses.
 Hong Kong is a major regional and international trade and finance center. It is
 a principal gateway for trade and investment witth China. A thriving free market
 economy operates with little government interference (a system provided for by the
 Basic Law for 50 years). The global economic crisis had a significant impact on the
 economy; per capita gross domestic product dropped from $26000 in 1997 to just
 over $25,000 in 1998. Despite this, the Government has resisted calls for a change
 in the territory's free market system.  -I
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, however,
 human rights problems that existed both before and after the reversion to China
 included: Some degree of media self-censorship; limitations on citizens' ability to
 change their government and limitations on the power of the legislature to affect
 government policies; some limits on freedom of movement; violence and discrimina-
 tion against women; and discrimination against the disabled and ethnic minorities.
 Human rights groups' concerns that revisions to the Public Order and the Societies
 Ordinances would undermine fundamental human rights thus far have proved un-
 founded.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person; Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There were four instances of death of detainees in police custody in the first 9
 months of the year. The police coroner's office is investigating these deaths.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other abuse by the police, however, there were reports
 that police at times used excessive force against persons in custody. The law stipu-
 lates punishment for those who break these prohibitions, and disciplinary action can
 range from warnings to dismissal. Criminal proceedings may be undertaken inde-
 pendently of the disciplinary process. Allegations of excessive use of force are inves-
 tigated by the Complaints against Police Office, whose work is monitored and re-
 viewed by the independent Police Complaints Council, a body composed of public
 members appointed by the Chief Executive.
 Although excessive use of force by police is not widespread, there are occasional
 complaints of force being used during interrogations to coerce information or confes-
 sions. In April four police officers were found guilty of assaulting a suspect to force
 a confession and sentenced to prison terms of between 4 and 6 months. They beat
 a suspected drug dealer and poured water in his ears and nose. In the first 9
 months of the year, the Complaints Council received 647 complaints of assault. Of
 the 154 cases examined by the Council, 118 were withdrawn by the complainants,
 and 31 were deemed "not pursuable." Only five complaints were investigated, of
 which three were found to be false and two unsubstantiated. Human rights groups
 have called repeatedly for a more independent monitoring body noting long delays
 in hearing some allegations, the contrast between the relatively large number of
 complaints and the few that are substantiated, and the unwillingness of witnesses
 to substantiate complaints to the police due to fear of retribution.
 Although conditions vary among facilities, prisons conform to international stand-
 ards.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors. Local justices
 of the peace regularly inspect prisons, but these visits rarely are unannounced and
 justices of the peace speak with prisoners in the presence of Correctional Service
 Department staff. The Correctional Services Departmenfs August ruling that prison
 officers' use of force in breaking up fighting between inmates in July was justified
 
 
 877
 rompted widespread criticism and calls for the establishment of an independent
 oard to monitor prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Common law, precedents previously in
 force, and the Basic Law (which incorporates the International Convention on Civil
 and Political Rights) provide substantial and effective legal protections against arbi-
 trary arrest or detention. Suspects must be charged within 48 hours or released.
 The average length of preconviction incarceration does not exceed 80 days.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-Hng Kong's independent judiciary has endured
 since the handover, underpinned by the Basic Laws provision that Hong Kong's
 common law tradition be maintained. According to the Basic Law, the courts may
 rule on matters that are the "responsibility of the Central People's Government or
 concern the relationship between the central authorities and the (Special Adminis-
 trative) Region," but before making their final judgments (which are not appeal-
 able), the courts must seek an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the
 Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. When the Standing Commit-
 tee makes an interpretation of the provisions concerned, the courts, in applying
 those provisions, "shall follow the interpretation of the Standing Committee." The
 Nat onal People's Congress vehicle for interpretation is its Committee for the Basic
 Law, composed of six mainland and six Hong Kong members. The Hong Kong mem-
 bers are nominated by the Chief Executive, the President of the Legislative Counil
 and the Chief Justice. Human rights and lawyers' organizations have expressed con-
 cern that, if broadly applied and loosely interpreted, these exceptions to the Court
 of Final Appeal's power of final jurisdiction could be used to limit the independence
 of the judiciary. However no such limitations have occurred and no issues thus far
 have been referred to the Basic Law Committee.
 The Court of Final Appeal is Hong Kong's supreme judicial body. An independent
 commission nominates judges; the Chef Executive is required to appoint those nom-
 inated, subject to endorsement by the legislature. Nomination procedures ensure
 that commission members nominated by the private bar have a virtual veto on the
 nominations. The Basic Law provides that, with the exception of the Chief Justice
 and the Chief Judge of the High Court who may not have right of abode outside
 of Hong Kong, foreigners may serve on Hong Kong's courts. More than 40 percent
 of Hong Kong's judges come from other Commonwealth countries. Judges have secu-
 rity of tenure until retirement age (either 60 or 65, depending on date of appoint-
 ment).
 Beneath the Court of Final Appeal is the High Court, composed of the Court of
 Appeal and the Court of First Instance. Lower judicial bodies include the District
 Court (which has limited jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters), the Magistracy
 (exercising jurisdiction over a wide range of criminal offenses), the Coroner's Court,
 the Juvenile Court, the Lands Tribunal, the Labor Tribunal, the Small Claims Tri-
 bunal, and the Obscene Articles Tribunal.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and this is respected in prac-
 tice. Criticism foliowed the revelation in March that some juvenile courts did not
 allow public access, but the courts clarified that courts should only be closed in ex-
 ceptional circumstances when it was necessary to protect the identity of juvenile de-
 fendants. Trials are by jury, and the judiciary provides citizens with a fair and effi-
 cient judicial process.
 Although the judiciary remains independent, human rights activists are concerned
 that the legal system may favor those closely aligned with China or powerful local
 institutions. These concerns were heightened when the Government decided not to
 prosecute the New China News Agency for alleged violations of the Privacy Ordi-
 nance (see Section l.f.) and in March declined to prosecute a prominent newspaper
 editor accused of fraud. In April there was much controversy after the Provisional
 tovegilte hastl pawss the Aridapt aiono Laws (inttie PSmlCis    ri-

 Hong Kong Government did not vigorously assert its jurisdiction or attempt to pro-
 tect the rights of its residents arrested in the mainland. China's assertion of
 extraterritorial jurisdiction in the arrest of a mainland citizen in China for murders
 committed in Hong Kong also has been controversial. Talks on a rendition agree-
 ment between Hong Kong and China, which may help alleviate some of these juris-
 dictional problems, are ongoing. Since 1992 128 fugitives have been returned to
 Hong Kong from China through an administrative arrangement; none have been re-
 turned to China from Hong Kong.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right of privacy, and the Government generally respects this right
 in practice. The Interception of Telecommunications Ordinance, passed by the Legis-
 lative Council in June 1997, requires the security forces to obtain a warrant from
 the High Court for a wiretap or mail interception. However, because the law speci-
 fies that the Government must name an effective date for the change, it has never
 been implemented. Responding to Legislative Council questioning on September 30,
 the Secretary for Security refused to reveal the number of government wiretaps.
 For more than 20 years, the Independent Commission Against Corruption was
 vested with powers, including the right to authorize searches and detain suspects,
 that are normally exercised only by a judicial officer. Amendments to ordinances
 governing the Commission took effect in June 1997, depriving the Commission of
 the independent authority to issue arrest or search warrants. However, the Commis-
 sion still does not apply the presumption of innocence in corruption cases, and crimi-
 nal convictions are obtained by regarding any excessive, unexplained assets held by
 civil servants as ili-gotten until proven otherwise.
 In 1996 the Government established the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for
 Personal Data (PCO) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance to prevent mis-
 use and disclosure of data such as medical and credit records. The ordinance also
 prohibits matching sets of personal data without the consent of the subject individ-
 ual or the commissioner, although some government departments were exempted in
 order to combat social welfare abuse and tax evasion. In the first 8 months of the
 year, the PCO received 225 complaints. In 1997 the PCO investigated 162 com-
 plaints; 8 were found to be in contravention of data protection principles and 7 were
 found to be in contravention of provisions in the Privacy Ordinance. The PCO issued
 17 warning notices and 2 enforcement notices. In June a code of practice on the use
 of personal identity numbers and identity card copies went into effect.
 There was public criticism in February when the Government decided not to pros-
 ecute the New China New Agency for failing to respond within the ordinance-speci-
 fied time frame to a legislator's request for information about her in the Agency's
 files. The legislator filed a civil suit to obtain the information (see Section I.e.). In
 June an intern who revealed the medical records of the Secretary for Justice to the
 press was convicted of violating the Privacy Ordinance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law provides for freedom of speech,
 of the press, and of publication, and there was no apparent change in the tradition
 of respect for these freedoms after reversion; however, some journalists continued
 to practice a degree of self-censorship. Overall, the media has been outspoken in de-
 fending civil liberties. Reporting on the May elections generally was regarded as fair
 and balanced. However, the Basic Law also directs Hong Kong to pass laws prohibit-
 ing "treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Govern-
 ment, or theft of state secrets" (see Section 2.b.). The Interception of Communica-
 tions Ordinance, passed by the Legislative Council in June 1997, nullified Section
 33 of the Telecommunications Ordinance, which granted the Government wide-rang-
 ing powers to ban messages. However, this provision was never implemented, be-
 cause the Government has not named a date for the changes to take effect. The
 Public Order Ordinance enables the Government to ban a demonstration on national
 security grounds, including as a factor whether it advocates independence for Tibet
 or Taiwan. In practice, this situation has not arisen and no applications for permits
 to demonstrate have been denied (see Section 2.b.).
 Newspapers publish a wide variety of opinions. After July 1, 1997, there was nei-
 ther a sharp increase nor decrease in coverage critical of China, but there were
 many more reports critical of the Hong Kong Government than there were before
 the reversion. People speak freely to the media. Political debate is vigorous, and nu-
 merous viewpoints, including stories and opinions critical of the Hong Kong and
 Chinese Governments and statements by leading Chinese dissidents, are provided
 in the mass media, in public forums, and by political groups. International media
 organizations operate freely. Sixteen major daily newspapers, 2 commercial tele-
 
 
 879
 vision stations, and 2 commercial radio stations function with virtually no govern-
 ment control. The media were heavily affected by the Asian financial economic crisis
 and 400 journalists lost their jobs during the year.
 Foreign reporters need no special visas or government-issued press cards. Many
 local reporters continue to enter China to cover sensitive stories related to Hong
 Kong, Taiwan, or the mainland. China still requires journalists-both foreign and
 local-to apply for permission to make reporting trips to the mainland. Those who
 bypass official channels-which many feel they must do to get the stories they
 want-risk violating Chinese regulations. At least one publication whose owner of-
 fended China's leadership several years ago subsequently has been unable to get of-
 ficial permission for its reporters to cover events on the mainland.
 There is a widespread impression among both journalists and the public that it
 is prudent to engage in a degree of self-censorship. The pressures on journalists are
 subtle-there are no direct orders to refrain from writing, but there is a wide per-
 ception of a need for special care toward topics of particular sensitivity to China:
 Leadership dynamics, military activity, or Taiwanese or Tibetan independence, al-
 though numerous articles on these topics continue to appear. Chinese-language jour-
 nalists report a pervasive, if tacit, understanding that editors expect those reporting
 on China to be particularly certain of their facts and careful in their wording. An-
 other source of pressure comes from the belief by some publishers and editors that
 advertising revenues or their business interests in China could suffer if they were
 seen to be too antagonistic to China or powerful local interests. For example, jour-
 nalists have been told by their boards of directors not to publish stories about a
 prominent local businessman's property development project in Beijing. Journalists'
 associations also cite the Chinese Television Network s refusal to broadcast a docu-
 mentary ("Cry Wolf') dealing with Xinjiang separatist movements as an example of
 self-censorship.
 In March a Hong Kong member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Conference, speaking in Beijing, attacked the government-owned Radio Television
 Hong Kong (RTHK) for producing programs critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese
 Governments. When asked by journalists for a comment, the Chief Executive's im-
 promptu response was to suggest that a review of the station's role might be nec-
 essary, saying, "while freedom of speech is important, it is also important for gov-
 ernment policies to bepositively presented." However, the Chief Executive and the
 Chief Secretary, as wel as senior Chinese leaders, later reiterated their support for
 Hong Kong's freedom of the press. There was also a grundswell of support for
 RTKR's editorial independence. In April a Chinese diplomat in France warned a
 Hong Kong journalist to stop asking sensitive questions of visiting Chinese Premier
 Zhu Rongi. The warning sparked protests in Hong Kong, and Zhu later publicly rep-
 rimanded the diplomat. In September RTHK issued guidelines, which stressed that
 its editorial policy should be independent.
 In May two persons were convicted under the National Flag and National Em-
 blem Ordinance and the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance of defacing
 the Hong Kong and Chinese flags during a peaceful protest in January. The ordi-
 nances were passed by the Provisional Legislature before reversion and enacted in
 July 1997.
 In June the High Court found the editor-in-chief of a Chinese-language newspaper
 guilty of contempt of court for "scurrilous and racial" attacks against top judges and
 for ordering a 3-day "paparazzi-style" surveillance of a judge. Most observers, in-
 cluding the Hong Kong Journalists' Association, commented that the paper had
 breached professional ethics.
 Although former Governor Christopher Pattens account of the prehandover nego-
 tiations and reforms was widely available throughout Hong Kong, the refusal of
 some bookstores to carry the book was cited by human rights groups as an example
 of commercial self-censorship. Films critical of China, such as "Kundun" and "Red
 Corner," were released.
 In 1996 a code on access to information governing the provision of information by
 government agencies was extended to the entire Government. The code requires
 government departments to release information to the public unless there is a valid
 reason to withhold it. A department may withhold "sensitive" information in such
 areas as defense, security, external affairs, or law enforcement. Guidelines for access
 to information are provided to the public on an Internet web page.
 The Government respects academic freedom. There is a wide range of opinions in
 lively debate on campuses. The issue of academic freedom generally has not caused
 much public comment, but there has been some debate over university management
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is prac-
 ticed without significant hindrance. Article 23 of the Basic Law provides that Hong
 
 
 880
 Kong shall enact laws to prohibit subversion, secession, treason, and sedition
 against the Chinese ,Government. The process of developing this legislation contin-
 ues at a very deliberate pace, with no indication of when such laws may be enacted.
 Amendments to the Crime Ordinance, passed by the Legislative Council in June
 1997, narrowed the definition of treason and sedition to include a "proven intention
 of causing violence or creating public disorder or a public disturbance." However,
 since the amendments stipulate that the Government must name the date when the
 change is to take effect, the Government has chosen not to enact the amendments
 until comprehensive legislation dealing with all the "Article 23 crimes" is developed.
 In the interim, preexisting provisions in the Crime Ordinance dealing with treason
 and sedition continue to a p1l.
 A revised Public Order Ordinance, passed by the Provisional Legislature that took
 effect on July , 1997, reintroduced licensing for demonstrations (applications must
 be made at least 48 hours prior to a demonstration) and empowered the police to
 raise objections on national security grounds. Iri practice, however, the police have
 not denied any applications for demonstrations (see Section 2.a.). There is an aver-
 age of four demonstrations per day, a rate slightly higher than the prereversion
 rate. However, demonstrators, particularly labor activists, complain that demonstra-
 tions often are limited to "designated areas" where they receive little public atten-
 tion, and that police sometimes outnumber demonstrators. In March two Confed-
 eration of Trade Union demonstrators were prosecuted for using a megaphone dur-
 ing a strike. They were acquitted in May. A police order issued in September, while
 underlining that it is police "policy to facilitate as far as possible, all peaceful public
 order events," also stipulates that certain "internationally protected persons" are in
 addition to security entitled to "protection of their dignity." Human rights activists
 are concerned that the order may lead to the use of police-tactics such as those em-
 ployed during the September 1997 visit of Li Peng, when the police played classical
 music over loudspeakers to drown out the shouts of demonstrators. The independent
 Police Complaints Council ruled in March that those tactics were inappropriate.
 Freedom of association is practiced without significant hindrance. In the first 9
 months after reversion, 626 societies were registered and no applications for reg-
 istration denied. Nevertheless, human rights groups also have expressed concern
 that the Amended Societies Ordinance, which-like the Public Order Ordinance was
 passed by the Provisional Legislature, could be used to restrict political activity. The
 Societies Ordinance requires that new societies must apply for registration within
 1 month of establishment. The Government may refuse registration if it believes
 that the refusal is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, pub-
 lic order, or the protection of the rights and freedom of others. The Government also
 may refuse to register a political body that receives support from a foreign political
 organization or a Taiwan-based political organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Basic Law provides that the Government respect re-
 ligious freedom and activities, the Bill of Rights Ordinance prohibits religious dis-
 crimination, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Government
 policy and general practice ensure freedom of religion.
 Some religious leaders noted that the Basic Law, which calls for ties between
 Hong Kong and mainland religious organizations to be based on "nonsubordination,
 noninterference and mutual respect," could be used to limit such contacts. However,
 there were no reports of any limits being applied or proposed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within Hong Kong, and travel docu-
 ments are obtained freely and easily. However, there are some limits on travel to
 the mainland imposed by the Chinese Central Government.
 As was the case before the reversion, the Taiwan passport is not recognized as
 valid for visa endorsement purposes. During the year, regulations were changed to
 allow residents of Taiwan in transit to the mainland to remain in Hong Kong for
 u to 7 days without a visa. After protests from Taiwanese visitors, on July 20, the
 Ong Kong Government stopped stamping the passports of such visitors with warn-
 ings not to display Taiwanese symbols or emblems, fly flags, or "engage in behavior
 embarrassing to the Special Administrative Region."
 Chinese authorities do not permit a number of Hong Kong human rights activists
 to visit the mainland. In August well-known Chinese labor organizer and political
 dissident Han Dongfang received a 3-year Hong Kong work permit. As it has since
 his expulsion from China in 1993, the Chinese Government continued to refuse him
 entry into China.
 In July 1997, the Provisional Legislature passed amendments to the Immigration
 Ordinance requiring mainland-born children claiming the right of abode through
 their parents to obtain prior endorsement (by means of a certificate of entitlement)
 from the Chinese Government. The Government claimed that such a requirement
 
 
 was necessary to keep the estimated 66,000 children with the right of abode from
 overwhelming Hong Kong's social welfare and education systems. From July 1997
 until March 1998, more than 17,000 such children were admitted to Hong Kong.
 However, more than 1,500 minors in this category who entered Hong Kong without
 the required certificate of entitlement are subject to deportation. In October 1997,
 the High Court declared that a provision requiring cdren born out of wedlock to
 derive their right of abode through their mothers and not their fathers contravened
 the Basic Law. On January 26, the High Court upheld the right of abode claims
 of 81 test case plaintiffs. A government appeal of the ruling was scheduled for hear-
 ing in the Court of Final Appeal in January 1999.
 The 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was not extended
 to Hong Kong. On a case-by-case basis, the Director of Immigration has discretion
 to grant refugee status or asylum in cases of exceptional humanitarian or compas-
 sionate need.
 In January the Government abolished its port of first asylum policy. Approxi-
 mately 1,700 Vietnamese sought refugee status in Hong Kong in 1997. The vol-
 untary repatriation program run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) ended in August 1997. In May the last detention center for Viet-
 namese refugees was closed. In the first 9 months of the year, 1,350 Vietnamese
 were repatriated under the (involuntary) orderly repatriation program. A total of
 1,080 refugees remain in Hong Kong, among them 660 stateless (Vietnamese origin)
 asylum seekers and 280 Vietnamese formerly in China. While awaiting resettle-
 ment, most live in Pillar Point Center, an open camp, and are allowed to seek em-
 ployment and enroll their children in local schools. Approximately 12 families from
 other countries have been admitted as refugees and receive a subsistence allowance
 from the UNHCR, but are allowed neither to seek employment nor to enroll their
 children in local schools.
 In two separate cases in September and October 1997 courts ruled that the deten-
 tion of 288 Vietnamese illegal migrants who were formerly in China was illegal. The
 Vietnamese migrants' suit seeking to prevent the Government from returning them
 to the mainland still is pending. Meanwhile, they remain free on bail and live in
 the Pillar Point Camp. In the first 8 months of the year, 9,479 illegal immigrants
 were returned to the Chinese mainland.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Residents' right to change their government is limited by voting regulations that
 provide for the election of the Chief Executive by an appointed selection committee
 of 400, the direct election of only a limited number of Legislative Council members,
 and the addition of indirectly elected members to the elected district boards and mu-
 nicipal councils. In addition, while the approval of the Chief Executive, two-thirds
 of the legislature, and two-thirds of Hong Kong's National People's Congress dele-
 gates is required to place an amendment to the Basic Law on the agenda of China's
 National People's Congress, it is the National People's Congress which has the
 power to actually amend the Basic Law.
 The government structure is three-tiered, and consists of the Legislative Council,
 the provisional municipal councils, and the provisional district boards. C.H. Tung
 is Chief Executive.
 The Chief Executive was chosen by a 400-member selection committee chosen by
 the 150-member preparatory committee, itself appointed by the Chinese Govern-
 ment. The Basic Law provides for elections for chief executive in 2002 and 2007,
 by a "broadly representative election committee" of 800 local residents appointed by
 China. The Basic Law also permits amendment of the Chief Executive selection
 process after 2007 by a two-thirds majority of the Legislative Council, with the con-
 sent of the Chief Executive and the Standing Committee of the National People's
 Congress, with universal suffiage and direct elections as the ultimate goal.
 A provisional legislature, appointed by the same 400-member committee that ap-
 pointed the Chief Executive, began working before the reversion and was sworn in
 at midnight on July 1, 1997; it served until June 30. Although the Provisional Legis-
 lature included 33 of 34 legislators from the 1995 Legislative Council who sought
 inclusion, the Democratic Party and several independents declined to seek seats in
 what they deemed an illegitimate body, which they claimed lacked a legal founda-
 tion and transparency, and excluded groups, parties, and individuals critical of
 China. The Provisional Legislature repealed several laws that had been enacted by
 the elected Legislative Council to enhane civil and poitical rights, including .
 amendments to the Bill of Rights Ordinance; the Employee oght oRepresentation,
 Consultation and Collective Bargaining Ordinance; the Employment (Amendment)
 Ordinance 1997, and the Trade Unions (Amendment) Ordinance 1997 (see Section
 
 
 6). A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Provisional Legislative Council
 was unsuccessful.
 Elections for Hong Kong's first postreversion Legislative Council were held on
 May 24. Seventy percent of eligible voters registered, and a record 53 percent of reg-
 istered voters cast ballots, half again as many as in any previous election. Twenty
 seats were elected directly from geographic districts through universal suffrage, 30
 from functional (occupational) constituencies, and 10 by votes of a committee of local
 elected officials. The functional constituencies were drawn more narrowly than the
 nine broad functional constituencies of the 1995 Legislative Council, and the total
 number of potential voters in functional constituencies was cut from 1.15 million to
 147,000 (a figure close to that used in elections through 1991). There was general
 acceptance of the electoral districts -proposed in October 1997 by the Electoral Af-
 fairs Commission. A bill calling for an accelerated time line for direct elections was
 defeated in the Legislative Council in July.
 The ability of the legislature to influence policy is limited substantially by Basic
 Law provisions that require separate majorities among members elected from geo-
 graphic and functional constituencies in order to pass a bill introduced by an indi-
 vidual member. The Basic Law also prohibits the Legislative Council from putting
 forward bills that affect public expenditure, political structure, or government oper-
 ations. The Chief Executive's approval is required before bils affecting government
 policy may be submitted. There was considerable controversy in July when the Gov-
 ernment asserted that the Legislative Council could not propose amendments to
 government bills that affected government policy without the approval of the Chief
 Executive. At year's end, the issue remained under debate.
 In July 1997, the membership of the elected district boards and municipal coun-
 cils was expanded by 25 percent. The same selection committee that chose the Pro-
 visional Legislature and the Chief Executive, chose the new members, and the bod-
 ies became known as the provisional district boards and provisional municipal coun-
 cils. On October 7, the Chief Executive announced the Government's intention to
 submit a bill to the Legislative Council abolishing the provisional municipal councils
 when the terms of their current members expire in 1999. The district boards, which
 are to be elected, are to remain with functions to be specified in law. On October
 9, the Government briefed the Legislative Council on its extensive public consulta-
 tions on the regional boards and published the submissions that it had received
 from the public and concerned groups.
 Hong Kong sends 36 delegates to China's National People's Congress (NPC). This
 is an important group since placing proposed amendments to the Basic Law on the
 agenda of the NPC requires the approval of two-thirds of Hong Kong's NPC dele-
 gates. Hong Kong's NPC delegates also are entitled to sit on the Election Committee
 that chooses 10 of the Legislature's 60 members. Hong Kong's NPC delegates were
 selected by the same committee that appointed the Chief Executive and the Provi-
 sional Legislature. Politicians and human rights activists criticized the selection
 process as undemocratic and lacking transparency and noted that New China News
 Agency Director Jiang Enzhu, who is not a Hong Kong permanent resident, is one
 of Hong Kong's 36 delegates.
 Women are playing a larger role in politics, with larger numbers running for pub-
 lic office than ever before. Women held 9 of the 60 seats in the Provisional Legisla-
 ture and 10 of the 60 Legislative Council seats. Women hold 7 of the 26 government
 directorate-level posts.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Dozens of local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) operate
 freely, despite concerns about possible restrictions under the revised Societies Ordi-
 nance. These organizations have thriving contacts with the local community and
 with groups overseas. Government officials are cooperative and responsive to their
 views. In July the Government granted the local chapter of Amnesty International
 a special fund raising permit for the first time.
 The 1988 Ombudsman Ordinance established the Office of the Ombudsman,
 which has wide powers to investigate and report on grievances from members of the
 public as a result of administrative actions of the executive branch and other des-
 ignated public bodies. However, the Ombudsman does not have any oversight au-
 thority over the police, the Independent Commission against Corruption, the Equal
 Opportunities Commission, or the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal
 Data. The Ombudsman may investigate complaints of noncompliance with the code
 on access to information by the government departments, including the police and
 Independent Commission against Corruption. With regard to election-related com-
 plaints, the Ombudsman is empowered only to investigate complaints made against
 
 
 the Registration and Electoral Office, but not the Electoral Affairs Commission.
 Thus, the Ombudsman's human rights role regarding liberty of persons, freedom
 from arbitrary and unlawful arrest and detention, equality, and related matters is
 limited.
 The Ombudsman may publish investigation reports in which the identity of the
 complainant has been disguised. In addition to responding to public complaints, the
 Ombudsman may initiate investigations on his own. The Ombudsman may report
 to the Chief Executive if he believes that his recommendations to the organizations
 under his jurisdiction have not been acted upon or if there are serious violations;
 the Chief Executive is bound by law to present this report to the Legislature.
 According to the Basic Law, the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
 apply, with certain restrictions, to Hong Kong. In 1996 the United Kingdom filed
 reports on Hong Kong under both covenants with the U.N., which were to serve as
 a "baseline." The Chinese Government has agreed to transmit Hong Kong's 1998 re-
 p orts, without editing, to the U.N. These reports were prepared without interference
 from the Chinese Government, but local NM's complained that they were not con-
 sulted fully enough on the contents of the reports.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are no laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race. After the pas-
 sage of laws in 1995 banning discrimination on the basis of sex and disability, an
 Equal Opportunities Commission was established in 1996. Women's groups and oth-
 ers have criticized the Commission for passivity in combating discrimination and for
 emphasizing conciliation instead of acting as a watchdog or pursuing court cases.
 However, the Government has begun to bring cases against discriminatory employ-
 ment advertisements. In the first 9 months of the year, 18 cases under the Sex Dis-
 crimination Ordinance and 1 case under the Disability Discrimination Ordinance
 were brought to court. However, fines, particularly against newspapers for carrying
 discriminatory advertisements, were very light.
 In June 1997, the Legislative Council enacted the Family Status Discrimination
 Ordinance, which protects persons whose marital status changes, who have chil-
 dren, or who are responsible for caring for another family member, such as a child
 or an elderly person.
 According to the Basic Law, English may be used as an official language by the
 executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Almost all civil cases and most criminal
 cases are heard in English. To help remedy this imbalance, the Government has in-
 creased the number of officers in the Legal Aid Department proficient in Chinese.
 A 1996 pilot scheme for simultaneous interpretation in some court proceedings
 failed, but the Government expanded the use of bilingual prosecution documents
 and indictments. All laws are available in Chinese, and in 1997 the High Court
 heard the first jury trial ever conducted in Cantonese.
 Women.-Violence against women remains a significant problem, particularly
 among new immigrants from China. The only law to protect battered women is the
 1987 Domestic Violence Ordinance, which allows a woman to seek a 3-month injunc-
 tion against her husband (extendible to 6 months). Domestic violence also may be
 prosecuted as common assault. The Government enforces the laws and prosecutes
 violators, but punishment remains lenient; of the 344 charges of "family violence"
 from April to September of 1997 only 33 resulted in convictions. Half of those con-
 victed were fined and only four were imprisoned. Of the 60 spousal abuse cases in
 the first 9 months of the year that resulted in legal action, 41 were awaiting trial,
 1 received a 6-month sentence and fine, 1 received a 2-month sentence, 4 were fined
 between $200 and $450, 3 received a suspended sentence, 1 received a police warn-
 ing and 1 was acquitted. Women do not seek help when subject to violence; cultural
 factors and inadequate information about available assistance and resources cause
 many cases of spousal abuse to go unreported. To address this, in 1995 the Govern-
 ment set up a working group on battered spouses. In 1996 it crafted multidisci-
 plinary procedural guidelines on handling battered spouse cases. It also funds pro-
 grams such as family life education counseling, a hot line service, temporary hous-
 ing, legal aid, and child protective services; and has initiated public education and
 media programs.
 The general incidence of rape is low. There were 74 cases reported in 1997 and
 63 in the first 8 months of the year.
 Women face significant discrimination in employment, salary, welfare, inherit-
 ance, and promotion (see Section 6.e.). Unemployment is higher among women than
 men. Despite equal educational opportunities, women are disproportionately rep-
 resented in the lower echelons of the work force. As a result of 1994 revisions to
 
 
 884
 inheritance statutes, the law treats men and women equally in inheritance matters,
 although women still face discrimination based on traditional practices.
 During 1991-95, the number of female secondary student candidates who took
 university advanced-level examinations accounted for between 51 and 55 percent of
 the total, and the number of female candidates who matriculated at universities ac-
 counted for between 52 and 56 percent of all matriculating candidates. Women are
 entering fields such as medicine in greater numbers, although there are few women
 in specialties like surgery.
 Children.-The Government is committed firmly to children's rights and welfare
 through well-funded systems of public education, medical care, and protective serv-
 ices. It supports programs for custody, protection, day care, foster care, shelters,
 small group homes, and assistance to families. The age of criminal responsibility for
 children in Hong Kong is 7, although it must be proved that a child under the age
 of 14 understood the consequences of his actions.
 Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread, but are increasing. There are
 no specific laws dealing with child pornography. In 1997 there were 744 child sexual
 abuse cases reported to the police and 356 cases of physical abuse. For the first 8
 months of the year, the numbers were 489 and 142 respectively. In 1995 the police
 set up a child abuse investigation unit to improve the treatment of victims. In 1996
 legislation was passed making it easier for child victims to testify in court by using
 an interviewing suite for recording statements. Legal penalties for mistreatment or
 neglect of minors also were increased substantially. A witness support program also
 was launched in 1996 to help child witnesses in need. A child witness information
 kit in Chinese, with books explaining legal and c6urt proceedings was published in
 1996 to help reduce anxiety, and a child care bill was passed in May to prevent un-
 suitable persons from -providing child care services and to facilitate the formation
 of mutual help child care groups.
 People With Disabilities.-Discrimination against the physically and mentally dis-
 abled persists in employment, education, and the provision of some public services.
 The 1995 Antidiscrimination Law called for improved building access and sanctions
 against those who discriminate. In 1997 amendments to the Buildings Ordinance
 updated design requirements. However, despite inspections and occasional closure
 of noncompliant businesses, access to public buildings and transportation remains
 a serious problem. Advocates for the disabled complained that limited access for the
 disabled at polling stations made voting difficult; for example, only 36 of the 96 sub-
 sector election polling stations were accessible to the disabled. The Government has
 an integrated work extension program in sheltered workshops and has expanded vo-
 cational assessment and training. No comprehensive statistics are available on the
 number of disabled persons in the workforce. There are about 4,600 disabled per-
 sons employed as civil servants in a civil service work force of 184,638-about 2.5
 percent. In the first 8 months of the year, the Selective Placement Division of the
 Labor Department found jobs for 979 of 2,363 disabled job seekers. Approximately
 9,000 students in a school population of 919,620, or just under 1 percent, are dis-
 abled. A pilot integration program launched in 1997 offered places to 46 mildly dis-
 abled students in regular schools. In 1997 the Government started a special univer-
 sity admission scheme for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination
 on the basis of race. A government "Code of Practice for Employers" designed to pre-
 vent discrimination states that race should not be considered when hiring employ-
 ees. However, racial discrimination in employment and admission to public res-
 taurants and clubs is common. Foreign domestic workers, most of them from the
 Philippines, are particularly vulnerable to discrimination.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right of assoiation and the
 right of workers to establish and join organizations of their own choosing. Trade
 unions must be registered under the Trade Unions Ordinance. The basic pre-
 condition for registration is a minimum of seven persons who serve in the same oc-
 cupation. The Government does not discourage or impede the formation of unions.
 In the first 8 months of the year, 12 new trade unions were registered. By the end
 of 1997, there were 563 trade unions comprising 538 employee unions and 25 mixed
 employer-employee unions. Approximately 22 percent of Hong Kong's 3.1 million sal-
 aried employees and wage earners belong to a labor organization.
 Work stoppages and strikes are permitted. However, there are some restrictions
 on this right for civil servants. There were six strikes in the first 8 months of the
 year and several work stoppages or slowdowns, the largest, in September, involving
 thousands of Hong Kong telecommunications workers. In 1997 there were 7 strikes
 involving 418 workers. Although there is no legislative prohibition of strikes, in
 
 
 885
 practice, most workers must sign employment contracts that typically state that
 walking off the job is a breach of contract that can lead to summary dismissal.
 To date, Hong Kong has amended labor legislation and taken administrative
 measures to apply 49 International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions. In the
 Basic Law, China committed to adhere to these conventions (see Section 6.b.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In 1997 the Legislative Coun-
 cil passed three laws that greatly expanded the collective barg aining powers of
 workers, protected them from summary dismissal for union activity, and permitted
 union activity on company premises and time. The new ordinances would have en-
 abled full implementation of the ILO's Conventions 87 (which was ratified with res-
 ervations in 1963), 98, and 154. However, in October 1997, after consultation with
 the Labor Advisory Board, the Provisional Legislature repealed the Employee's
 Right to Representation, Consultation, and Collective Bargaining Ordinance of 1997
 and the Employment (Amendment) Ordinance 1997, and amended the Trade Union
 (Amendment) Ordinance. The repeal removed the new legislation's statutory protec-
 tion against summary dismissal for union activity; the Government argued gat ex-
 isting law already offered adequate protection against unfair dismissal arising from
 antiunion discrimination.
 In October 1997 the Provisional Legislature promulgated the Employment and
 Labor Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. This bill permits the cross-indus-
 try affiliation of labor union federations and confederations and allows free associa-
 tion with overseas trade unions (although notification of the Labor Department
 ,within 1 month of affiliation is required), but removes the legal stipulation of trade
 unions' right to engage employers in collective bargaining bans the use of union
 funds for political purposes; requires the Chief Executives approval before unions
 can contribute funds to any trade union outside of Hong Kong, and restricts the ap-
 pointment of persons from outside the enterprise or sector to union executive com-
 mittees. The Confederation of Trade Unions promptly filed a complaint against the
 Government for violation of ILO conventions 87, 98, and 154. In November the ILO
 Committee on Freedom of Association concluded that the new labor ordinance
 breached conventions 87 and 98 and recommended that the Government take legis-
 lative action to remedy the situation. The Government has not commented.
 With  the repeal of the short-lived    collective bargaining legislation, the
 prereversion framework continued: There were no laws that stipulated collective
 bargaining on a mandatory basis. Wage rates in a few trades like tailoring and car-
 pentry were determined collectively in accordance with established trade practices
 and customs rather than as a statutory mechanism. In practice, collective bargain-
 ing is not practiced widely. Unions generally are not powerful enough to force man-
 agement to engage in collective bargaining. The Government does not encourage it,
 since the Government itself does not engage in collective bargaining with civil serv-
 ants' unions but merely "consults" with them.
 The Labor Relations Division of the Department of Labor affords free nonbinding
 conciliation services to employers and employees involved in disputes that may in-
 volve statutory benefits and protection in employment as well as arrears of wages,
 wages instead of notice, or severance pay. The Department of Labor takes a positive
 attitude towards the participation of trade unions in such dispute negotiations. In
 1997 the Labor Relations Division handled 161 trade disputes and 20,404 claims,
 more than half of which arose from termination of contract or dismissal cases. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of these trade disputes and claims were settled with Labor
 Relations Division conciliation.
 The Employment Ordinance includes provisions protecting against antiunion dis-
 crimination. Violation of the antiunion discrimination provisions is a criminal of-
 fense the maximum fine for which was increased in 1995 to $12,500. Employees who
 allege such discrimination have the right to have their cases heard by the Labor
 Relations Tribunal. The Tribunal may order reinstatement of the employee, subject
 to mutual consent of the employer and employee. If no such order is made, the Tri-
 bunal may award statutory entitlements (severance pay, etc.) and compensation.
 The maximum amount of compensation is $20,000. However, labor activists com-
 plain that the Labor Relations Tribunal's tendency to push conciliation rather than
 issue orders discourages complaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The use of forced labor is prohib-
 ited in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. While this legislation does not spe-
 cifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, there were no reports of such
 practices.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Em-
 ployment of Children Regulations prohibit the employment of children under the
 age of 15 in any industrial establishment. Children 13 and 14 years of age may be
 
 
 886
 
 employed in certain nonindustrial establishments, subject to conditions aimed at en-
 suring a minimum of 9 years' education and protecting their safety, health, and wel-
 fare. In 1997 the Labor Department conducted 158,936 workplace inspections and
 issued 10 summonses for violations of the Employment of Children Regulations. Of
 these, nine resulted in convictions with total fines of $4,000. Work hours for young
 persons 15 to 17 years of age in the manufacturing sector remain limited to 8 hours
 per day and 48 hours per week between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. Overtime is prohibited
 or all persons under the age of 18 in industrial establishments. Employment in
 dangerous trades is prohibited for youths except 16- and 17-year-old males. The
 Labor Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to enforce compliance with these
 regulations. While provisions against forced or compulsory labor do not specifically
 refer to children, -there were no reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage except
 for foreign domestic workers. As of December, the minimum  wage for such workers
 was about $500 a month. Because the law-also requires employers to provide foreign
 domestic workers with housing, worker's compensation insurance, travel allowances,
 and food or a food allowance in addition to the minimum wage, foreign domestic
 workers have a decent standard of living. However, there are an increasing number
 of credible reports' of foreign domestic workers, 'who are subject to deportation if
 they are dismissed and who are- thus less likely to raise formal complaints, being
 forced illegally to accept less than the minimum wage and unacceptable living condi-
 tions.
 Aside from a small number of trades where a uniform wage structure exists, wage
 levels customarily are fixed by individual agreement between employer and em-
 ployee and are determined by supply and demand. Some employers provide workers
 with various kinds of allowances, free medical treatment, and free subsidized trans-
 port. The average wage generally provides a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. However two-income households are the norm.
 In order to comply with provisions in the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, provi-
 sions in the Women and Young Persons (Industry) Regulations that had prohibited
 women from joining dangerous industrial trades and limited their working hours,
 including compulsory weekly rest days, were dropped in 1997.
 Hong Kong's Factory Inspectorate Division was restructured in 1996 as part of a
 government effort to strengthen its safety and health promotion and enforcement
 program. The new division-part of a new occupational safety and health branch of
 the Labor Department-comprises four units:     operations division covering field
 services such as safety and health advice; a support services division responsible for
 technical support services; a planning and training division; and a legal services di-
 vision charged with processing and conducting prosecutions. '
 The Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and its 27 sets of subsidi-
 ary regulations regulate safety and health conditions. The Labor Department -con-
 ducted 82,278 inspections of industrial and nonindustrial workplaces in 1997 and
 issued 2,265 summonses (933 of which resulted in convictions, with a total of $2.6
 million in fines), 36 suspension orders, and 1,848 improvement notices. Worker safe-
 ty and health has improved, due in part to the transfer of many manufacturing jobs
 to factories across the Chinese border, but serious problems remain, particularly in
 the construction industry. In 1997 a total of 62,800 occupational accidents (43,300
 of which were classified as industrial accidents) were reported, of which 58 were
 fatal. Employers are required under the Employee's Compensation Ordinance to re-
 port any injuries sustained by their employees in work-related accidents. There is
 no specific legal provision allowing workers to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
