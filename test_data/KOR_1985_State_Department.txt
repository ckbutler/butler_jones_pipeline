 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 President Chun Doo Hwan dominates the political scene in the
 Republic of Korea. The elected legislature has limited power
 but considerable influence on public opinion. President Chun,
 a former army general, assumed power with military support in
 1980, at which time martial law was declared and civil
 disturbances in Kwangju were harshly confronted. The
 Constitution was adopted by referendum in October 1980 under
 strict martial law conditions, leading many Koreans to question
 the referendum's fairness. At the time of the next
 presidential election, in late 1987 or early 1988, President
 Chun has promised to step down to provide for a peaceful and
 constitutional change of power.
 Korea's traditional sociopolitical ideology, Confucianism,
 emphasizes order and conformity, as well as a subordinate role
 for women. This thinking retains great strength, coexisting
 uneasily with Western democratic ideals.
 Citing this tradition and faced with a heavily armed Communist
 North Korea that once invaded the South and that remains
 extremely hostile to it, successive South Korean governments
 have given top priority to maintaining external and internal
 security, implemented in-part by the large and well-organized
 security forces. Many Koreans have charged throughout the
 years that the very real threat from the North was also used as
 a pretext to suppress internal opposition politics, despite the
 democratic ideals professed by all South Korean leaders.
 Koreans enjoy considerable personal freedom, including economic
 and religious freedom and broad rights to pursue private
 interests. Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of
 speech and press, in practice both are abridged.
 During the past 20 years, Korea's export-oriented, mixed
 economy has achieved one of the world's highest growth rates
 and a twentyfold increase in per capita gross national product
 (GNP). The population is urbanized and well educated. Abject
 poverty has been largely eliminated. The rapid growth of the
 economy has created a growing middle class with increasing
 access to education and wealth. They have joined with other
 groups to become a strong voice for fuller political
 participation and greater freedom to express political views.
 Human rights issues as well as "democratization" issues were
 the focus of greater public discussion and debate than in
 recent years. There was some progress in the human rights
 field in the early months of 1985, continuing the trend of
 1984. The National Assembly election held on February 12 was
 widely regarded as among the most democratic in the Republic's
 history, with candidates freely criticizing the Government at
 large rallies. Press coverage was frank and lively. The
 election resulted in a new party, supported by leading
 opposition politicians, becoming the largest opposition party
 in the Assembly since the Republic's founding.
 In March a statutory political ban originally applied to 567
 politicians was lifted on the remaining 14 persons affected,
 including prominent dissident leaders Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae
 Jung. (The political activities of Kim Dae Jung and some other
 politicians remained restricted, however, by other legal
 provisions.) At the same time, Kim Dae Jung was freed from the
 house arrest imposed on him on his return to Korea one month
 earlier. Nine political prisoners were released in an amnesty
 on May 27. Under the Government's "campus autonomy" policy,
 
 
 799
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 the formation of independent student councils was permitted and
 police stayed off campus as students began the most active
 semester of student protest since 1980.
 The Government soon responded heavily to the newly assertive
 opposition and the increased student activism, initiating a new
 wave of repression of dissent. Political tension remained high
 throughout the remainder of the year. On several occasions
 journalists were detained for writing politically sensitive
 articles. There were credible reports of torture or physical
 intimidation of several journalists and dissidents. After the
 May 23-26 student sit-in at the U.S. Information Service
 library in Seoul, the Government returned to its pre-1984
 practice of arresting and trying student protest leaders, and
 police entered campuses readily to stop demonstrations. During
 the fall semester, student protests became increasingly
 violent. The Government reacted by arresting some or all of
 those involved in the more violent protests, raising the number
 of students in prison at the end of the year to over 400, the
 largest number since 1980. The Government announced that it
 was considering a plan to send activist students to
 6-month-long ideological reeducation centers, but it backed off
 because of widespread opposition.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports of torture or cruel treatment in 1985 increased
 significantly over 1984. The Constitution prohibits torture,
 and the Government insists that it has issued injunctions
 against it and that these are strictly enforced and violations
 sternly punished. Nonetheless, there were credible reports of
 torture, such as that of an antigovernment youth activist who
 was subjected to torture while under police detention in
 September, and reliable reports of three senior Korean
 journalists who were detained and beaten by security officials
 for breaking a government embargo on a news story. Korean
 human rights groups and political opposition leaders also made
 plausible charges that a number of students and other prisoners
 in politically related cases were subjected to various degrees
 of physical maltreatment including beatings, sleep and food
 deprivation, electric shock, and forced water intake during
 police interrogations in the latter half of 1985. The
 Government publicly denied that any of these prisoners had been
 mistreated.
 On February 26, 1985, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's
 acquittal of a woman whose conviction for murder had been based
 on a confession which she later said had been made as a result
 of police torture. She was awarded the equivalent of about
 $29,500 in compensation from the State.  Court sources say some
 
 
 800
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 cases were prosecuted in 1985 under a law adopted by the
 National Assembly in 1983 increasing sentences for those
 convicted of killing or injuring through torture.
 The use of excessive force by the police has proven to be a
 pervasive'and ingrained problem, despite some high-level
 efforts to reduce or eliminate it. Rioters have been beaten on
 apprehension, often by plainclothes police. Charges of police
 beatings in nonpolitical cases occur fairly frequently and are
 sometimes reported in the press. There were reports in 1985
 that police were using a stronger form of tear gas to break up
 student and other unauthorized demonstrations which caused skin
 blisters on those who came into direct contact with it.
 Conditions in Korean correctional institutions are austere,
 especially in winter as cells are not heated. Discipline is
 strict. Under normal circumstances, convicts are not subjected
 to physical punishment, but prisoners who break rules or
 protest conditions are sometimes beaten. There were reports
 that 19 political prisoners transferred to Taegu Prison in July
 were beaten severely when they protested overcrowded conditions.
 Prisoners may receive visits only from their lawyers and
 immediate families. Their mail is monitored and sometimes
 censored. There does not seem to be a difference between the
 treatment of political and non-political prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrest warrants are required by law but are sometimes not
 produced at the time of arrest in politically related cases.
 In 1985 the Supreme Court ruled that police may not detain
 persons for more than 48 hours without arrest warrants. An
 indictment must be issued within 30 days after arrest. Within
 40 days after making an arrest, the police must notify an
 arrested person's family of his detention and whereabouts. The
 police normally wait at least several days, and occasionally
 more than 40 days, before making notification. The
 Constitution guarantees the right of prompt legal assistance
 and the right to request court review in case of arrest.
 Habeas corpus, not traditional in Korean law, was introduced
 after World War II, abolished in the 1970's, and reintroduced
 in 1980. It does not apply to those charged with violations of
 the National Security Act or laws punishable by at least 5
 years' imprisonment, which includes most politically related
 offenses. There is a system of bail, but it does not apply to
 offenses punishable by 10 or more years' imprisonment. In 1985
 the Government adopted a new policy to compensate persons held
 for questioning but who are subsequently found to be innocent
 by prosecutors..
 Dissidents who openly criticize the Government are sometimes
 picked up and detained for short periods and then released.
 There were several instances in 1985 of journalists who had
 written politically sensitive articles being detained for short
 periods, usually overnight, by security forces.
 From time to time, the security services have not only detained
 persons accused of violating laws on political dissent but have
 also increased surveillance of, or put under various forms of
 house arrest, those they think intend to violate the laws. In
 the longest continuous application of such restrictions in
 1985, opposition politician Kim Dae Jung was not permitted to
 
 
 801
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 leave his home for about 1 month after his return to Korea from
 the United States in February 1985. Kim and others were also
 confined to their homes on several other occasions for briefer
 periods. In the latter half of 1985 the Government arrested
 and charged with National Security Law violations about 80
 students and other Koreans associated with student and youth
 organizations the Government characterized as pro-Communist
 and/or pro-North Korean; about 60 of these had been convicted
 or remained under detention awaiting trial at the end of 1985.
 Government critics claim that, in many of these cases, the
 National Security Law was misused to suppress domestic,
 particularly student, dissent.
 For persons deemed "socially dangerous," the law allows
 preventive detention under provisions of the Social Protection
 and Social Stability Laws. Neither provision affords the
 accused the benefit of legal counsel or appeal. Under the
 Social Protection Law, a judicial panel may order preventive
 detention for a fixed term of 2 years, which can be extended by
 the panel for additional 2-year periods. The Social Stability
 Law allows for a preventive detention term of 7 to 10 years.
 In the city of Chongju there exists a "preventive custody
 center" where prisoners judged to be insufficiently repentant
 are held following the completion of their original prison
 sentences. Soh Joon Shik, whose original 7-year sentence ran
 out in 1978, is one of two political prisoners believed to be
 held in this facility. The Government has not released figures
 on the total number of persons under preventive detention.
 There were no reports in 1985 of forced labor as defined by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees many rights to defendants: The
 right to presumption of innocence, the right against
 self-incrimination, freedom from ex-post facto laws and double
 jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights are generally observed. Trials, with
 some exceptions, must be held within 6 months of arrest. In
 Seoul, trials usually begin within a month after indictment.
 The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court, whose
 Chief Justice in turn appoints lower-level judges. The Chief
 Justice serves a 5-year term. The judiciary is considered
 eindependent in ordinary criminal and civil cases but much less
 so in politically sensitive cases, In 1985 the Chief Justice
 'was criticized in opposition and legal circles for transferring
 several judges to less desirable positions, allegedly because
 they had ruled in favor of defendants in cases involving
 .student protesters or had complained about the treatment of
 their colleagues who were accused of being too lenient toward
 student defendants. The Korean Bar Association called for the
 Chief Justice's resignation; an impeachment sponsored by the
 opposition was voted down in the National Assembly.
 In several politically sensitive trials in 1985, as in the
 trial of students who seized the U.S. Information Service
 (USIS) Library in May, public attendance was limited, and the
 defendants sometimes were removed from the courtroom for
 attempting to disrupt the proceedings by shouting slogans and
 singing. Judges generally allowed great scope for examination
 of witnesses by both prosecution and defense, but they often
 denied defense requests to call witnesses to discuss the
 
 
 802
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 political or ideological leanings of the defendants, even when
 the prosecution had introduced evidence on such topics.
 Trials are usually open to the public, but trial documents are
 not part of the public record. Charges against defendants in
 the courts are clearly stated, with the exception that, in
 lengthy and complex indictments, the relationship between
 specific acts alleged and violations of specific sections of
 the penal code may not always be clearly drawn. In cases
 involving a mixture of political and criminal charges this can
 bring into question the fairness of the proceedings.
 The same courts try political and ordinary criminal cases. The
 military courts do not try civilians. Defendants have the
 right of appeal in felony cases, a right which is often
 exercised and frequently results in substantial reductions in
 sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed. The
 list of political prisoners maintained by the Human Rights
 Committee (HRC) of the National Council of Churches hovered
 around 100 names throughout the first 5 months of 1985. The
 list grew to around 700 names by November as the Government
 continued its crackdown on activist students begun in the
 aftermath of the USIS Library seizure, but the number had
 dropped to around 600 by the end of December. The HRC includes
 on its list persons indicted but not yet tried for
 politically-related offenses as well as those already
 convicted; this list contains the names of some persons who
 have advocated or used violence. The Minister of Justice
 reported to the National Assembly in October 1985 that there
 are no prisoners of conscience in the Republic of Korea.
 Of the 600 names on the HRC list, more than 400 are university
 students. About 30 people on the HRC's list were charged with
 illegal labor actions; several were farmers charged with
 illegal assembly and demonstration. The list also includes 40
 or so persons, many of whom were Korean residents in Japan,
 accused of espionage for North Korea.
 Not included in the HRC political prisoner list are students
 and others briefly detained but not indicted in connection with
 student and labor demonstrations during 1985. According to
 government statistics, between May and October police referred
 over 1,000 students to summary court where they were charged
 with minor offenses, and sentenced to a maximum of 29 days'
 detention. Some students receiving summary judgments chose to
 exercise their right to formal trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Many political and religious dissidents are subjected to
 surveillance by the security forces. During politically
 sensitive periods, this surveillance by one or more security
 agencies may increase or a form of house arrest may be
 imposed. There have also been charges of telephone tapping and
 opening or interception of correspondence. Koreans who meet
 with foreigners, particularly with journalists and foreign
 diplomats, are sometimes questioned afterwards. In the
 aftermath of the seizure by students of the USIS library in
 May, police tried to stop relatives of the students involved
 and others from meeting U.S. Embassy officials.
 While the Constitution requires a warrant issued by a judge
 upon request of prosecutor for search and seizure in a
 residence, the police at times force their way into private
 
 
 803
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 homes without warrants. During politically sensitive periods,
 the police and security force presence in city centers and near
 university campuses is very heavy. Citizens, particularly
 students, are frequently stopped, questioned, and searched.
 Traditional Korean police practice requires police commanders
 to know a good deal about the personal and business affairs of
 all residents in their jurisdictions. This system is effective
 in crime control, and urban residents generally credit it with
 keeping their streets safe. By contrast, the presence of
 police informer networks on college campuses with the primary
 purpose of keeping track of political activities has been a key
 complaint among students, including those who are Aot
 politically active.
 In most other respects the Government honors the right of
 personal privacy and the integrity of the home and family.
 Parental rights to educate children are broad, and restrictions
 on study in foreign-administered schools (whether in Korea or
 overseas), originally imposed to force wealthy Koreans to
 involve themselves in the nation's social and educational
 development, have been relaxed in recent years. The State
 rarely seeks to intervene in such inherently personal decisions
 as marriage, choice of vocation, and formation of social and
 familial ties. However, persons thought to have politically
 suspect backgrounds are denied some forms of employment and
 advancement, particularly in government, press, and education.
 In 1985, Korean newspapers reported that a number of teachers
 and college graduates had been denied jobs in public schools
 solely because of their past involvement in student protest
 activities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, in practice the expression of opposition
 viewpoints is limited, sometimes severely. Government critics
 say that laws such as the Basic Press Law, under which media
 organizations are licensed and permitted to operate, and
 criminal code provisions against the spreading of "rumors which
 eventually disturb peace and order" and "defiling the state"
 are used to muzzle and punish dissident views. Opposition
 political parties have called for the repeal or reform of the
 Basic Press Law.
 During the February 1985 National Assembly election campaign,
 opposition candidates made speeches before large crowds in
 which they were highly critical of the Government. Most Korean
 and foreign observers alike agreed the campaign was
 characterized by the most outspoken political debate permitted
 in the Republic of Korea in many years. Print media coverage
 was extensive, although television reporting reflected much
 more government influence. When the new National Assembly was
 inaugurated, it continued to be characterized by a breaking of
 old taboos on speaking out on sensitive political topics,
 including thinly-veiled challenges to the Government's
 legitimacy stemming from the serious civil disturbance in
 Kwangju in 1980, policy toward South-North Korean dialogue, and
 constitutional revision, all of which received print media
 coverage. The government party, concerned about increasingly
 sharp opposition criticism, sought with limited success to
 precensor opposition politicians' remarks. After several
 
 
 804
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 opposition politicians complained of government intimidation
 when they or their aides were summoned for questioning about
 critical remarks made on the Assembly floor, the Government
 promised it would respect Assemblymen's rights to free speech.
 Details of the most critical speeches were generally not
 reported in the press, and government party speeches received
 heavier coverage. Nonetheless, newspapers did report in
 greater detail than in many years about opposition views on
 previously taboo political subjects.
 The domestic media engage in self-censorship, according to
 verbal or written guidelines the Government regularly gives to
 editors. Journalists who object to or ignore these guidelines
 or criticize the guidance system have been picked up for
 questioning and on occasion dismissed or sent out of the
 country on assignment; in one case in 1985 journalists were
 beaten. Nonetheless, the domestic media, notably newspapers
 and magazines, became noticeably more outspoken during and in
 the aftermath of the February National Assembly election. An
 edition of a prestigious monthly magazine carrying an article
 on the 1980 civil disturbances in Kwangju was confiscated by
 the Government shortly after its publication, and the article's
 author was interrogated by security officials. In late 1985
 about 30 reporters, mostly from provincial papers, were fired
 for corruption on orders from the Ministry of Culture and
 Information. There were reports that at least some were in
 fact fired for holding views critical of the Government. In
 December a visiting U.S. Washington Times journalist was
 ordered out of the country temporarily, reportedly for writing
 an article on an alleged meeting between North and South Korean
 leaders.
 The early months of 1985 saw the publication of an increasing
 number of books and magazines by dissident religious,
 political, and cultural figures. In May police confiscated
 books they considered dangerous on the grounds of being
 "leftist" or "encouraging revolution." According to the
 Minister of Culture and Information, in October 11,000 copies
 of 395 books were confiscated.
 Twenty teachers who contributed to a magazine criticizing the
 Government's education policy were arrested or fired, and the
 magazine's publishing company was closed under the Basic Press
 Law. The Basic Press Law was also used against a student
 charged with editing a "seditious" publication; at least seven
 other students were charged with National Security Law
 violations in connection with publications said to be
 1sympathetic to Communism and serving the interests of the
 enemy." In July police raided an art exhibition and jailed
 five artists for a week, saying the paintings and prints there
 were objectionable on ideological grounds. A Christian youth
 activist received a suspended sentence for "defiling the state"
 by distributing dissident leaflets to foreign journalists.
 Academic freedom is subject to some political limitations. In
 fall 1985 a group of professors who signed a petition opposing
 the proposed campus'stabilization law came under official
 pressure to retract their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 A number of specified categories of assembly, including those
 considered likely to undermine public order or cause social
 unrest, are prohibited by the Law on Assembly and
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Demonstrations. The law also requires that demonstrations of
 all types and outdoor political assemblies be reported in
 advance to the police. Violation of the law carries a maximum
 sentence of 7 years' imprisonment or a fine of about $3,750.
 Under this law, police have at times intervened and broken up
 meetings. Most peaceful nonpolitical assemblies take place
 entirely without official supervision or restriction. However,
 meetings of dissidents are monitored and sometimes prevented,
 often by placing the scheduled speaker under some form of house
 arrest.
 The Law on Assembly and Demonstrations was most often used in
 1985 against student demonstrators. According to a government
 report submitted to the National Assembly in late October, a
 total of 1,923 students had been taken to police stations for
 involvement in demonstrations on and off campus since the May
 USIS Library seizure. Of that number, 309 were charged with
 violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstrations and/or laws
 punishing violent acts. Another 104 were booked without
 physical detention. About 1,000 were summarily tried on minor
 charges, and the remainder were released with warnings.
 In September two opposition National Assemblymen and several
 other oppositionists were indicted under the Law on Assembly
 and Demonstration after they were stopped by police for
 shouting protest slogans against the Government at the gates of
 a Seoul campus on the day of a scheduled protest meeting. In
 October the lawyers for some of the students charged under the
 Law on Assembly and Demonstration requested a review by the
 Constitution Committee of the legitimacy part of the law,
 asserting that the vagueness of one clause rendered it
 unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled against the claim,
 stating that the right to assembly and protest is limited.
 Under the Constitution, workers are guaranteed the right to
 independent association, to bargain collectively, and to
 collective action. These rights are circumscribed by law and
 practice and do not extend to workers employed by the
 Government, public utilities, defense-related industries, or
 firms "that exercise great influenee on the national economy."
 In the past the last category has applied primarily to heavy
 industry.
 The single national labor federation, the Federation of Korean
 Trade Unions (FKTU), and its 16 national affiliate unions are
 not controlled by the Government, but their activities are
 limited by law and subject to government interference. In
 1985, five ranking FKTU officials were forced to resign under
 government pressure, reportedly because they were either held
 responsible for or did not agree with the Government's tough
 policy on recent labor disputes. Labor organizations are
 forbidden by law to support politicians or political parties,
 though the FKTU does lobby National Assemblymen, and
 Assemblymen often attend labor gatherings.
 According to the FKTU, after an increase in 1984, dues-paying
 union membership in 1985 remained at about 800,000 workers,
 about 10 percent of the full-time work force. Ministry of
 Labor figures, based on reports submitted by individual unions,
 place total union membership at slightly over I million.
 Some FKTU-supported revisions to labor regulations, approved in
 1985, permitted a larger role for the Federation in local
 
 
 806
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 affairs. The FKTU continued to press for broader revision of
 the labor law, as did the main opposition party.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, and its constituent unions are affiliated
 with recognized international trade union federations. The
 Republic of Korea has observer status at the International
 Labor Organization.
 All local unions must be organized within individual
 enterprises, creating a structure of thousands of individual
 unions, most of them small and weak. Direct participation in
 local unions' bargaining activities by outside agencies is
 forbidden. The FKTU and its constituent national unions can
 and sometimes do bargain on behalf of the locals and conduct
 education programs, but only with government and employer
 approval. Religious labor ministries such as the Catholic
 Young Christian Workers and the Protestant Urban Industrial
 Mission are also severely limited in the assistance which they
 can provide the unions. Under these circumstances, government
 and employer influence has greatly exceeded that of unions in
 setting wages and resolving other major labor issues.
 Collective actions and strikes, though technically legal, are
 strongly discouraged. The Government used the Law on Assembly
 and Demonstration on a number of occasions in connection with
 workers' and farmers' rallies. Despite the legal restrictions
 and other obstacles, collective actions by workers, including
 strikes, increased in 1985. The Government charged radical
 student involvement in many of the disputes, saying it had
 identified at least 277 "disguised workers" through the end of.
 September who had hidden their university credentials in order
 to "infiltrate" the workforce and "instigate" the workers to
 strike. Of these, 160 were fired by their employers, 97
 "voluntarily" quit their jobs, and 20 are still working. In a
 few strikes, groups of nonstriking workers wielded pipes and
 stormed their workplaces to end worker sit-in's forcibly. They
 were not prevented by police from doing so, and many Koreans
 charged that the attacks were government-sponsored.
 According to government statistics, the government committee
 charged with investigating unfair labor practices heard 227
 cases in the first eight months of 1985, 205 of which involved
 problems with union organization and alleged employer
 obstructionism. The committee decided in favor of the workers
 in 64 cases.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. There is
 generally complete freedom of proselytizing, doctrinal
 teaching, and conversion. Korea both sends and receives
 missionaries of various faiths. Many religious groups in Korea
 maintain active links with coreligionists in other countries.
 Minority sects are not discriminated against, and adherence to
 a faith confers neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil,
 military, or official life. Churches and religious groups are
 subject to many of the restrictions on political activity and
 criticism of the Government that apply to all other
 institutions. On those occasions where pastors are harassed by
 the authorities, it is usually for religiously motivated social
 or political activism. One Protestant minister active in human
 rights issues has made plausible charges that a government
 security agency has sponsored efforts to disrupt his church
 
 
 807
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 services; other ministers have joined with him to protest what
 they term government infringement on religious freedom. The
 Government denied the charges and says the church's troubles
 are an internal problem. Conscientious objectors are subject
 to arrest.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is almost universal freedom of movement and freedom to
 change employment in Korea. Because Korea is one of the most
 densely populated countries in the world, the Government does
 not discourage emigration or discriminate against prospective
 emigrants. Most people can obtain passports, except for
 criminals and some persons considered politically suspect. A
 number of dissidents, former political prisoners, and persons
 banned from political activity have been allowed to travel
 abroad. The Government limits the number of passports issued
 to tourists and prospective students, citing foreign exchange
 considerations and the problem of unqualified students going
 abroad. Passports, when issued, are typically limited to 1
 year, although there are exceptions in which passports are
 issued up to the legally maximum 5-year period of validity.
 A small continuing influx of Vietnamese boat refugees is
 admitted to first asylum in Korea. They are cared for at a
 camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross until they can be
 resettled abroad. Over 700 displaced persons from Vietnam have
 passed through Korea in the last several years. Very few have
 been permanently resettled in Korea.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Korea's Constitution and statutes, as well as its traditions,
 concentrate political power in the President, a concentration
 further intensified by the support the President enjoys from
 the military. The President and the members of the National
 Assembly are the only elected officials in Korea. Under the
 1980 Presidential Election Law, the President is chosen by a
 popularly elected electoral college of at least 5,000 members.
 By law, presidential campaigns are brief and candidates
 severely restricted in campaigning, including the amount they
 may spend, the number of speeches they may deliver, and the
 number of publications they may distribute. In the 1981
 presidential election these restrictions, together with the
 authorities' screening of electoral college candidates,
 resulted in the absence of effective opposition to incumbent
 President Chun Doo Hwan, who won nearly unanimously. In the
 1985 National Assembly election, two of the most prominent
 opposition politicians, Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, were
 not allowed to participate.
 The Constitution limits the President to a single 7-year term
 and may not be amended to allow the incumbent president to run
 for another term. The next presidential election will be held
 in late 1987 or early 1988. President Chun continued to
 reaffirm throughout 1985 that he intends to step down in 1988
 to provide for a peaceful and constitutional transfer of
 power. His party, the Democratic Justice Party (DJP), has
 announced that it will convene in early 1987 to choose a
 presidential candidate. However, the main opposition party and
 most dissident groups are calling for a revision of the
 Constitution to allow for direct popular election of the
 
 
 808
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 president, contending that it would be less susceptible to
 government manipulation than the current system.
 The National Assembly, although institutionally weak, acquired
 new importance in 1985 with the holding of elections and the
 emergence of a new, more outspoken opposition party. Members
 are directly elected and serve a 4-year term. The election law
 passed in 1981 provides for a proportional representation"
 system that reserves 92 of the Assembly's 276 seats for members
 designated by the parties, with two-thirds of those seats
 awarded to the party gaining a plurality of the popular vote.
 The government party faced a strong challenge in the February
 1985 Assembly election from a new opposition party, the New
 Korea Democratic Party (NKDP), formed only weeks before the
 election and led largely by politicians recently freed from the
 political ban. The government party, the Democratic Justice
 Party (DJP), garnered a plurality of 35.3 percent and, with its
 proportional representation seats, maintained a comfortable
 majority of 148 out of 276 Assembly seats. However, the NKDP
 obtained a surprising 29.2 percent of the popular vote. The
 former main opposition party, the Democratic Korea Party (DKP),
 received only 19.5 percent. Almost all of its members defected
 to the NKDP after the elections, boosting the NKDP's Assembly
 seats to 102 and making it the largest opposition party in the
 Republic's parliamentary history in terms of Assembly seats
 held. The campaign included outspoken criticism of the
 Government and its leaders by the opposition at large rallies
 and calls for constitutional revision to allow for direct
 presidential elections, Voter turnout was 84 percent, the
 highest since 1958. Press coverage was extensive, television
 less so.
 In the aftermath of the election, the DJP pledged to practice
 the politics of "dialogue" and to "reflect the people's wishes
 as expressed in the election." The NKDP took a more aggressive
 stance than that adopted by other opposition parties since
 1980, taking the Government to task on sensitive issues
 including the handling of the 1980 civil disturbances in
 Kwangju and constitutional reform.
 On March 6, 1985, the Government lifted the political ban on
 the 14 people still affected by it. However, several persons,
 including prominent opposition figure Kim Dae Jung, although
 freed from the political ban, were still prohibited from
 joining a political party or running for office because they
 were under suspended sentences from prior convictions.
 Women are free to vote, become government officials, and run
 for the National Assembly. Women hold seven Assembly seats,
 all but two appointed by their parties. In practice, however,
 the power structure remains male-dominated, and in many
 significant respects the legal system and social custom
 strongly discriminate against women. There is some pressure to
 address women's rights; in recognition of this, the ruling
 party has formed an ad hoc committee to study the issue.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Republic of Korea does not belong to any international
 human rights bodies and usually does not welcome outside
 involvement in the human rights area, although government
 officials have allowed the visits of and met with
 
 
 809
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 representatives of international human rights bodies, including
 Amnesty International and Asia Watch. Prison authorities
 rebuffed attempts by human rights groups and opposition
 politicians to investigate conditions in prisons.
 There are no government agencies charged with the protection of
 human rights, although political parties and the National
 Assembly have committees which are concerned with oversight of
 some aspects of the issue. In March 1985 opposition party
 leaders held up the convening of the National Assembly to
 negotiate the release of prisoners convicted on political and
 security charges. While the negotiations did not result in the
 release of many prisoners, they did represent the most open
 discussion of the issue in several years and received extensive
 press coverage in Korea. The autumn session of the National
 Assembly saw opposition interpellation of government ministers
 on human rights issues including torture and arbitrary arrest.
 Although the Government rejected calls for a special Assembly
 committee to investigate human rights abuses, especially
 torture, the opposition party and other opposition groups
 dispatched investigative teams, held press conferences, formed
 special committees, and provided legal defense in connection
 with numerous human rights issues.
 A number of politically nonaffiliated private organizations
 have long been active in human rights, chiefly the Human Rights
 Committee of the Korean National Council of Churches, the
 Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, and the Korea Legal Aid
 Center in Seoul. The Committees and other human rights
 organizations submit petitions to the Government and make their
 views known both inside and outside Korea. People working with
 these groups are frequently questioned and sometimes detained
 by the security services, though apparently none have been
 arrested in the past several years.
 Amnesty International temporarily closed its office in Seoul in
 1985, over the objections of its Korean chapter, on the grounds
 that the group's independent activities were not possible under
 present conditions. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International
 remained concerned about the imprisonment of people for
 peaceful expression of their views. While it welcomed the
 release in the early part of 1984 of over 200 students, it was
 concerned about an increase in the use of short-term detention
 for people participating in public protests and about several
 well-known critics of the Government being placed under house
 arrest. It noted that it had received fewer reports of torture
 during interrogation, but that there were numerous reports of
 police violence against demonstrators both before and after
 arrest. Freedom House rated South Korea "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Republic of Korea's population in 1985 was 42.6 million.
 Over the last 20 years the population growth rate has decreased
 from 2.6 to 1.5 percent, due in part to concerted efforts by
 the Government to encourage voluntary family planning. During
 the past 20 years, Korea's export-oriented, mixed economy has
 achieved one of the highest growth rates in the world, with per
 capita GNP rising from $100 in 1965 to $2,010 in 1983. A
 notable feature of this rapid growth has been the relative
 evenness of income distribution, though many Koreans
 characterize the gap between rich and poor as worsening. The
 percentage of the population below absolute poverty was
 estimated to be 18 percent in urban areas and 11 percent in
 rural areas. There is no economic discrimination based on race
 
 
 810
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 or religion. The right to own property, both alone and in
 association with others, is recognized in law and practice.
 Improved health care and nutrition have increased life
 expectancy to 68.2 years, while infant mortality has declined
 to 29.6 per 1,000 live births. In 1980, an estimated 78
 percent of the population had access to safe drinking water,
 and caloric supply per person was 126 percent of minimum
 nutritional requirements.
 Education is highly valued in Korean society. Ninety-six
 percent of the population was estimated to be literate in
 1980-82. Primary school education is universal for both sexes,
 and over 90 percent of elementary school students enter
 secondary school. About 34 percent of all high school
 graduates pass competitive entrance exams and enter college.
 There is great social mobility based on merit in education and
 employment.
 Chapter V of the Labor Standards Law governs the employment of
 minor and female workers. Under this provision, minors under
 age 13 must have a special permit issued by the Ministry of
 Labor to be employed. Minors under age 18 must have a parent's
 or guardian's written approval in order to work, and they are
 prohibited from night work without special permission from the
 Ministry of Labor. The law requires that employers of 30 or
 more minors provide educational facilities or arrange
 scholarship funds for them. Employment of minors is
 widespread, particularly in family-operated enterprises and in
 some labor-intensive industries, and abuses of legal
 protections are common.
 The Constitution states that the Government "shall endeavor to
 promote the employment of workers and to guarantee optimum
 wages through social and economic means." Standards of working
 conditions are to be "determined by law in such a way as to
 guarantee human dignity." The Labor Standards Law provides for
 a maximum workweek of 60 hours with mutual consent of employer
 and employee, a paid day of rest during the workweek,
 compensation for overtime and holiday work, paid holidays, and
 annual leave. There are no exceptions to working conditions
 standards for industries established in export-processing
 zones. Recent statistics indicate that the average full-time
 worker spends 54.4 hours per week on the job. Korea has no
 minimum wage system, but the Government has pledged to
 institute one as part of the 5-year economic plan beginning in
 1987. Meanwhile, the Government is attempting to persuade the
 employers of the 300,000 workers earning less than 100,000 won
 ($112) per month to raise wages. The Government announced in
 late 1985 that its efforts had resulted in a decrease of
 112,000 workers in the below 100,000 won per month category.
 Responding to a series of labor disputes highlighting criticism
 of its labor policy, the Government promised in 1985 to use
 stronger measures, including fines and imprisonment, to curb
 employer abuses such as delayed wage payments, illegal firings,
 and violations of regulations on working conditions. The
 Minister of Labor reported in late 1985 that 24 employers were
 arrested in the first half of 1985 for failure to pay wages and
 for physical abuse of employees. During that period, the
 Government reported uncovering 16,000 cases of employer
 wrongdoing, including nearly 2,500 cases of non-payment of
 wages, about 150 cases of unfair dismissal, and 40 violations
 of safety and health standards.

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In the first half of 1985, 685 job-related deaths and 64,000
 injuries were reported by government sources. In 1984 there
 were 1,667 deaths and 156,133 injuries reported in connection
 with industrial accidents. A government study cited lack of
 adequate safety precautions as a major cause of industrial
 casualties in about 10 percent of all cases. The Government
 has mandated insurance to cover industrial accidents at places
 of business employing 10 or more workers. The 1981 revision of
 the Industrial Accident Compensation Law covers job-related
 medical costs, sick leave benefits, disability benefits, and
 other costs.
 Women's rights constitute a problem area. Some progress has
 been made--the family law was revised in 1960 and 1979--but
 critics contend that the law is still inconsistent with Korean
 constitutional guarantees of sexual equality. Women do not
 have equal rights with men in passing nationality to their
 children, nor do they have equal rights with regard to child
 custody in divorce cases. Women's rights groups are
 campaigning for changes in these and some other, points of the
 family law.
 Women do enjoy full access to educational opportunities. They
 are increasingly represented, though still largely at entry
 levels, in the military, the police, and in private industry.
 Other areas are more problematic. As of 1985, only 24 women
 had ever passed the bar examination. Five had passed the
 National Administration Examination, given for higher level
 civil service jobs. In general, women are not protected
 against discrimination in hiring, pay, or advancement. Some
 members of the National Assembly, however, are trying to focus
 more attention on women's rights.
