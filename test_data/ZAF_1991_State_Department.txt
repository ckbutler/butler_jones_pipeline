 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa's reform process continued in 1991 but was
 accompanied by frequent and widespread political violence,
 which claimed at least 2,050 lives from January through
 November, according to the Human Rights Commission (HRC). The
 remaining statutory "pillars of apartheid" were toppled,
 security legislation revised, and political prisoners freed.
 These actions, along with progress toward constitutional
 negotiations between the Government and the opposition,
 prompted the relaxation of many international sanctions against
 South Africa, including those imposed under Title III of the
 United States' Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA).
 An historic national Peace Accord was concluded on September
 14. Principal signatories included the Government, the African
 National Congress (ANC), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
 A "patriotic front" meeting of antiapartheid forces occurred on
 October 25-27, and the long-awaited all-parties talks were held
 on December 20-21. Most of the major parties participated in
 this historic event called the Convention for a Democratic
 South Africa (CODESA). The participants agreed to future talks
 and created several ongoing working groups at this opening
 round of CODESA. An agreement was reached between the South
 African Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) to facilitate the return of South Africa's
 estimated 30,000 political exiles.
 Meanwhile, the country's black majority remains disenfranchised
 and continues to suffer from pervasive discrimination under
 remaining apartheid-related laws and practices, as well as from
 the substantial deprivation that is the legacy of apartheid.
 South Africa continues to be ruled by a parliamentary-style
 government elected by a small white minority of the country's
 residents. Whites (13.5 percent of the population) retain the
 monopoly on formal political power. The Afrikaner-dominated
 National Party has formed every national government since
 1948. Under the 1984 tricameral Constitution, which,
 consistent with the doctrine of apartheid, prescribes the basic
 rights and obligations of people according to their racial or
 ethnic origin, blacks (numbering 28.2 million or 75.5 percent
 of the population) are denied- the right to vote in national
 elections and to be represented in Parliament. While the
 present parliamentary system allows representation in separate
 chambers for those classified by the Government as "colored"
 (mixed race) and Asian, whites control key ministries and the
 executive branch, which is headed by a state president with
 extraordinarily strong powers. The "colored" and Asian
 (largely Indian) minorities (8.4 percent and 2.6 percent of the
 population, respectively) also suffer extensive racial
 discrimination and the effects of now-renounced policies,
 including those which dictated in which "group areas" members
 of various racial groups had to live.
 Between 1976 and 1981, the Government granted "independence" to
 4 of 10 "homelands" it created for South African blacks,
 thereby stripping an estimated 8 million black people of their
 South African citizenship. South Africa is the only country
 that has recognized the "independence" of these homelands.
 Their status is included on the CODESA agenda. The homelands
 of Bophuthatswana and Transkei continue to hold prisoners
 accused of attempting to overthrow those regimes, although all
 but one of the Bophuthatswana coup plotters were released by
 the end of the year. Some government reforms, including
 revised security legislation and increased freedom of political
 expression, have not been implemented in the homelands, with
 
 
 353-
 SOUTH AFRICA
 the result that certain types.of human rights abuses are more
 prevalent there. As a result of the homelands' own security
 legislation, restrictions are especially severe with regard to
 freedom of assembly and press and the right to fair trial.
 Bophuthatswana and Ciskei are consistently cited by the HRC for
 repressive security actions.
 White control of the Government .is backed by a powerful defense
 and police establishment. Under President de Klerk, however,
 the role of the security establishment in domestic and foreign
 policymaking and-security funding overall have decreased
 significantly. The Government declared violence-prone
 localities "unrest areas" 20 times during 1991--permitting
 detentions,. the imposition of curfews, and the confiscation-of
 dangerous weapons--in affected areas of Natal and the Transvaal.
 Allegations persist that "hit squads" and a "third force,"
 involving rightwing" extremist elements .of the security forces
 or hired mercenaries, were active in fomenting township
 violence. Witnesses to violence have also alleged that in some
 cases South African Police (SAP) and South African Defense
 Force (SADF) personnel not only did not stop perpetrators, but
 even protected and transported them. In September the HRC
 issued a report which claimed that the Government had a double
 agenda, engaging-.in negotiation while at the same time
 "destabilizing and subverting" thd opposition's bargaining
 position through violence. The Government denied such
 charges. .The Peace Accord established special mechanisms
 designed to investigate allegations of government complicity in
 the violence, aid prompted widespreda discussion of codes of
 conduct for the SAP and SADF. The 1990 Harms Commission Report
 singled out the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), a clandestine
 SADF special unit, for-a number.of past human rights abuses,
 including the murder ahd.intimidation of human rights'
 activists. No prosecutions have as yet ensued. In January
 Supreme Court Justice Kriegler, contrary to. the Harms
 Commission findings, -ruled -that a.'former CCB member had told
 the truth-in implicat hg .the head 6f the SAP's forensic
 division in the murd6r of an.ANC activist.' That matter is
 still under litigation.
 In addition to the ANC, extraparliamentary organizations
 include the IFP, the Panfricanist Congress (PAC), and the
 Azanian People's Organization (AZAPO). The IFP, while open to
 all races, has remained largely an ethnic Zulu and regional
 (Natal) party. .Mangosuthu Buthelezi is both the Chief Minister
 of the KwaZulu homeland and the president bf the.IFP. Ongoing
 conflict since the late 1070's between Buthelezi's movement and
 the ANC has been one of the principal sources of violence in
 South Africa. Despite a historic meeting on January 29 between
 Buthelezi and Mandela, factional violence among their followers
 continued. The Peace Accord was cited by both as a significant
 opportunity to quell such violence.
 In July 'it was revealed that the Government had secretly funded
 transportation to two Inkatha rallies and supported an
 Inkatha-affiliated labor union.. The ANC responded by renewing
 charges of government involvement in the "factional" violence
 and stepped up demands that the existing Government yield to an
 impartial interim authority to oversee the transition process.
 In response to this scandal, the Minister of Defense and the
 Minister of Law and Order were replaced by persons less
 controversial and less strongly affiliated with the security
 establishment. President de Klerk also reiterated the
 
 
 354
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Government's willingness to consider appropriate transitional
 governing arrangements.
 South Africa's economy, while protecting the freemarket and
 property rights of the white population, has suffered from
 government enforcement of apartheid-related laws and
 restrictions, recently repealed, on black property and
 employment rights. The economy, which features a
 well-developed industrial sector and extensive agricultural and
 mineral resources, is currently in a mild but protracted
 recession. During 1991 there was no real growth. Since the
 mid-1970's, black unemployment levels have increased
 significantly, and per capita income among blacks has
 stagnated. With roughly 350,000 black entrants to the labor
 market each year, present black unemployment is estimated at 40
 percent nationwide and significantly higher in the homelands.
 Apartheid laws increased the income disparity between whites
 and blacks and have restricted the buying power of black
 consumers. The current debate on the structure of a
 postapartheid economy focuses on appropriate policies to reduce
 this income disparity.
 The homelands, which comprise 13 percent of South Africa's
 area, are generally fragmented parcels of land in impoverished
 rural areas, housing over 43 percent of the population-
 Outside the homelands, a growing black urban population of more
 than 10 million persons lives in massive townships on the
 periphery of large cities. Human rights groups estimate that 7
 million black South Africans do not have permanent shelter and
 are living in areas in contravention of the Illegal Squatting
 Act.
 The repeal of the Population Registration, Group Areas, and the
 two Land Acts, amendment of the Internal Security Act, the
 release of political prisoners, return of exiles, and an agreed
 role for the UNHCR, plus renewed access to prisoners by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were
 representative of a continuing improvement in human rights in
 South Africa in 1991. Despite unprecedented levels of
 violence, which threatened at times to overwhelm the process,
 negotiations toward a new constitutional dispensation--which it
 is generally believed will fundamentally improve the protection
 of human rights--remained on course. Nonetheless, persons of
 color in South Africa continued to face discrimination,
 restrictions on due process rights, and the deprivation caused
 by generations of educational, employment, housing, and other
 ,legally enforced inequalities. There were some further
 positive developments in the area of worker rights, but legal
 inequities, wage disparities, and societal attitudes continue
 to disadvantage South African women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The death toll from political violence, most often in the form
 of factional fighting or of criminal elements using
 factionalism as a disguise, continued at a high level
 throughout South Africa in 1991 (see Section l.g.). The
 1990-1991 levels of violence ate the highest in South Africa's
 history.
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 The number of deaths in police custody has declined from
 previous years, due in'part to the sharp decline in the number
 of detainees.' In 1991'at least 10 persons died in detention,
 according-to the HRC-and media rEports, including Cornelius
 Maqoma, who collapsed and died in police custbdy in Sebokeng,
 and Peter Masilo, who died-after allegedly resisting arrest in
 Shaipeville.' A suspected car thief, Johannes Theme, died of
 pneumonia and brain hemorrhages in Newlands, Johannesburg. A
 Johannesburg inquest court magistrate found that three -
 policemen and the alleged car theft victim,, who was permitted
 by the police to enter Mr. Theme's cell, were responsible for
 his death. The magistrate pointed out that the police had
 falsified their testimonr and.cell'register to cover up their
 actions.
 Investigations of previous years' deaths'continued. On July
 29, five policemen of the Welverdiend Unrest Investigation Unit
 were suspended and'charged with assault and attempted murder in
 connection with'at least 17 violent deaths since January 1990.
 The HRC reported that rightwing hit squads are actively
 operating and were responsible for over 50 deaths or attempted
 murders of'ANC and PAC members, unionists, and civic-
 activists.. In most of'these cases there have'been no arrests.
 No prosecutions have yet ensued from police' investigations.
 The September 1990 Hafms Commission Report found that, while
 there were no state-sanctioned "hit squads" as such, evidence
 pointed directly'to the participation of the SADF's CCB in at
 least two murders of antiapartheid activists. No decisions to
 prosecute had been taken by the concerned Attorneys General by
 year's end. The government' auditor acknowledged in February-
 that $3.5 million had been paid out for CCB purposes between
 April and July 1990--even though the Defense Minister had
 assured Parliament that operations had ceased in February
 1990--and that the Defense and Finance Ministers had given
 verbal consent for CCB operations without the State President's
 knowledge. In a subsequent court case, a judge ruled 'against
 SAP forensic c~ief,Nedthling's defamation suit against a
 newspaper, describing tesfimdny to the Harms. Commission by
 former police baptain-Dirk Coetzee asCredible. Coetzee had
 asserted thatNeethling's organization'was behind the murder of
 antiapartheid activists. 'Neethling has appealed the decision.
 Targets of alleged hit squads have frequently been
 ANC-affiliited; such as-Congress of Traditional Leaders Head
 Chief Mhlfbunzima Maphumulo, his stepfather, and his driver,
 who was murdered the day before the scheduled start of the
 judicial inquest into the Chief's death. A man claiming to be
 a former military intelligence agent confessed to being a
 member of an SAP/SADF hit squad that he says carried out the
 Chief's assassination on'February 25 in Pietermaritzburg. The
 inquest is continuing.
 Six polibemen, including two white senior officers, went on
 trial for thehkurder of-l1 persons--including 6 women and 2
 children-in a 1988 attack on a home in Natal's Trrust Feeds
 Township. At the inquest, it was found that circumstantial
 evidence linked two spe'ial constables to the murder.' At their
 'trial, which began'In October, the two ddmitted to being the
 gunmen but said that others were involved, including the two
 senior officers who had ordered the attack and then told them
 to."disappear"--which they did by joining the KwaZulu police
 force. These and two other men-were arrested and have been
 suspended pending the o'tcome'of their trial.
 
 
 356
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Other alleged victims of hit squad-type violence included
 Mziwonke "Pro" Jack of the ANC, gunned down on June 19 in Cape
 Town, and Bheki Mlangeni of the Independent Board of Inquiry
 into Informal Repression, who was killed in March by a bomb
 concealed in a tape player. In the Mlangeni case, a police
 investigation was completed on October 5 and, after being
 considered by the Witwatersrand Attorney General's office, is
 now closed. The Government said that as no perpetrator was
 found, there will be no prosecution. A privately funded
 forensic scientist refused to sign the forensic report on
 Mlangeni's death because he was denied access to vital
 information. Township councilors, such as Moses Khumalo of
 Diepmeadow, were targets of assassins presumed to be
 ANC-affiliated. IFP leader Thomas Gcabash was murdered on
 December 17 by unknown assassins. In September the HRC, in its
 publication "The New Total Strategy," accused elements of the
 security forces of continuing efforts to destabilize black
 communities, using acts of both commission and omission to
 foment violence. Both President de Klerk and ANC President
 Nelson Mandela are on a rightwing "hit list" of prominent
 political figures, according to a December 22 statement by the,
 SAP.
 The Government has been somewhat responsive to claims of police
 brutality. A 29-man team to investigate allegations of
 politically motivated violence was created in January, headed
 by a major general. The team has begun to show some results,
 including the suspension of four special constables and two
 police officers pending charges for 11 murders in 1988 (the
 Trust Feeds killings). The Commission on Violence and
 Intimidation, an independent body established under the
 National Peace Accord, was also conducting several
 investigations into police violence at year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of antigovernment figures
 disappearing while in police custody in 1991. The June 1988
 disappearance case of Maisha "Stanza" Bopape, a Community
 Research and Information Center staff member and township
 activist, remains unresolved despite international attention.
 Police state that he is considered a fugitive from justice,
 while friends and family believe he has been killed.
 Significant numbers of activists who had left the country or
 had gone into hiding have begun to reappear and, as necessary,
 apply for indemnity under government-ANC agreed criteria and
 procedures governing political offenders.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Court testimony and sworn affidavits indicate that beatings and
 torture of security detainees occurred in 1991. Alleged
 perpetrators included police officials charged with
 investigating crimes, SADF members, and homelands military
 units. Despite many charges of abuse by lawyers and human
 rights activists, few security officials were suspended or
 prosecuted in 1991. Thirty former Umkhonto We Sizwe
 (MK--military wing of the ANC) operatives, detained by the ANC
 in Tanzania and Uganda in the past 10 years for alleged crimes
 against the movement, claimed that they had been tortured on
 the orders of MK Chief of Staff and ANC National Executive
 Committee (NEC) member Chris Hani and other top ANC officials.
 Upon the return of these detainees to South Africa, Nelson
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Mandela said the ANC would attempt to "reconcile" with them,
 implicitly-admitting the truth of some of the claims.
 Common methods of torture allegedly used by both the security
 forces and opposition groups include severe beatings, prolonged
 periods of solitary confinement, suffocation, sleep
 deprivation, and forcing'detainees to stand for lengthy periods
 of time- Sick and wounded detainees were sometimes handcuffed
 to their beds. ANC detainees claimed they were put in solitary
 confinement in a- ditch for long periods of time, beaten, and
 interrogated. Murder by "necklacing" (setting-fire to a
 gasoline-soaked tire wedged around a person's body) continued
 to be a feature of the ongoing factional violence. Other forms
 of torture were also meted out by self-appointed groups of
 township residents known as "people's courts." Court-ordered
 whipping is still .used by the Government to punish minor
 offenders-
 In July a Soweto woman claimed to have been assaulted,
 blindfolded, and beaten with the'metal end of a safety belt by
 police officers. looking..for a missing firearm. Police
 spokesmen said an investigation had been launched.
 In prisons, harassment due to supposed political affiliation
 and denial, of medical attention have been reported. Some
 hunger strikers -in Bophuthatswana allegedly-were assaulted by
 prison wardens, then denied medical attention by prison
 doctors. The ICRC was allowed access in May to monitor the'
 condition of inmates staging hunger strikes in nonhomelands
 prisons on the grounds that they should have been released as
 political prisoners. These prisoners have generally-been
 treated in accordance-with internationally accepted standards.
 d. Arb.ktrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile     -
 The number of detentions decreased significantly in 1991 in
 South Aftrica, includingoin the so-called independent homelands,
 according .to HRC-statistics.  Consistent with an undertaking
 made in-its August 6, 199, agreement (the:PretQri-a Minute)
 with the ANC, the Government introduced in 1991 legislation
 amending the Internal Security Act of 1982. The legislation,
 entitled the Internal Security.and Intimidation Amendment Act,
 1991 (ISIAA), was signed. into law by- State President de Klerk .
 on June 29. It repealedz,, inter. alia, sections. of, the 1982 Act
 authorizingthe notorious-."consolidated list" of persons,
 bannings, and, indefi14it- preventive- detention. As amended, the
 law plaqes.an- absol ute limit of 10- days on the period during
 which, under Section:29, persons suspected of terrorism or
 subversion-may .be- dptained for interrogation vithout the .
 approval of -a.judge of  e Supreme Court. The -lay- also - .
 requires .that- a-physician and a magistrate visit the detainee
 every 5 days. Visits by relatives and the detainee's legal
 representative are permitted during the 10-day periodunless
 there is reasonto.believe.that such accesp..will hamper the .
 police in thpir-investigation. In a published comment on the
 ISIAA, the nationwide Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR)
 organization concluded that, while the amendments were laudable
 in many respects, far more needed to-be done (e.g., reducing .
 further the 10-day detention period) before the new Act
 conforms-with the legal norms and constitutional principles-of
 most Western democracies.
 Detention of ,persons without charge is also permitted under
 regulations applicable-to."unrest areas" declared under Section
 5(a) of the Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1953. Detentions are
 
 
 358
 SOUTH AFRICA
 authorized for up to 30 days "if necessary for combatting or
 prevention of public disturbance, disorder, riot, or public
 violence or the maintenance or restoration of public order." A
 detainee or a relative may apply at any time to the Supreme
 Court for a determination whether the detention meets this
 legal standard. Unlike Section 29 of the Internal Security
 Act, judicial review is not precluded at any time after
 detention.
 The HRC reported that, as of November 30, no one was then being
 detained under the ISIAA or the PSA ("unrest areas") in South
 Africa, excluding the "homelands." The year-to-date totals
 were 21 under the PSA and 94 under the ISIAA.
 In December the HRC listed four persons as currently detained
 under security legislation in the Transkei. The HRC reported
 the following totals through November 30 for numbers of
 -detainees held in the "independent" homelands: Transkei (5),
 Bophuthatswana (25a), Venda (0), and Ciskei (529). Despite the
 lifting of its State of Emergency in March, Bophuthatswana in
 particular continued to come under heavy criticism from human
 rights monitors for its widespread use of detention powers
 under its Internal Security Act of 1979. During an
 October-November State of Emergency in the Ciskei, over 400
 people were detained. In October two American citizens were
 among those detained by Bophuthatswana authorities for over 48
 hours for witnessing a small, peaceful protest in Mmabatho by
 the Black Sash human rights organization.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The South African judiciary is headed by the appellate division
 (Court of Appeals) of the Supreme Court in Bloemfontein and six
 regional supreme courts. The appointment of the country's
 first nonwhite judge occurred during 1991. Judges, appointed
 to the bench by the State President, serve until age 70 and may
 not be removed from office except by impeachment by
 Parliament. By tradition, judges of the appellate division and
 the Supreme Courts are appointed to the bench from the ranks of
 the elite corps of South African Supreme Court practitioners
 (-advocates").
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Dutch and English
 jurisprudence7. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including capital
 crimes, are tried in the supreme courts. The presiding judge
 or magistrate determines guilt or innocence. Juries were
 abolished in 1969. Judges in capital and other serious cases
 are empowered to appoint two assessors who serve as fact
 finders and who have the power to overrule the presiding judge
 on questions of fact but not on questions of law.
 Defendants in criminal cases may retain legal counsel, but a
 1990 study showed that 85 percent of those convicted in
 ordinary criminal cases had no representation. The idea of
 public defense was given a significant boost by the formation
 of a widely representative group, comprising members of the
 government-supported Legal Aid Board and all the major legal
 organizations, dedicated to laying the groundwork for such a
 system. A pilot public defender's office was opened in
 Johannesburg, and plans are under way for further such
 demonstration projects. In October; in the case of State vs.
 Mthwana, a full bench of the Court of Appeal effectively
 
 
 359
 SOUTH AFRICA
 overturned a 1988 lower court decision in the Khanyile case
 that.a failure to provide representation was an irregularity
 rendering a trial unfair. At the same time, however, Chief
 Justice Corbett,: in his-concurring opinion, essentially threw
 the entirequestion to the. legislature by insisting that "the
 ideal of the provision of free legal representation to all
 indigent persons accused of serious crime... is a sine qua non
 of a complete system of criminal justice,.,and any system which
 lacks it is flawed." (As a matter of practice, courts usually
 appoint counsel in capital cases in which the defendant cannot
 afford a lawyer.)"There continued to be.reported cases of
 inordinately lenient.sentences meted out, usuallyby
 magistrate'scourts, in cases involving white perpetrators and
 black victims.
 Persons charged with common crimes are presumed innocent uitil
 proven guilty, although Parl-iament has modified the general
 presumption of innocence for many security offenses. Both
 security-related..and common criminal cases are .tried in
 civilian courts.
 While the South African judiciary has displayed willingness in
 many instances to discover ambiguities in parliamentary decrees
 and apply common law principles in support of fundamental.
 rights, the power of the judiciary at all levels continues to
 be circumscribed by the principle of parliamentary sovereignty,
 under which judges possess no authority to alter, strike down,.
 or refuse to enforce properly drafted and enacted laws of"
 Parliament. Prominent opposition lawyers have called for a
 complete overhaul-of the country's.white-dominated court system
 as a necessary part of the creation of a nonracial democracy.
 There was discussion in 1991 of alternative means of dispute
 resolution, including the concept of "democratic community
 courts"-which would be consistent with certain cultural
 traditions and-resppnsive.-to the needs of. the community. In
 October the South African Law Commission issued the final
 version of its March 1989 draft.report on the protection of
 individual-rights which called for, inter alia, the. creation of
 an independent judiciary and.a justiciable bill of rights.
 These principles have been endorsed by'the Government, the ANC,
 and several other potential parties to negotiations for a new
 South African constitution.
 The Government-ANC Pretoria Minute of August 1990 included an
 arrangement for the release of persons deemed under the
 agreement to be political prisoners and the granting of
 indemnity for.nonprisoners convicted.or suspected of political
 offenses (mostly exiles; se& Section 2.d.). In the face of
 continuing.ANC and human rights groups' criticism of government
 implementation'of the arrangement (including its failure to
 meet the April 30, 1991, target date set forth in the Pretoria
 Minute), the Government agreed to the formation of an "audit
 committee"-comprising'representativesof the Departments of
 Justice and Correctional Services, LHR, and the HRC. It also
 agreed to nfettered LHR and ICRC access to the country's
 .prisons for the-purpose of thorough notification of the
 prisoner release process. The audit committee was later
 replaced by a government-ANC "screening. committee," which
 continues to. function.
 As of December 31, 6,541 applications for release had been
 received by the Department of Justice. Of this number, 1,291
 applicants had been released, while 4,782 had their
 applications refused. As of December 31, approximately 270
 release applications were still being processed. (Denied
 
 
 360
 SOUTH AFRICA
 applicants had further rights of "appeal" to an advisory body
 comprising, mainly, three judges or former judges, and
 established to make recommendations to the State President.
 ANC nominees to the body, however, refused to serve because of
 objections to the body's procedures and mandate.) The
 remaining 200 or so applications comprised those submitted
 after the deadline.
 In the context of a review and subsequent lifting of U.S.
 sanctions under Title III of the CAAA, it was determined in
 July that all political prisoners within the meaning of the Act
 (and as defined in this report) had been released. Of the
 1,000-plus nonhomelands prisoners identified as "political" by
 the HRC and the ANC in April-June 1991, approximately 230 who
 had applied for release remained incarcerated at the end of the
 year, according to the South African Department of Justice. As
 of December 31, the so-called independent homeland of
 Bophuthatswana had released all but 3 of the 166 prisoners
 considered to be "political" by the ANC and human rights
 organizations pursuant to the Pretoria Minute criteria.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During 1991 South Africa's Parliament continued the
 dismantlement of the legal system of apartheid, which
 previously intruded into virtually every area of private life.
 All remaining "pillars of apartheid" were repealed. The June
 repeal of the Group Areas Act means that racial integration in
 residential areas is no longer a crime. On the other hand,
 racial discrimination by private landlords and property owners
 is not explicitly prohibited by law, and de facto
 discriminatory practices are widespread (see Section 5).
 Legislation, enacted in June following repeal of the Group
 Areas Act, enables local neighborhoods to establish their own
 "norms and standards" regarding local living conditions.
 Although the bill specifically prohibits racial discrimination,
 critics of the legislation expressed concern that it could be
 used to perpetuate discriminatory practices. Despite the
 repeal of the Population Registration Act (see Section 3), the
 race classification of persons born before the effective date
 of the repeal remained valid for some purposes, including
 racially based voting and pension laws and military
 conscription for white males.
 Parliament also repealed the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, which
 limited black land ownership to the homelands. However, blacks
 deemed to be citizens of one of the so-called independent
 homelands still face legal restrictions on where they can
 live. By law, they are required to obtain work permits in
 order to reside in urban areas outside their homelands,
 although these laws no longer are being enforced.
 Inadequate available housing has resulted in an increased
 squatter population. Despite government efforts to develop a
 more realistic policy toward illegal settlements, provincial
 and local authorities continued to pressure squatters to move.
 Under the Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act, all
 landowners--whether public or private--are required to remove
 "unauthorized" structures from-their property. As a result,
 even when private landowners raise no objection, police often
 threaten to fine the squatters. In other cases, owners hire
 security firms to evict the squatters, usually without regard
 to the health, welfare, or alternate housing arrangements for
 the dislocated.
 
 
 SOUTH AFRICA
 The repeal of the Land Acts failed to provide for either
 resettlement or compensation of the estimated 3.-5 million
 persons who previously had been forcibly removed from their
 land. A dramatic challenge to the Government's refusal to make
 restitution occurred in April when several dozen black families
 reoccupied land known as Goedgevonden farm near Ventersdorp,
 from which they had been forcibly evicted in 1978. The area to
 which they were relocated subsequently became part of the
 "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana, causing them to lose
 their S6utf African citizenship. Shortly after these families
 returned, an estimated 1,000 white farmers attempted to destroy
 their shacks.and forcibly return them to Bophuthatswana.' The
 SAP defended the squatters with tear gas and shotgun fire,  --
 wounding four white farmers. The Government maintained that,
 although the black, families were indeed illegally squatting on
 government property, their eviction could only 'be legally
 effected-through the courts.- Subsequently, a court order was
 granted allowing the squatters' eviction but, with the aid of a
 human rights organization, the order was appealed. During the
 ongoing appeal pr-ocess, the squatters have remained at
 Goedgevonden�Farm. The Goverhment controls access to the farm,
 however, and human rights groups complain that the squatters
 are denied ready access to food and water.
 Under existing "unrest area" designations, police are free to
 make warrantless searches, seizures, and arrests. In fact,
 according to human rights lawyers, warrants.are-unusual for any
 search and. seizure of a black home, and one lawyer with over 20
 years', experience said he had never actually seen one. Police
 surveillance 6f opposition groups has continued, including
 infiltration of organizations and bugging of activists' homes.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In 1991,. according to official sources, over 2,165 people died
 in political violence and unrest in the country. The number of
 deaths was particularly large in Natal and the Johannesburg-
 Pretoriaarea. The HRC estimates the.number of unrest-related
 deaths at.2,050 through December 30, including 98 persons
 killed by security forces. The SAP stated that 145 police
 officers were kiIled in 1991.
 According to human rights monitors, political violence in Natal
 and the Johannesburg-Pretoria area, primarily attacks between
 ANC/COSATU,(Congress of South African Trade Unions) supporters
 and members-of Inkatha, has left a death toll, in excess of-
 3,190 since July 1990, with thousands more wounded and
 thousands of bomes burned and damaged. .The: causes of this
 violence- include the -power struggle .between Inkatha and the
 ANC/COSATU, as well as -personal revenge, socioeconomic
 frustration common, criminal activity, and resentment of
 police,, both black and white.               .
 According' to Inkatha figures, at least 28 Inkatha leaders were
 assassinated in 1991,, including former Inkatha Youth Brigade
 National Secretary Mbhekiseni Gwala, whp was shot dead in Natal
 in November, .and IFP Table Mountain leader Thomas Gcabashe,
 killed on December. 17. An.ANC spokesman reported, on November 7
 that more than 60 ARC-leaders had been killed during 1991 in
 political violence. -
 In many of the incidents of violence in 1991, growing tensions
 between township dwellers and squatters j(largely pro-ANC) on
 the one hand and predominately Zulu-speaking hostel residents
 
 
 362
 SOUTH AFRICA
 (largely Inkatha supporters) on the other was the kindling to
 which individual incidents provided the spark. There were
 frequent charges that police either were involved in or
 condoned attacks by Inkatha supporters on ANC supporters.
 Hundreds of people died as the warring sides battled each other
 with knives, spears, and guns, including automatic weapons such
 as AK-47's.
 In March residents of the Johannesburg area township of
 Alexandra, who were holding a vigil for a victim of violence,
 telephoned the police because residents had seen about 200 men,
 thought to be Inkatha partisans, massing in the area the night
 before. On the day of the vigil, the men attacked, and 15
 people were killed and 16 were injured by spears and automatic
 weapons. The police, despite being within hearing distance of
 the attack, did not intervene.
 In May the cycle of violence in the Johannesburg-area townships
 of Alexandra, Sebokeng, Tembisa, and Soweto led to over 2,574
 "unrest-related" arrests, according to the HRC. A triggering
 incident was the funeral of Inkatha member and Diepmeadow Mayor
 Moses Khumalo, following which residents claim they were
 attacked by mourners. News video footage showed men walking
 past police vehicles, and the police driving by twice without
 taking action. At least 24 people were killed.
 ANC members in Khayelitsha, Cape Town also alleged that police
 were involved in or covering for attacks on them in the
 township. Following a massacre which claimed 27 lives in
 Swanieville, a township near the Transvaal town of Krugersdorp,
 an Inkatha spokesman acknowledged that Inkatha members had
 attacked the Swanieville squatter camp in retaliation for an
 earlier abduction of two hostel residents. Human rights groups
 claimed police involvement, citing squatter residents' claims
 that the police had escorted the more than 1,000 hostel
 residents back to their hostel and had refused to help those
 under attack. Police spokesmen stated that the attack took
 place "while the local riot unit was busy changing shifts."
 Beginning in 1990, a new form of terror has been visited on
 township residents. Armed men have attacked over 12 trains
 full of commuters in the Soweto area, causing over 30 deaths in
 1991. In late October, for example, at least 9 persons were
 shot or stabbed to death and 39 hurt when armed men attacked
 two commuter railway stations in Soweto. On September 8, three
 gunmen opened fire on a crowd of Inkatha supporters in the
 Johannesburg-area township of Thokoza, killing 23. This set
 off a cycle of violence which left over 100 dead and at least
 i11 injured. A September 11 grenade attack on a bus in Thokoza
 resulted in the death of one person and serious injury to six.
 The next day, a lone gunman armed with an AK-47 sprayed bullets
 in a crowded bus in the nearby township of Vosloorus, killing
 four passengers. Disruption of the September 14 Peace Accord
 may have been the aim of the perpetrators in these September
 incidents.
 Although some of the attackers are presumed to be common
 criminals, there are persistent and serious allegations that
 some of the attackers are members of hit squads or are trained
 by a third force interested in maintaining terror and
 uncertainty in the township residents. The existence of such
 hit squads and a third force has not yet been proved but is
 widely believed in South Africa. Hit squads are allegedly
 small, trained units formed to assissinate leaders of opposing
 organizations or groups. The third force is said to be a
 
 
 363
 SOUTH AFRICA
 loose, clandestine grouping of rightwing elements, both in and
 out of government, who fundamentally disagree with President de
 Klerk's pol-icies. Their tactics are said to include inciting
 violence in order to pit one group against the other--e.g.,
 Inkatha against the ANC--with the aim of disrupting
 negotiations toward a new, democratic South Africa.
 The ANC and others have long claimed a third force existed; the
 IFP recently stated that it accepted the possibility. In July
 Felix Ndimene, *a former SADF operative, confessed to having
 taken part in SADF-sponsored cross-border destabilization
 campaigns. He alleged that other members of the unit were
 responsible for some of the train attacks. Nelson Mandela
 cited this as further evidenceof "third-force" backing of the
 train attackers, pointing out that they carried out their
 attacks in a well-organized fashion and in silence--which led
 him to believe they were foreign mercenaries.
 The Government responded to this violence chiefly by declaring
 20 magisterial districts encompassing 25 affected townships to
 be "unrest areas." Under this declaration--pursuant to the
 Public Safety Act--substantial extraordinary powers are vested
 in the police,: including the ability to impose-curfews,
 confiscate dangerous weapons, and detain suspects (see Section
 l.d.). The ANC and other groups have charged that, despite
 these unrest declarations, the security forces have not
 intervened effectively to prevent violence or in many instances
 have been deliberately slow in their interventions to favor IFP
 groups.
 A serious effort, spearheaded by church and business leaders,
 to bring the IFP, the ANC, and the South African Government
 together to stop the violence reached fruition in September
 with the-signing of the'Peace Accord (see Section l.a.). The
 Accord, which includes statutory provisions to be enacted by
 the Government as well as many new mechanisms, aims to curb
 violence, create more security force oversight mechanisms, and
 improve the system of bringing violent criminals to justice.
 With all sides' attitudes so hardened after years of conflict,
 however, the effectiveness of the implementation bodies remains
 to be seen.
 Incidents of" rightwing violence in 1991 included the bombing of
 a previously all-white school in Pretoria in July slated to be
 -used by children of returning ANC exiles, and the December
 bombings of a mixed race school in Klerksdorp and of COSATU's
 offices in Pretoria. The rightwing Boer Republican Army
 claimed responsibility for all of these bombings. Other
 bombings occurred in late December and continued into early
 1992. -Three whiteprotesters were killed,-4 policemen were
 shot, and more.than 50-people were injured on August 9 when
 State President de Klerk addressed National Party supporters in
 Ventersdorp. Rightwing groups had threatened that de Klerk
 would not be allowed to speak in the Conservative Party-
 stronghold,,and several thousand showed up--matched by almost
 equal numbers-'of police. Members of the crowd attacked a taxi
 carrying. three black men and a coffin, firing bullets at the
 taxi and injuring one man seriously. Police fired on the
 crowd, killing three people.
 In some instances, the perpetrators of rightwing violence were
 tried and-punished. In-March two members of the rightwing
 Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), David Botha and Adriaan
 Smuts, pleaded guilty to.7 counts of murder and 27 counts of
 attempted murder for their attack on a Durban bus in October
 
 
 W4
 SOUTH AFRICA
 1990. On September 13, they were each given seven death
 sentences. They stated that they acted to implement the policy
 of the rightwing group Orde Boerevolk that for every white
 person killed by a black, 10 blacks must die.
 There were also instances of killings and use of excessive
 force by security forces. In March, 12 residents of the
 Johannesburg-area township of Daveyton were killed by police.
 According to witnesses, the police confronted a group of
 residents preparing for a rumored Inkatha attack, gave them 10
 minutes to disperse, and then began randomly firing at the
 crowd before the 10 minutes were up. A policeman was also
 killed in the confrontation. An inquest judge found that the
 police had used excessive force in dispersing the crowd and
 that six unknown township residents had murdered the police
 officer. The Attorney General will decide whether to press
 charges. A judicial inquest into the September 1990 deaths of
 42 people killed by security forces in the Transvaal township
 of Sebokeng revealed that the police had used excessive force,
 perjured themselves, and falsified evidence before a military
 inquiry. Members of the SADF were found guilty on 4 counts of
 murder and 10 of causing grievous bodily harm against people
 who had posed no reasonable threat. IFP members were alleged
 to have been responsible for the other 38 deaths, but the judge
 found insufficient evidence to so rule.
 As of year's end, no action had been taken by the provincial
 Attorney General on the recommendations of a commission
 concerning a March 1991 incident in Sebokeng in which police
 killed 12 people and wounded over 250 when they opened fire on
 protesters presenting a petition to the local police station.
 The Commission, headed by Justice Richard Goldstone, blamed the
 police for excessive use of force, lack of discipline, and
 failure to follow proper procedures, and recommended that the
 Attorney General investigate the actions of certain policemen.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 South Africans speak freely on most issues and, although a
 number of concerns remain, the reforms launched by President de
 Klerk on February 2, 1990 continue to expand speech and press
 freedoms. Segments of the country's almost totally white-owned
 mainstream press, as well as the opposition press, continue to
 engage in vigorous criticism of the Government and its policies.
 Although the most onerous regulations constraining press
 freedoms fell away in 1990 with the end of the state of
 emergency, several cases remain pending against journalists who
 were charged under the regulations. Journalists and human
 rights activists are quick to point out that a number of
 restrictive laws remain on the books for use at the
 authorities' discretion.
 During the 1991 parliamentary session, the Government amended
 the Internal Security Act, abrogating provisions that had made
 advocating communism a crime, prohibited publication of
 statements by "banned" people, and disqualified formerly banned
 people from membership in Parliament or the legal profession.
 Also dropped was the requirement that persons seeking to
 register a new newspaper post a fee of up to $14,000. However,
 under the law, journalists may still be detained for up to 14
 days for alleged violations under other sections of the Act.
 
 
 365
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Under Section 29b of the Police Act, a journalist who publishes
 untrue information about- the police without having "reasonable
 grounds" for believing it to be true may be subject to a fine
 of up to $3,500 or a prison sentence of up to 5 years. or both.
 Several profee~iohal media -organizations have complained that
 journalists-have been harassed and prosecuted unjustifiably
 under Sectidn 205.;of'the Criminal Procedures Act, which
 empowers a magistrate'to-order someone to appear before him if
 that person "'is likely to give material or relevant'information
 as to a4._ aleige offense, whether or notit-is known by whom
 the offense-wAs committed'" Refusal to-comply can be punished
 by up to 5. yeas' imprisohment."

 the major press'freedbm cases involved the opposition
 Afrikaans-languageiVrye Weekblad and English-language Weekly'.,
 Mail, relatively small publications whose economic viability is
 threatened by costly -legal battles. The-papets were-sued by
 police Lt. General Neethling, who claimed personal defamation

 that he'had'bden involved in police hit'squhd,activities. The

 WeekbraA 'was also suedby the Witwatersrand-.Attorney Gefteral

 General of a "vendetta" against the newspaper. Although the
 Attorney ' eneral was awarded $7,000 in damages, he was ordered
 in Octobdr'to pay- both sides' legal costs--about $60,000-.-
 These decisions'may afford some protection against suits based
 on media critiaisni-of'public figures.-     .   .
 Rightiwng political ictivists continued to resort to violence
 and intimidation'of jouinalist& and"public figurds.'Throughout
 the year, journalists charged that rightwing activists; usually'
 members of the AWB, assaulted or threatened them. ANC Deputy

 Ventersdorp.. --
 Journalists do not fear political intimidation from rightwing
 extraparliamentary groups only. Complaints early in the year'
 by journalists, most of them black, of threats and intimidation
 by local ANC activists escalated until ANC Deputy President
 Walter Sisulu and 'sereral ANC senior executives held a 7-hour
 
 
 366
 SOUTH AFRICA
 meeting with black editors and journalists on July 1 to
 reassure them of the organization's commitment to press freedom.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), although access to the
 airwaves is also available to radio and television stations
 broadcasting from the so-called independent homelands and to
 M-Net, which is owned by four major newspaper publishing
 groups. M-Net was authorized in late 1990 to carry news
 programs subject to restrictions on air times but has not yet
 begun to do so. While the Government professes that SABC is
 politically independent, a wide range of the political
 spectrum, including the ANC, the liberal-leaning Democratic
 Party and the rightwing Conservative Party, characterizes SABC
 as an editorial arm of the ruling National Party. However,
 SABC has made substantial efforts to broaden the scope of
 political opinion broadcast to South Africans in the past year,
 with virtually every major political leader or newsmaker
 appearing on radio or television public affairs programs.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals with
 the exception of newspapers), the importation, possession, and
 publication of politically or morally "undesirable" works is
 prohibited. Materials subject to censorship include those
 found to be "indecent or obscene" or "blasphemous," or which
 constitute a "threat to the security of the state, the general
 welfare, and the peace and good order." Determinations are
 made by the governmental directorate of publications and
 routinely appealed to the Publications Appeal Board; they are
 not subject to judicial review except in rare instances.
 During 1991 the Directorate of Publications and Publications
 Appeal Board continued to permit publications that once would
 have been banned for political reasons, while prohibiting
 publications or films ruled to be obscene or blasphemous.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Previous security restrictions on antiapartheid organizations
 continue to be relaxed, and most of these organizations have
 -taken advantage of the changed political climate to participate
 openly in the political debate for a new dispensation in South
 Africa. -
 The 15-year ban on outdoor political gatherings, in operation
 under the Internal Security Act, ended on March 31. However,
 under still-existing legislation, specific gatherings can be
 and have been banned by any of the 350 district magistrates or
 by the Minister of Law and Order. Also, while the Internal
 Security Act remains on the statute books, the Minister has the
 power to reinvoke the blanket ban at some future date,
 according to the HRC.
 Police forcibly broke up demonstrations and protest marches
 when no demonstration permission was sought or granted. A
 Democratic Party meeting in Meloding Township, near the Orange
 Free State town of Virginia, was broken up on June 6. The
 police claimed the meeting was illegal because more than 25
 people were present; allegedly, they refused to tell the
 meeting participants what sectibn of the law they were using or
 give their names. Later it was discovered that a local by-law
 was used to declare the meeting illegal. On April 6, the
 Krugersdorp town council refused to allow a planned
 ANC/COSATU/South African Communist- Party march protesting
 delays in the Pretoria Minute prisoner release process. In
 
 
 367
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Bophuthatswana, repression-remained at a.high level; numerous
 protest -and political meetings were summarily broken up.
 Permission was denied to hold many other such meetings.
 COSATU claimed that 5,000 demonstrators at a June 15 march in
 the Eastern Transvaal town of Witbank were teargassed and
 ordered-to disperse. The town council had refused permission
 for the-march; and roadblocks and barricades were set-up.
 Police have denied that the march took place or that they
 teargassed anyone.
 The designation of an unrest area also prohibits free-
 association after curfew-hours (usually 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.),'
 allows police to search homes without a warrant, restricts
 gatherlngs, allowsfor the dispersal of gatherings using force,
 and grants indemnity against prosecution for the security
 forces.
 In the so-called independent homelands of Bophuthatswana and
 Ciskei, all'meetings of more than 20 people (except church,
 tribal, or-sports gatherings) require magisterial permission,
 Without such sanction they are unlawful and.-may be-broken up by.
 the tecurity forces with "such.force as-maybe necessary."
 Bophuthatswanazbranches "of the ANC say they often apply-for
 permisdionto:hold a meeting and do not receive aresponse..
 The power to-;ban and.restrict.persons continues-in effect in.
 all four of the Hindependent" homelands.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are numerous religious denominations and-an estimated
 3,000 independent black churches.- Religious groups may worship
 freely-without government interference.
 The Defense Act,-provides alternative service options for-
 pacifist~religious objectors, although some persons -in this,
 category have served prison terms. On January 29,.-President de
 Klerk announced-.a reduction f-rom.6.years to 3 yearsin the
 length of,-sentences for both-.nonreligious and religious,
 conscientious objectors. The latter's alternative service-
 period is one-half of the total length of the period of
 military service. -The policy df-whites-only conscription is
 under review. In July the Attorney General halted all
 prosecutions of conscientious objectors pending the completion
 of a report on the issue. There-were no-conscientious
 objectors in.prison at-the end of the year..
 -d; Freedom of Movement Within-the Country, Foreign
 'Travel, Emigration; and Repatriation.
 Since the repeal of the Pass Laws in 1986, black SouthAfricans
 have not had to carry government-issued passes proving their
 right to be in an urban area. "Independent'! homeland citizens
 still require work permits for employment outside their .,
 homelands, but-South African authorities no longer rigorously
 enforce this regulation.
 As far as is known, no passports were denied to antiapartheid
 activists in1991.- Blacks assigned to an "independent"
 homeland may now obtain South African passports. The Minister
 of Home-.Affairs continues to-have'absolute discretion to-revoke
 or refuse to issue a passport without giving any reasons for
 his action.
 
 
 368
 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa is not a party to the international conventions on
 refugees. It does not formally recognize any form of refugee
 status and regards Mozambicans entering South Africa as
 economic migrants. The Government and monitoring groups
 estimate that 250,000 Mozambicans displaced by civil strife
 have entered South Africa; most of them are considered illegal
 aliens by Pretoria. Approximately 200,000 of these refugees
 live in the homelands of Gazankulu and Kangwane. South African
 nonprofit organizations, the ICRC, and other international
 donor agencies provide relief assistance in the homelands. The
 Government permits access by international observers to areas
 where these refugees are found. Other refugees work as farm
 laborers in the Eastern Transvaal where they are allowed to
 live with temporary 3- and 6-month government residence
 permits, or in the Johannesburg-Pretoria areas where they are
 often paid less than South Africans in the same jobs.
 According to one humanitarian group, some refugees live and
 work under conditions approaching slavery.
 Apprehended Mozambicans who cannot prove they have permission
 to reside in South Africa are forcibly repatriated without an
 interview to determine whether they can safely return. This
 practice was given new legal foundation on October 1 with entry
 into force of the new Aliens Control Act, which gives
 immigration officers greater internal-control over aliens. The
 Act allows immigration officers to enter private premises
 without warning and posts a maximum penalty of 5 years in
 prison for harboring illegal aliens.
 In 1990 the ANC and the Government reached agreement on
 procedures for the indemnification and repatriation of
 political exiles, with a target date of April 30, 1991, for
 such indemnifications. As of September 25, some &,000 persons
 had received indemnity, with 215 applicants being refused.
 With the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the
 South African Government and the UNHCR in September, the way
 was paved for repatriation of political exiles. No
 applications for indemnity received under UNHCR auspices were
 refused in 1991. By-December large-scale repatriation under
 the UNHCR had begun.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the present Constitution, the extent to which South
 African citizens have the right to change their government
 depends on their race. The black majority still lacks the
 right to vote in national elections or otherwise to participate
 meaningfully in the political system. The opening of CODESA in
 December 1991 marked the beginning of negotiations on a new,
 nonracial constitution.-
 The 1983 Constitution created a tricameral Parliament with
 separate chambers for whites, "coloreds," and Asians. The
 respective groups are represented in the tricameral Parliament
 in a racial ratio of four white/two "colored"/one Asian.
 Members of each house are elected from separate racially based
 voter rolls. Each house has primary responsibility for its
 "own affairs," i.e., legislation affecting its own racial
 constituency. The State President has complete discretion to
 decide which issues are of general concern and are therefore to
 be treated by all three chambers. Matters that usually are
 considered general affairs include foreign policy, defense,
 national security, and black affairs. The terms of the 1983
 
 
 369
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Constitution ensure conto'l by the white House of. Assembly over
 general affairs.
 The National Party, which cis a lirge majority in the'-white
 House of Assembly, has controlled South African political power
 and legislative affairs since its first-parliamentary victory in
 1948." In late .1990, the National Party opened its membership
 to all races and, during the subsequent 1991 parliamentary
 session, 3S4mdembers-of the "colored" House of Representatives
 joined the'National Party, which became the. official opposition
 in that chamber:' In August President de Klerk appointed one of
 the new "colored" Nati6nal Party members, Abraham Williams, as
 Deputy Minister'of- National Education.
 The church-business initiative which led to the signing of the
 Pace.Accbrd'ielped'tr.ansfer a measure of  responsibility in the
 areas:-tilw "hd order 'a6i justice fr6lh- th e-Povernimefit-to a
 multiparty forum. Transitional arrangemezits'for other areas of
 governance are also high on the agenda of CODESA.
 The iepeal-.in 1991 of the Population Registration Act ehded the
 requirement that-children born in South Africa be classified
 according to-ra ce. -Accomp anying legislation provided-that. the
 population registdr "as it exists'at the commencement -of this'
 Act"  shall remain in effect until the'current Constitution is
 repealed. There-6re,' alth6ugh children born after June 1991ho
 longer *&re assigned to racial grous, the race classification
 of persons born before this date remains valid for the
 completionrof voters' roles. Thus, 'blicks  rights to vote and
 hold'of-ice currently remain limited to their respective
 homelands or, in the case of more than 10 million urban blacks,
 to their townships near white urban areas.
 Political rights vary within South'Africa's 10 black
 homelands. -During the period 1976-198i, the Government
 declared four homelands "independent" nations (Transkei,
 Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei), although South Africa is the
 only country'that has- ever recognized- their "independence."
 Rampant corruption and other-factors inspired successful
 military coups in Transkei, Ciskei, and Venda. At the end of
 1991, all three remained under military governments.
 Bophithatswana continues.to be governed as a one-party state.
 There is consensus that the "independent" homelands will be
 reintegrated into South Africa, and the matter is on the CODESA
 agenda.
 Within"'the -existIng homeland structures, "citizens" and
 residents'elect delegates and are governed by assemblies that
 are partly'elected partly appointed. The percentage of
 elected delegates in homelands assemblies ranges from 17 to 65 -
 percent, with a median of 45 percent. Thd Government Is no
 longer pursuing its former policy of encouraging the
 "independence" of the six "self-governing" homelands.
 The only votiH4 fights which -urban bldcks are currently able to
 exercise are-those granted under the Community Councils Act of
 1977 and the -Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The latter
 Act elevatdd the formal-status-of black'municipal -authorities
 to that enjoyed by white municipal governments . However, black
 local governments still face critic-l problems of' limited
 powers, inadequate financial resources, and- lack of political
 credibility. Voter participation in township elections is
 extremely low, and in fact there is considerable public
 pressure within townships to abstain from voting.
 
 
 370
 SOUTH AFRICA
 With the repeal of the Group Areas Act, blacks, "coloreds," and
 Indians are no longer barred from residing in areas formerly
 restricted to whites. However, existing provincial ordinances
 still prevent nonwhite residents from voting in municipal
 elections. No attempt has yet been made to change these
 ordinances. In 1991 Parliament did pass legislation giving
 municipalities the right to form administrative links, or even
 to combine with their adjoining black townships. Results of
 such linkages could include creation of a single municipal tax
 base but not necessarily a nonracial voters' roll. As of
 December, several municipalities had taken some steps to
 include representatives of other races on joint management
 committees, but no agreements had been reached on the
 incorporation of white municipalities with black townships.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1991 there was notably increased cooperation between the
 Government and human rights monitoring groups, continuing the
 trend begun in 1990. LHR, the Black Sash, HRC, the Legal
 Resources Center, -the South African Council of Churches, the
 University of the Witwatersrand Center for Applied Legal
 Studies, the Human Rights Trust in Port Elizabeth, the National
 Anti-Repression Forum, the Independent Board of Inquiry into
 Informal Repression, and other groups are involved in a wide
 range of human rights issues. LHR and HRC served jointly with
 the Departments of Justice and Correctional Services in a
 political prisoner "advisory committee," although the committee
 was short-lived.
 Despite improved government attitudes, domestic human rights
 monitors and lawyers report continued threats of surveillance,
 .detentions, and hit squads (e.g. Mlangeni). Salley Sealey, a
 monitor with the Independent Board of Inquiry into Informal
 Repression, was detained on September 24 in Khotsung, near
 Carletonville, an area in which the local police have been
 accused of obstructing justice and fomenting a destabilization
 campaign. She was accused of "insulting a police officer" and
 "intimidating the police." She was released on bail and faces
 charges. Black Sash workers were detained in Bophuthatswana in
 October for a small, peaceful protest of the homeland's poor
 human rights record.
 The extent to which the Government has evolved in its attitude
 toward human rights and related organizations is reflected by.
 the agreement reached in August 1991 between the Government and
 the UNHCR allowing an official UNHCR presence within South
 Africa, albeit for the limited purpose of the South African
 political exile repatriation program.
 After a 1986 vote by an International Red Cross conference in
 Geneva to expel a South African delegation, the Government
 reduced the ICRC staff in South Africa to eight persons.
 Negotiations between the Government and the ICRC to increase
 this number began during 1990 but were not resolved during
 1991. Although the Government did not comply with a 1990 ICRC
 request for access to detainees, regular ICRC visits to
 prisoners recommenced in 1991 after a few years' hiatus, and in
 general the Government has become more flexible in its approach
 to the ICRC.
 During April-May 1991, in connection with the Pretoria Minute
 prisoner release process, a team of ICRC representatives was
 
 
 371
 SOUTH AFRICA
 allowed free access to all 200-plus prisons within the
 Department of Correctional Services, and interviewed 1,400
 prisoners in 61 South African prisons. The ICRC also
 experienced some improvement in aacess to prisoners in several
 of the "independent" homelands but still has less access to
 prisoners in the homelands--particularly Bophuthatswana--than
 it has within the South African Department of Correctional
 Services.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,'
 Language, or Social Status
 South Africa's black majority and, to a lesser extent, Asian
 and "colored" communities still face extensive racial
 discrimination despite the repeal during the 1991 legislative
 session-of the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas
 Act, and the Land Acts. While these measures removed major
 statutory discriminatory legislation, de jure discrimination
 still exists, including separate and unequal pensions,
 educational systems, and subsidies. De facto, it is still
 difficult for nonwhites to purchase homes or to acquire
 property in certain "white" areas or to be gainfully and
 meaningfully employed according to their abilities.
 In some localities, groups and individuals--including
 officials-have tried to perpetuate discriminatory laws by
 enacting membership requirements and/or rules intended to limit
 and restrict nonwhite access to.both public and private
 facilities. For example, there have been numerous reports of
 nonwhites being denied entry to libraries, parks, and swimming
 pools through arbitrary regulations, such as user fees, which
 would disqualify them. The Government established nearly 2
 years ago the Independent Development Trust to address social
 inequities (particularly for blacks) through locally based
 development projects focusing on housing, education, and
 health. Although jobs are no longer designated "for whites
 only," employment opportunities for blacks remain limited--in
 large measure because of their inferior educational system.
 Unemployment for blacks is estimated at 40 percent. The gap in
 white and nonwhite pensions was narrowed in 1991.
 Females in all racial groups--particularly blacks--still suffer
 from legal, cultural, and economic discrimination. Democratic
 Party Member of Parliament Carole Charlewood described this
 discrimination to the media as "ancient and pernicious." The
 Democratic.Party has called for an equal opportunity ombudsman
 and a South African ministry for women's affairs which would be
 tasked to assess the impact on women of cabinet proposals and
 bills. Gender discrimination is underscored by the fact that
 the husband's legal primacy over his wife still exists. For
 example, married women may not own a house in their own name.
 Black women may not own land, an offshoot of local African
 traditional law. When a black man dies, he usually passes a
 house to his son, father, or brother--not his wife. Apart from
 codified law, traditional legal rulings work to negate progress
 for many women. Lobola (a "bride price") is prevalent, but not
 legally required, among the black population.
 Employment opportunities for nonwhite women are still found
 mainly in the domestic and factory sectors. In September the
 National Manpower Commission outlined proposals to improve the
 working conditions and salaries for domestic workers. If the
 proposals were adopted, domestic workers would, among other
 things, receive a "living wage" plus basic benefits such as
 paid holidays, pensions, and medical aid. They would also be
 
 
 372
 SOUTH AFRICA
 entitled to trade union representation. Opponents of the bill
 point out that up to half the domestic workers currently
 employed might lose their jobs if employers have to conform to
 the proposal.
 Violence against women of all races is a serious problem,
 particularly because there is very little legal redress.
 Spouse abuse is not recognized, and rape within marriage is not
 considered a crime. A husband may be charged for assault
 accompanying rape, but courts will not convict upon the
 evidence of a woman alone. Family murder/suicide is prevalent;
 the husband is the usual perpetrator, and in white families the
 weapon is usually a gun. There are no government-subsidized
 programs or advice centers for abused women, except for
 overextended welfare and social workers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 South Africa's Labor Relations Act entitles all workers in the
 private sector to freely join labor unions of their choosing.
 Legislation in 1979 granted blacks full status as employees
 with the right to form free and independent trade unions.
 Black union membership has increased some 10-fold since then.
 Although reliable statistics are unavailable, it is likely that
 as many as 2.5 million workers were members of trade unions in
 1991, and probably more than half of those members were black.
 Broad estimates of the percentage of the work force organized
 range between 30 and 40 percent of nonagricultural workers.
 The Labor Relations Act does not cover domestic servants,
 farmworkers, or public servants, hindering trade union
 organizing in those sectors.
 South Africa's unions are independent of direct government
 control. The legacy of apartheid, however, continues to
 impinge on all nonwhite workers and unionists, limiting their
 political rights and access to the legal process. As unions
 increasingly assumed the role of voicing black worker demands
 for political rights, the Government in the past imposed
 specific restrictions on their activities. It lifted the last
 of these restrictions on February 2, 1990.
 The Government did not directly interfere significantly with
 union activities in 1991. Nevertheless, there were instances
 in which authorities denied permits for trade union marches and
 demonstrations, used tear gas and batons against demonstrators,
 and arrested participants in such activities. Additionally,
 the leadership of COSATU, South Africa's largest trade union
 federation, protested that the police continue to harass them.
 Three senior COSATU leaders, including its general secretary,
 were tried on charges of kidnaping and assault in July,
 stemming from an August 1990 incident in which they brought an
 alleged police spy to their headquarters and forced him to
 participate in an impromptu press conference. They were found
 guilty on October 16, fined the equivalent of $700, and given
 suspended 1-year sentences. In passing sentence, the
 magistrate took into account COSATU's history of harassment and
 surveillance by the SAP. The Government admitted that it
 secretly financed a COSATU rival, the Inkatha-linked United
 Workers Union of South Africa (UWUSA), for 5 years until July
 1991. COSATU accuses UWUSA of violent and sometimes lethal
 attacks on its members. Similarly, the Government admitted
 financing an ostensibly private labdr relations consulting firm
 in an effort to influence labor affairs.
 
 
 373
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Some of South Africa's trade union federations are closely
 linked with political organizations. COSATU is formally
 aligned with the ANC and SACP, and is a major political force
 in its own right. UWUSA is closely associated with Inkatha.
 South Africa's second largest trade union federation, the
 National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), remains ostensibly
 independent from political groups, but has close connections to
 the PAC and AZAPO.
 South Africa extended the right to strike, long enjoyed by
 white workers, to all private sector workers regardless of race
 in 1979. Since then, work stoppages triggered by collective
 bargaining disputes--and occasionally by political issues--have
 been colmmonplace. The first 6 months of 1991 were relatively
 quiet, leading analysts to speculate that greater concern for
 job security among workers in the face of recessionary
 conditions lowered the level of strike action. The number of
 strikes surged, however, in the third quarter to bring total
 activity up to the level of the previous year. Wages were the
 main cause of strikes, almost two-thirds, followed by
 grievances, dismissals, and discipline.
 In early-November, the largest nationwide strike in the
 country's history took place. Over 3 million workers,
 representing 70 to 80 percent of the industrial force,
 participated in a 2-day general strike, protesting the
 introduction of a value-added tax and the Government's attempts
 to carry out economic and other reforms without agreement of
 black labor and political groups. Trade unions are planning
 further protest actions for early 1992.
 South African law prohibits all public employees from
 striking. Each minister, in consultation with appropriate
 offices and advisory bodies, determines annual wage increases
 for his ministry, and legislation governing each public service
 sector establishes machinery for collective bargaining.with
 staff associations and dispute resolution. In most public
 service sectors, disputes are referred to the appropriate
 minister and then to arbitration or mediation, if necessary.
 Recently, increased efforts to unionize public workers have
 resulted in illegal public sector strikes becoming
 commonplace. Strikes in the public sector accounted for 31
 percent of all strikes in the first half of 1991, compared to
 24 percent for the whole of 1990 and 1 percent in 1989. Public
 employers and workers settled their disputes through
 negotiations in most cases, and occasionally through mediation.
 South Africa does not restrict union affiliation with regional
 or international labor organizations. Government restrictions
 on foreign funding have not affected these affiliations.
 In 1988 COSATU lodged a complaint with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) against the Government, claiming that
 amendments-made that year to South Africa's Labor Relations Act
 gave preference to racially constituted unions and abridged the
 right to strike. The Government declined to accept ILO
 jurisdiction over the complaint until February 1991 when it
 invited the organization to send a fact-finding mission to
 South Africa. The ILO mission did not take place in 1991, but
 the Government, unions, and employers appear to support a broad
 investigation, of South Africa's labor law by an ILO team of
 experts.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Excluded for years from the statutory system of industrial
 councils, black unions developed a collective bargaining
 tradition of their own. Nonstatutory collective bargaining
 relations were established by agreement at the enterprise
 level, based on majority representation. The Government does
 not interfere directly with union organizing in the private
 sector and has generally not intervened in the collective
 bargaining process. South African law prohibits discrimination
 by employers against union members and organizers, and disputes
 over recognition and other antiunion activities are rare.
 Parliament passed amendments to the Labor Relations Act in
 February. The amendments, based on unprecedented talks in 1990
 between government, business, and trade unions, rolled back
 changes made 3 years earlier which were widely considered to be
 antiunion. During their talks, the three parties signed an
 agreement, the "Laboria Minute," in which the Government
 pledged to extend basic trade union rights to farm, domestic,
 and public sector workers and to consider restructuring the
 Minister of Manpower's advisory body, the National Manpower
 Commission (NMC). COSATU in turn agreed to participate on the
 NMC. COSATU has since accused the Government of delaying the
 fulfillment of its pledges and in October pulled out of the
 NMC. COSATU continues to urge the Government to extend all
 basic labor legislation to farm, domestic, and public sector
 workers.
 Collective bargaining is freely practiced throughout the
 country. The major exceptions are public servants, farm
 workers, and domestic servants. In addition, South Africa's
 labor law does not apply to the homelands, whose own labor
 legislation has generally not matched South Africa's. There
 have been clear signs that many homelands have discouraged
 trade union organizing. A thousand strikers at a Transkei tea
 plantation were teargassed by police in August. Nevertheless,
 trade union organizing and activity is on the increase in
 almost all of South Africa's homelands. A series of strikes in
 the past 2 years has prompted many homelands to reconsider
 their labor legislation. Transkei and Ciskei have brought
 their labor legislation closer to international standards.
 Similar steps appear to be under way in Venda, KwaNdebele,
 Lebowa, and Gazankulu. In contrast, Bophuthatswana passed new
 industrial relations legislation that tightens limits on trade
 union activity and renews previous prohibitions on South
 African unions organizing there. The legislation awaits the
 proclamation of the Bophuthatswana Manpower Department to
 become law.
 Private mediation services are available and have been
 voluntarily sought by management and black trade unions to
 resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Relations Act
 establishes an Industrial Court to rule in labor-management
 disputes, and its decisions appear to be balanced. The most
 common complaints filed with the Court concern dismissals,
 followed by unfair labor practices. A labor Court of Appeals
 oversees the Industrial Court and can overturn its decisions.
 South Africa has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 South Africa does not constitutionally or statutorily prohibit
 forced labor; however, it is against the country's system of
 
 
 375
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Roman-Dutch common law. It is not widely practiced, but
 reports have appeared of Mozambican refugees being used as
 slave labor on South African farms. The extent of the problem
 and the accuracy of the reports concerning exploitation of
 these often desperate people are unclear.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibits the employment
 of minors under age 15 in most industries, shops, and offices.
 The Mines and Works Act prohibits persons under 16 from working
 underground. There is no restriction, however, on the age of
 agricultural workers. Child labor legislation is only
 partia1ly enforced by the responsible authorities at the
 Ministry of Manpower and the Mineral and Energy Affairs
 Ministry. One of the best known and documented instances of
 underaged employment is young boys employed in black township
 coalyards.
 Education is compulsory for all white and "colored" children
 until they reach age 16 or pass the10th grade, and for Indian
 children until age 15. There is no compulsory education for
 black children in South Africa, including in the homelands.
 The Department of Education and Culture effectively enforces
 compulsory education for white children but not for nonwhites.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legal minimum wage in South Africa. The Labor
 Relations Act instead provides a mechanism for negotiations
 between labor, and management to set minimum wage standards
 industry by industry. At present, over 100 industries,'
 covering most nonagricultural workers, come under the
 provisions of the Act.
 A recent survey by the Labor Research Service (LRS) found that
 the average minimum wage increase for laborers in negotiated
 industrial agreements in 1990 was 21.9 percent, well above the
 inflation rate of 14.2 percent. Yet of 17 sectors which the
 survey covered, only one paid a minimxim wage above what the LRS
 estimates to be a "living wage." Further, the average minimum
 wage was some 30 percent below the living wage. Wages paid
 unskilled workers, especially domestic servants and
 agricultural workers, are often significantly less.
 Attention to health and safety issues has increased in recent
 years. The state-funded National Occupational and Safety
 Association claims that the Ministry of Manpower effectively
 enforces government-legislated minimum standards for the
 workplace environment. While its figures are disputed by some,
 the Association claims that the number of workers suffering
 disabling injuries annually has dropped significantly over the
 last decade. Most iidustries have a standard workweek of 46
 hours (which is also the well-enforced legal maximum), as well
 as vacation and sick leave. Overtime is voluntary and limited
 to 10 hours a week. The law does not mandate a 24-hour rest
 break. The Basic Conditions of Employment Act which legislates
 minimum workplace sthndards does not apply to agricultural
 workers and domestic servants. Their work conditions and those
 of workers in the homelands are sometimes far less advanced
 than in the rest of South Africa.
