 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 Since September 1, 1981, General-of-the-Army Andre Dieudonne
 Kolingba has headed the all-military Government of the Central
 African Republic,   He relies on military colleagues and a few
 civilian confidants to run the country in the name of stability.
 On several recent occasions Kolingba has enjoined party leaders
 to refrain from political activity, public or private.   He has
 said that he believes that economic development and political
 maturation must be further developed to prepare the country for a
 return to democracy, but that it will only take root if party
 politics are set aside for at least two more years.
 Rolingba's injunction against political party activities stems
 from politically exacerbated regional and tribal cleavages
 evident during 1981.  Under Bokassa, control of the Government,
 the armed forces, the Judiciary, and the sole political party was
 absolute. Local elections were held under strict limitations, and
 in one instance, the Emperor nullified an election because he
 disapproved of the winning candidate. Shortly after former
 President David Dacko took power in September 1979, he took steps
 to re-establish democratic institutions in the country.      In
 early 1980 a constitution was ratified by the Central Africans in
 a referendum and multi-party elections for the presidency were
 held in March, 1981; However, because Dacko was elected by the
 slimmest of margins he was unable to control opposition party
 agitation; much of it was tribally motivated against his Government.
 Dacko's arch-rival, Ange Patasse, the leader of the Central
 African. Peoples Liberation Movement, contested the results
 of the election and encouraged Central Africans to undermine
 Dacko.   Supporters of Rudolph Iddi Lala, a Central African
 exile in the Congo, planted bombs at several places in the
 country. One of these was set off in a Bangui cinema on July 14,
 1981, .killing three persons and severely injuring another 32.
 After serious attacks by the opposition, Dacko passed the powers
 of government to his Chief of Staff, General Kolingba.
 Kolingba's acoession as head of state was at first cautiously
 accepted by most of Dacko's former opponents. By the end of
 1981, however, his rule was more and more called into question.
 As a result, on two occasions during 1982, Kolingba virtually
 impQsed a state of siege in reaction to at first an overt, then a
 covert, opposition challenge.
 The first was occasioned in February 1982, by Patasse who returned
 from self-imposed exile in Paris. Be was greeted by six thousand
 followers when he arrived and his arrival stirred up his partisans.
 By early March 1982, tribal and regional cleavages had widened
 to the point where serious public disturbances were threatened.
 On the night of March 3, one of Patasse's sympathizers An the
 Government, Minister of Information Brigadier General Francois
 Bozize, called on the population to oust Kolingba from power.
 In the early evening hours other supporters had put up barricades
 in several places in the African quarters of the city. The
 coup was foiled and Kolingba and his security forces mastered
 the situation, although the principal plotters escaped and
 are still at large.    About 40 people reportedly were killed
 by security forces and perhaps one hundred wounded in the
 immediate aftermath of the failed coup. Though opinion varies
 whether the apparent threat of unrest justified this action, it
 is clear that many of the casualties were not active Patasse
 supporters.

 During the rest of March and April, expatriates were routinely
 intimidated and other Central Africans often imprisoned by
 Government forces. Well over 200 people were rounded up and
 jailed. Ange Patasse sought refuge in the French Embassy and is
 now in exile in Lome under the supervision of the Togolese
 government.
 The second occasion on which Kolingba imposed martial law
 occurred about the time of the August 17 arrest of Professor
 Abel Goumba, the President of the Oubangui Patriotic Front-
 Labor Party and rector of the University of Bangui.     During
 this period, tracts critical of the Government and attributed
 to Goumba were clandestinely circulating in Bangui.      These
 led the security forces to set up roadblocks throughout the
 city to forcibly inspect all vehicles, including those of
 diplomats, in contravention of international law. This practice
 ended in September. Goumba himself was detained on the basis of
 correspondence with associates, implicating him in a scheme to
 establish clandestine revolutionary cells throughout the country
 as a preliminary to engaging in guerrilla warfare against the
 Government.  Goumba is also being accused of having maintained
 contact with foreign political parties and Marxist states intending
 to abet the overthrow of the Kolingba Government.
 The presence of political prisoners is a new development in the
 last two years.  During Dacko's administration few people were
 held in custody for political offenses despite the activities of
 the opposition. At the present time about 100 persons are being
 detained on charges of subversion and conspiracy. Their rights
 to integrity of the person seem to be generally respected,
 however, since no verifiable reports of mistreatment of the
 prisoners have been heard.
 About 30 of the approximately 130 political activists  detained
 since the beginning of the year, including the two opposition
 party leaders, Doctors Bedaya-Ngaro and Mandaba, have been
 released without publicity because the Government's case against
 them was weak. A Government source has suggested that with the
 ebbing of political memories, the Government will gradually
 free the other political detainees. There may neverthe-
 less be exceptions. The wives of opposition leader Ange Patasse
 and coup plotter General M'Baikoua may be kept prisoners or at
 least under house arrest, for some time as hostages for the good
 conduct of their husbands now in exile.
 The Central African Republic is a poor, landlocked and sparsely
 populated country. Its inhabitants for the most part derive
 their livelihood from subsistence agriculture.  Only about one
 percent of the population has had university education. The
 essentially free-enterprise economy has suffered from mismanagement
 for more than a decade.   Expatriates dominate the economy and
 sometimes Government officials try to control it for personal
 gain.  Private interest is thus confounded with public interest
 and corruption as a result is deeply embedded in the ethos as a
 traditional way of doing business.  The present Government has,
 however, taken some effective steps to reduce corruption, particu-
 larly in the collection of customs receipts.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There is no evidence of assassination for political motives
 by government forces.    During the March 1982 aborted coup,
 
 
 61
 approximately 40 people were reportedly killed and 100 wounded by
 security forces attempting ho search out fleeing government
 officials implicated in the coup attempt. Killings are not
 generally condoned as far as is known by the Government or
 opposition elements.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no indication that people are being abducted, secretly
 arrested, clandestinely detained, or simply disappear as a result
 of government action.
 c. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture. The Penal Code prohibits
 torture and provides for sanctions against persons guilty of
 physical abuse.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions remain substandard, and the police are often
 brutal, but those currently imprisoned, including for political
 crimes, have not apparently been subjected to unusually harsh
 treatment. Family members, legal counsel, doctors, and ministers
 of the faith have as a rule been given controlled access to
 prisoners.   Early in the year, however, the wife of General
 M'Baikoua, who was gravely wounded during the government assault
 on the general's home following the aborted coup d'etat, was
 transferred while in serious condition from the General Hospital
 to a military camp.     She did not receive adequate medical
 attention there.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Unlike Dacko's Government, Kolingba's has engaged in illegal
 arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.   Government officials have
 argued that arrests of political activists were necessary
 to put an end to subversion and the danger of serious civil
 unrest.   Political detainees can be held without charge under
 local law for as long as two months, but at that point detainees
 must be either formally charged or released.  If charged, local
 judicial procedures (which are modeled on the French) allow for
 open-ended preventive detention while the public prosecutor
 prepares the state's case against the accused.   Some political
 detainees have been in custody for nearly a year, however,
 without counts of indictment being brought against them.
 Neither common criminals nor political prisoners can claim the
 right of habeas corpus.   Its procedural equivalent nonetheless
 exists in that within a maximum of 96 hours in the first case and
 two months in the second, a detainee must be physically brought
 before an examining magistrate who considers whether formal
 charges will be filed against the prisoner.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In common criminal cases -- except when leading personali-
 ties of the regime are involved --      the Government permits
 the French-modeled legal procedures to be fairly and openly
 applied and the laws to be properly executed.      Within this
 framework, Kolingba granted amnesty to petty criminals in
 December 1981, and again in August 1982, acts of grace which
 did not apply to political prisoners.   The courts are clearly
 dependent on the executive. Constitutional Act 2/81 says contra-
 dictorily that the judiciary is independent of the executive but
 that its independence is guaranteed by the President.
 
 
 62
 A special tribunal comprisinq civilian magistrates and military
 advisors adjudicates political crimes. It sentenced five men to
 death in May 1982, two of them in absentia, for planning the
 bombing of several facilities in the country in July and August,
 1981. The special tribunal differs from ordinary courts in that
 there is no appeal except for the possibility of presidential
 clemency, and it can only try a case after being authorized by
 the President.  On at least one occasion, Kolingba has withheld
 his authorization. Furthermore, the right of political detainees
 to effective counsel is not clear. There is an unconfirmed
 report that the briefcase of the French lawyer defending Professor
 Goumba was recently opened at the airport by government officials
 who copied the lawyer's brief.    Another attorney who has been
 vigorous in his defense of political detainees has had his
 license suspended arbitrarily.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Criminal Code prohibits the invasion of the home without
 due process.   This right is apparently not generally abused
 in civil and minor criminal cases.     If a political crime is
 involved, however, ordinance 81/035 (which instituted the
 special tribunal) authorizes     searches anytime, anywhere.
 These searches have been conducted without specific warrants.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to speak one's mind about political developments
 or to criticize the Government is circumscribed. Any individual
 delivering a speech considered potentially seditious would
 undoubtedly put himself in jeopardy. The Government also prohibits
 the distribution of tracts and literature deemed to be subversive,
 and it has arrested a score of people for doing so. Laws 60/169
 and 61/239 (Chapter 3) ban subversive writings and conspiracies
 of any sort against the internal security of the state.    Mass
 media are extremely limited and broadcast media are controlled by
 the Government.   Religious organizations and missionary groups
 are protected and provided religious freedoms by the Constitition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only sports enthusiasts and devotees of other cultural pursuits
 of a non-political nature can assemble without fear of government
 intimidation. No effective labor movement exists. The Government
 tacitly approves of an apoliticized labor federation that has
 conducted few activities on behalf of workers.   It has neither
 rallied workers around a common cause nor promoted labor strikes.
 The International Labor Organization has a case pending before it
 involving the Government's violations of labor's right to free
 association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All forms of religious activities are generally observed in the
 country.  No religion dominates the others, and none seems to
 confer either a social advantage or disadvantage. However, in one
 instance, some adherents of the Unification Church were arrested
 for distributing tracts without authorization. They were released
 a few days after their arrests, but some foreign members were
 subsequently required to leave the country after they continued
 to proselytize Central Africans.
 
 
 68
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 After the failed coup d'etat in early March 1982, all movement
 within the country was severely restricted.  Intensive security
 checks were iitermittently maintained until early September.
 Since then financial and educational constraints rather than
 government controls restrict most foreign travel and emigration.
 The right of voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized, and
 there appears to be no sexual discrimination in its application.
 The country remains hospitable to foreigners.      About 5,600
 Chadians temporarily or permanently reside in the country. There
 is no known instance where citizenship was revoked during
 1982.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of the Central African Republic is dominated
 by President Andre Kolingba who is president of the Republic,
 president of the ruling Military Committee for National Recovery,
 as well as military Chief of Staff. He rules with the assistance
 of the 23 officers on the Military Committee for National Recovery,
 each of whom also holds a cabinet post. Kolingba apparently favors
 collegial style of rule.
 Since September 1, 1981 all forms of public and private assembly
 for political purposes have been proscribed. The party formerly
 led by Ange Patasse was banned shortly after the thwarted March
 coup d'etat.  Patasse himself was exiled in Togo, and the other
 party leaders who are at liberty have been enjoined to-stay out
 of politics.  The Government apparently intends to deny.public
 participation in the political process until economic recovery is
 achieved and until it believes that political activists can play
 what it regards as a "constructive" role in society.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 Amnesty International reportedly has accused the Kolingba
 Government of detaining more than 100 persons.    International
 or non-governmental investigations of the country's human
 rights record may not be welcome by the Government, but pressures
 from such groups may have had an effect on the human rights
 situation. Early in 1982 the Government reportedly released
 several prominent anti-government sympathizers from police
 custody in response to Amnesty International's interventions.
 Some of its Western European affiliates reportedly sent as many
 as 300 letters to President Kolingba requesting the trial or
 release of the men in question.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Kolingba Government must rebuild and develop one of the
 world's poorest economies, which has suffered in the past from
 inept rule. The Government's ability to do so depends on massive
 and long-term inputs of financial and human resources from
 abroad. Current government plans focus on strengthening the
 agricultural sector (primarily through road building/maintenance
 programs and by encouraging cash crop production) and upgrading
 other basic infrastructure. These programs are designed to
 increase state revenues and thus over time lessen reliance on
 foreign aid.

 Per capita income was about $295 during 1981. Inflation and
 population growth rates caused the average Central African's
 income to diminish by 6.7 percent a year during the 1977-1981
 period. In 1981 an inflation rate of 16 percent continued
 to contribute to a real decline in economic activity and per
 capita income.  As a result, many of the country's predominant-
 ly rural inhabitants abandoned the cash economy for susbistence
 farming and hunting during the last few years. Minimum wage
 laws are in effect for both industrial and agricultural workers,
 but the number of those affected is small relative to the popula-
 tion as a whole, owing to the low level of economic development.
 Despite the ravages of tropical diseases and an infant mortality
 rate of 149 per 1000 live births, the country's population of
 about 2.3 million still grows by 2.2 percent a year.      Life
 expectancy at birth is only 44 years because of the woefully
 inadequate or simply non-existent health care in some parts of
 the country. Although health care is accorded a high priority by
 the Government, it is handicapped by lack of trained personnel
 and the inaccessibility of large parts of the country.
 Government support for education occupies an important place in
 the government budget. Total school population approximates
 280,000 (primary through university levels). Still, the literacy
 rate is estimated to be no higher than 18 percent, and it may be
 lower in rural areas. The Ministry of Education, therefore,
 plans to increase expenditures to provide better trained teachers
 and more schools to Central Africans living outside the capital.
 Due to the low level of economic development, women are generally
 accorded a lower status than men in Central African society.
 Polygamy is common, and the legal system and traditional practice
 tend to support the rights of wives and all children of such
 marriages.  Women were legally equal to men during the Bokassa
 era, and several held high office in the Government and in the
 imperial court.  In principle this practice was continued under
 Dacko although no women were named to his cabinet. There are no
 female cabinet members in the Kolingba Government.
