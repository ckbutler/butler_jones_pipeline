 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary form
 of government. The role of the Grand Duke is mainly ceremonial and administra-
 tive. The Prime Minister is the leader of the dominant party in the popularly elected
 Parliament The Council of State, whose members are appointed by the Grand
 Duke, serves as an advisory body to the Parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 The government effectively controls the security apparatus, which consists of po-
 lice and gendarmerie.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous market economy with active industrial and service
 sectors. The standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 The Constitution and laws- provide for the full range of human rights, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1.Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 1372
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government per-
 mits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.
 Judicial warrants are required by law for arrests except in cases of hot pursuit.
 Within 24 hours of arrest, the police must lodge charges and bring suspects before
 a judge. Suspects are given immediate access to an attorney, at government expense
 for indigents. The presiding judge may order release on bail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The independent judiciary is headed by the Supreme Court, whose members are
 appointed by the Grand Duke. Defendants are presumed innocent. They have the
 right to public trials and are free to cross-examine witnesses and to present evi-
 dence. Either the defendant or the prosecutor can appeal a ruling; appeal results
 in a completely new judicial procedure, with the possibility that a sentence may be
 increased or decreased.
 In response to a 1995 decision by the European Court of Human Rights, the Gov-
 ernment established an administrative court system to review citizen challenges to
 legislation.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 A police search in October of the house and office of a journalist who published
 a story alleging corruption on the part of the Interior Minister pointed up the need
 for reform of the 1869 press law. Under this law, a civil case can be brought against
 journalists to force them to reveal sources of information; they can be fined for re-
 fusing to reveal a source.
 Print media are privately owned. Television broadcasting rights, previously held
 exclusively by the privately owned national radio and television company, were ex-
 tended in 1997 to a regional cable television company. The Government issues li-
 censes to private radio stations. Radio and television broadcasts from neighboring
 countries are freely available.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no state religion, but the State
 pays the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergy, and several
 local governments maintain sectarian religious facilities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum and granted it to 46 persons through October. Through August
 the Government received 703 requests for refugee status and expected to receive
 over 1,300 total applications during the year. Most of the applicants are Albanian
 or from the former Yugoslavia. The Government does not expel those having a valid
 claim to refugee status; there were no reports of the forced return of persons to
 countries where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a multiparty democracy. Suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 of age and above, and balloting is secret. National parliamentary elections are held
 every 5 years.
 Women are active in political life. Of 60 members of Parliament, 11 are women,
 as are 4 members of the Cabinet. The mayors of several major municipalities, in-
 cluding the capital, are women.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction. Government offi-
 cials are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits racial, sexual, or social discrimination, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions. Blatant societal discrimination occurs only rarely.
 Women.-Neither society nor the Government is tolerant of violence against
 women, and the Government prosecutes persons accused of such crimes. The Gov-
 ernment funds organizations providing shelter, counseling, and hot lines. In 1997
 women's shelters provided refuge to 342 women and 363 children. Information of-
 fices set up to respond to women in distress reported receiving a total of 3,921 tele-
 phone calls in 1997. Of the sheltered women and children, 188 reported problems
 of domestic violence. In 1997 women's groups also saw an increase in the number
 of immigrant women seeking assistance, particularly from the former Yugoslavia.
 Women enjoy the same property rights as men. In the absence of a prenuptial
 agreement, property is divided equally upon the dissolution of a marriage.
 The law mandates equal pay for equal work, and the Ministry for the Promotion
 of Women has a mandate to encourage a climate of equal treatment and oppor-
 tunity. However, according to government reports, women are paid from 9 to 25 per-
 cent less than men for comparable work, depending on the profession. The dif-
 ferences are least in the highest paid professions and more substantial at lower sal-
 ary levels. To date there have been no work-related discrimination lawsuits in the
 courts. Women constitute 38 percent of the work force.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care, which are available equally to girls and boys. The law mandates school attend-
 ance from the ages of 4 to 16. Schooling is free through the secondary level, and
 the Government provides some financial assistance for postsecondary education.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children. Child abuse does not appear to
 be widespread, and laws against it are enforced. In 1996 the main pediatric hospital
 dealt with approximately 260 cases of suspected child abuse, not all of which were
 substantiated. A hot line maintained by a nonprofit organization received 1,056 tele-
 phone calls in 1997 from children and youth in distress. In 1997 the Government
 sponsored several workshops at primary schools, high schools, and youth centers to
 highlight the problem of sexual abuse. The Government also organized training ses-
 sions for law enforcement professionals on responding to sexual abuse cases.
 People With Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination against people with
 disabilities in employment, education, and the provision of other state services. The
 law does not directly mandate accessibility for the disabled, but the Government
 pays subsidies to builders to construct "disabled-friendly" structures. Despite gov-
 ernment incentives, only a modest proportion of buildings and public transportation
 have been modified to accommodate people with disabilities.
 The Government helps disabled persons obtain employment and professional edu-
 cation. By law, businesses and enterprises with at least 25 employees must fill a
 quota for hiring disabled workers and must pay them prevailing wages. The quotas
 are fixed according to the total number of employees, and employers who do not ful-
 fill them are subject to sizable monthly fines. There have been no known complaints
 of noncompliance.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although foreigners constitute over 30 per-
 cent of the total population, antiforeigner incidents remain infrequent. The Govern-
 ment granted to resident citizens of European Union member countries the right to
 vote and run in municipal elections. Minimum residency requirements are 6 years
 for voters and 12 years, including 6-months residence in the commune, for can-
 didates to run for town council offices. The Government-supported, nonprofit
 "League Against Racism" organized community education and awareness projects in
 conjunction with the 1997 European Year Against Racism.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the right to associate freely and
 choose their representatives. About 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Mem-
 bership is not mandatory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The
 two largest labor federations are linked to, but organized independently of, major
 political parties. The law prohibits discrimination against strike leaders, and a labor
 tribunal deals with complaints.
 
 
 1374
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, except for government
 workers such as police, armed forces, and hospital personnel providing essential
 services. Legal strikes may occur only after a lengthy conciliation procedure between
 the parties; the Government's National Conciliation Office must certify that concilia-
 tion efforts have ended for a strike to be legal.
 In 1998 there were two legal strikes. In Jan   Luxembourg Railway Company
 (CFL) employees went on strike to protest planned government pension reforms. In
 July the largest civil service trade union (CGFP) also went on strike to protest the
 pension reform plans. The CGFP was joined by employees of local authorities, the
 railway, and the post office for the 24-hour strike on July 21, during which public
 administration and services were brought to a standstill.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for and pro-
 tects collective bargaining, which is conducted in periodic negotiations between cen-
 tralized organizations of unions and employers. Enterprises-having 15 or more em-
 ployees must have worker representatives to conduct collective bargaining. Enter-
 prises with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In enterprises with more
 than 1,000 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of di-
 rectors must be employee representatives.
 The law provides for adjudication of employment-related complaints and author-
 izes labor tribunals-to deal with them. A tribunal can fine anemployer found guilty
 of-antiunion discrimination, but it cannot requirq the employer to reinstate a worker
 fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits- forced or com-
 pulsory labor by children and adults, and it is not-known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effec-
 tively (see Section 6.c.). The law prohibits the employment of children under the age
 of 16 and requires all children to remain in school until the age of 16. Apprentices
 who are 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job training. Public
 education is free and universal through the secondary level.
 Adolescent-workers under the age of 18 have additional legal protection, including
 limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continuously. The
 Ministries of Labor and- Education effectively monitor the enforcement of child labor
 and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law provides for minimum wage rates at
 levels that vary according to the- worker's age and number of dependents. The mini-
 mum wage for. a single worker over the age of 18 is $7.67 (Lux F 267) per hour.
 Supporting a family is difficult on the minimum-wage, but most employees earned
 more than the minimum.
 The law mandates a-maximum -workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is permitted in continuous-
 process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance and se-
 curity personnel; other industries have -requested permission for Sunday work,
 which the Government has granted on a case-by-case basis. Work on Sunday, al-
 lowed-for some retail employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at
 double the normal wage; and employees must be given compensatory time off on an-
 other day, equal to the number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest
 - breaks for shift workers and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day
 including overtime. All workers receive at least- 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly, in
 addition to paid holidays.
 The law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provides se-
 vere penalties for infractions. The Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor and
 the Accident Insurance Agency of the Social Security Ministry- carry out their in-
 spections effectively.
 No laws or.regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment,
 but every worker has the right to- ask the Labor Inspectorate to make a determina-
 tion, and the Inspectorate usually does so-expeditiously.
