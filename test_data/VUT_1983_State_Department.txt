 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, governed under a single-chamber parliamentary system,
 became independent in 1980 following more than 70 years of
 joint British-French rule when it was known as the New
 Hebrides. Independence was accompanied by temporary political
 turbulence, including an attempt at secession by one province,
 which left a legacy of suspicion of outside interference.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. Elections
 are vigorously contested and fair; the courts are independent
 and solicitous of individual rights; and the police and
 military are under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles those of other Pacific island
 states in its dependence on international prices; however,
 tourism earns more foreign exchange than all exports combined.
 Vanuatu has gained some revenue as a tax haven, although
 returns from ship and corporation registration are small.
 Until recently, attempts to attract foreign investment have
 been hampered by uncertainty over land rights; however, a new
 land law was enacted in 1983 and leases are being signed.
 Early in 1983, freedom of the press suffered a setback with the
 closure of the country's one independent newspaper following
 deportation of its editor, a citizen of Great Britain, for
 publishing stories critical of alleged activities of government
 leaders. Elections to the National Parliament in November 1983
 were vigorously contested and democratically conducted. Most
 of the strains from the 1980 secessionist rebellion have
 subsided--only the rebel leader, Jimmy Stevens, is known still
 to be in jail.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of life
 Due process is strictly observed. Neither the Government nor
 any organized group has recourse to political violence.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional guarantees against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are complied with in practice and
 enforced by the courts. Prisoners also have recourse to an
 Ombudsman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no politically motivated arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. Suspects have free access
 to a lawyer of their choice. The constitutional guarantee that
 suspects will be informed of charges and given a speedy hearing
 before a judge is observed.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until proof of guilt, prohibition
 against double jeopardy, and the right of appeal to the Supreme
 Court. The courts are independent of military or executive
 interference. There were no reports in 1983 of arbitrary or
 unfair exercise of judicial authority.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution, but
 Vanuatu's only private, national newspaper had to suspend
 publication in March 1983 when the publisher, a British citizen,
 was deported for allegedly threatening Vanuatu's security and
 slandering government leaders. The publisher's appeals were
 dismissed by the courts. The Government currently publishes the
 country's only remaining national newspaper, a weekly, and runs
 the national radio station. There is no commercial radio or
 television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties or
 trade unions in Vanuatu. There are two main political parties and
 a newly formed smaller party. Vanuatu has a small but active
 trade union movement with the right to organize, strike, and
 bargain collectively. As of 1980, there were 16 registered trade
 unions and six employer associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations work
 without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel domestically and abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates competed
 in the parliamentary elections in 1983; both the campaign and
 voting were considered by outside observers to be fair. Elections
 to provincial and local councils also are contested and fair.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has publicly expressed willingness to permit
 investigation by qualified and objective outside observers. While
 there were allegations of mistreatment of prisoners following the
 1980 rebellion, there have been no such allegations of human
 rights violations in the past year.

 Amnesty International did not include Vanuatu in its 1983
 report. Freedom House in its 1983 report downgraded its rating
 of Vanuatu from "free" to "partly free," noting the closure of
 the only critical newspaper and stating that "radio is not
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Buoyed by tourism, which has expanded steadily since
 independence, the Vanuatu economy weathered the recent
 international recession with few problems. Real Gross Domestic
 Product rose an estimated two percent in 1982, and there was a
 balance-of-payments surplus of $25 million. The rate of
 inflation was only three percent. Communal land ownership by
 clans is thought to inhibit economic development, but a system
 of land leasing has been implemented during the past year in an
 attempt to ameliorate this difficulty.
 Government services are provided without discrimination.
 Education is heavily dependent on British and French aid and on
 church schools. The population, at 127,000 in 1983, has grown
 at an average rate of over three percent in recent years. The
 infant mortality rate is 36.70 per 1,000 live births. The
 calorie supply was about 87 percent of requirements in 1977.
 Women have equal legal rights, but traditional culture has
 discouraged their moving into leadership roles. The only
 female candidate for the National Parliment in 1983 was
 defeated by a small margin.
