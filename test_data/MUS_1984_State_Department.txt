 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small, densely-populated island country with a
 parliamentary democracy modeled after that of Great Britain.
 Mauritius is governed by a Prime Minister, a Council of
 Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. Parliamentary,
 municipal, and village council elections take place at regular
 intervals. A Governor General with largely ceremonial powers
 is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister and
 represents Queen Elizabeth II, who is also titular head of
 state as Queen of Mauritius.
 Political and civil rights are protected under the Mauritian
 Constitution and exercised in practice. There are four major
 political parties with wide-ranging ideologies, and a host of
 minor parties. Executive power has changed hands twice in the
 last three years through general elections supervised by an
 independent electoral commission. Over 80 percent of eligible
 voters participated in these elections. Religious freedom is
 uninhibited in this multi-religious society, which includes
 large Hindu, Christian, and Muslim populations. Mauritius has
 a free and active press, with 11 newspapers for a population
 of one million. There are about 290 labor unions which enjoy
 considerable freedom'in contract negotiations and within the
 political arena, but their right to strike is limited by law.
 Mauritius' independent judiciary administers a legal system
 based principally on the British model. Since independence in
 1968, there have been no substantiated reports of political
 killings, disappearances, torture, or degrading treatment of
 prisoners. There is equal protection for women under the law,
 although women remain underrepresented in the upper echelons
 of government and business.
 Mauritius has a per capita income of $1,240. Its mixed
 economy, based on sugar production, tourism, and simple
 manufacture for export, including textiles, has both a strong
 private sector and a number of state-owned enterprises. In
 1984, the economy started to pull out of a recession, and
 unemployment, which peaked to 25 percent in 1983, fell to
 about 20 percent by mid-1984. In recent years, Mauritius has
 adopted austerity readjustment policies consistent with
 guidelines from the International Monetary Fund and the World
 BanK. Health and education systems are state-supported, and
 of generally adequate quality. The literacy rate is 79
 percent.
 There were unsubstantiated allegations of government petty
 harassment of opposition figures in 1984, including
 surveillance and wiretaps. Political activity continued at an
 active pace, however. Political rallies were held regularly,
 and a major congress by the leading opposition party attracted
 about 40,000 supporters in September. Opposition newspapers
 constantly criticized policies and public figures of the
 governing coalition. A law to require newspapers to post a
 $20,000 bond against libel suits was passed by Parliament in
 March, but was not implemented following widespread protests.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1984. There
 have been no such reports since independence in 1968.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance of persons in Mauritius
 for political causes.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited by law. Although
 there have been no reports of degrading treatment or
 punishment, there have been reports of serious overcrowding in
 local prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no reports of arbitrary arrests and/or
 detention since the early 1970's, when opposition political
 and trade union leaders were jailed, accused of creating chaos
 and anarchy. Habeas corpus exists in practice, and a person
 can be held only up to 48 hours without being charged. Bail
 is common. Exile has never been used in Mauritius as a means
 of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of a Supreme Court with appellate powers and a series
 of lower courts. Final appeal to the Queen's Privy Council in
 the United Kingdom is provided for by the Constitution. There
 are no political or military courts. The courts have a very
 good record of assuring fair, public trials to those charged
 with crimes. Defendants have the right to private or
 court-appointed legal counsel. There have been no allegations
 by political parties, human rights groups, or the media of
 political bias in the judiciary. In the past the judiciary
 has made several politically unpopular decisions, such as
 finding a prominent minister guilty of corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The search of personal property or premises is
 allowed only under clearly specified conditions by court
 order, or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed. There are no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the
 state or political organizations into the private lives of
 individuals. There have been unproven allegations that the
 Government through its intelligence apparatus occasionally
 opens mail, carries out wiretaps, and exercises surveillance
 on opposition leaders.

 MAURITIUS
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected both in the
 Constitution and in practice. Eleven privately owned daily
 and weekly newspapers, representing widely varying hues of the
 political spectrum, freely express partisan views. Newspapers
 are subject only to the legal constraints of libel laws. In
 April 1984, the Parliament passed the Newspaper and
 Periodicals Act which, among other things, required each
 newspaper to post a bond equivalent to $20,000 to cover
 possible liability in legal suits, a large sum by Mauritian
 standards. After a series of protests by journalists and the
 opposition party, during which 44 journalists were arrested
 for civil disturbances, a government commission, led by the
 former Supreme Court Chief Justice, was formed to review the
 Bill. The Commission advised the Government not to implement
 the Act and not to prosecute the journalists. The Government
 accepted these recommendations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal proscriptions against the right of
 individuals to form associations, including political parties,
 trade unions, and religious associations. Although the Public
 Order Act requires police permission for demonstrations and
 mass meetings, sucn permission is rarely refused. Political,
 cultural, religious, and other mass assemblies are
 commonplace. For example, a congress sponsored by the
 opposition party in September/October 1984 was held without
 incident and played host to some 40,000 followers. This was
 in the tradition of the 1982 and 1983 parliamentary campaign,
 when daily political rallies of the competing parties
 regularly attracted large numbers without any reports of
 violence or civil disorder.
 Mauritius has one of the freest and most widespread trade
 union movements in Africa, with seven trade union
 confederations and numerous unaffiliated unions. With about
 290 unions the Mauritian labor movement represents some 90,000
 workers, over one-fourth of the work force. The largest
 confederation, the Mauritian Labor Congress, is a member of
 the democratically-oriented International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Unions are free to press wage demands,
 link with domestic political parties and international
 organizations, and address political issues. One of the
 leading federations actively supports the opposition party.
 Nonetheless, some union officials charge that the Industrial
 Relations Act, which requires a 21-day cooling-off period,
 followed by binding arbitration, has the effect of making most
 strikes illegal. Others claim that the ease of registering a
 union, requiring only seven members, has been used to fragment
 the union movement in Mauritius. The Government is
 considering new legislation to amend the Industrial Relations
 Act to respond to these complaints.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Christians,
 Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, as well as a number of other
 religions and sects, openly practice and teach their own
 religion without prejudice. All religious institutions
 
 
 224
 MAURITIUS
 receive state subsidies in proportion to their number of
 adherents. There is no state-sanctioned discrimination
 against any of Mauritius' ethnic and religious communities.
 Political candidates are often chosen on the basis of their
 ethnic or religious affinity and the composition of the
 particular electoral constituency. In the National
 Parliament, 8 of the 70 members are selected via a complex
 'best loser' system, designed in part to assure that all
 ethnic groups are adequately represented. There have been
 allegations that certain communities, particularly the Muslim,
 are underrepresented in the civil service, particularly at
 higher levels.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. Fewer than 10
 people have applied for refugee status in Mauritius during the
 past 3 years. There is no forcible repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Mauritius is a participatory democracy with a parliamentary
 system patterned after that of Great Britain. The country is
 governed by a freely elected, unicameral legislative assembly,
 with executive direction coming from a Council of Ministers
 headed by the Prime Minister. The parliamentary opposition is
 headed by an official leader elected by opposition members of
 the legislative assembly. Although there have been proposals
 to make Mauritius a republic, a Governor General appointed on
 the advice of the Prime Minister still represents Queen
 Elizabeth II, who is also Queen of Mauritius. The Governor
 General's role is largely ceremonial, with real executive
 power resting with the Prime Minister. The Governor General
 could play a significant role, however, should elections be
 very close, since he would designate the person he believes
 could best form a new government. Voting and running for
 office are open to all citizens 18 years of age and over.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all types of
 political, business, and social activities, and a few hold
 high positions. Nonetheless, conservative religious and
 ethnic attitudes do inhibit women, and only 4 of the 70
 parliament members and 1 of 19 ministers are women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known reports of requests by outside or domestic
 organizations to investigate the human rights situation in
 Mauritius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in
 Mauritius. There is also a local Roman Catholic human rights
 organization, the Justice and Peace Commission. Neither of
 these organizations has expressed concern with the Government
 of Mauritius about its human rights situation. Amnesty
 International did not have an entry on Mauritius in its 1984
 Report. Freedom House rates Mauritius "free.'

 MAURITIUS
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritius is a small, relatively prosperous island state with
 a population of just over one million and a 1982 per capita
 gross national product of $1,240. The Mauritian economy is
 based on sugar production, tourism, and simple manufactures
 such as textiles. A strong private sector works hand-in-hand
 with the Government and with state-owned enterprises. The
 recent international recession hit Mauritius hard, cutting
 foreign demand for manufactures, lowering world sugar prices,
 and reducing tourism. Unemployment rose to about 25 percent
 *at the end of 1983, with serious impact on the poorer segments
 of the population. Despite Government efforts to expand its
 unemployment insurance program and a large social security
 fund, an effective social safety net does not yet exist.
 Still, the economy picked up somewhat in 1984, with a net
 increase of about 10,000 jobs. Unemployment fell to about 20
 percent. Fewer than one in eight Mauritians are below the
 absolute poverty level, the same as in 1979.
 The revival in 1984 was complemented by expanded assistance
 from bilateral and multilateral sources, including the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In accordance
 with large loans from these agencies, the Government of
 Mauritius has adopted an austere program of structural
 readjustment, designed to reduce government involvement in the
 economy, encourage industrial and tourism expansion, diversify
 agriculture, and rejuvenate the sugar sector.
 Mauritius places a high priority on education, with the
 Education Ministry receiving the largest ministerial
 allocation in the 1984/85 budget: about $38 million.
 Education in both English and French is free and accessible to
 all through secondary school. Enrollment at the primary level
 is virtually universal. Adult literacy is 79 percent (1980
 figure). The nation's only university teaches a technical
 curriculum to 400 students. Other secondary school graduates
 must go abroad for university education.
 Medical care is available to all Mauritians through an
 expanding network of free government hospitals and clinics.
 The system emphasizes basic health needs and preventive care.
 Those requiring complex treatment must travel abroad. With
 one of the world's highest population densities, Mauritius has
 stressed mother-child health care and family planning. The
 infant mortality rate has declined to about 30 per 1,000 live
 births according to World Bank data, while the population
 growth rate has been halved in the past two decades to 1.3
 percent in 1984. Life expectancy at birth is about 67 years.
 Malnutrition is not a serious problem, even in the poorer
 rural areas, with calorie supply exceeding nutritional
 requirements by 14 percent in 1977, the latest available
 data. The Government has also concentrated on expanding
 access to safe water, especially in rural sectors, where only
 about one in five had such access in 1975. In urban areas 100
 percent of the population has access to safe water. With the
 help of foreign donors, including the U.S. Agency for
 International Development, about half the rural sector now has
 potable water.
 The Mauritian Government is on record as seeking to improve
 the status of women. Recent amendments to laws ranging from
 emigration to inheritence have removed sexually discriminatory
 
 
 226
 MAURITIUS
 sections. The emphasis on mother-child health care has
 encouraged food supplements for pregnant women, greater
 prenatal care, and female education. There is a Ministry of
 Women's Rights and Family Affairs, headed by a woman.
 Nonetheless, despite a six-fold increase in the 1984/85
 budget, this Ministry receives only $300,000. The literacy
 rate in 1980 for women was 73 percent, compared to 86 percent
 for men. Women tend to occupy the less skilled and lower paid
 jobs in the economy, such as operators in the textile plants.
 They are particularly susceptible to layoffs during economic
 downturns.
