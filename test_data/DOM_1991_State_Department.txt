 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a
 popularly elected president and a bicameral congress. In
 practice, the system heavily fa'vors the executive branch. The
 Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary whose members are
 appointed-by the Senate. Political parties representing the
 ideological spectrum from left to right freely participate in
 elections. President Joaquin Balaguer was inaugurated for a
 new 4-year term in August 1990.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of
 Investigation (DNI), and the military serve as the security
 services. The PN has general investigative and principal
 arrest authority. The military has investigative and general
 arrest authority for armed forces personnel and may arrest
 suspects apprehended by military patrols. The armed forces may
 be used to back up the PN. The DNI is the principal national
 investigative body for national security concerns and does not
 have arrest authority. The National Drug Control Directorate
 (DNCD), formed in 1988, coordinatos domestic and international
 narcotics programs and brings under a single authority elements
 of the PN, military, and DNI. All security services are under
 control of the Government and are generally responsive to
 civilian authority, but some members of these organizations
 were responsible for human rights abuses (see below).
 Major sectors of the diverse Dominican economy include
 agriculture, fishing, construction, housing, commerce, and
 manufacturing. State-owned firms are heavily involved in the
 economy, especially the State Sugar Council (4EA), the Dominican
 Electricity Corporation (CDE), and the Consortium of State
 Enterprises (CORDE). Tourism is the largest earner of foreign
 exchange, and exports from the free trade zones exceed those of
 the rest of the country. The volume of traditional exports,
 such as sugar and ferronickel, remains significant but is not
 expanding. Real gross domestic product was expected to fall 2
 to 5 percent in 1991; the country has a $4.5-billion foreign
 debt. The rate of inflation dropped from 101 percent in 1990
 to a single digit figure in 1991.
 Principal human rights problems in 1991 were ihcidents of
 illegal detention and mistreatment of civilian suspects by
 police, the poor treatment of Haitian migrant workers, the
 sweeping repatriation of Haitian workers, an antiquated
 promanagement Labor Code, and antiunion discrimination in free
 trade zones, as well as police sweeps that sometimes targeted
 labor activists to discourage general strikes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There was one known case of political killing in 1991. In
 mid-February, police shot political activist Pedro Rafael
 Almanzar in the city of Salcedo, reportedly while he was
 leading protests against inadequate utility services. He died
 of the wounds on March 30, sparking 2 days of protest strikes
 and disturbances. The police reported that the policeman
 accused of shooting Almanzar escaped from custody on March 9,
 further contributing to public anger. He was still claimed to
 be missing at year's end.
 
 
 573
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 There were several incidents of nonpolitical extrajudical
 killings by police or military personnel, including one
 incident of a civilian killed by a drunken policeman and
 another involving a soldier's attempt to extort money. In
 September the military handed over to civilian authorities an
 officer and four enlisted men involved in the August 27
 shooting of a civilian who was breaking forestry protection
 laws. In a separate incident, three forestry personnel (a
 civilian and two army enlisted men) were arrested in September
 for allegedly killing a farmer in Duveaux. A police officer
 and a member of the army attached to the DNCD were cashiered
 and placed at the disposition of civilian courts for their part
 in the March death of a drug suspect in Barahona. During the
 July 9-11 general strike, a young man said to be suffering from
 tuberculosis died apparently after his condition was aggravated
 by exposure to police tear gas, and another youth was killed by
 stray gunfire. Although the Government has responded by
 arresting and dismissing some officials in these incidents, as
 of year's end there had been no prosecutions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible sources, including lawyers' associations, the Roman
 Catholic Church, and human rights organizations, continue to
 charge that detainees and prisoners are sometimes beaten by
 police to provide information or confessions. On September 4,
 a naturalized U.S. citizen alleged that he was beaten and
 tortured on two separate occasions.by the DNCD to the extent
 that he required hospitalization. Since then, two other
 American citizens have complained of physical abuse at the
 hands of DNCD agents. At the end of the year, the only
 government response to U.S. Embassy protests in all three
 incidents has been a promise that the cases will be examined by
 the proper authorities. The Chief of the National Police
 reported that between January 1 and November 27, 2,218
 policemen had been fired or retired for offenses ranging from
 insubordination to murder. The National Police has also fired
 a small number of commissioned officers who were believed to be
 guilty of various offenses. The latter category includes a
 major who was fired and turned over to the justice system for
 his participation in the beating death of a suspected thief in
 the northwest city of Mao in November. Although a significant
 number of ex-members of the National Police have been turned
 over to the criminal justice system, to date there have been no
 reports of successful prosecutions for human rights abuses.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and health and sanitary conditions are
 substandard. Most prisoners find it necessary to rely on
 relatives or their own finances in order to be fed adequately.
 Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies. In some
 instances, minors have been incarcerated with adults in the
 general prison population.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution stipulates that suspects may be detained for a
 maximum of 48 hours for investigation before arraignment, after
 which they must be charged or released. In 1991 enforcement
 officials continued to detain suspects routinely for
 
 
 574
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 "investigation" or "interrogation" beyond the prescribed
 48-hour limit. In October the Dominican Human Rights Committee
 sent to President Balaguer a list of 27 prisoners, including
 Lizardo Cabrera, whose judicial brders for release had been
 ignored by the National Police. Large numbers of people were
 detained in police sweeps conducted mainly in poor
 neighborhoods. These roundups were ostensibly aimed at
 fighting crime, but some were also conducted against labor
 activists and others shortly before general strikes to
 discourage the strikes. The Attorney General, members of the
 legislature, and the Archbishop strongly criticized the sweeps,
 charging that the police were indiscriminate and abusive in
 carrying them out. President Balaguer and the Chief of Police.
 repeatedly defended the sweeps as necessary to combat rising
 crime rates.
 There were no credible reports of exile of citizens for
 expressing views contrary to or critical of the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system includes a Supreme Court, appellate court, and
 courts of the first instance. Judges at all levels are
 appointed by the Senate. They are nominally independent of the
 executive branch and are subject to removal or transfer by a
 majority vote in the Senate. Their terms of office correspond
 roughly to those of the President and other elected officials.
 A newly elected Senate can either designate their replacements
 or reconfirm them. There continued to be credible charges that
 a number of judges and prosecutors accepted bribes to
 manipulate the outcome of cases. There is concern that the
 judicial system is not adequately independent of the executive
 branch and that underfunding the courts is a means of lessening
 their autonomy. In November the Senate approved legislation to
 raise salaries for judges.
 The Constitution provides for public trial. Court-appointed
 lawyers normally are provided at public expense to indigents in
 felony criminal cases but rarely in criminal misdemeanor
 cases. There are chronic delays in the judicial process.
 Credible sources have said that of approximately 9,000 persons
 detained in the penal system, only 11 percent have been
 convicted.. Although the right to judicial determination of the
 legality of detention exists, detention of those awaiting trial
 is legal and commonly employed, and many of those accused
 remain in prison for lengthy periods awaiting trail. This
 practice, coupled with a lack of administrative and financial
 support for the system, has created a major backlog of cases.
 Additionally, enforcement authorities frequently claim that the
 judiciary is too lenient, and the DNCD, in particular, appears
 to be able to intimidate some judges in drug cases so that the
 cases are delayed or sentences are imposed that at times.appear
 to be inconsistent with the nature of the offense. In several
 instances, the police have defied judicial orders of release.
 There are no known political prisoners. There are no special
 courts for political or national security cases, and civilians
 may not be tried by a military court. Members of the armed
 forces are tried by military courts, except under specific
 circumstances and only after review by a military board.
 In July, after a trial which lasted more than 2 years, former
 President Salvador Jorge Blanco and his Secretary of the Armed
 Forces were found guilty of corruption during Jorge's 1982-1986
 term. The two men were heavily fined and sentenced to 20 years
 
 
 575
 DObTINICAN REPUBLIC
 in prison. Both immediately appealed their sentences. Jorge
 maintained throughout the trial that his prosecution was
 politically motivated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no credible reports of arbitrary governmental
 interference with the private lives of persons or families.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home are
 observed. A residence may not be searched except in the
 presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, excluding
 cases of "hot pursuit" or instances where there is probable
 cause to believe that a crime is actually being committed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are provided for by law and are respected in
 practice. Dominicans of all political persuasions enjoy
 freedom of speech and regularly exercise it. The numerous
 privately owned radio 'and television stations air all political
 points of view. Dominican newspapers are privately owned and
 freely reflect independent and opposition points of view.
 There is no government censorship on political grounds. Public
 and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and are
 generally respected in practice. Outdoor public marches and
 meetings require government permits, which are routinely
 granted. Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors,
 teachers, and others function freely and can maintain relations
 with counterpart international bodies of diverse political
 philosophies. Many of these organizations take on roles
 similar to those of labor unions, including protest activities,
 strikes, and collective bargaining. During 1991 there
 continued to be incidents in which the security forces
 arbitrarily detained labor activists and suspected agitators
 prior to a general strike.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to hold
 public office, no restrictions on the practice of religious
 faiths, and no social discrimination based on religion. The
 Dominican population is predominantly Roman Catholic; several
 non-Catholic faiths have well established churches in the
 country. There have been no credible reports of government
 interference with the free practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or
 outside the country for Dominican citizens.
 On June 13, President Balaguer issued a decree ordering the
 repatriation of all foreigners (primarily Haitian) under the
 age of 16 and older than 60 who were working in the Dominican
 Republic's sugar industry. According to Dominican immigration
 officials, about 6,000 Haitians were involuntarily repatriated
 
 
 576
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 before the program was suspended the day after the September
 coup in Haiti. Some Dominican citizens or persons with some
 other right to reside in the Dominican Republic were among
 those expelled. At times during the repatriation process,
 families were separated and deportees were forced to abandon
 their personal property and were not allowed to collect back
 pay, severance pay, and pensions. In addition to those
 involuntarily repatriated, some 50,000 to 55,000 Haitians left,
 mainly to avoid the possibility of losing their possessions.
 There continued to be credible charges of forced recruitment
 and detention of Haitians to work on sugar plantations in 1991
 (see Section 6.c.).        I
 The bominican Republic has a tradition of granting asylum to
 people who fear political persecution if returned tu their
 countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The
 President, all 150 members of the Senate and Chamber of
 Deputies, and the mayors and city councilmen of over 100
 municipalities are freely elected every 4 years by secret
 ballot and universal suffrage (except for active duty military
 and police, who may not vote). The governors of the 29
 provinces are appointed by the President. The nation enjoys a
 functioning multiparty system. Opposition groups of the left,
 right, and center operate openly.
 The President fully exercises his authority in directing the
 Government's administration. Through use of the veto,
 discretion to act by decree, and influence as the leader of his
 party, he also takes a leading role in enacting laws and
 regulations. The Congress traditionally has had limited powers
 but provides an open forum for the free exchange of views and
 debate. The governing party holds a majority in the Senate (16
 of 30 seats) and is in the minority (42 of 120 seats) in the
 Chamber of Deputies. There are no legal or practical
 impediments to women and minority participation in politics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely
 without government interference. They include the Dominican
 Human Rights Committee, the Dominican Union for the Defense of
 Human Rights, the National Committee of Human and Labor Rights,
 various church and labor groups, and others. The Dominican
 Republic participates actively in international and regional
 human rights bodies and supports efforts to promote human
 rights in international forums.
 Section'5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race and sex is prohibited by law. For
 historical reasons and because of sharp cultural differences,
 there is a prejudice against Haitians in Dominican society.
 This often translates into discrimination against those with
 darker skin (i.e., Haitian appearing). Dark skinned
 Dominicans, including some of Haitian descent, have, however,
 been successful in a variety of fields, including elected
 
 
 577
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 political office. There have been charges that children of
 Haitian descent were unable to attend school due to their
 inability to obtain needed documents; nevertheless, the school
 system functioned in areas heavily populated with Haitians, and
 there were no apparent government restrictions aimed
 specifically at Haitian children. An October 1990 decree
 required all Haitians to register with'the Department of
 Immigration. One human rights group charged that fear of
 deportation often prevents Haitians from registering and thus
 obtaining proper documentation for school-age children.
 Women traditionally have not shared equal social and economic
 status or opportunity with men, and men. hold the overwhelming
 majority of leadership positions in all sectors. Women have,
 however, begun to make visible inroads in employment rolls and
 to hold more high and public leadership positions. Nine of the
 country's 29 governors are female. Divorce is easily
 obtainable by either spouse, and women may hold property in
 their own names apart from their husbands. In the past,
 violence against women had not received much public attention,
 but 1991 saw continued growing public awareness of and
 sensitivity towards this issue, in part due to the efforts of
 various women's groups. These efforts culminated in month-long
 activities in November, highlighted by the observance on
 November 25 of the National Day against Violence against
 Women. On November 26, feminists picketed the Justice Palace
 in solidarity with women who have been abused.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the freedom to organize labor
 unions and also for the rights of workers to strike and
 management to lock out. All workers, except military personnel
 and police, are free to organize, and agricultural and public
 sector workers exercise this right. However, unions operate
 under the handicap of an antiquated (1951) Labor Code that
 gives them few rights vis-a-vis maqagement and, in practice,
 gives little effective protection to organizers or union
 officials. In October, President Balaguer forwarded the
 revised Labor Code draft to Congress. The new code, if passed
 by the Congress in its 1992 session, would strengthen the right
 of workers to organize.
 The current Labor Code contains several restrictions on the
 right to strike, including blanket prohibitions on sympathy and
 political strikes. The Labor Code grants the right to strike
 for the private sector but prohibits strikes in the public
 sector (including government-owned enterprises such as the
 sugar plantations) and general strikes. Nevertheless, there
 were major strikes in 1991 by government doctors, nurses, and
 teachers seeking higher wages, and labor and political groups
 staged general strikes in June and July.
 The Labor Code specifies in detail the steps required to
 establish a legal union, federation, or confederation. In
 general, this has not been a major impediment for unions to
 obtain recognition, as evidenced by the number of functioning
 labor organizations, but labor complained that the Government
 could use a union's failure to comply with every detail of the
 Code as a reason to withhold recognition and that this was
 being done in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ's). In 1991 the
 Government extended recognition to-several unions in the
 EPZ's. Unlike in previous years, no union applications were
 denied, and the Government has been processing the applications
 more rapidly than in the past, although it is still unable to
 
 
 578
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 comply with the legal requirement to rule on an application
 within 10 days of submission. However, this development was
 not sufficient to prevent continued antiunion discrimination in
 the EPZ's (see Section 6.b.).
 Organized labor represents about 12 percent of the work force
 and is divided among three large confederations, three minor
 confederations, and a number of independent unions. Labor
 unions can and do freely affiliate regionally and
 internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is permitted and usually takes place in
 firms which have union representation. The Constitution gives
 the Government legal authority to set minimum wage levels, and
 the Labor Code assigns this task to the National Salary
 Committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage legislation.
 The Labor Code clearly stipulates that workers cannot be
 dismissed because of their trade union membership or
 activities. However, Article 69 of the Code essentially
 permits an employer or employee unilaterally to end an open
 work contract simply with a notice of termination, and there
 are credible charges that companies use Article 69 to fire
 labor organizers. For example, the American Institute for Free
 Labor Development reported that a union at the Empresa
 Manufacturera Borinzuena received recognition on April 30 and,
 on May 11, 14 union leaders and activists were fired. The
 American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
 Organizations also noted that at Undergarment Fashions workers
 elected an executive board in November 1990, and by February
 1991 all members of the executive board had been fired. In
 October Undergarment Fashions fired all the members of a
 reconstituted union executive board as part of an annual layoff
 of workers. Although many workers were rehired, none of the
 workers with identifiable union connections or sympathies was.
 In September the Secretary of Labor stated that some companies,
 especially in the EPZ's, systematically violated workers'
 rights to organize; he said that government recognition of
 unions served no purpose if companies then dismissed labor
 organizers, and stressed the importance of passing the revised
 Labor Code into law to strengthen workers' protections against
 arbitrary firings. However, the judge in a complaint filed
 against Westinghouse ruled that companies have the right to
 fire any employee at any time for any reason, with the
 provision of severance pay. There are over 350 companies and
 110,000 workers located in the country's 23 EPZ's, yet no EPZ
 company has concluded a collectively bargained contract with a
 union.
 During a 1990 strike, the administrator of the state-owned
 Dominican Electric Corporation (CDE) charged the CDE union
 (SITRACODE) with sabotage, featherbedding, and corruption, and
 began massive firings of SITRACODE leaders and activists. In
 1991, the Dominican Government agreed to a settlement calling
 for the pensioning of 75 percent of the fired workers and the
 rehiring of 25 percent.
 
 
 579
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law. There were
 credible charges in the 1990-1991 sugar harvest that the
 Government and CEA forcibly recruited Haitian seasonal
 agricultural workers and then restricted them to work on
 specific sugar plantations. In some cases, workers told of
 holding facilities under military guard, having personal
 effects confiscated, and being physically and psychologically
 abused by CEA employees to restrict them to the plantations.
 There were also charges that the Government used the military
 and police to round up Haitians residing in the Dominican
 Republic and compelled them to work in the cane fields. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) noted that "in order to
 prevent an exodus of workers to other plantations, rural guards
 have used coercive methods, such as keeping the belongings of
 the workers (in most cases their clothes) or locking them in
 when they sleep."
 In August representatives of the Dominican and Haitian
 Governments held an ILO-moderated meeting and discussed the
 repatriation issue and ways to regularize the recruitment of
 migrant workers. The coup in Haiti forestalled plans for
 further meetings.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code prohibits employment of youths under 14 years of
 age and restricts the nighttime employment of youths aged 14 to
 18. The Labor Code also provides that employees under age 18
 work no more than 8 hours a day and specifies that those 18
 years and younger may not be employed in dangerous or unhealthy
 jobs.
 The high level of ,,nemployment, the erosion of real wages by
 inflation, and the lack of a social safety net create pressures
 on families to allow children to generate supplemental income.
 Young people, including minors younger than 14 years of age and
 some who are abandoned, engage in a variety of work which
 technically violates labor regulations, including selling
 newspapers, washing car windows, and shining shoes. In
 practice, many of the child labor restrictions in the Labor
 Code are ignored. During the last 2 years, the Secretariat of
 Labor has investigated the employment of youths in Santo
 Domingo and Santiago and has attempted to enforce the law in
 cases where companies employed underage workers in violation of
 the law. Some young workers obtained work permits and
 continued their employment. Those who were unable to obtain
 permits were dismissed. Some companies were subjected to small
 fines for violating the law.
 A January 1991 ILO Direct Contacts Mission found that "the lack
 of labor to cut sugar cane has resulted in plantations
 resorting to child labor for this activity." One human rights
 group interviewed over 100 youths during the 1990-1991 sugar
 cane harvest and found cases of children aged 14 and under
 being employed on sugar plantations. The CEA has stated that
 it found 70 Haitian children working on the plantations and
 that it repatriated them. The CEA has also issued orders to
 its employees prohibiting the hiring of children under pain of
 dismissal. Nevertheless, sugar cane workers have reported that
 children often accompany their parents into the fields.
 
 
 580
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code establishes that all workers are entitled to 24
 hours of rest after 6 days of w6rk; in practice, a typical
 workweek is Monday through Friday plus a half day on Saturday,
 but longer hours are not unusual. Safety and health conditions
 at places of work do not always meet legal standards. The
 existing social security system does not apply to all workers
 and is underfunded. As a result, benefits are low, payments
 often delayed, and medical care is limited and available only
 in the major cities.
 Conditions among agricultural workers are in general much
 worse, with little rest and long hours during harvest and
 planting seasons. Some observers allege that Haitian workers
 on CEA plantations are not allowed to eat or rest during the
 day at harvest time and are required to work significantly
 longer than the legal 48-hour week. Since workers are paid by
 the weight they cut (plus bonuses for extra production), and
 CEA employees often manipulate the figures, many cane cutters
 work extra hours to increase their income. The ILO Committee
 of Experts (COE) in 1991 stated that new rates of payment to
 cane cutters improve their chances of earning the statutory
 minimum wage. It added that while the increase was
 significant, it was lower than the rise.in the cost of living.
 The COE also recommended adoption of more uniform and regular
 working hours for cane cutters.
 Problems found in many Haitian worker villages,'such as disease
 and a lack of schooling, medical facilities, running water, and
 sewage systems, are also found in many parts of the country and
 are not suffered uniquely by Haitians. CEA has undertaken
 projects, some in connection with international organizations
 such as the U.N. Population Fund, to improve living conditions
 on the plantations.
 The Secretariat of Labor has formed a team of 20 inspectors to
 prevent abuses by CEA employees such as the fraudulent weighing
 of cut cane. Twenty CEA employees were dismissed for cheating
 workers, but the practice continues, and not all CEA employees
 are disciplined for it. In the 1990-1991 harvest, CEA paid the
 cane cutters in vouchers, which were often exchanged by
 merchants at exorbitant discount rates to reduce the value of
 the worker's income. CEA announced plans to modify that
 procedure in the 1991-1992 harvest.
 Health standards for workers are set by the Dominican Social
 Security. Institute. Nonhealth safety standards are covered by
 the Labor Code. Both the Social Security Institute and the
 Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors who are
 charged with enforcing standards. However, these posts are
 filled through political patronage and some inspectors have
 earned a reputation for corruption. Laws on working conditions
 and their enforcement in the EPZ's do not differ significantly
 from those in the country at large. Some companies in private
 EPZ's exhibit much higher worker safety and health standards.
 Real wages, especially in the public sector, were seriously
 eroded by an unprecedented consumer price inflation in 1990 of
 101 percent, in part because consumption subsidies on sugar,
 wheat flour, and petroleum products were eliminated and prices
 for these products rose sharply. The Government increased the
 minimum public sector wage by 30 percent in August 1990 and
 raised all public sector wages by 20 percent in July 1991.
 Following consultations with the private sector and various
 
 
 581
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 labor leaders, the national wage board raised wages of lower
 paid private employees (the majority) by 60 percent effective
 in September 1991. According to labor leaders and many private
 sector businessmen, the vast majority of workers receive only
 the minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient
 to maintain a small family at a minimally acceptable standard
 of living. As a result, many people hold more than one job.
 
 
 582
