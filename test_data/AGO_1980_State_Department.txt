 ANGOLA *
 At independence on November 11, 1975, the three major
 lioeration groups which had fought the Portugese colonizers
 for 13 years were engaged in a bloody civil war, marked by
 extensive foreign intervention. By early 1976, the Popular
 Movement for the Lioeration of Angola (MPLA) had forced the
 two rival movements from Luanda, the capital, and from
 power. Both groups, the National Front for the Liberation
 of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for the Total
 Independence of Angola (UNITA), reverted to guerrilla
 warfare. The FNLA has since ceased to be a threat to
 government control of northern areas of the country.
 UNITA continues to challenge the government's control of
 large areas of the southern, eastern, and central portions
 of the country. The MPLA, meanwhile, transformed itself
 from a liberation movement into a Marxist-Leninist "van-
 guard" political party, named the MPLA-Labor Party.
 During 1980, the MPLA government continued the establi-
 ment of political institutions in line with its ideology.
 For example, in November, single-list elections were held to
 select representatives to new local, provincial, and national
 "People's Assemblies."   The MPLA-Labor Party also sought to
 expand its membership, but it remains tightly restricted.
 Although the-Party claims that these steps iere taken to
 increase popular participation in government, political
 rights do not appear to be expanded.
 Security concerns continued to preoccupy the government
 during 1980. The South African Defense Forces, which had
 been attacking the bases of the Southwest Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO) in Angola, carried out three large-
 scale attacks on SWAPO bases and Angolan economic infra-
 structure and increased the frequency of their smaller-scale
 military attacks on Angola. Casualty and damage figures
 resulting from these attacks cannot be confirmed, but are
 believed to be high. Continued hostilities between UNITA
 and government forces have resulted in hundreds of thousands
 of displaced persons facing famine or severe malnutrition
 in central and southern Angola, according to international
 relief agency reports. As a consequence of these security
 concerns, the MPLA government continues to rely partially
 on a large Cuban combat troop presence for its national
 security, while it is forced to divert thousands of its own
 best-trained people and a substantial portion of its greatly
 reduced material and financial resources to military ends.
 *There is little reliable information on human rights
 practices in Angola. The United States does not maintain
 diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Angola,
 and thus has no diplomatic personnel on the spot to monitor
 human rights conditions or to evaluate allegations of
 abuses. Of the major human rights organizations, only
 Amnesty International has reported on human rights in
 Angola since independence.
 
 
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although constitution charges the State with responsibility
 to guarantee the integrity of the person, allegations of
 torture in Angolan prisons have been made in the past.
 One prisoner who was held for several months in 1980 in an
 Angolan minimum security prison reported that, while some of
 his fellow prisoners bore evidence of possible torture and
 alleged that it had occurred frequently three or more years
 ago during interrogations, none held in that prison alleged
 that torture was currently employed by prison authorities.
 There were no known allegations of torture in Angola in
 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In July, the government after public trials executed 25
 members of a UNITA bombing ring which had set off several
 explosive devices in Luanda. In retaliation, UNITA summarily
 executed 15 MPLA prisoners.
 Escaped or released prisoners have claimed that in general
 prisons are overcrowded, and that diet and sanitation are
 substandard. These conditions may reflect the general state
 of the economy more than purposeful maltreatment of prisoners.
 Prison officials allow food to be sent in to detainees to
 supplement the prison diet. While some reports have alleged
 that foreigners are not well treated, such information as is
 available indicates that two American prisoners convicted of
 being mercenaries apparently receive relatively good treat-
 ment in terms of medical care, jail privileges, and in being
 allowed to share food sent in to cell mates. Due to lack
 of access, however, there is no first hand knowledge of
 those prisoners' current conditions.
 Prisoners' rights to receive visitors, packages, and
 mail are severely restricted. Although Angolan officials
 indicated they would end mail restrictions imposed on the
 American prisoners and permit visits by members of their
 families, mail privileges were improved only temporarily
 and family requests for visas to visit the prisoners have
 been ignored.
 c.   Disappearances
 There is no information to indicate that abductions,
 secret arrests, or clandestine detentions are practiced by
 the Angolan security agencies.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported charges
 of human rights violations in Angola have been those of
 arbitrary arrest and imprisonment without due process.
 Numerous reports allege that individuals are arrested and
 imprisoned on suspicion or denunciation by another, held in
 
 
 some cases for several years, and, indeed, without knowing
 the charges against them. One American citizen who was
 released in 1980 had been held for nearly three years
 without being charged or tried. An American pilot who made
 an emergency landing in Angola in April was held for six
 months while authorities investigated his case.
 A group of ten prisoners held since 1977 who were believed
 by the government to be members of banned ultra-leftist
 organizations were reportedly freed in 1980 after several in
 the group went on a hunger strike. The cases of these ten
 had been highlighted by Amnesty International.
 Estimates of the number of persons arrested arbitrarily or
 held for long periods of time without trial are lacking,
 but released prisoners have reported that there are many.
 Nevertheless, one released prisoner reported that the
 government in mid-1980 began to accelerate the legal
 processing of some prisoners, resulting in their releases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of the accused to legal counsel and defense is
 guaranteed in the constitution, but there is insufficient
 information to assess adequately the practice of this right.
 Former prisoners have reported that prisoners are allowed
 visits and consultations with their lawyers. Information on
 the structure and functioning of the judicial system is not
 available.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the domicile and confidentiality of corres-
 pondence are guaranteed in the constitution. It is not
 known to what extent these rights are presently respected in
 practice.
 2.    Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Needs-as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Angolan economy, basically rural subsistence agri-
 culture, had a sigrfificant modern component in the colonial
 period. Before independence, an overwhelming portion of the
 economy was controlled by the approximately 500,000 Portuguese
 residents, who possessed the bulk of the country's managerial
 expertise and technical skills. Perhaps 30,000 Portuguese
 remain. The 1975 civil war, continuing guerrilla activity
 and South African attacks have caused the destruction of
 important infrastructural elements and economic assets. The
 exodus of most of the Portuguese and the diversion to civil
 warfare of many of the country's.available trained personnel
 and substantial economic resources, have resulted in near
 paralysis of the economy. Today only the petroleum and
 diamond sectors of the economy    are generating income at
 anywhere near pre-independence levels; all other sectors are
 stagnant or operate at a fraction of their pre-war levels.
 The distribution system has been particularly affected,
 resulting in chronic shortages of manufactured goods in
 rural areas and severe scarcity of food in urban areas.
 The continued hostilities between the MPLA government
 forces and UNITA have exacerbated food shortages resulting
 from drought and the disruption of the distribution system
 in central and southern Angola, with disastrous results.
 International relief agencies estimate that from 250,000 to
 perhaps as many as 800,000 residents of the affected areas
 
 
 have left the countryside seeking food and safety in cities
 and towns. Most of these people are reportedly severely
 malnourished. Poor security conditions have hampered relief
 work. Since the rural exodus has meant that next year's
 crops are not being planted, significant hunger problems in
 the area are likely to continue.
 In December 1977, the MPLA transformed itself into a Marxist-
 Leninist "vanguard party," and adopted socialism as its
 long-term goal. However, at present, the economy is "mixed"
 and government leaders have indicated they intend to keep
 it so. Significant areas of the economy such as banking
 and mining have been transferred from private ownership
 to state ownership. Although the right to private property
 is guaranteed by the constitution and a sizeable portion of
 the economy still operates under private ownership, the
 State reserves the right to confiscate property and assets
 it considers "abandoned", e.g., due to a resident's departure
 from Angola.
 Although the constitution provides that it is the duty
 of the State to provide conditions for social development,
 work, health care, and educations continuing internal
 hostilities and the exodus of trained personnel have
 severely hampered the government's efforts to provide
 basic economic rights to Angolans. For example, although
 physicians from several countries are serving in Angola
 under assistance programs, the number is insufficient to
 supply minimum health care to more than a small fraction of
 the total population. Data on the system of education are
 unavailable. It is believed the government has had some
 success in expanding its basic literacy programs, although
 the current literacy rate is estimated at 15-20 percent.
 Corruption and favoritism appear to be hindering the
 distribution of scarce commodities. A thriving and expen-
 sive black market is known to exist. There are widespread
 allegations of corruption by some government officials and
 foreigners working in the government. Despite government
 controls on prices, the scarcity of nearly all goods has
 caused the inflation rate to skyrocket. Some unconfirmed
 estimates have placed the annual inflation rate at well
 over 100 percent.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression, assembly,
 conscience, and belief, as well as separation of church and
 state, but qualifies the exercise of these freedoms by
 requirements that activities must fall within "the area of
 realizing the fundamental objectives of the People's Republic
 of Angola," that they must be "in the national interest," or
 that they "conform to public order." Freedom of assembly is
 denied to any other political movement by the MPLA government.
 It is not possible to determine the extent of violations of
 freedom of speech. However, there are numerous reports of
 arrests of people who voice support of an opposition move-
 ment or alternative political systems.
 Censorship of political expression exists, and the circulation
 of Western journals and periodicals is tightly restricted.
 
 
 The government controls or owns the media. Although
 opposition views are not aired, the press frequently
 contains articles criticizing government failings in
 economic areas. The government is especially sensitive
 to criticism in the foreign press, and has occasionally
 expelled foreign correspondents for writing articles
 critical of its policies, or describing activities of
 opposition movements. Entry of foreign correspondents
 into Angola is tightly restricted.
 There is a government-sponsored trade movement, the National
 Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA). Traditional labor union
 activities and rights are tightly restricted by the govern-,
 ment. The right to strike is prohibited by law as a crime
 against the security of the state.
 Although, as noted, the constitution guarantees freedom of
 religion, pastoral letters from the Catholic Church criti-
 cizing the government reportedly have resulted in restrict-
 ions on church activities.
 The MPLA-Labor Party is Angola's only legal political party.
 The government has banned other political movements.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The right of voluntary repatriation for members of Angolan
 political movements opposed to the MPLA does not exist in
 practice. As a result of fear of persecution should they
 return, about 250,000 Angolans who were sympathizers of
 these movements remain as refugees in Zaire, and numerous
 others in Portugal and other countries.
 On the other hand, Angola has welcomed refugees from
 other countries, most notably from Namibia and Zaire.
 Angola estimates its refugee population at about 48,000, of
 whom 20,000 are Namibian, 17,000 are Zairian, and 1,000 are
 South African. United Nations High Commission for Refugee
 estimates are slightly higher at about 55,000. The number
 of Zairan refugees decreased from 1979 to 1980 due to
 repatriation under international agency auspices, while the
 number of Namibian refugees increased with the escalation of
 the Namibian conflict. The Angolan government reportedly is
 cooperating with international agencies in attempting to
 meet the needs of these refugees.
 The government has instituted a pass system within Angola,
 and foreigners are generally prohibited from travelling
 outside principal cities. Foreign travel is carefully
 controlled by passport issuance restrictions, delayed
 issuance of exit visas, and currency restrictions. Emi-
 gration, particularly of draft age males, is tightly res-
 tricted. The frequency of travel abroad by foreigners
 resident in Angola also may be restricted.
 The Angolan government, influenced by the active insurgencies
 within the country, is highly security conscious. As one
 result, visa policy is selective and stringent. Visa
 applications frequently are rejected, ignored or subject to
 long delays.
 
 
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The People's Republic of Angola is a one-party authoritarian
 state. The MPIA-Labor Party is the only legal political
 party. The government has banned all political activities
 by opposition groups, and denies them access to the state-
 controlled media.
 The constitution guarantees the exercise of political power
 to the "masses, through organized forms of popular power."
 in effect, this restricts political expression to partici-
 pation in the MPLA-Labor Party or to one of its controlled
 and sanctioned organizations such as the youth wing, Angolan
 Women's Organization, or trade union movement (UNTA).
 All Angolan citizens over 18 not legally deprived of politi-
 cal rights may participate in the political process, as
 described above. Angolan citizenship is denied, however, to
 those individuals with claims to another nationality, who
 have committed homicide, opposed the liberation struggle, or
 joined clandestine organizations opposed to the decoloniz-
 ation process. Voting rights of those citizens who are
 known supporters of opposition groups are restricted.
 The constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens and
 proscribes discrimination because of color, race, ethnicity,
 sex, birthpiace, religion, education, or economic or social
 conditions. Women participate in the MPLA, not only in
 the Angolan Women's Organization, but also in the higher
 levels of the party. Women in the higher party organs,
 however, have not been numerous. Only three of the MPLA's
 65 Central Committee members are women, while none of the
 government ministers is female. Social, cultural and
 traditional factors probably limit the participation of
 women at the highest levels of the party and government.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, no international or non-govern-
 mental human rights organization has attempted to visit
 Angola to investigate human rights conditions or practices
 since independence.
 Amnesty Internaticnal Report 1980 expresses concern about the
 continued imprisonment of suspected members of armed oppo-
 sition parties and other political factions and allegations
 of ill-treatment of prisoners. The report also notes that a
 considerable number of prisoners bas been released during
 the period of May 1, 1979 to April 30, 1980.
