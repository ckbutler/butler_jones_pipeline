 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic whose political and economic
 system has been dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary
 Party (PRI) since its founding in 1929. Periodic political
 reform has expanded the opposition's role and stake in the
 political system, particularly in the 1988 presidential
 election year. Nevertheless, the PRI has maintained its
 preponderant political control throughout the Republic by a
 combination of voting strength, organizational power, and,
 major opposition parties and other observers allege, electoral
 fraud.
 The 1917 Constitution stipulates that power be divided among a
 bicameral legislature, a judiciary, and an executive. The
 President's powers, however, far outweigh those of the other
 branches in Mexico's highly centralized system. This may be
 changing; the PRI's slim majority in the Chamber of Deputies
 since September 1, 1988, may make it more difficult for the
 Executive branch to dominate the legislative process.
 The principal law enforcement organization in Mexico is the
 Federal Judicial Police, which is controlled by the Attorney
 General. The General Directorate of Investigations and
 National Security under the control of the Secretariat of
 Government is responsible for investigations involving
 national security. The Mexican armed forces are represented
 at the cabinet level and, aside from their primary mission of
 national security, play an important role in the drug
 eradication and interdiction program and in the confiscation
 of illegal weapons. Despite the tendency toward centralization
 of authority, municipal, state, and federal police exercise
 authority in their respective areas of jurisdiction.
 Mexico has a mixed economy, which combines elements of
 domestic market capitalism with state ownership of major
 industries (parastatals). Through a program of divestiture of
 some parastatals, the Government continues to increase the
 role of the private sector in the economy.
 Mexico's Constitution provides for a wide range of individual
 freedoms, regardless of race, creed, color, or sex, and these
 provisions are, with some exceptions, honored in practice.
 Human rights abuses persist in a number of areas, although the
 Government maintains it has taken steps to improve the human
 rights situation. A number of observers, including Amnesty
 International (AI), have continued to express concern about
 mistreatment and torture of prisoners, and perennial rural
 conflicts over title to land continue to result in physical
 abuse, arbitrary detentions, and deaths of peasants who
 confront local landowners or their agents (sometimes including
 local police and/or military officials).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In Mexico's rural states, especially Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz,
 Hidalgo, Guerrero, and Puebla, disputes over land occasionally
 erupt in violence. The Federal Government is continuing its
 efforts to curb such violence, but violations continue
 nonetheless. Paramilitary bands, police controlled by local
 
 
 632
 MEXICO
 political bosses, and landowners themselves are often accused
 of oppressing and murdering peasant activists. The Mexican
 Socialist Party (PMS) filed suit in January for impeachment
 against the Governor of Chiapas, Absalon Castellanos
 Dominguez, averring that landowners and landed political
 bosses (caciques), along with the army, ran roughshod over
 civil and human rights of peasants and Indians laying claim to
 disputed land. Though the suit quickly failed in the national
 legislature, it represented a benchmark for human rights
 activists and peasant organizations in drawing attention to
 such abuses.
 Independent peasant organizations and the PRI-affiliated
 National Confederation of Peasants (CNC) have made similar
 charges. The independent groups continue to charge that
 persons employed by local caciques, as well as members of the
 CNC and the local police are responsible for the killings.
 For its part, the CNC blames fatalities in its ranks on
 independent unions encouraged, it  .ys, by leftist political
 activists. Others, however, suggest that most CNC casualties
 stem from internal CNC power :_ruggles.
 Powerful Mexican drug smuggling rings have been responsible
 for a number of killings. Their victims have included Mexicans
 and foreigners. During the week of September 22, Rafael Caro
 Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and others accused of
 involvement in the 1985 kidnaping and murder of U.S. Drug
 Enforcement Administration (DEA) special agent Enrique
 Camarena were convicted and sentenced on drug-related charges.
 Caro Quintero was sentenced to 34 years in prison, while 22
 other defendants received lesser terms. On September 30, Caro
 Quintero's appeal of the sentence was denied. Defense
 attorneys told the press they might take the appeal to
 Mexico's Supreme Court. Kidnaping and murder charges remain
 pending and are being tried separately in a Federal Court in
 Guadalajara. Final sentences would not be subject to parole.
 The second trial in Guadalajara is expected to be concluded in
 mid-1989. Investigative work continues into a possible
 relationship between Camarena's murder and the 1984
 disappearance of five other U.S. citizens. It appears likely
 that a U.S. citizen, John Clay Walker, and a U.S. legal
 permanent resident, Alberto Radelat, were mistaken by
 associates of Caro Quintero for DEA agents, and that they were
 beaten, and subsequently killed. There were no developments
 in the cases of the four other U.S. citizens during 1988.
 A Mexican newspaper publisher in June stated that 16 Mexican
 journalists had been murdered, several of whom had written
 about drug trafficking. Arrests resulted in four of the
 cases. The Union of Democratic Journalists asserted that 29
 reporters had been killed since  1982. In response, the
 Government Secretariat asserted that only five of the deaths
 "were presumably linked to journalistic activity."
 Journalists and other critics have asserted that while the
 Government cannot automatically be held accountable for the
 killings, it should be faulted for failing to prosecute them
 vigorously in an attempt to prevent further killings.
 A number of as yet unsolved murders of political activists and
 journalists also occurred within the last year. Political
 motives cannot, as yet, be clearly ascribed to any of the
 killings, though opposition groups continue to assert such was
 the case. Among the more newsworthy of these crimes was the
 assassination in downtown Mexico City, just days before the
 July 6 election, of Francisco Xavier Ovando Hernandez and
 
 
 633
 MEXICO
 Roman Gil Heraldez, two top aides to presidential candidate
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. In late August, four teenagers, one the
 son of a Revolutionary Workers Party (PRT) activist, were also
 found murdered, and Inocencio Romero, the Mexican Socialist
 Party (PMS) candidate for Mayor of Tezonapa, Veracruz, was
 shot in front of his home on September 10. In each instance,
 the Attorney General's office has rejected the notion of
 political motivation but has promised thoroughgoing
 investigations. By year's end, no results had been announced.
 A Canadian Immigration Appeal Board granted Mexican Army
 deserter Zacarias Osorio Ruiz refugee status on March 25,
 accepting his assertion that service from 1977 to 1982 in
 military "death squads" which purportedly executed civilian
 prisoners rendered his return to Mexico impossible. Osorio
 also confessed to participation in military sweeps of peasants
 and political dissidents in the states of Sinaloa, Veracruz,
 Guerrero, Chiapas, and Coahuila. The Mexican Government,
 through its diplomatic representatives in Canada, denied
 Osorio's charges; in addition, it gave assurances he was not
 under indictment for any crime in Mexico and claimed he had no
 cause to fear harm or injury were he to return.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been credible reports of disappearances in Mexico.
 According to the Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the
 Persecuted, Disappeared Persons, and Political Exiles of
 Mexico, a prominent human rights organization, there are some
 547 disappeared persons in Mexico. The Committee claims that
 from 1982 to 1988 there were 34 disappearances of persons
 whose whereabouts remain unknown. An additional two
 disappeared in 1988 but later reappeared. Human rights
 activists, in general, blame military and police authorities
 for the majority of disappearances said to have occurred, but
 lack firm evidence to support those charges.
 c. Torture and Other-Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Although torture is prohibited by the Constitution, credible
 reports from independent observers and human rights
 organizations continue to charge that law enforcement officials
 employ psychological and physical abuse, most often in the
 period immediately following arrest and especially during
 interrogation.
 The Government asserts that the use of torture is illegal and
 unacceptable, and stresses its continuing program to recruit
 better trained personnel, as well as its program to provide
 courses to sensitize law enforcement personnel to human rights.
 Nevertheless, there were continued reports of the use of
 torture and the subjection of prisoners to inhumane treatment
 during 1988. For example, a Cuernavaca publisher, Victor
 Osorio Ventura, alleged in late September that he was arrested
 falsely and tortured for 10 hours by six Morelos State Judicial
 Police Officers. As a result, State Judicial Police Director
 Roberto Perez Prieto was dismissed. Subsequently, State
 Attorney General Gustavo Malo Camacho admitted that police
 resorted to illicit detention and/or torture on certain
 occasions.
 
 
 634
 MEXICO
 In another case, on May 20, Mexico State Judicial Police
 officer Estanislao Pablo Aguilar Alcala, was tortured and
 later killed by asphyxiation, in apparent (though unconfirmed)
 retaliation for the May 13 slaying of a Mexico City policeman
 and the son of another. Aguilar's body was discovered in a
 police station parking lot. Judicial Police from the Federal
 District were charged with the Aguilar crime. Jesus Miyazawa
 Alvarez, a senior Mexico City Police official, and eight
 subdirectors were dismissed from their posts shortly
 thereafter. A large-scale overhaul of the Mexico City Police
 followed the incident, but the actual perpetrators remain at
 large.
 In a formal diplomatic protest to the Mexican Government, the
 United States Government requested a full investigation of the
 alleged physical abuse and illegal detention of one U.S.
 citizen and the illegal detention of another. A similar
 protest was made in April regarding five U.S. citizens accused
 of drug smuggling in Chihuahua.
 The United States protested to the Mexican authorities in July
 and again in October regarding the lack of prompt notification
 of arrest and the alleged abuse and possible torture of
 approximately 20 American citizens, the majority of whom had
 been arrested on drug-related charges and held by military
 authorities in the Puerto Vallarta area. Most claimed to have
 been subjected to beatings, electric shocks, sexual assaults,
 attempts at suffocation, and death threats. Some of the
 purported victims declined to discuss their cases with consular
 officials for fear of reprisal. There had been no formal reply
 to these charges by year's end.
 The trial of the police officers accused in the August 1986
 torture of DEA special agent Victor Cortez is proceeding and
 the evidence-gathering stage was closed on December 5, 1988.
 Barring further complications, the judge should reach a
 verdict in early 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, the detention of suspected criminals
 for more than 72 hours without being charged is prohibited.
 Mexican citizens have the right to bail, to seek restraining
 orders, and to make appeals ("amparo"), a constitutional
 protection provided against "coercive and abusive acts of
 authority." Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 occur most frequently in criminal cases.
 The National Front Against Repression (FNCR) alleges that
 there are currently 34 political prisoners and detainees in
 the country, down from 150 last year. The majority of these
 are peasants and peasant activists arrested in disputes over
 land. Some of these prisoners have been held for extended
 periods of time without being charged. In many of these
 c-ses, especially those involving land tenure, persons termed
 political prisoners are, according to the Government, actually
 guilty of common crimes, such as terrorism, criminal
 association, and damage to property. The Government has
 consistently denied that it holds any political prisoners.
 Exile and extradition of Mexican citizens are not normally
 practiced in Mexico.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 635
 MEXICO
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into federal and state court
 systems, with the federal courts having jurisdiction over most
 civil cases and those involving major felonies. Under the
 Constitution, trial and sentencing must be completed within 12
 months of arrest for crimes that would carry at least a 2-year
 sentence. Despite efforts at reform, this standard is often
 not met because of delays caused by cumbersome court
 procedures, case backlogs, and defense motions. Trial is by
 judge, not jury, in nearly all criminal cases. Defendants
 have a right to counsel, and public defenders are available.
 Recently implemented reforms have further broadened the rights
 of the.accused.
 The political opposition alleges that the judiciary, with
 judges placed in office by renewable appointments, is dependent
 on the executive branch. The Government denies that political
 beliefs have any bearing on the impartial administration of
 justice. Factors such as low pay for judges and law
 enforcement officials and high caseloads contribute to alleged
 corruption in the judicial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Article 16 of the Constitution provides for the privacy of the
 individual. Although the Government generally does not intrude
 on this right and search warrants are required by law,
 opposition political figures continue to state that their
 movements are monitored. Freedom to pursue private interests
 and hold private property is virtually unrestricted for
 Mexicans.
 In conflicts over land titles, peasants and urban squatters
 have charged that local landowners, accompanied by police,have
 entered their homes without appropriate judicial orders and
 that these incidents are sometimes accompanied by violence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are provided for by the
 Constitution. The Government has tolerated much direct public
 criticism, most notably in the print media. This was
 particularly true during the 1988 presidential election
 campaigns. Mexico's press is also a primary channel for
 reporting charges of human rights violations.
 Opposition political parties claimed that Mexico's two
 principal television stations, one government owned and the
 other allegedly partial to the Government, accorded the PRI
 presidential candidate preferential campaign coverage.
 Article 52 of the revised Federal Electoral Code provides
 opposition parties 15 minutes per month of television time and
 additional time during an electoral campaign. However, the
 opposition notes that the PRI derives a substantial advantage
 from its status as Mexico's "official" party, with party
 activities (including campaign events) covered as national
 news.
 During 1988 several journalists died violently or under
 suspicious circumstances in which, according to the media,
 retaliation for coverage of local and national problems such
 
 
 636
 MEXICO
 as drug trafficking and corruption may have been a motive.
 These include the April 20 murder of popular Tijuana
 investigative reporter Hector Felix "El Gato" Miranda; the
 February 22 murder of Mazatlan journalist, lawyer, and
 university professor Manuel Burgueno Orduno; and the July 15
 incident which took the life of Ciudad Juarez television
 personality Linda Bejarano.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right of peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose. A government permit is generally required for
 major demonstrations. Throughout the presidential campaign
 and postelectoral period, the Government permitted
 demonstrations--with few exceptions--by a broad range of
 political groups. Opposition political groups as well as
 peasant and indigenous organizations were allowed frequent
 access to main boulevards and Mexico City's large central
 square for demonstrations. In rare instances, unauthorized
 marches, sit-ins, and other forms of protest are broken up
 forcibly by police and security forces, especially outside the
 capital.
 Mexicans have full freedom to join political parties, civic
 associations, and other organizations. These organizations
 operate without arbitrary government restriction.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Persons are free to practice the religion of their choice, and
 no religious body has legal standing. The Constitution
 prohibits the clergy from participating in politics, voting,
 owning real estate, or wearing religious dress in public.
 Some of these prohibitions are not strictly enforced; neither
 is a Constitutional restriction against preuniversity
 religious schools, many of which exist.
 Mexico is predominantly Roman Catholic. Protestant, Jewish,
 and other religious communities are free to worship. Mormon
 and other Protestant evangelists, principally foreign, are
 active and especially successful in certain rural, largely
 indigenous communities. Some critics have stated that the
 Government finds these foreign groups threatening and,
 therefore, selectively enforces anticlerical laws in favor of
 the predominant Roman Catholic Church. Other critics assert
 the opposite, that the laws are not enforced against the
 evangelists in order to reduce the influence of the Catholic
 Church.
 A change in the Federal Electoral Code in 1986 subjected
 clergy to substantial fines and even imprisonment if they were
 found guilty of inducing the electorate to vote for or act
 against a candidate or foment abstention and disorder. Though
 some clerics were relatively outspoken during the presidential
 election campaign, none are known to have been charged under
 this regulation. The Catholic Church insisted upon its right
 to educate the faithful to their civic responsibilities and,
 in August, issued a statement which was both critical of the
 Government's handling of the elections as well as supportive
 of the high levels of participation achieved.
 
 
 637
 MEXICO
 Catholic and private educators, as well as some opposition
 politicians (notably the National Action Party (PAN)
 presidential candidate Manuel Clouthier), have criticized the
 Government for forcing Mexicans to use government-mandated
 textbooks in religious and private schools. Critics have
 complained of the textbooks' negative treatment of businessmen
 and free enterprise.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within and outside the country is
 unrestricted. Some 40,000 Guatemalan refugees reside in camps
 in southeast Mexico. According to the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), an additional 120,000
 illegal Salvadorans reside in urban areas, principally Mexico
 City; if discovered, they are usually deported across the
 border to Guatemala.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1929 Mexico has been ruled by the PRI. To secure its,
 continuance in power, the PRI has relied on extensive public
 patronage and massive government and party organizational
 resources. The opposition parties have also charged the PRI
 with electoral fraud in those contests in which the opposition
 is strongly organized.
 Given the PRI's greatly reduced margin of victory compared to
 previous years, many observers believe that the extent of
 electoral fraud in 1988 was considerably reduced. A total of
 eight political parties, sponsoring five presidential
 candidates, participated in the elections. The combined
 opposition garnered an unprecedented 237 seats out of a total
 of 500 in the Chamber of Deputies, and for the first time, 4
 of 64 seats in the Senate. A total of six political parties
 now hold seats in the Chamber of Deputies.
 The President and senators are elected for 6-year terms with
 one-half of the nation's senators elected every 3 years.
 Deputies are elected for 3-year terms, simultaneously with the
 election of the President and then midway through the
 presidential term. State governors are elected for 6-year
 terms, with elections in the various states spread throughout
 a 6-year period.
 Women enjoy full political rights and are active in political
 parties. One of the nation's 31 governors is a woman, 9 of 64
 senators are women, and 55 of the 500-member Chamber of
 Deputies are women, an increase of 14 over the previous
 legislature.
 Members of the unicameral state legislatures and all mayors
 are elected for 3-year terms. These elections are also
 staggered. Among its numerous provisions, a 1986 electoral
 reform law provides for the presence at polling stations of
 representatives from-all political parties, as well as
 independent poll watchers. Most urban polling stations were
 covered by both the PRI and other parties; the opposition had
 a more difficult time in the countryside, where they claim
 most manipulation of the vote occurred.
 
 
 638
 MEXICO
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government allows both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment, and it has pledged its full cooperation with
 efforts by AI to monitor human rights violations in Mexico.
 Senior Mexican officials have met with domestic human rights
 activists to discuss allegations of human rights violations.
 The Government has, in the past, publicly committed itself to
 periodic inspection by the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) and other human rights organizations and
 has pledged its complete cooperation with any such
 investigations.
 In its report covering events in 1987, AI indicated that its
 concerns included reports of political killings, torture,
 arbitrary arrest of political opponents, and the use as
 evidence of confessions obtained under duress. AI was also
 concerned about disappearances in previous years which have
 never been satisfactorily clarified by the Government. In its
 1988 report, AI confirmed that it had received detailed
 information from the Mexican Government in many cases, but
 stated that the Government had not fully addressed AI's
 concerns.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and Tndian origins.
 Indigenous groups, many of which do not speak Spanish, are
 encouraged to participate in political life, and the
 Government is respectful of the desire-of these groups to
 retain elements of their traditional lifestyle. These groups,
 however, remain largely outside the country's political and
 economic mainstream; this is more the result of historic
 patterns of economic and social development than any
 restrictive policy of the Government. Al reported that the
 state government of Oaxaca established an Indian legal rights
 office to assist in cases where imprisonment was related to
 socioeconomic or cultural problems.
 Mexico is free of official religious discrimination except for
 provisions of the Constitution which bar the clergy from
 participating in politics, voting, owning real estate, or
 wearing religious dress in public.
 The role of women in Mexican society is in transition, and
 women are beginning to move into areas traditionally reserved
 for men. The number of women's action groups is increasing,
 and they are aggressively promoting women's issues on a broad
 front. Women comprise approximately 29 percent of the work
 force but continue to work predominantly in nonsupervisory
 jobs with few at the executive level. Equal pay for equal
 work is mandated by statute. However, in practice a wage
 disparity exists between work traditionally performed by women
 and work traditionally performed by men. Men and women are
 equal in principle under Mexican law. Women have the right to
 file for separation and divorce. Women may travel without
 their husband's permission and own property in their own name.
 
 
 639
 MEXICO
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The rights of Mexican workers to organize and to strike are
 provided under Article 123 of the Constitution. Workers and
 employers have the right to establish and join organizations
 of their own choosing, and a pluralistic trade union movement
 exists. Numerous trade union confederations, independent
 unions, and a variety of employer organizations also exist.
 Mexico has had a free and independent trade union movement,
 as defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO), for
 decades. Mexican trade unions are neither controlled nor
 restricted by the Government, but the vast majority are
 affiliated with the PRI. A minority of unions, covering an
 estimated 10 to 15 percent of Mexico's organized workers, is
 independent, and some support the opposition parties.
 Mexican law provides for and protects the right to strike.
 This right, however, does not apply to public sector workers
 who are prohibited from striking. Strikes do occur but are
 relatively infrequent. Procedures for legal strikes are set
 forth in Mexico's basic labor legislation, the Federal Labor
 Law of 1971, but these provisions are lengthy and complex.
 The law provides for the filing of notices of intent to strike
 and for efforts at conciliation, mediation, and arbitration
 between the parties in dispute through the local, state, or
 federal tripartite (labor, management, government) conciliation
 and arbitration boards. By making them a measure of last
 resort, strikes are difficult to initiate, but not impossible.
 They usually take place over collective bargaining impasses or
 over such issues as plant closures or layoffs. Wildcat
 strikes continue to occur.
 Some 9 million Mexicans (out of a total work force of 25
 million) are unionized. Nearly 8 million are affiliated with
 PRI labor organizations. PRI-affiliated unions tend to
 support the Government and PRI on most issues, though not
 necessarily with respect to improvements in wages and working
 conditions. They are, furthermore, able to place a substantial
 number of union leaders in government positions; many are
 federal senators and deputies for the PRI. While PRI does not
 control the labor movement, the fact that most union leaders
 are also PRI officials and may occupy PRI electiye offices,
 does limit their freedom of maneuverability. One PRI-
 affiliated union, the 800,000-member National Teachers Union
 (SNTE), has a significant dissident movement, particularly in
 the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Michoacan, which rejects
 purported authoritarian control of the union.
 Independent unions outside the PRI-affiliated Mexican Labor
 Congress (CTM) cover the entire ideological spectrum. Mexican
 unions are free to maintain relations with international trade
 union bodies. The CTM is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and is a leading
 member of the ICFTU's Inter-American Regional Organization,
 headquartered in Mexico City. The Latin American regional
 organization of the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions (WFTU) maintains its headquarters in Mexico City,
 though they have no Mexican following to speak of and only one
 minuscule farm worker union affiliate.
 
 
 640
 MEXICO
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain c ilectively is provided
 for under Article 123 of the ConstiLuCion and implemented in
 Mexican labor law; it is generally respected in practice.
 There are few, if any, restraints on union organization.
 Collective bargaining is extremely commo-, particularly in
 industry and commerce. The aforementioned tripartite boards
 of conciliation and arbitration promote voluntary worker-
 employer negotiations. The boards have additional statutory
 responsibilities, such as the registration of collective
 bargaining agreements reached between labor and management.
 Workers are protected in Mexico against antiunion
 discrimination, and labor laws encourage unionization (tnough
 there are no legal requirements for unionization in any
 industry or branch of commerce.)
 Although it is difficult to generalize about labor union
 representation in the maquiladora (in-bond or duty-free zone)
 industry, overall labor relations are good. In all sectors
 the right of association and the right to organize and bargain
 collectively, a prohibition on the use of any form of forced
 labor, minimum age for the employment of children, the right
 to strike, and acceptable working conditions exist and are
 respected. Some firms are represented by the CTM, others by
 rival labor federations, and still others by independents.
 Eighty to 90 percent, however, are not organized at all.
 Fidel Velazquez, president of CTM, has been working with the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO) on the possibilities of unionizing
 maquiladora workers. To date there has been no reported
 progress as a result of these discussions.
 Government workers are almost fully unionized, but collective
 bargaining is much less common. Government workers are not
 permitted to bargain over wages but only over certain working
 conditions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Mexico is a signatory to the ILO conventions regarding the
 prohibition of forced or compulsory labor. Such practices are
 also prohibited by Mexican law. There have been no recent
 reports of forced labor in Mexico.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law sets the minimum.age for employment at 14 years.
 Children over 14 years but under 16 years may work but are
 subject to special legal protection and shorter working hours
 than adults. They cannot be employed in certain hazardous
 jobs. Child labor laws are observed fairly strictly in large
 and medium sized manufacturing and commercial establishments.
 They are less well observed in small shops and factories, and
 even less so among street vendors, many of whom are children.
 Enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the
 Labor Secretariat and local, state, and federal boards of
 conciliation and arbitration.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage set by law is upgraded at periodic intervals
 by the National Minimum Wage Commission, a tripartite body
 
 
 641
 MEXICO
 composed of government, trade union, and employer organization
 representatives. The current minimum wage in Mexico City and
 other high cost areas (there are 3 minimum wage zones in
 Mexico) is approximately $3.25 per day. Despite periodic
 increases, it has not changed much, in dollar terms, over the
 past 3 to 4 years, due to recurring devaluations of the peso.
 The Mexican minimum wage provides for a barely acceptable
 standard of living for the substantial number of workers who
 receive it.
 The maximum length of the workweek is 48 hours. In recent
 years, the average workweek has declined considerably, to a
 level of 42 to 43 hours. The CTM and other Mexican unions are
 currently campaigning' to reduce the legal maximum, through
 proposed legislition, from 48 to 40. hours.
 Mexican legislation on occupational health and safety is
 relatively advanced and provides substantial protection.
 Health and safety standards are better enforced in large
 firms. There appears to be a higher incidence of industrial
 accidents in smaller firms and on construction sites, a
 reflection of a lack of sufficient inspection personnel to
 adequately monitor health and safety regulations.
