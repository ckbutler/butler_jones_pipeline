 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a
 popularly elected president and a bicameral congress. The
 Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary whose members are
 appointed by the Senate. Political parties representing the
 ideological spectrum from left to right freely and actively
 participated in the May 1986 national elections, the sixth to
 be held since 1966. In the elections of 1978 and 1986, the
 reins of government were peacefully transferred from one
 ruling party to the opposition. The current President,
 Joaquin Balaguer, was inaugurated in August 1986 and will
 serve until August 1990.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of
 Investigation (DNI), and the military serve as the security
 services. The PN has general investigative and principal
 arrest authority. The military has investigative and general
 arrest authority for armed forces personnel and can arrest
 suspects apprehended by military patrols. The DNI is the
 principal national investigative body for national security
 concerns and generally does not have arrest authority. In
 1988 the Government created the National Executive Council for
 the Control of Drugs to coordinate domestic and international
 narcotics programs, bringing under a single authority elements
 of the National Police, military, and DNI. All branches of
 the security services are responsive to civilian authority.
 The Dominican Republic has a mixed economy based primarily on
 agriculture (approximately 15 percent of the gross domestic
 product) and services. The Government accounts for nearly 25
 percent of the gross domestic product and controls several
 major industries (sugar, the national airline, electricity,
 etc.). Historically, sugar has been the principal export,
 although tourism, free trade zones, and remittances from
 Dominicans living abroad now generate more foreign exchange.
 The country continues to face the burdens of a $4-billion
 external debt, a 45-percent inflation rate (estimate for
 1989), a rapidly growing population (2.3 percent annually),
 and concomitant high levels of unemployment (some 25 percent)
 and underemployment (20-25 percent). During 1989, discontent
 over the continued deterioration of basic public services,
 inflation, and low wage levels generated a series of
 demonstrations (some of which became violent), serious
 sectoral strikes (including extended teachers' and public
 doctors' strikes), and a national general strike in June.
 Dominicans generally continued to exercise the broad range of
 human rights provided by the Constitution. The political
 environment remained unrestricted, and individuals and
 political groups freely debated and criticized the
 Government's policies and programs. The major human rights
 problem which has continued to generate criticism within the
 Dominican Republic and abroad was the abuse of human and
 worker rights of Haitians residing in the Dominican Republic.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of political killings in 1989.
 Daniel Mirambeaux, an ex-member of in extremist, leftist party
 who was accused of murdering a New York City policeman during
 
 
 552
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 a drug-related crime in October 1988, died on June 30 as a
 result of a fall from a third story landing in the national
 police headquarters as he was on his way to be transported
 back to the United States to stand trial. The official
 autopsy stated that the death "was highly compatible with
 homicide," fueling-charges that the Dominican Government
 engineered the death. The four Dominican police officers who
 had custody of Mframbeaux at the time of his death all
 testified that Mirambeaux jumped from the landing. The
 official report and an independent investigation by the United
 States Federal Bureau of Investigation, (done at the Dominican
 Government's invitation), both determined the probable cause
 of death as suicide. The four police officers involved were
 suspended from active duty for "gross negligence" in allowing
 Miramb~aux to escape physical custody. They were themselves
 placed in custody, and a court-martial recommended that they
 be separated from the police. On December 22, however,
 President Balaguer announced that, as an act of Christmas
 clemency, he was ordering their release and reinstatement,
 explaining that they had already been punished enough for
 their act of negligence.
 In two additional cases, the police have been accused of abuse
 of prisoners leading to death. In August, Montero Mondesi
 died of blows allegedly received while in police custody at
 the National Police Headquarters. The officials in charge"
 were arrested, and the police chief ordered an autopsy and
 complete investigation. In September, relatives charged that
 Armando Moya Salazar died in custody after being tortured by
 the police.
 Members of the military were implicated by relatives in the
 alleged beating and death of Geovanny Cuello Sencion.
 According to press accounts, Cuello and some friends were
 picked up by a military patrol following a bar fight he had
 with an off-duty soldier. The press reported that Cuello was
 held at a military base and beaten for several days, and he
 subsequently died on September 16. The military alleges that
 Cuello and his friends were involved with illegal drugs. The
 police chief led a high-level investigation into the
 incident. The military court tried four enlisted men who made
 up the patrol. In December their case was still under final
 review. No officers have been brought to trial in the
 incident.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances in 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but. several cases of
 mistreatment of prisoners or detainees by law enforcement
 officials and military personnel were reported by the press.
 In its 1989 report covering 1988, Amnesty International (AI)
 expressed concern over the reported beating of several people
 in detention following their arrest in mass demonstrations.
 The Government states that it has investigated reports of
 alleged police abuses, but any results of such investigations
 have not been made public.
 
 
 553
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no credible reports of arbitrary arrest or exile of
 citizens for expressing views contrary to or critical of the
 Government. However, in mid-December 1988, the Government
 summarily deported Dr. Paul Etienne, a Haitian who worked for
 a nongovernmental center providing health and social services
 to Haitian sugar plantation workers. Human rights groups,
 including AI, observed there was no apparent reason for the
 expulsion other than his criticisms of the Government's
 treatment of Haitians.
 There have also been frequent assertions that security forces
 forcibly detain Haitians and require them to cut sugar cane on
 state-owned plantations (see Section 2.d.)
 The Constitution stipulates that suspects may be detained for
 a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before arraignment,
 after which they must be charged or released. In 1989 there
 were procedural complaints that people were being held in
 prison improperly. In response, the Attorney General began to
 review prison records in June. She subsequently ordered the
 release of 56 prisoners being held without timely trial or
 without legal cause, faulting the District Attorney's office
 for issuing "irregular" holding orders.
 In the last half of 1989, the judiciary, some elements of the
 executive branch, and various human rights groups complained
 that prisoners were being improperly held, often after court
 release orders had been issued in their behalf. Police and
 prison officials, on their part, complained that courts were
 releasing dangerous criminals or letting them off with light
 sentences. After evaluations by the Attorney General and the
 Santo Domingo District Attorney, over 50 prisoners were
 subsequently released. In late November, President Balaguer
 responded to the demands that the Government ensure that court-
 ordered releases be obeyed by announcing that the executive
 branch was preparing legislation to reform the habeas corpus
 law.
 Large numbers of people were detained during the year.as a
 result of protest activities. Many hundreds were reportedly
 detained as a measure to prevent violence on the eve of the
 June general strike; the strike was peaceful, and those
 detained were released shortly thereafter. Also in late June,
 a number of teachers were arrested during a confrontation
 between striking Dominican teachers' association members and
 police; the teachers were released within a few days.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are no known political prisoners. The Constitution
 provides for a public trial. No special court for political
 or national security cases exists, and civilians may not be
 tried by a military court. Members of the armed forces are
 tried by military courts, except under specific circumstances
 and only after review by a military board. The appeals
 procedure, which includes appellate courts and the Supreme
 Court, is widely utilized. Court-appointed lawyers normally
 are provided at public expense to indigents only in criminal
 cases; they are seldom provided in criminal misdemeanor cases
 in which their provision is at the court's discretion.
 Prosecuting attorneys are appointed by the executive branch.
 
 
 554
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Judges at all levels are appointed and approved by the
 Senate. They are nominally independent of the executive
 branch and are subject to removal or transfer by a majority
 vote in the Senate.' Their terms 6f office correspond roughly
 to that of the President and other elected officials. The
 newly elected Senate can either designate their replacements
 or reconfiim them.
 Judges earn a relatively low salary, and there have been
 allegations that the fairness and timeliness of some trials
 have been subject to influence and manipulation. There is
 widespread public belief that a number of judges and
 prosecutors accept bribes. To increase the professionalism of
 the juqiciary, the'Government, in cooperation with the U.S.
 Department of Justice, began in 1988 and continued in 1989 a
 program which provides judges and court attorneys with
 professional training in the legal aspects of criminal
 investigation.
 The slowness of the judicial system, a problem for many years,
 continues to~come under criticism. In an effort to attack the
 backlog of cases in the courts, the Supreme Court, with
 technical assistance from the U.S. Government, has
 computerized the Dominican central files and court docket.
 Although the right to judicial determination of the legality
 of detention exists, preventive detention of those awaiting
 trial is legal and commonly employed, and many of those
 accused remain in prisgn for lengthy periods.
 Ex-president Salvador Jorge Blanco (of the opposition
 Dominican Revolutionary Party) returned to the Dominican
 Republic after an absence of 18 months in November 1988 and
 remains involved in a lengthy trial on charges of corruption
 during his presidency (1982-86). He maintains that his
 prosecution is politically motivated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no credible reports of arbitrary governmental
 interference with the private lives of persons or families.
 Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the home are
 generally observed. A residence may not be searched except in
 the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor,
 excluding cases of "hot pursuit" or instances where there is
 probable cause to believe that a crime is actually being
 committed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are provided for by law and are respected in
 practice. Dominicans of all political persuasions enjoy
 freedom of speech and regularly exercise it. The numerous
 privately owned radio and television stations air all
 political points of view. Dominican newspapers are privately
 owned and freely reflect independent and opposition points of
 view. There is no government censorship on political grounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice. Outdoor public marches and meetings
 require government permits, which are routinely granted.
 
 
 555
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Indoor gatherings of political parties, labor unions, and
 other associations are unrestricted.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, and others
 function freely and can maintain relations with counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 Although formed as professional associations, many of these
 organizations take on roles similar to those of labor unions,
 including protest activities and strikes.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Discrimination on religious grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to hold
 public office, no restrictions on the practice of religious
 faiths, and no social discrimination based on religion.
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman Catholic,
 and the Church's preeminent position is recognized in the
 Concordat between the Dominican Republic and the Holy See.
 There have been no credible reports of government interference
 with the free practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual legal restrictions on-travel within or
 outside the country for citizens. However, the status and
 treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican Republic and of
 persons of Haitian descent have generated criticism by the
 press and private groups, both in the Dominican Republic and
 abroad. The Haitian community of perhaps 1,000,000 is
 composed mainly of illegal immigrants seeking improved
 economic conditions. Over the years, many have remained after
 the end of seasonal agricultural contracts and others have
 slipped over the border. In February 1989, Haiti created the
 Commission for Haitians Overseas to try to induce these
 Haitians to return.
 In early January, a truck carrying some 73 Haitians overturned
 killing 47 Haitians. Several survivors told the press that
 they had been captured at the border, kept in military
 barracks for several days, and then put on the truck guarded
 by Dominican soldiers destined for a sugar plantation. This
 incident focused national and international attention on the
 situation of Haitians in the Dominican Republic. More
 attention arose when the 1989 International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) again faulted the Dominican
 Government for its failure to address problems pointed out in
 a 1983 ILO study of Haitians in the Dominican Republic. In
 addition, the ILO General Assembly made specific criticisms of
 the Government for failure to protect worker rights of
 Haitians working in the Dominican Republic.
 A May 1989 report issued by the private U.S. human rights
 group, Americas Watch (AW), charged that the Government and
 the state-owned sugar corporation (CEA) did not allow the free
 travel of Haitian seasonal agricultural workers during the
 sugar harvest, restricting them to the sugar plantations which
 had their contract and not permitting them to return to
 Haiti. It has also charged that security forces paid
 recruiters to lure Haitians into the Dominican Republic who
 were then forcibly taken to the state-owned sugar company
 
 
 556
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 plantations. The Dominican Government denied these charges
 (see Section 6.c.).
 For the most part, the Government-does not deport illegal
 Haitian immigrants, although it may do so under Dominican
 immigration law. The Government claimed that this policy is
 motivatedby humanitarian considerations, noting the problems
 the new Haitian Government would have in reassimilating
 hundreds of thousands of its poorer citizens. As a result of
 ILO and other criticism of Dominican Government treatment of
 Haitian residents, and calls for the Government to legalize
 undocumented persons of Haitian descent born in and living in
 the Dominican Republic, many economic and political leaders
 are publicly calling for the enforcement of immigration laws
 and thd deportation of large numbers of Haitians.
 Persons seeking-political refuge (virtually all are Haitian)
 are not repatriated if the Government determines that they
 have a legitimate fear of persecution. Both Haitian
 ex-President Henri Namphy and ex-Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck
 Romain were among Haitians from fallen governments who fled to
 the Dominican Republic and safety in 1988 and remained through
 1989. A group of Haitian military officers who led an aborted
 coup attempt in April were allowed into the Dominican Republic
 in transit to the United States. Six members of the Basque
 separatist organization "ETA" received political asylum in the
 Dominican Republic in April.--Despite subsequent 'equests from
 Spain, the Dominican Government stated that it would not
 extraditeor return the six men.
 The Constitution requires that all foreigners abstain from
 political activities while in the Dominican Republic. During
 1989, the Avril Government in Haiti repeatedly complained that
 the Dominican Republic was being used by Haitian dissidents,
 especially those from the Duvalier regime, as a safehaven for
 antigovernment activity. However, the Dominican Government
 has insisted that it will enforce its prohibition, especially
 in asylum cases, of political activity by foreigners.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning multiparty democracy
 in which governments are freely elected by the citizenry every
 4 years by secret ballot. Opposition groups of the left,
 right, and center operate openly and participated in the 1986
 elections in which nearly three-quarters of the registered
 electorate voted, selecting national, provincial, and
 municipal office holders. All major parties and a large
 number of sma-ller parties are involved in open and free
 campaigning for the next general election, scheduled for May
 1990.
 Although the bicameral Congress is similar in structure and
 representation to that of the United States, it exerts limited
 power in pactice. The President uses the veto, broad
 discretion to act by decree, and his influence as the head of
 his party (which currently has an overwhelming majority in the
 Senate and a near majority in the Chamber of Deputies) to
 exercise principal influence in enacting laws and
 regulations. However, in its enactment of bills, the Congress
 does provide an open forum for the free exchange of views and
 debate. On rare occasions, the Congress successfully
 challenges the President.
 
 
 557
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The access of international human rights organizations is
 unrestricted. During 1989, AW visited the Dominican Republic
 twice to study the issue of Haitian seasonal workers. AW
 representatives freely met with a wide variety of people,
 including a number of government officials, and traveled
 throughout the country.
 Private organizations which freely report and comment on human
 rights include the Dominican Human Rights Committee, the
 Dominican Union for the Defense of Human Rights, and the
 National Committee of Human and Labor Rights. The major labor
 confederations (which represent the principal regional and
 international labor organizations) also have offices and
 internal organizations which work with and for worker rights
 and on the Haitian agricultural workers' issue. There have
 been no credible reports that the Government has restricted
 entry to, or activities within, the Dominican Republic of
 these organizations.
 The Dominican Republic participates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and-supports efforts to
 promote human rights in international forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on sex and race is prohibited by law.
 Divorce is easily obtainable by either spouse, and women can
 hold property in their own names apart from their husbands.
 Nonetheless, women traditionally have not shared equal social
 and economic status or opportunity with men.
 There is no officially sanctioned violence against women,
 although such violence, including domestic violence such as
 wife beating, does occur. However, a lack of statistical data
 makes it difficult to determine its actual extent.- Human
 rights and women's rights groups do not consider violence
 agsinst women to be one of their major concerns, and
 government policy generally reflects this attitude. During
 1989, the Government did take several positive steps to
 protect women. For example, during the summer the police
 mounted an effective campaign to combat kidnap-for-rape crimes
 in Santo Domingo.
 The Dominican populace is predominantly nonwhite (73 percent
 mixed and 11 percent black). For historical reasons and
 because of sharp cultural differences, there is a strain of
 prejudice against Haitians in Dominican society. This often
 translates into discrimination against those with darker skin
 (i.e., Haitian appearing) (see Section 2.d.). Dark-skinned
 Dominicans, including some of Haitian descent, have been
 successful in a variety of fields, including elected political
 office. Still, persons of Haitian descent
 ("Dominico-Haitianos") traditionally fill the lowest economic
 and social niches, in part because of'concern about possible
 illegal status, a lack of skills, and problems with the
 language and culture. AW has reported that due to prejudicial
 attitudes, children of such persons often cannot obtain
 documents to prove their citizenship and therefore are
 unable to attend school. There is no evidence that children
 of Dominican citizens of Haitian descent have been unable to
 obtain such documentation or attend school.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the freedom to organize labor
 unions, and'also for the rights of labor to strike and the
 private sector to lock out. However, unions operate under the
 handicap of a dated labor code (1951) that gives unions few
 rights vis-a-vis management and gives no effective protection
 for organizers or union officials. The labor code specifies
 in detail the steps required to constitute a legal union,
 federation, or c6nfederation, and labor objects that the
 Government can use the 'failure to comply with every minute
 detail to withhold official recognition, as AW reports it has
 done with the Union of Cane-Cutters of Barahona, which applied
 in February 1988 to the Ministry of Labor and has not yet been
 recognized.
 The labor code defines the right to strike but also denies the
 right to strike to workers in public services and prohibits
 general strikes. Nevertheless, professional organizations
 representing public service workers have not been deterred
 from strikes--including major work stoppages in 1989 by
 doctors, nurses, teachers, agronomists, and judges, as well as
 participation by many public workers in the June 1989 general
 strike. Although these strikes were illegal under the labor
 code, the Government negotiated with the striking parties.
 The ILO's COE in 1989 noted several deficiencies in the
 Dominican labor code, including the prohibition of sympathy
 strikes and political strikes.
 Organized labor in the Domipican Republic represents about 12
 percent of the work force and is divided among 8 competing and
 highly politicized confederations and a small number of
 independent unions. The confederations exercise only a
 limited degree of control or coordination over their
 affiliates and receive only minimal financial support from
 their members. An umbrella group to coordinate organized
 labor was formed in July 1989 as a result of the general
 strike, to negotiate on a sector-wide basis with the private
 sector on a variety of labor issues.
 Labor groups represent the political/ideological spectrum, and
 several are associated with regional and international labor
 organizations- According to knowledgeable estimates based on
 the membership of Dominican organized labor, 32 percent were
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, 16 percent with the World Confederation of Labor, and
 25 percent with the Communist-controlled Woild Federation of
 Trade Unions- (WFTU). An additional 22 percent were affiliated
 with the Communist regional trade union organization
 (CPUSTAL), apart from the WFTU. There have been no credible
 reports of the Government interfering in or
 restricting association with international labor organizations
 or activities.
 Many of the labor groups are affiliated with political parties
 and frequently pursue partisan political objectives as much as
 workers' economic interests, but are independent of government
 control. The ailing economy and high unemployment and
 underemployment have hampered the growth of organized labor.
 
 
 559
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor code clearly stipulates that workers cannot be
 dismissed because of their trade union membership or
 activities. Still, there are complaints that these
 protections are ignored and that labor leaders are being
 discriminated against. Criticism is often directed at Article
 69 of the code which essentially permits an employer to
 dismiss a worker without cause. The ILO's COE noted in 1989
 that the Government still needed to strengthen measures
 protecting workers against antiunion discrimination.
 Although the labor movement is growing and collective
 bargaining is increasing, both continue to be severely
 limited by the competition and fragmentation of labor and
 labor's scarce financial and manpower resources in difficult
 economic times. One of the fastest growing economic sectors
 is the industrial free trade zones which began in the late
 1960's and now employ about 112,000 workers (5.5 percent of
 available jobs), representing the third largest source of
 employment after the Government and the sugar industry. The
 free trade zone labor force, over 70 percent female, is
 generally nonunionized. Although the labor code applies to
 free trade zones, in both 1988 and 1989 there were allegations
 that workers identified in applications for union recognition
 were dismissed from free trade zone companies shortly after
 the presentation of documents to the Secretariat of Labor.
 Labor union officials also charged that the Secretariat of
 Labor failed to act on formal applications for recognition of
 unions in the free trade zones within the required 30-day
 period.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law. There was no
 contract between the Governments of Haiti and the Dominican
 Republic to bring in Haitian cane cutters for the 1989
 harvest. Al reported that in 1989, as in the past, Haitian
 laborers in the sugar cane fields, especially those in the
 country illegally, were subject to abusive living and working
 conditions and in some cases were forced to work against their
 will. AW charged that the Government (which controls a major
 part of the sugar industry through the parastatal corporation
 CEA) used military and police to round up Haitians and then
 compelled them to sign a sugar cane cutter .contract or be
 deported. Some human rights groups report that they have
 documented cases of Dominicans of Haitian descent and Haitians
 residing legally in the country being subjected to this
 treatment. The issue has been under review for a number of
 years by ILO supervisory bodies. In the 1989 annual meeting,
 the Committee on the Application of Conventions and
 Recommendations expressed detailed concern about the situation
 of Haitians on the CEA plantations, and the ILO Conference
 adopted a "special paragraph" in its annual report critical of
 the Dominican Republic for violating ILO standards on forced
 labor.
 In response to the AW report alleging that persons of Haitian
 origin were coerced to cut sugar cane against their will,
 President Balaguer said that the charges were purely political
 in nature. The Acting Foreign Secretary admitted that
 individual abuses may occur, but he affirmed that this in no
 way reflected Dominican Government policy. The CEA denied the
 charges, and the CEA director said that CEA does not and will
 not-tolerate abuses towards Haitian workers.
 
 
 560
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 d. MinimUm Age for Employment of Children
 The Dominican labor code prohibits employment of youths under
 14 years of age, and restricts the nighttime employment of
 youths aged 14 to 18. The labor code also provides that
 employees under age 18 work no more than 8 hours a day, and
 specifies that those 18 years and younger may not be employed
 in dangerous or unhealthy jobs. In practice, many of the
 restrictions in the labor code are ignored. Young people,
 including minors younger than. 14 years of age, engage in a
 variety of work which technically violates the labor
 regulations. There are many youths in the informal economy,
 selling newspapers, washing car windows, shining shoes, or
 begging in the streets. The Dominican Government denied that
 it encouraged or deliberately permitted the illegal employment
 of youths. During the year, the Secretariat of Labor
 investigated the employment of youths in Santo Domingo and
 Santiago areas and enforced the law in cases where companies
 were found with underage workers or teens without proper
 permission. Some young workers obtained work permits and
 continued their employment. Those who were unable to obtain
 permits were released. Some companies were subjected to small
 fines for violating the law. The AW report charged that
 Haitian youths were being recruited and used to harvest sugar
 cane for CEA. The Episcopal Black Bishops' Conference, held
 in Santo Domingo in April, made a similar charge (see Section
 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code establishes that all workers are entitled to 24
 hours of rest after 6 days of work; in practice, a typical
 workweek is Monday through Friday plus half a day on
 Saturday. However, for manual and unskilled labor, longer
 hours are not unusual. Safety and health conditions at places
 of work do not always meet legal standards. The existing
 social security system does not apply to all workers and is
 underfunded; as a result benefits are low, payments often
 delayed, and medical care is'limited and available only irr the
 major cities.
 Conditions among agricultural workers are in general much
 worse, with little rest and long hours during harvest and
 planting seasons. Some observers alleged that Haitian workers
 on CEA plantations are not allowed to eat or rest during the
 day at harvest time and are required to work significantly
 longer than the legal 48-hour week. The Government has
 responded that Haitians live under the same conditions as
 Dominicans doing equivalent work and has denied that it
 condones-or'permits mistreatment of workers. The CEA
 management has affirmed that it would punish any manager found
 mistreating workers.
 In 1988 the Government, in response to terms worked out in
 church-sponsored talks including the government, labor, and
 business sectors to maintain real wages in the face of high
 inflation, raised the basic minimum monthly wage from $55 to
 $80. Some smaller businesses and agricultural workers were
 exempt from the new pay scale. As a result of the June
 general strike, the minimum wage for the public sector was
 raised in August 1989 from $64 to $80 a month. The general
 strike also led to negotiations between organized labor and
 business leaders to raise the private sector minimum wage.
 Business leaders unilaterally granted a raise from $80 to $104
 a month in August, while negotiations continued. In October
 
 
 561
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 the Government's National Salary Committee officially raised
 the national private sector minimum wage to $104, the
 voluntary level offered by the private sector. However, after
 a threat of a national labor strike by seven of the eight
 national labor confederations, the Government and labor
 negotiated an additional raise of $7 to $111.
 According to labor leaders and many private sector
 businessmen, the vast majority of workers receive only the
 minimum wage. The current $111 a month is not sufficient,
 even with high government subsidies on essential goods and
 services, to maintain a small family at a minimally acceptable
 standard of living. A report published in mid-1989 by a local
 economic study center concluded that real salaries had
 declined by 50 percent since 1970. A June 1989 study by a
 local retail association found that feeding a family of five
 at a subsistence level (assuming one meal a day, with
 inexpensive canned tuna as the only animal protein) would cost
 $137 a month.
