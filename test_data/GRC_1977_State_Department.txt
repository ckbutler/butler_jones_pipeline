 GREECE
 A new Constitution, developed following the fall of the
 Junta and Greece's return to democracy in 1974, incor-
 porated many of the elements contained in the United
 Nations Declaration on Human Rights, and included specific
 provisions against "torture, bodily maltreatment, impair-
 ment of health, and use of psychological violence." The
 latter practices were of particular concern in Greece
 because of their frequency during the Junta period.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Although there have been some allegations of mistreatment
 of prisoners by individual officials, the Government has
 clearly effected significant changes in the conduct of
 security officials.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no evidence of any such treatment or punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Reports of arbitrary detention or invasion of the home no
 longer arise.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials, even of persons accused of human rights abuses
 during the Junta period, have met international standards
 of fairness and openness.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is no evidence of any such practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Greek Government is committed to fulfilling basic
 (296)
 
 
 .human needs for food, shelter, health care and education.
 The Government has sought particularly to make education
 more accessible, more democratic, and more relevant to
 Greek economic development.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 There is freedom of thought, speech, press, religion and
 assembly.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within the country, and out
 of it.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Persons of all political persuasions, including members of
 the communist parties, are free to participate in the
 political process in Greece. The new Constitution pro-
 vides universal suffrage for all persons twenty and over.
 Workers are free to organize and join trade unions, to
 participate in collective bargaining and to strike.
 The Greek Government asserts that Greece's small Moslem
 minority is treated exactly like any other Greek citizens.
 In support of their claim that they provide the-Moslem
 minority absolute equality of opportunity, Greeks point
 to the growth of the Moslem community in Greece in the
 past 50 years, to Moslem ownership of valuable and pro-
 ductive land, and to the presence of two Moslem deputies
 in the Greek Parliament representing Moslem constituencies
 in the north.
 On the other hand, there have been periodic complaints of
 harassment and maltreatment. These generally concern such
 matters as buying and selling land, and bureaucratic delays
 in processing official papers.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the best of our knowledge, the Government has not
 objected to visits and investigations of human rights
 conditions by Amnesty International and others.
