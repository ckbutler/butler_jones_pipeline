 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitution
 adopted in 1947. Sovereignty is vested in the people, and the
 Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. On the national
 level, power is divided among executive, legislative, and
 judicial branches. Executive power is vested in a cabinet,
 composed of a prime minister and ministers of state,
 responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house parliament. The
 Diet, elected by universal suffrage and secret ballot,
 designates the prime minister, who must be a member of that
 body. Nearly 70 percent of the electorate usually votes in
 general elections, contested by six political parties covering
 a broad ideological spectrum. The ruling Liberal Democratic
 Party (LDP) has held a parliamentary majority for 35 years.
 The judicial system has several layers of courts, with the
 Supreme Court as final authority.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally
 respects the human rights of the populace. However, there
 were recurrent reports of harsh treatment of suspects in
 custody. The police force is firmly under the control of the
 civil authorities. The Civil Liberties Bureau in the Ministry
 of Justice and the Human Rights and Refugee Division in the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating to human
 rights practices in Japan.
 Japan's free market economy has the world's second largest
 gross national product. Increased consumer demand and capital
 investment have maintained the economy's steady expansion over
 the last 4 years. As the Japanese Government implements its
 commitments under the recent Structural Impediments
 Initiative, the economy is expected to become oriented more
 toward Japan's consumers and more open to foreign goods and
 foreign direct investment.
 The Constitution states, "all of the people are equal under
 the law and there shall be no discrimination in political,
 economic, or social relations because of race, creed, sex,
 social status, or family origin." The human rights assured by
 the Constitution and Bill of Rights are secured by a just and
 efficient legal system. However, the "Burakumin" (a group
 traditionally treated as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's
 indigenous people), women, and alien residents experience
 varying degrees of discrimination. Current laws against
 discrimination contain virtually no penalties for offenders.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of political or other extrajudicial
 killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions, secret arrests,
 clandestine detention, or hostage holding by security forces
 or any other organization.

 JAPAN
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degradinq treatment
 or punishment is provided for in the Constitution. According
 to reports by several Japanese bar associations, police often
 use physical violence, including kickings and beatings; to
 obtain confessions from suspects in custody. While such abuse
 remains a problem, several recent court cases have overturned
 convictions obtained by forced confession.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is provided for
 in the Constitution and respected in practice. 'Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Persons cannot be detained without charge, and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. The
 length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on
 the nature of the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months; the
 average is 1 to 2 months. By law there is no right to legal
 representation during-interrogation., However, the Ministry of
 Justice has stipulated that a detained person should be able
 to meet with counsel within 48 hours of the accused's
 request. This time limit is sometimes ignored. Counsel is
 provided at government expense when the arrested person cannot
 afford one. Preventive detention does not exist.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, a suspect may be held in
 police custody for up to 72 hours. This period may be
 extended by a judge for up to 25 days- if necessary. If an
 indictment'follows, the suspect is transferred to a criminal
 detention facility.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon arrest and assured a public trial'by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the
 right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as
 well as free and private access to counsel, although the right
 to such .access is sometimes abridged in practice. Defendants
 are also protected from the application of laws retroactively
 and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a
 formal indictment has been made. Judges are appointed by the
 Cabinet for a 10-year term which can be renewed until the age
 of 65. Justices of'the Supreme Court may serve until the age
 of 70, but face periodic review through popular referendum. A
 defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial
 court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by
 law, appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of
 courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial
 authority. There is no trial by jury in Japan. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, Or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Standards
 for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbitrary
 
 
 912
 JAPAN
 searches. There are no reports that the Government or any
 other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution, an independent press and judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several Christian denominations. Foreign missionaries are
 welcome and gain admission to Japan through a specific visa
 category for foreign religious workers. Some temples and
 shrines receive public support as treasured national
 properties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japanese nationality
 can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or by
 failure to elect Japanese nationality at the proper age.
 In 1985 the Government agreed to the permanent settlement of a
 total of 10,000 Vietnamese refugees, of which about 6,800 have
 been processed. Two government-administered resettlement
 centers are responsible for providing training and employment
 assistance. Immigrants reportedly face frequent police
 harassment and widespread discrimination in obtaining housing,
 jobs, and health care.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to
 change their government. ,A parliamentary democracy, Japan is
 ruled by the political party or parties able to form a
 majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. The
 Liberal Democratic Party has been in power on the national
 level--through control of the lower house--continuously since
 its establishment in 1955. The political system is open,
 however. The LDP owes its longevity primarily to pragmatic
 and effective governance and to the fragmentation of the
 opposition parties. Local and prefectural governments are
 often controlled by coalitions. Elections on all levels are
 held frequently, suffrage is universal, and ballots are secret.
 Postwar population movements have left some parliamentary
 electoral districts disproportionately large; some districts
 have more than three times the population of others. The
 Supreme Court has called for greater equality in the value of
 
 
 913
 JAPAN
 votes, but the lack of a nonpartisan mechanism to make such
 changes has slowed the process of adjustment.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not obstruct or inhibit the investigative
 activities of international nongovernmental organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The exclusive nature of Japanese society, reinforced by
 cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of isolation
 from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority
 groups. Despite improvements in Japan's legal system, Korean
 permanent residents (most of whom were born, raised, and
 educated in Japan) and the Burakumin (descendants of
 feudal-era "outcasts" who 'practiced so-called unclean
 professions such as butchering and undertaking) are frequently
 the victims of entrenched social discrimination which has
 restricted the access of both groups to private housing,
 employment, and marriage opportunities. The Ainu, descendants
 of the original inhabitants of Japan, are also subject to
 discrimination, especially regarding employment opportunities.
 Beginning in 1969, the-Government introduced a number of
 social, economic, and legal programs designed to improve
 conditions for the Burakumin and hasten their assimilation
 into the mainstream of Japanese society. While the Government
 has approved funding for these programs through 1992,
 organizations representing the interests of the Burakumin are
 lobbying for an extension.
 An ongoing concern among permanent resident aliens residing in
 Japan, particularly second and third generation Korean
 residents who constitute 82 percent of all such aliens, is the
 legal obligation to carry an alien registration card and to be
 fingerprinted. Only one of the estimated 14,000 aliens who
 have refused to be fingerprinted--an American missionary who
 has attacked the law as racist-has been tried for this
 offense. After his appeal was dismissed by the Osaka District
 High Court in June, the missionary filed an appeal to the
 Supreme Court in Tokyo where his case is pending final
 judgment.
 In addition, Korean permanent residents are subject to various
 forms of entrenched social discrimination. In recent years
 the Government has enacted several laws and regulations  -
 extending to permanent resident aliens equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those
 qualified, and certain public employment rights. However,
 employment and social discrimination are still common.
 Antidiscrimination laws affecting Korean residents were
 initiated as government guidance and are not backed up by
 penalty provisions.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years' continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, most eligible aliens do not apply for
 citizenship, in part due to fears that their cultural identity
 would be erased by that act. In response to an appeal from
 the Republic of Korea, the Government agreed in April to
 
 
 914
 JAPAN~
 extend the privilege of permanent residency to some third
 generation Korean residents and their descendants. However,
 as written, the definition of "third generation" applies only
 to a small number of persons. Under the agreement, which
 updates the 1965 Japan-Republic of Korea legal status
 agreement, legally defined third-generation Korean residents
 will still be required to carry alien registrations. However,
 they will no longer be fingerprinted.
 Estimates of Japan's illegal foreign worker population range
 from 100,000 to 200,000 persons. The majority of these
 workers are from South and Southeast Asia, and have come in
 search of better paying manufacturing and construction jobs
 created by Japan's labor shortages. Activist groups claim
 that, with little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or
 their legal rights, foreign workers can easily be
 discriminated against by employers. The Government has tried
 to decrease the inflow of illegal foreign workers through
 recent revisions of the immigration law to assess penalties on
 employers of undocumented foreign workers. The Government
 also recently established a special committee to address the
 issue of foreign workers. Several citizens' groups are
 working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access
 to information on worker rights.
 Late in 1990, press stories and an Asia Watch article
 criticized Japan's failure to adequately protect Chinese
 students in Japan by extending the visas of those who fear
 persecution in China or by preventing intimidation by Chinese
 Embassy officials. The Japanese Government, however,
 considers that only a tiny fraction of the thousands of
 Chinese students in Japan have a well-founded fear of
 punishment from the Chinese Government. There is no
 information that any Chinese citizen claiming fear of
 punishment for prodemocracy activities since June 4, 1989, has
 been deported by the Japanese Government. There are credible
 allegations, however, that Chinese students seeking to extend
 their visas face numerous obstacles and impediments, although
 such problems are common among other foreign students as
 well. There are also credible reports that Chinese officials
 in Japan engage in harassment and intimidation tactics against
 prodemocracy students.
 The position of women in society and the home, although
 significantly improved during the last few decades, continues
 to reflect deep-seated traditional values which assign women a
 subordinate role. In this environment, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often goes unreported
 due to social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family
 or endangering the reputation of one's spouse or offspring.
 Typically, victimized women more often return to the home of
 their parents rather than file reports with authorities.
 Therefore, Ministry of Justice statistics on violence against
 women undoubtedly understate the scope of. the current
 situation. Many local governments are responding positively
 to a need for confidential assistance by establishing special
 women's consultation departments in police and prefectural
 offices.
 Although discrimination by private employers against women is
 prohibited by the Constitution, it persists. Women comprise
 40 percent of the employed population. Legislation over the
 past 30 years has been adjusted to accord them the same legal
 status as men. The Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986
 was aimed at eliminating sex discrimination in such areas as
 
 
 915
 JAPAN
 recruitment, pay, and working hours. The law does not
 expressly forbid discrimination; it merely states that
 "employers should endeavor" to avoid it. Under this law and
 -other regulations,.the Ministry of Labor attempts to encourage
 corporate compliance with its objectives by positive
 inducements, including subsidies; it does not enforce
 compliance through fines or other punitive measures. Despite
 the law, significant disparities in pay and access to
 managerial positions persist. Two 1990 court cases focused
 national media attention on discrimination against women. In
 one ongoing case, a female employee of a publishing firm in
 Fukuoka Prefecture charged her employer with sexual
 harassment. In another case, under deliberation for 10 years,
 the Tokyo District Court in a landmark ruling ordered a
 medical.insurance fund to pay approximately $650,000 in back
 wages to 18 women denied promotions granted to similarly
 qualified male colleagues. The court cited violations of
 Article 14 of the Constitution and the Labor Standards Law.
 Through cases such as these, public awareness of
 discrimination against women and sexual harassment in the
 workplace has increased. Some government entities have also
 established hotlines and designated ombudsmen to handle
 complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize, bargain, and act collectively
 is assured by the Constitution. Approximately 26 percent of
 the active work force belongs to unions. Unions are free of
 government control and influence. The Japanese Trade Union
 Confederation (Rengo), which represents 8 million Japanese
 workers, was formed in 1989 through the merger of several
 confederations and is Japan's largest labor organization.
 There is no requirement for a single trade union structure,
 and there are no restrictions on who may be a union official.
 Japanese law allows unions to lobby and to make political
 campaign contributions, and most unions are involved in
 political activity as well as labor relations. Rengo and
 other labor groups are active in supporting political parties
 and individual candidates, and promoting their political and
 social agenda. Organized labor generally supports the
 opposition political parties and provides key funds and
 manpower. The right to strike is'implicit in the
 Constitution, and it was exercised frequently in 1990. Public
 employees, however, do not have the right to strike, although
 they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to
 resolve disputes. In exchange for a ban on their right to
 strike, government employees' pay raises are determined by the
 Government based on a recommendation by the independent
 National Personnel Authority. Unions are active in
 international bodies, most notably the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive
 international contacts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution states that unions have the right to
 organize, bargain, and act collectively and these rights are
 exercised in practice. Collective bargaining is widely
 practiced. The annual "Spring Wage Offensive," in which
 individual unions in each -ndustry conduct negotiations
 simultaneously with their firms, attracts national attention.
 Japanese management usually consults closely with its
 
 
 916
 JAPAN
 enterprise union on issues. However, trade unions are
 independent of management and aggressively pursue the
 interests of their workers. Antiunion discrimination is
 prohibited by law and in practice does not take place.
 Members of the armed forces, police, and fire fighters are not
 permitted to organize. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Standards Law prohibits the use of forced labor, and
 there are no known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the revised Labor Standards Law of 1987, minors under 15
 years of age may not be employed as workers and those under
 the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or
 harmful work. Child labor laws are rigorously enforced by the
 Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Standards Law provides for the phased reduction of
 maximum working hours from the present 46-hour 6-day workweek
 to 40 hours by the early 1990's. Minimum wages are set by
 industry and region. For example, effective in October 1990,
 the Tokyo metropolitan area minimum hourly wage, the highest
 regionally set rate, was increased by approximately 4.8
 percent over 1989's rate to $4.28. Japan's lowest regional
 minimum wage rate is Kagoshima Prefecture's $3.66. In
 addition, regions have minimum wage rates for certain
 industries. These vary from region to region, but they are
 higher than the regional minimum wage rates, which are not
 industry specific. These wage rates are sufficient to provide
 workers and their families with a decent living. The Ministry
 of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations
 governing occupational health and safety, principal among
 which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law of 1972.
