 MOROCCO
 The Constitution -of Morocco provides for a monarchy -with a parliament and an
 independent judiciary. Ultimate authority, however, rests with the King, who pre-
 sides over the Council of Ministers, appoints all members of the Government, and
 -may, at his discretion, terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the Par-
 liament, call for new elections, and rule by decree. King Hassan II has ruled for 38
 .years. Since. the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of
 a lower house, elected through universal suffrage, and an upper "Chamber of Coun-
 selors," whose members are elected by various regional, local, and professional coun-
 
 
 1759
 cils. The councils' members are themselves directly elected. The lower house of Par-
 liament also may dissolve the Government through a vote of no confidence. In
 March the King named a coalition government headed by opposition Socialist leader
 Abderrahmane Youssoufi and composed largely of ministers drawn from opposition
 parties. Prime Minister Youssoufi's Government is the first government drawn pri-
 marily from opposition parties in decades, and also represents the first opportunity
 for a coalition of socialist, left-of-center, and nationalist parties to be included in the
 Government. The King took this step in response to criticism of the November 1997
 parliamentary elections, which were held amid widespread, credible reports of vote
 buying by political parties and the Government, and excessive government inter-
 ference. The fraud and government pressure tactics led most independent observers
 to conclude that the results of the election were heavily influenced, if not predeter-
 mined, by the Government. The judiciary is subject to bribery and government influ-
 ence, however, the Youssoufi Government is implementing a reform program to de-
 velop greater independence and impartiality.
 The security apparatus includes several overlapping police and paramilitary orga-
 nizations. The Border Police, the National Security Police, and the Judicial Police
 are departments of the Ministry of Interior, while the Royal Gendarmerie reports
 to the palace. Members of the security forces continued to commit a number of seri-
 ous human rights abuses.
 Morocco has a mixed economy based largely on agriculture, fishing, light industry,
 phosphate mining, tourism, and remittances from citizens working abroad. Illegal
 cannabis production, much of which is destined for Europe, is also a significant eco-
 nomic activity. Economic growth is highly dependent on agricultural output, and has
 experienced wide fluctuations due to a series of debilitating droughts. While good
 rainfall during 1996 resulted in gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 11 percent,
 erratic rainfall resulted in GDP growth in 1997 of negative 2 percent. According to
 the Government's statistics, GDP grew 6.7 percent in 1998.
 The Government's human rights record improved measurably under the Youssoufi
 Government, although serious problems persisted in several areas. Citizens do not
 have the full right to change their government; however, the results of the Novem-
 ber 1997 legislative elections led to the King's appointment of an opposition coalition
 government for the first time, which marked a significant step toward increased de-
 mocratization.
 Nevertheless, human rights problems remain. Security forces occasionally torture
 and abuse detainees and prison conditions remain harsh. Authorities sometimes ig-
 nore legal provisions for due process during arrest and detention. However, there
 was progress during the year as the Youssoufi Government took measures to detain
 police charged with abuses, and to make autopsies available in cases of deaths in
 detention in order to dispel allegations of torture. The judiciary is subject to corrup-
 tion and Interior Ministry influence, although the Government in April instituted
 judicial reform efforts to increase the level of the judiciary's independence and im-
 partiality. Des pite some improvement during the year, including an easing of media
 censorship andsome easing of restrictions on demonstrations, the Government con-
 tinued to restrict freedom of speech and of the press in certain areas, and limited
 the freedoms of assembly, association, religion, and movement. In October and No-
 vember, police beat demonstrators and students, and also temporarily detained
 some persons. Although non-Muslim foreigners may practice their religions freely,
 missionaries who proselytize face court-ordered expulsion, and converts from Islam
 to other religions continue to experience social ostracism. Discrimination and domes-
 tic violence against women are common. Child labor also is a problem, and the Gov-
 ernment has not acted to end the plight of young girls who work in exploitative do-
 mestic servitude. Unions are subject to government interference.
 The Government includes a Minister for Human Rights, and, with the King's sup-
 port, Prime Minister Youssoufi pledged in April to "close the books" on Morocco's
 human rights past. With the King's support, the Government announced in Novem-
 ber several measures to ensure wider respect for human rights, including training
 teachers and developing curriculums to promote human rights education in primary
 schools. The Prime Minister also established an inter-ministerial human rights com-
 mission, which he chairs. On the King's instructions, the Government disclosed in-
 formation on 112 persons who disappeared from the 1960's to the 1990's, and re-
 leased 28 political prisoners. Press freedom expanded during the year, with a promi-
 nent journalist returning to her television show as a result of a government decision
 overturning her suspension for failing to prevent a guest from insulting a minister
 during a 1997 broadcast. Under the direction of the Minister of Interior, security
 forces disclosed results of autopsies to dispel allegations of abuse involving deaths
 in prison. The Government detained police charged with abuses, and announced the
 
 
 1760
 imprisonment, for 12 years, of two policemen responsible for a death in Tangier in
 1996.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, in August authorities arrested a policeman and four colleagues
 in Guercif for beating to death Omar Tayebi Bouhout, a man with whom one of the
 officers had a personal dispute. The accused remain in detention while they await
 trial. On November 28, two policemen responsible for the death of Mostapha
 Lemrabit in Tangier in 1996 were sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.
 Human rights groups allege that poor medical care in prisons results in unneces-
 sary "deaths; however, the Justice Ministry assigned more doctors to prisons and im-
 proved prison health facilities during the year (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new cases of disappearance for the third con-
 secutive year. While the forced disappearance of individuals who opposed the Gov-
 ernment and its policies occurred over several decades, the new Government
 pledged to ensure that such policies do not recur, and to disclose as much informa-
 tion as possible on past cases. Many of those who disappeared were members of the
 military who were implicated in attempts to overthrow the Government in 1971 and
 1972. Others were Sahrawis on Moroccans who challenged the Government's claim
 to the Western Sahara or other government policies. Many of those who disappeared
 were held in secret detention camps. -While the Government released about 300 such
 detainees in June 1991, and although in October it issued an announcementI on
 those who disappeared, to this day hundreds of Saharan and Moroccan families do
 not have any information about their missing relatives, many of whom disappeared
 over 20 years ago.
 In recent years the Government has quietly released several hundred persons who
 had disappeared, including about 300 in June 1991, but no explanation for their in-
 carceration has ever been provided. Local human rights monitors have concluded
 that many others died while at the notorious Tazmamart prison, which the Govern-
 ment has since closed. The Government has acknowledged 34 of these deaths and
 has provided death certificates to the families of all but 1 of the 34 who died.
 In an October 9 speech, the King directed that all human rights cases should be
 resolved "within 6 months." On October 15, the Royal Consultative Council on
 Human Rights (CCDH) announced the release of information on 112 cases of dis-
 appearances. According to the Council, 56 of the 112 who disappeared were de-
 ceased; family members of 33 of the deceased received death certificates from the
 Government. The Council added that eight persons believed'to have disappeared
 were alive and living abroad, and that four were alive and in Morocco. For the're-
 maining 44, -the Council 'said that it had no further information. Human rights
 groups and families pointed out discrepancies between their lists and those of the
 Government, asked the Government for more data about these cases, and demanded
 full explanations of causes and circumstances of these deaths and disclosure of the
 identities of those responsible. Some family groups claim that the Government is not
 divulging details on at least 50 more cases. In November the Council began meet-
 ings in various provinces with groups representing families of persons who had dis-
 appeared in order to collect data on their grievances and to conduct further research
 into the fate of those who remain missing: There were no developments in the dis-
 appearance of Abdullah Sherrouq, a student who was reportedly detained by secu-
 rity services on June 22, 1981. After 17 years, his family has been unable to learn
 anythiig -of his whereabouts or -his fate, despite appeals by Amnesty International
 (AI).
 Associations that seek information on those who  have disappeared, including a
 group representing Tazmamart prison survivors, operate openly and freely, and call
 upon the Government for-full disclosure of events surrounding cases that date back
 to the 1960's. Several front-page articles in newspapers affiliated with parties in the
 governing coalition called at various times during the year for full disclosure on all
 outstanding cases of disappearance. The associations also call for compensation to
 families of those who have disappeared, death certificates and the return of the re-
 mains of those who died, and prosecution of responsible officials. The Government
 indicated that it would be more open about providing information in these past
 cases.
 The Government pays a monthly stipend of $550 (5,000 dirhams) to 28 former
 prisoners who suri-ved 18 to 20 years in solitary confinement under harsh condi-
 tions at Tazmamart prison in connection with the coup attempts in 1971. and 1972.
 After their release; the Government prohibited them from speaking out publicly
 
 
 1761
 about their detention. In exchange, the Government gave the former prisoners as-
 surances that it would help them find jobs and reintegrate them into society, how-
 ever, none of them has yet obtained government assistance in this regard, and some
 complain of being denied voter cards and passports.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government claims that the use of torture has been discontinued, but some
 human rights groups report that security forces still torture and abuse detainees.
 There were no conmed reports of torture during the year, although one human
 rights nongovernmental organization (NGO) called for an investigation into the ar-
 rest and subsequent hospitalization of Mustafa Benali, who allegedly was beaten by
 police in Al Hoceima in July. Another human rights NGO reported isolated cases
 of mistreatment in Kenitra and Khenifra.
 At a Rabat rally of unemployed university graduates on October 26, police
 charged into a crowd of demonstrators without warning and beat participants and
 journalists indiscriminately. According to reliable reports, some demonstrators were
 put on public transportation back to their place of origin where police met them and
 again beat them (see Sections 1.d., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.). On October 28, police entered
 UfnionMarocaine du Travail (UMT) headquarters, where those who had organized
 the October 26 demonstrations had taken refuge, and beat 28 demonstrators holding
 a sit-in strike, seriously injuring 6, including a pregant woman. On November 10
 in Mohamedia, security officers and guards reportedly beat with batons, kicked, and
 randomly struck Casablanca University students belonging to the Islamist Justice
 and Charity Group (JCO) who were setting up election tables and ballot boxes in
 preparation for student council elections. No prior attempt was made to disperse the
 students peacefully. The Government's spokesperson offered regrets for police ex-
 cesses in these incidents, both in press interviews and in response to questions by
 Members of Parliament. However, according to local press reports, Interior Minister
 Driss Basri stated in Parliament that police actions were "a responsible and mature
 action aimed at ensuring public or  an that such gatherings "distort the image
 of Morocco." In November the Ministers of Employment and Interior met with rep-
 resentatives of the unemployed graduates who had organized the October 26 dem-
 onstrations and agreed to an expanded program to offer greater job opportunities.
 In December the Interior Minister agreed to recognize officially the jobless dem-
 onstrators association, whose request for recognition had been pending for 7 years.
 The Minister also agreed to grant members of the group 5,000 taxi licenses. Sepa-
 rately, members of the association were invited in December by the King to a na-
 tional conference on unemployment.
 In December police disrupted a march by the unemployed and beat protesters;
 some marchers were hospitalized (see Section 2.b.).
 In March the Ministry of Justice and the prison administration implemented a
 law that makes autopsies routine for any death that occurs in detention, in order
 to allow allegations of torture to be disproved. The autopsies take place at the re-
 quest of the family, human rights NGO's, or the state prosecutor, and at the order
 of a judge. When three prisoners died of heart attacks at the prison in Kenitra in
 March, the prison administration immediately made the autopsies public when the
 local press alleged that the three had died under suspicious circumstances. Rep-
 resentatives of the OMDH inspected the autopsies and conducted a full investigation
 at the prison, and subsequently issued a communique that accepted the authorities'
 explanation of the deaths.
 Although prison conditions remain harsh, they have improved in recent years, due
 in part to reforms undertaken at the suggestion of the CCDH and the Minister of
 Justice. Nonetheless, credible reports indicate that harsh treatment and conditions
 continue, often as a result of chronic overcrowding. In 1997 Oukacha Central Prison
 in Casablanca, designed for 5,000 inmates, held 8,831. Human rights groups allege
 that poor medical care in prisons results in unnecessary deaths. The Government
 has added doctors and health facilities to prisons during the year as a result, and
 has provided special funds in the 1998-99 budget for the renovation of prison facili-
 ties. Although the Government generally did not permit prison visits by human
 rights monitors in the ast, since the tenure of the Youssoufi Government began
 there has been close colaboration between the Justice Ministry and human rights
 groups on prison visits. OMDH members visited prisons several times throughout
 the year, and reported that they were well-received and permitted free and full ac-
 cess to gauge progress on government efforts to reduce overcrowding, improve medi-
 cal care, and provide additional morale-building facilities to inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Le gal provisions for due process have
 been revised extensively in recent years, although reports indicate that authorities
 sometimes ignore them. Although police usually make arrests in public and during
 the day, they do not always identiar themselves and do not always obtain warrants.
 
 
 1762
 
 Incommunicado ("garde-a-vue") detention is limited to 48 hours, with one 24-hour
 extension allowed at the prosecutors discretion. In state security cases, the "garde-
 a-vue" period is 96 hours; this also may be extended by-the prosecutor. It is during
 this initial period, when defendants are denied access to counsel, that the accused
 is interrogated and abuse or torture is most likely to occur. Some members of the
 security forces, long accustomed to indefinite precharge access to detainees, continue
 to resist the new rules.
 Under 1991 changes to the law, the police are obliged to notify a person's next
 of kin of an arrest as soon as possible. However, lawyers are not always promptly
 informed of the date of arrest, and thus are not always able to monitor compliance
 with the "garde-a-vue" detention limits. While the law provides for a limited system
 of bail, it is rarely granted. Defendants are, however, sometimes -released on- their
 own recognizance. The law does not provide for habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 Under a separate code of military justice, military authorities may detain members
 of the military without warrants or public trial.
 Although accused persons generally are brought to trial within an initial period
 of 2 months, prosecutors may request up to five additional 2-month extensions of
 pretrial detention. Thus, an accusedoperson may be kept in detention for up to 1
 year.
 At a Rabat rally of unemployed university graduates in October, police originally
 detained between 60 and 70 demonstrators. All detainees were released within 3
 days (see Sections 1.c., 2.a., 2.b., and 2.d.). Islamist dissident Sheikh Abdessalam
 Yassine has remained under house arrest in Sale since 1989 for refusing to acknowl-
 edge the religious authority of King Hassan (see Sections 2.a., 2.c., and 2.d.).
 Except for the case of Abraham Serfaty, there are no known instances of enforced
 exile. The Youssoufi government has stated that it wishes to end the exile of
 Serfaty, a member of the (now defunct) Communist Party and a supporter of Saha-
 ran independence. Serfaty was released in 1991 after 17 years in prison. Upon his
 release, the Government declared that Serfaty was a Brazilian rather than a Moroc-
 can citizen, because his father was a naturalized Moroccan citizen originally from
 Brazil. Based on this declaration, Serfaty was expelled from Morocco, an action that
 has been widely criticized by human rights groups. In July Serfaty appealed his sta-
 tus to the Supreme Court, which declared that it was not competent to pass judg-
 ment on the validity of his expulsion order. In December the Prime Minister stated
 that, in his opinion, Serfaty was a Moroccan citizen, and urged all Moroccans to
 work to end restrictions on his travel to Morocco. Local human rights organizations
 publicly have questioned whether due process was applied adequately in the Su-
 preme Court's consideration of the case. In November two leftist militants of the Or-
 ganization for Popular Democratic Action (OADP) party ended their self-imposed ex-
 iles, returning to Morocco from Algeria after 34 years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but all courts are subject to extrajudicial pressures, including bribery and gov-
 ernment influence. However, the Government has taken steps to increase judicial
 independence. The Justice Minister in April stated that judicial reform was his top
 priority. He compiled information on judicial corruption, and submitted the names
 of 61 judges to internal disciplinary panels for punishment. In turn those panels for-
 warded 13 cases to the criminal prosecutors. Of the 61, 9 judges were disbarred, 13
 were suspended without salary for periods ranging from 1 to 6 months, 2 were sus-
 pended with salary, 1 was denied promotion, 5 were issued warnings, 26 were
 cleared of wrongdoing, 4 cases are under investigation, and 1 is waiting a decision
 on punishment. With the encouragement of the King and the broad support of the
 business community, the Minister also oversaw the creation of a system of commer-
 cial courts for business litigation to boost investor confidence.
 There are four levels in the common law court system: Communal and district
 courts, courts of first instance, the Appeals Court, and the Supreme Court. While
 in theory there is a single court system under the Ministry of Justice, other courts
 also operate, including: The Special Court of Justice, which handles cases of civil
 servants implicated in corruption; administrative courts, which deal with the deci-
 sions of the bureaucracy; commercial courts,- which deal with business disputes; and
 the Military Tribunal, for cases involving military personnel and, on certain occa-
 sions, matters pertaining to state security (although state security cases also may
 fall within the jurisdiction of the regular court system).
 Although there is a single court system for most nonmilitary matters, family
 issues such as marriage, divorce, child support and custody, and inheritance are ad-
 judicated by judges trained in Islamic law, or Shari'a. Judges considering criminal
 cases or cases in nonfamily areas of civil law are generally trained in the French
 legal tradition. All judges trained in recent years are graduates of the National In-
 stitute for Judicial Studies, where they undergo 3 years of study heavily focused on
 
 
 1763
 human rights and the rule of law. It is not necessary to be a lawyer to become a
 judge, and the majority of judges are not lawyers.
 In general detainees are arraigned before a court of first instance. If the infraction
 is minor and not contested, the judge may order the defendant released or impose
 a light sentence. If an investigation is required, the judge may release defendants
 on their own recognizance. Cases often are adjudicated on the basis of confessions,
 some of which are obtained under duress, according to reliable sources.
 The Justice Minister stated that he would attempt to end petty corruption in the
 judiciary by increasing judges' salaries and ensuring punishment for bribe-takers,
 as well as attempt to end all informal and irregular influences on judicial decision-
 making in the court system. Nonetheless, the court system remains subject to
 extrajudicial pressures. Despite recent increases, salaries for both judges and their
 staffs remain modest; as a result, petty bribery has become a routine cost of court
 business. In some courts, especially in minor criminal cases, defendants or their
 families pay bribes to court officers and judges to secure a favorable disposition.
 In August 1997, the King, after a vacancy of 2 years, appointed a new Minister
 of Justice, who began to reduce the judiciary's relationship with the Ministry of In-
 terior. Nevertheless, judges continue to work closely with the Interior Ministry's
 local network of officials, or "caids," who serve as members of the judicial police and
 often assume personal responsibility for the questioning of criminal defendants.
 Caids frequently prepare the written summary of an arrest and subsequent interro-
 gation. The summary is admissible in court, and sometimes serves as a virtual in-
 struction from the caid to the judge. Credible sources have reported that judges who
 hope for higher salaries and career advancement follow the caids' guidance closely.
 However, after the new Justice Minister's appointment, the Ministry of Justice
 began to reassert its authority and control over judges.
 The law does not distinguish political and security cases from common criminal
 cases. In serious state security cases, communications between the Ministry of Inte-
 rior and the court are more direct. At the Government's discretion, such cases may
 be brought before a specially constituted Military Tribunal, which is subservient to
 other branches of the Government, especially the military and the Ministry of Inte-
 rior.
 Aside from external pressures, the court system is also subject to resource con-
 straints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses often
 receive only a cursory hearing, with judges relying on police reports to render deci-
 sions. Although the Government provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes (i.e., when the offense carries a maximum sentence of over 5 years), ap-
 pointed attorneys often provide inadequate representation.
 In December the OMDH issued a report that assessed the status of the judiciary.
 According to the OMDH, the Youssoufi administration took a series of steps to im-
 prove the court system, including rooting out high-level corruption, naming a new
 Director for Judicial Administration at the Justice Ministry, reactivating a Justice
 Ministry disciplinary body, publishing that body's deliberations and decisions, and
 organizing free and fair elections to that body. Nevertheless, the OMDH called for
 sweeping reforms, including changing laws to reduce the Justice Minister's right to
 suspend judges, revamping the criminal code which the OMDH stated offers insuffi-
 cient protection for a fair trial, strengthening the law on civil liberties, and compel-
 ling judges to place their assets in a blind trust. The OMDH also called on the State
 to punish those officials guilty of human rights abuses. Finally, the OMDH noted
 the lack of resources necessary for documentation tracking and for court facilities.
 All members of the Party of Democratic Socialist Avante-Garde (PADS) who were
 arrested during the 1997 elections for calling for their boycott, were released after
 serving short prison terms.
 The Government continued to hold a number of political prisoners, but released
 many late in the year. Prior to the October release, the OMDH estimated that there
 were some 60 political prisoners, of whom 50 were Islamists and the remainder
 were leftists. Among the 50 alleged Islamists were 16 members of the "Group of 26."
 The Ministry of Interior claimed that there were 55 Islamists serving sentences for
 offenses that range from arms smuggling to participating in a bomb attack on a
 hotel in Marrakech. However, some of these prisoners remain in prison for having
 called for an Islamic state in 1983. International human rights groups' estimates of
 the number of persons in prison for advocating independence for the Western Sa-
 hara varies from none to 700. The AMDH listed 42 political prisoners who were de-
 tained between 1984 and 1996.
 On October 13, on the recommendation of the CCDH, and with the approval of
 the King, the Government released 28 political prisoners. Newspapers reported that
 at least 20 other prisoners, whose offenses ranged from the murder of leftist labor
 and political leaders to the bombing of the Atlas Asni Hotel in Marrakech in 1994,
 
 
 1764
 
 would remain incarcerated. Of the 28, AMDH acknowledged that 20 were included
 on its list of political prisoners; the rest were Islamists who had committed crimes
 of murder or robbery, albeit with political motives. After the release of the 28, the
 AMDH released a communique in which it noted the continued incarceration of 16
 persons whom it considered to be political prisoners. Amnesty international lists
 eight persons whom it considers to be political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant. The law stipulates that a search warrant
 may be issued by a prosecutor on good cause. Authorities sometimes ignore these
 provisions.
 Government security services monitor certain persons and organizations, both for-
 eign and Moroccan, and Government informers monitor activities on university cam-
 puses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, the Government restricts press freedom in certain areas. However,
 newspapers and weeklies from across the political spectrum, from Socialist to Na-
 tionalist to Islamist, publish freely.
 The Government owns the official press agency, Maghreb Arab press, and the Ar-
 abic daily AI-Anbaa. The Government also supports two semiofficial dailies, the
 French-language Le Matin and the Arabic-language Assahra, in addition to provid-
 ing subsidies to the rest of the press through price supports for newsprint and office
 space. A 1958 decree grants the Government the authority to register and license
 domestic newspapers and journals. Authorities can use the licensing process to pre-
 vent the publication of materials that they believe cross the threshold of tolerable
 dissent. Offending publications may be declared a danger to state security, seized,
 the publisher's license suspended, and equipment destroyed. The Ministry of Inte-
 rior can control foreign publications by collecting "banned" publications after they
 have been distributed. In general, however, the Government does not employ ex-
 treme measures, and there were no reports of the abuse of the Government's licens-
 ing authority during the year. However, the media regularly engage in self-censor-
 ship to avoid the Government's attention and possible sanctions.
 The Press Code empowers the Minister of Interior to confiscate publications that
 are judged offensive by the Government. Under the code, the Prime Minister may
 order the indefinite suspension of a publication. There are 1,780 domestic and for-
 eign newspapers, magazines, and journals in circulation in Morocco. In comparison
 with, 1997, when individual issues of several foreign newspapers were seized due to
 the inclusion of sensitive articles, there were no confirmed cases of seizures of for-
 eign or domestic newspapers or journals during the year. The journal, Al-Ousbou
 al Siassiy, which was banned in 1997 for libel, resumed publication in March as Al-
 Ousbqu. In general, press articles containing unflattering material that had rou-
 tinely been prevented from circulation in the past were allowed free circulation dur-
 ing the year.
 The Press Code empowers the Government to censor newspapers directly by or-
 dering them not to report on specific items or events. In most instances, government
 control of the media generally is exercised through directives and "guidance" from
 the Ministry of Interior. Nonetheless, the Government generally tolerates satirical
 and often stinging editorials in the opposition parties' dailies. However, both law
 and tradition prohibit criticism on three topics: The monarchy, Morocco's claim to
 the Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam.
 The Government controls Radio-Television Marocaine (RTM) broadcasts. Another
 major broadcaster is the French-backed MEDI-1, which operates from Tangier and
 reaches throughout Morocco and North Africa. While nominally private and inde-
 pendent, MEDI-1 practices self-censorship, as do other Moroccan media outlets. The
 Government owns the only television stations whose broadcasts can be received in
 most parts of the nation without decoders or satellite dish antennas. In 1996 the
 Government purchased a majority share in 2M, formerly the country's sole private
 station, which can be received in most urban areas. The ostensible reason for the
 Government's action was to save 2M from bankruptcy; the Government now owns
 68 percent of 2M stock, and the Minister of Communication, by virtue of his posi-
 tion, has become the chairman of the board. A government-appointed committee
 monitors broadcasts. Privatization of these stations was a major topic of political de-
 bate during the year, and the Government announced that it was preparing a plan
 for 2M's re-sale to the private sector. After an 18-month suspension for failing to
 control the statements of a guest on her show, the Communications Minister rein-
 stated popular 2M political talk show host Malika Malik to her program in Septem-
 
 
 1765
 
 ber. Dish antennas are available at low cost on the market and permit free access
 to a wide variety of foreign broadcasts. Residents of the north can receive Spanish
 broadcasts with standard antennas. The Government does not impede the reception
 of foreign broadcasts or Internet access.
 At a Rabat demonstration of unemployed university graduates in October, police
 beat and knocked to the ground both local and international journalists who were
 covering the demonstration. Authorities also confiscated film and audio tape from
 reporters (see Sections 1.c., 1.d., 2.b., and 2.d.). Islamist dissident Sheikh
 Abdessalam Yassine has remained under house arrest in Sale since 1989 for refus-
 ing to acknowledge the religious authority of King Hassan (see Sections 1.d., 2.c.,
 and 2.d.). However, Yassine's books and articles are sold without restriction, and
 editorials calling for his release are published without impediment.
 The universities enjoy relative academic freedom in most areas, but are barred
 from open debate on the monarchy, the Western Sahara, and Islam. Government
 informers monitor campus activities (see Section 1.f.) and rectors are approved by
 the Ministry of Interior.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, however, the law also permits the government to suppress
 even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings, and at times police prevented
 and disrupted gatherings during the year. Most conferences and demonstrations re-
 quire the prior authorization of the Ministry of Interior, ostensibly for security rea-
 sons.
 Throughout the year, the vast majority of meetings and marches occurred without
 government interference. However, while workers in Jerada were allowed to strike
 in December 1997, a January protest by a group opposed to the government's plan
 to close a money-losing coal mine degenerated into a riot when police disrupted it.
 The police arrested 60 protesters and some were sentenced to up to 2 years impris-
 onment for destruction of property. The King later granted a royal pardon and re-
 leased the protesters in May. In response to the protest, the Government also an-
 nounced a package of measures to soften the economic blow of the mine's closure.
 In July police blocked a Berber association, Tamaynut, from organizing a march in
 Rabat to condemn the murder of an Algerian Berber singer, due to fear of violent
 protests. Authorities blocked public gatherings of the blind in Rabat in June and
 in Tetouan in May. Authorities prohibited Islamist students at a university in Casa-
 blanca from taking part in a science colloquium in April. Later that month in Rabat,
 police disrupted a meeting of a group of supporters of exiled dissident Abraham
 erfaty.
 On October 26, roughly 150 baton-wielding police disrupted a group of approxi-
 mately 300 unemployed university graduates attempting to conduct a peaceful dem-
 onstration in front of the Parliament building in Rabat to protest alleged govern-
 ment shortcomings in addressing the country's continued high youth unemployment
 (see Sections 1.c., 1.d., 2.a., and 2.d.). Local authorities had refused to issue a permit
 for the demonstration. According to credible eyewitness accounts, the police charged
 into the crowd without warning and beat demonstrators indiscriminately. Many
 demonstrators were treated at local clinics. Press reports indicated that at least 100
 persons were injured. Two seriously injured demonstrators were hospitalized. Police
 also beat and knocked to the ground both local and international journalists who
 were covering the demonstrations. The authorities confiscated film and audio tape
 from British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Agence France Presse (AFP) re-
 porters. Police originally detained between 60 and 70 demonstrators. All detainees
 were released within 3 days. The Government's spokesman, Minister of Social Af-
 fairs Khalid Alioua, expressed regret for the police actions at the Government's
 weekly press briefing on October 27, and in Parliament on October 28, but did not
 indicate whether the police responsible would be investigated and punished. Local
 political parties and human rights organizations widely criticized the excesses of
 Ministry of Interior forces in breaking up the demonstrations. In December the Min-
 isters of Interior and Education met with the unemployed graduates and reached
 an agreement in which the graduates would cease their protests in return for a gov-
 ernment promise to expand job programs.
 On October 28, police entered Union Marocaine du Travail (UMT) headquarters,
 where those who had organized the October 26 demonstration had taken refuge, and
 beat 28 demonstrators holding a sit-in strike, seriously injuring 6, including a preg-
 nant woman (see Section 1.c.). On November 10 in Mohamedia, state security offi-
 cers and university guards reportedly beat with batons, kicked, and randomly struck
 Casablanca University students belonging to the Justice and Charity Group (JCO)
 who were setting up election tables and ballot boxes in preparation for student
 council elections (see Section 1.c.).

 In December the Interior Minister agreed to recognize officially the jobless dem-
 onstrators' association, whose request for recognition had been pending for 7 years.
 The Minister also agreed to grant members of the group 5,000 taxi licenses. Sepa-
 rately, members of the association were invited in December by the King to a na-
 tional conference on unemployment.
 In December in Sefrou, police beat protesters and disrupted a march by the unem-
 ployed. According to press reports, some marchers were hospitalized and others
 were detained for questioning.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, however the Government
 limits this right in practice. Under a 1958 decree, persons wishing to create an orga-
 nization must obtain the approval of the Ministry of Interior before holding meet-
 ings. In practice, the Ministry uses this requirement to prevent persons suspected
 of advocating causes opposed by the Government from forming legal organizations.
 Islamist and leftist groups have the greatest difficulty iutobtaining official approval.
 Although there are over 20 active Islamist groups, the Government has prohibited
 membership in two, JCO and Jama'a Islamia, due to their perceived anti-monarchy
 rhetoric. Political parties also must be approved by the Ministry of Interior, which
 uses this power to control participation in the political process. However, individual
 Islamists are not barred from participating in recognized political parties. The last
 known instance in which a proposed political party failed to receive such approval
 was in 1996, when an Islamist group's application was not approved. The group in-
 stead was permitted to present candidates for the 1997 elections under the banner
 of an existing party. One Islamist party, the Party for Justice and Democracy
 (PJD-formerly the Popular Democratic Constitutional Movement), has nine seats
 in Parliament. There was some progress during the year on increasing freedom of
 association. In January an anti-corruption NGO, Transparency Maroc, obtained ap-
 proval-from the Interior Ministry after a 2-year delay.
 In December the Interior Minister agreed to recognize officially the jobless dem-
 onstrators' association, whose request for recognition had been pending for 7 years.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, only Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are tolerated in practice; however, in
 1996 a small foreign Hindu community received the right to perform cremations and
 to hold services.
 Islam is the official religion. Ninety-nine percent of citizens are Sunni Muslims,
 and the King bears the title "Commander of the Faithful." The Jewish community
 of approximately 5,000 is allowed to practice its faith, as is the somewhat larger for-
 eign Christian community. Citizens who convert to Christianity and other religions
 often face social ostracism, and in the past a small number have faced short periods
 of questioning by the authorities. The Baha'i community of 350 to 400 people has
 been forbidden to meet or participate in communal activities since 1983.
 , Islamic law and tradition call for strict punishment of any Muslim who converts
 to another faith, although voluntary conversion is not a crime under the criminal
 or civil codes. Any attempt to induce a Muslim to convert is illegal. Foreign mission-
 aries either limit their proselytizing to non-Muslims or conduct their work quietly.
 There were-a small number of cases during the year of foreigners being denied entry
 into Morocco atothe port of Tangier because they were carrying substantial quan-
 tities of Christian materials. In two separate incidents, four Americans and two Ca-
 nadians were arrested in Meknes and Fez in February and May on suspicion of
 proselytizing. One American was expelled from Morocco, while cases against the
 others were- dropped. At the time of those arrests, a small number of Moroccan
 Christians in Meknes were summoned for questioning but released shortly there-
 after. A company in Casablanca was denied permission by the Ministry of Commu-
 nications to display bibles at a book fair in Casablanca in November.
 The Ministry of Islamic Affairs monitors Friday mosque sermons and the Koranic
 schools ensure the teaching of approved doctrine. The authorities sometimes sup-
 press the- activities of Islamists, but generally tolerate activities limited to the prop-
 agation of Islam, education, and charity. Security forces commonly close mosques to
 the public shortly after Friday services to prevent use of the premises for unauthor-
 ized political activity. The Government strictly controls authorization to construct
 new mosques.
 Islamist dissident Sheikh Abdessalam Yassine has remained under house arrest
 in Sale since 1989 for refusing to acknowledge the religious authority of King Has-
 san (see Sections 1.d., 2.a., and 2.d.). In October the Youssoufi Government stated
 that it intended to end the Sheikh's detention, and an appeal of Yassine's detention
 was expected to be heard before the Supreme Court.
 The Government permits the display and sale of bibles in French, English, and
 Spanish, but confiscates Arabic language bibles and refuses licenses for their impor-
 tation and sale. However, bibles reportedly have been seen on sale in local book-
 
 
 1767
 stores. In May in Tangier, a British citizen was indicted on a customs violation for
 allegedly failing to declare the importation of a commercial quantity of bibles. The
 case was resolved by the payment of a $10,000 fine.
 During the year, Interior Ministry officials summoned members of the small
 Baha'i community for questioning concerning their faith and meetings; however,
 fewer Baha'is were summoned than in past years. There were no reports that Ba-
 ha'is were denied passports because of their religion, as was the case in previous
 years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, however, the Gov-
 ernment restricts this right in certain areas. The gendarmerie maintains check-
 points throughout the country at which drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations
 are verified for validity. Although checkpoints have been maintained in the same
 places for years, the degree of inspections of motorists has relaxed, while the em-
 phasis on inspecting trucks and buses continues. In addition, while there are con-
 tinning allegations that gendarmes demand small payments to clear vehicles, press
 reports indicate that gendarmes found guilty of such behavior are being punished.
 In October the Gendarmerie Royale announced a campaign to combat such abuses
 within its ranks. In the Moroccan-administered portion of the Western Sahara,
 movement is restricted in areas regarded as militarily sensitive. In October police
 restricted the travel of and detained citizens attempting to attend a demonstration
 of unemployed university graduates in Rabat (see Sections 1.c., 1.d., 2.a., and 2.b.).
 The Ministry of Interior restricts freedom to travel outside Morocco in certain cir-
 cumstances. The OMDH and AMDH have compiled lists of individuals who have re-
 portedly been denied passports or who have passports but are denied permission to
 travel. The OMDH lists 20 persons, including Mostapha Farissi, a former political
 detainee. The AMDH's list includes 70 persons, many of whom are Islamists. In ad-
 dition, all civil servants and military personnel must obtain written permission from
 their ministries to leave the country. The spiritual leader of the Islamist JCO,
 Sheikh Abdessalam Yassine, has remained under house arrest in sale since 1989 for
 refusing to acknowledge the religious authority of the King (also see Sections 1.d.,
 2.a., and 2.c.). In October the Youssoufl Government stated that it intended to end
 the Sheikh's detention, and an appeal of Yassine's detention was expected to be
 heard before the Supreme Court.
 Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship, but the King retains the power-
 rarely used-to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold more than one citi-
 zenship and travel on passports from two or more countries. While in Morocco, they
 are regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government sometimes has re-
 fused to recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals
 or to he informed of their arrest and iprisonment. Dual nationals sometimes com-
 plain of harassment by immigration inspectors.
 The Government welcomes voluntary repatriation of Jews who have emigrated.
 Moroccan Jewish emigres, including those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Mo-
 rocco. The government also encourages the return of Sahrawis who have departed
 Morocco due to the conflict in the Western Sahara, provided that they recognize the
 Government's claim to the region. The Government does not permit Saharan nation-
 alists who have been released from prison to live in the disputed territory.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status.
 While Morocco has from time to time provided political asylum to individuals, the
 issue of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Constitutional provisions establishing periodic free elections notwithstanding, citi-
 zens do not have the full right to change their government. The King, as head of
 state, appoints the Prime Minister, who is the titular head of Government. The Par-
 liament has the theoretical ability to effect change in the system of government.
 Moreover, the Constitution may not be changed without the King's approval. The
 Ministry of Interior appoints the provincial governors and local caids (district ad-
 ministrative officials). Municipal and regional councils are elected.
 Constitutional changes in 1992, retained in the Constitution of 1996, authorized
 the Prime Minister to nominate all government ministers, but the King has the
 power to replace any minister at will. While Secretaries General enjoyed significant
 authority over day-to-day operations of ministries in past administrations, the King
 charged Prime Minister Youssoufi with implementing sweeping administrative, eco-
 nomic, and social reform, and gave him the discretion to accomplish this task. As
 
 
 1768
 a result of the King's decision, the current government has named new staff
 throughout the Government to accomplish its objectives. -
 The Government of Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi is the first govern-
 ment formed from the opposition since the late 1950's, and his appointment by the
 King marked a significant step toward increased democratization. With the King's
 support, Youssoufi, who was sentenced to death in absentia in the 1970s but subse-
 quently received a royal pardon in 1980, has declared his intention to modernize
 Morocco's administrative and judicial structures, and to liberalize the economic and
 political system. The new Government consists of only 4 ministers (Interior, Foreign
 Affairs, Justice, Islamic Affairs) out of 41, cabinet-level posts, plus the Secretary
 General of the Government and the Minister-Delegate for Defense Administration,
 who were retained from the previous government. In order to develop reforms, the
 King granted cabinet ministers a greater degree of responsibility for the manage-
 ment of their individual portfolios.
 Morocco created a bicameral legislature in 1997. Fourteen parties have members
 in Parliament, and seven are represented in the governing coalition. While opposi-
 tion parties urged in 1996 and 1997 that all Members of Parliament be directly
 elected by the citizens, the Kin  roposed in 1996 the creation of a bicameral legis-
 lature, whereby all members of the ower chamber would be directly elected by the
 people and all members of the second chamber indirectly selected by-popularly-elect-
 ed regional, municipal, and professional councils.  -      I
 In June 1997, Morocco held municipal council elections, followed by balloting for
 regional professional councils. In the wake of the June election, political parties ac-
 cused-each other of manipulation and vote-buying, and claimed government inter-
 vention on behalf of candidates. The Election Commission examined numerous peti-
 tions during the course of the electoral season in 1997 and recommended the rever-
 sal of over 60 municipal election results, including in Tangier, Khoribga, and Oujda,
 and also noted irregularities in 4 parliamentary races in Casablanca, Chefchaouen,
 and Fes, and called for the results to be set aside. The OMDH condemned the
 prominent role of the Interior Ministry in the June 1997 elections, as well as the
 numerous allegations of vote buying both by the Government and political parties,
 electoral list manipulation by the Government, and electoral card falsification.
 In August 1997 King Hassan convoked a special session of Parliament to ratify
 two laws creating a bicameral assembly, and the same month Parliament unani-
 mously approved these laws, which created a 325-seat lower house to be filled by
 direct elections, and a 270-seat upper house whose member would be elected by var-
 ious professional and regional councils. There were widespread, credible allegations
 of vote buying and government manipulation in the November legislative elections.
 The fraud and government pressure tactics led most independent observers to con-
 clude that the election results were heavily influenced, if not predetermined, by the
 Government. All opposition parties criticized the Government, and some called for
 a boycott of Parliament. Two winners renounced their seats; alleging unsolicited
 government interference on their behalf. The Election Commission concurred that
 irregularities had occurred in two Casablanca cases and recommended that new
 elections be held in those districts; new elections have not yet been scheduled. It
 also examined other complaints and recommended new elections in Chefchaouen
 and Fes, which took place during the year-
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are 2 female sec-
 retaries of state in the 41-member Cabinet. There are 2 women among the 325
 members of Parliament's Chamber of Deputies and 2 women in the Chamber of
 Counselors.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially-recognized nongovernmental human rights groups: The
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization, the Moroccan League for the Defense of
 Human Rights (LMDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association. A fourth
 group, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights (CDDH), was formed in
 1992 by former AMDH members. The Government maintains close and collaborative
 relations with these groups. During the year, the OMDH cosponsored seminars on
 human rights with the ministers of Justice and Education. The AMDH also recently
 opened a human rights documentation center in Rabat.
 Amnesty international has local chapters in Rabat, Casablanca, and Marrakech.
 These chapters participate in AI international letter campaigns outside Morocco.
 The Government encouraged AI to hold its International Congress in Marrakech in
 August 1999, an& hosted a visit by AI Secretary General Pierre Sane in June, dur-
 ing which Sane met-with senior.government officials and announced that AI would
 open a regional office in Morocco and hold the Congress in August 1999.
 
 
 1769
 In June U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson announced
 the establishment of a Regional Human Rights Documentation and Research Center
 in Morocco, with European Union financial support.
 In August Prime Minister Youssoufi announced that he would chair a human
 rights commission that would review cases of past and present human rights issues
 in order to solidify respect for human rights in Morocco. The commission, which is
 composed of members of the Government, serves as a brain trust on human rights
 issues and policies.
 The Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), an advisory body to
 the King, counsels the palace on human rights issues, and was the organization
 charged by the King to resolve cases related to persons who had disappeared. In
 March the King reestablished the Human Rights Ministry, which he hadeliminated
 in 1997, and named a former widely respected Human Rights Minister, Omar
 Azzinan, as Minister of Justice.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution states that all citizens are equal, non-Muslims and
 women face discrimination in the law and traditional practice.
 Women.-Spousal violence is common. Although a battered wife has the right to
 complain to the police, as a practical matter she would do so only if prepared to
 bring criminal charges. While physical abuse is a legal ground for divorce, a court
 only grants it if the woman can provide two witnesses to the abuse. Even medical
 certificates are not sufficient. If the court finds against the woman, she is returned
 to her husband's home. Consequently, few women report abuse to the authorities.
 The Criminal Code includes severe punishment for men convicted of rape or sexu-
 ally assaulting a woman or a girl. The defendants in such cases bear the burden
 of proving their innocence. However, sexual assaults often go unreported because of
 the stigma attached to the loss of virginity. While not provided for in law, victim's
 families may offer rapists the opportunity to marry their victims in order to pre-
 serve the honor of the family. The law is more lenient toward men with respect to
 crimes committed agalnst their wives; for example, a light sentence may be accorded
 a man who has murdered his wife after catching her in the act of adultery.
 Women suffer various forms of legal and cultural discrimination. The civil law
 status of women is governed by the Moudouwana, or Code of Personal Status, which
 is based on the Malikite school of Islamic law. Although the Moudouwana was re-
 formed in 1993, women's groups still complain of unequal treatment, particularly
 under the laws governing marriage and divorce.
 In order to marry, a woman is generally required to obtain the permission of her
 "tuteur," or legal guardian, usually her father. Only in unusual circumstances may
 she act as her own "tuteur."
 It is far easier for a man to divorce his wife than for a woman to divorce her hus-
 band. Under Islamic law and tradition, rather than asking for a divorce, a man may
 simply repudiate his wife outside of court. Under the 1993 reforms to the
 Moudouwana, a woman's presence in court is required in order for her husband to
 divorce her, although womens' groups report that this law frequently is ignored.
 However, human rights activists reported that, in a recent NGO-sponsored test, offi-
 cials refused to order a divorce without the wife being present, despite offers of
 bribes. Nevertheless, womens' groups complain that men are resorting to ruses to
 dodge the new legal restrictions. The divorce may be finalized even over the wom-
 an's objections, although in such cases the court grants her unspecified allowance
 rights.
 A woman seeking a divorce has few practical alternatives. She may offer her hus-
 band money to agree to a divorce (known as a khola divorce). The husband must
 agree to the divorce and is allowed to specify the amount to be paid, without limit.
 According to women's groups, many men pressure their wives to pursue this kind
 of divorce. A woman also may file for a judicial divorce if her husband takes a sec-
 ond wife, if he abandons her, or if he physically abuses her. However, divorce proce-
 dures in these cases are lengthy and complicated. In November the Minister of Is-
 lamic Affairs proposed the institutionalization of additions to the basic marriage
 contract that would outline the rights and duties agreed upon between husband and
 wife, and permit legal recourse for the enforcement of the contract.
 Under the Criminal Code, women generally are accorded the same treatment as
 men, but this is not the case for family and estate law, which is based on the
 Moudouwana. Under this law, women inherit only half as much as male heirs.
 Moreover, even where the law provides for equal status, cultural norms often pre-
 vent a woman from exercising those rights. When a woman inherits property, for
 example, male relatives may pressure her to relinquish her interest.
 
 
 1770
 
 While many well-educated women pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and
 government service, few make it to the top echelons of their professions. Women
 constitute approximately 35 percent of the work force, with the majority in the in-
 dustrial,- service, and teaching sectors. The Government reports that the illiteracy
 rate for women is 67 percent (and 89 percent in rural areas), compared with 41 per-
 cent for men. Women in rural areas suffer most from inequality. Rural women per-
 form most difficult physical labor, and the literacy rate in the countryside is signifi-
 cantly lower for women than for men. Girls are much less likely to be sent to school
 than are boys, especially in rural areas where the quality of schooling is inferior to
 urban areas, and demands on girls' time for household chores often prevents school
 attendance. Women who do earn secondary school diplomas, however, have equal ac-
 cess to university education.
 According to a July 1997 government survey, 76 NGO's work to advance women's
 rights and to promote women's issues. Among these are the Democratic Association
 of Moroccan Women, the Union for Women's Action, and the Moroccan Association
 for Women's Rights, which advocate enhanced political and civil rights, as well as
 numerous NGO s that provide shelters for battered women, teach women basic hy-
 giene, family planning, and child care, and educate illiterate women.
 Children.-The law provides for compulsory education for children between the
 ages of 7 and 13; however, not all children between these ages attend school due
 to family decisions and shortfalls in government resources, and the Government
 does not enforce the law. The Government conducts an annual campaign to vac-
 cinate children against childhood diseases.
 The Government took some steps to address the problem of child labor (see Sec-
 tion 6.d.). On September 8, the Government adopted International Labor Organiza-
 tion (ILO) Convention 138, which prohibits child labor. However, young girls in par-
 ticular are exploited as domestic servants. An incident in El Hajeb in April, in
 which a teenage prostitute fled naked from a brothel in which she had been forced
 to work for 5 years, highlighted the prevalence of child prostitution in impoverished
 areas. The practice of adoptive servitude, in which families adopt young girls who
 perform the duties of domestic servants in their new homes, is prevalent. Credible
 reports of physical abuse in such circumstances are widespread. Some orphanages
 are knowing accomplices to the practice of adoptive servitude; the practice is often
 rationalized as a better alternative to keeping the girls in orphanages. Adoptive ser-
 vitude is socially accepted, attracts little criticism, and is unregulated by the Gov-
 ernment.
 Another problem facing orphans of both sexes is lack of civil status. Normally,
 men are registered at local government offices; their wives and unmarried children
 are included in this registration, which confers civil status. Civil status is necessary
 to obtain a birth certificate, passport, or marriage license. If a father does not reg-
 ister his child, the child is without civil status and the benefits of citizenship. It is
 possible for an individual to self-register, but the process is long and cumbersome.
 While any child, regardless of parentage, may be registered within a month of birth,
 a court order is required if registration does not take place in that time. Abandoned
 children sometimes receive kafala (state-sponsored care).
 Several NGO's, including the Moroccan League for the Protection of Children,
 work to improve legal protection for children and to help at-risk children. There are
 several shelters in the major cities that provide food and lodging for street children,
 while other NGO's work to reduce the exploitation of street children and to cure
 those street children with drug addictions.
 People With Disabilities.-A high incidence of disabling disease, especially polio,
 has resulted in a correspondingly high incidence of disabled persons. While the min-
 istry of Social Affairs endeavors to integrate the disabled into society, in practice
 this is left largely to private charities. However, even nonprofit special education
 programs are priced beyond the reach of most families. Typically, disabled persons
 are supported by their families; some survive by begging. The Government contin-
 ued a pilot training program for the blind sponsored in part by a member of the
 royal family. There are no laws mandating physical changes to buildings to facilitate
 access by the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution affirms, and the Govern-
 ment respects, the legal equality of all citizens. The official language is Arabic. Both
 French and Arabic are used in the news media and educational institutions. Science
 and technical courses are taught in French, thereby eliminating the large,
 monolingual Arabic-speaking population from participation in these programs. Edu-
 cational reforms in the past decade have stressed the use of Arabic in secondary
 schools. Failure to similarly transform the university system has effectively dis-
 qualified many students from higher education in lucrative fields. This especially is
 true among the poor, for whom French training is not always affordable.
 
 
 1771
 Some 60 percent of the population claim Berber heritage. Berber cultural groups
 contend that Berber traditions and Berber language (which consists of three dia-
 lects) are rapidly being lost. Their repeated requests to the King to permit the
 teaching of Berber languages in the schools led to a 1995 royal speech authorizing
 the necessary curriculum changes; however, such changes have not yet been imple-
 mented. Official media broadcast in Berber for limited periods each day.
 In June 1996, a number of Berber associations issued a communique petitioning
 the Government to recognize their language as an official language and to acknowl-
 edge their culture as a part of Moroccan society. These associations claimed that the
 Government refuses to register births for children with traditional Berber names,
 discourages the public display of the Berber alphabet, limits the activities of Berber
 associations, and continues to Arabize the names of towns, villages, and geographic
 landmarks. The Government thus far has made no response to the petition, al-
 though Prime Minister Youssoufi acknowledged Berber culture as an integral part
 of Moroccan identity in a speech before Parliament in April. A full page of a major
 national newspaper is devoted on a monthly basis to articles and poems on Berber
 culture that are printed in Berber, although with Latin script.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Although workers are free to establish and join trade
 unions, the unions themselves are not completely free from Government inter-
 ference. Perhaps half a million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized in 17
 trade union federations. Three federations dominate the labor scene: the Union
 Marocaine du Travail (UMT), the Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT),
 and the Union Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no po-
 litical party affiliation. The CDT is affiliated with the Socialist Union of Popular
 Forces, the Party of Prime Minister Youssoufl, and the UGTM with the Istiqlal
 party. It is widely believed that the Ministry of Interior has informants within the
 unions who monitor union activities and the election of officers. Sometimes union
 officers are subject to government pressure. Union leadership does not always up-
 hold the rights of members to select their own leaders. There has been no case of
 the rank and file voting out its current leadership and replacing it with another.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so. Work stoppages normally are intended
 to advertise grievances and last 24 to 72 hours or less. There were a number of nar-
 rowly focused work stoppages during the year. In early October, the Minister of In-
 terior negotiated the return to work of 290 Royal Air Maroc machinists after a 3
 /2-month strike.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties with inter-
 national trade union secretariats. The UMT is a member of the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is implied in the constitutional provisions on the right to strike
 and the right to join organizations. Trade union federations compete among them-
 selves to organize workers. Any group of 8 workers may organize a union and a
 worker may change union affiliation easily. A work site may contain several inde-
 pendent locals or locals affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In general the government ensures the observance of labor laws in larger compa-
 nies and in the public sector. In the informal economy, and in the textile and handi-
 crafts industries, both the Government and management routinely ignore labor laws
 and regulations. As a practical matter, unions have no judicial recourse to oblige
 the Government to enforce labor laws and regulations.
 The laws governing collective bargaining are inadequate. Collective bargaining
 has been a longstanding tradition in some parts of the economy such as the indus-
 trial sector, especially heavy industry, but the practice has not spread to other sec-
 tors, such as the service and informal sectors. The wages and conditions of employ-
 ment of unionized workers are generally set in discussions between employer and
 worker representatives. However, wages for the vast majority of workers are unilat-
 erally set by employers.
 Employers wishing to dismiss workers are required by law to notify the provincial
 governor through the labor inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to re-
 place dismissed workers, a government labor inspector provides replacements and
 mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker dismissed
 for committing a serious infraction of work rules is entitled by law to a court hear-
 ing.
 There is no law specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination. Employers com-
 monly dismiss workers for union activities regarded as threatening to employer in-
 terests. The courts have the authority to reinstate such workers, but are unable to
 enforce rulings that compel employers to pay damages and back pay. Ministry of
 
 
 1772
 Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor disputes, but they
 are few in number and do not have the resources to investigate all cases. Unions
 have resorted increasingly to litigation to resolve labor disputes.
 Labor law reform is such a controversial issue that a draft revised Labor Code
 has. remained under discussion in parliamentary committee for 4 years.
 Labor law applies equally to the small Tangier export zone. The proportion of
 unionized workers in the export zone is about the same as in the rest of the econ-
 omy, roughly 5 percent.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor was
 prohibited in 1957 when the International Labor Organization's Convention 29 was
 adopted by royal decree. When authorities become aware of instances of forced
 labor, courts enforce the decree. However, in practice the Government lacks the re-
 sources to inspect all places of work to ensure that forced labor is not being used.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not en-
 force this prohibition effectively. The practice of adoptive servitude, in which fami-
 lies adopt young girls who serve as domestic servants, is socially accepted, and the
 Government does not regulate it. Credible reports of physical abuse in such cases
 are widespread (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Abuse of
 the child labor laws is common. The law prohibits the employment or apprenticeship
 of any child under 12 years of age. On September 8, the Government adopted ILO
 Convention 138, which prohibits child labor. Education is compulsory for children
 between the ages of 7 and 13 years, although not all children attend school. Special
 regulations cover the employment of children between the ages of 12 and 16. In
 practice, children are often apprenticed, before age 12, particularly in the handicraft
 industry. The use of minors is common in the rug making industry and also exists
 to some extent in the textile and leather goods industries. Children also are em-
 ployed informally as domestics and usually receive little or no wages. Safety and
 health conditions as well as wages in enterprises employing children are-often sub-
 standard. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children; however, the Gov-
 ernment does not enforce the law effectively (see Section 6.c.). The practice of adop-
 tive servitude is often characterized by physical abuse (see Sections 5 and 6.c.). The
 Ministry of Education, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and with the sup-
 port of UNICEF, is pursuing a strategy of establishing agreements with the heads
 of factories to assure basic education and health services for child workers.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor regulations,
 which are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector of the econ-
 omy. However, the inspectors are not authorized to monitor the conditions of domes-
 tic servants.
 The Government lacks the resources to enforce laws against child labor. ,In fact,
 there is general acceptance of the presumption that, to learn properly traditional
 handicraft skills, it is necessary for children to start working at a young age. In ad-
 dition, many persons argue that having children working to learn a craft is better
 than having them live on the streets.
 In July 1997 the Government announced a new voluntary labeling system for car-
 pet exports to certify that no child labor was involved in production. The system is
 cosponsored by German rug importers. However, the Government does not monitor
 nonparticipating handicraft producers that violate child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The June 1996 general strike led to negotia-
 tions among the Government, the Manufacturers' Association, and the labor confed-
 erations over increasing the minimum wage and improving health benefits, social
 benefits, and housing. In August 1996, all three parties agreed to a 10 percent in-
 crease in the minimum wage retroactive to July 1, raising it to approximately $180
 (1,661 dirhams) per month in the industrialized sector and to approximately $9
 (80.96 dirhams) per day for agricultural workers. Neither figure provides a satisfac-
 tory standard of living for a worker and family, even with government subsidies for
 food, diesel fuel, and public transportation. In many cases, several family members
 combine their income to support the family. Most workers in the industrial sector
 earn more than the minimum wage. They generally are paid -between 13 and 16
 months' salary, including bonuses, each year.
 The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and handicraft sec-
 tors, and evbn the Government pays less than the minimum wage to workers at the
 lowest civil service grades (approximately 8 percent of government workers), al-
 though benefits are more generous, and include transportation, food and housing
 subsidies, free vacations, and other nonmonetary remuneration. To increase employ-
 ment opportunities for recent graduates, the Government allows firms to hire them
 for a limited period through a subsidized program at less than the minimum wage.

 The law provides for a 48-hour maximum workweek with no more than 10 hours
 in any single day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and
 minimum conditions for health and safety, including a prohibition on night work for
 women and minors. As -with other regulations and laws, these are not universally
 observed.
 Occupational health and safety standards are rudimentary, except for a prohibi-
 tion on the employment of women in certain dangerous occupations. Labor inspec-
 tors attempt to monitor working, conditions and accidents, but lack sufficient re-
 sources. While workers,-in principle, have the right to remove themselvesfrom work
 situations that endanger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued em-
 ployment, there were no reports of any instances in which a worker attempted to
 exercise this right.
