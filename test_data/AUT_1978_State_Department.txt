 AUSTRIA
 Austria, a neutral but western-oriented country,
 attaches vital importance to human rights. It is a
 parliamentary constitutional democracy. The Austrian
 Constitution and Austrian State Treaty of 1955 define
 and guarantee basic human rights concerning the
 integrity of the person, and civil andpolitical
 liberties. Austria's record of assistance to refugees
 from other countries, many of whom have settled there,
 and its important role in facilitating the transit of
 Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union, are widely
 recognized.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Austria has a highly developed social welfare system.
 An equitable distribution of income is achieved through
 a progressive income tax system. Government, labor
 and management cooperate well in a "social partnership"
 which has been effective in avoiding serious labor-
 management disputes. Austria's socialist government
 places heavy emphasis on maintaining and improving
 health, education and social services.
 The Austrian State Treaty (Article 7) states that the
 Slovene and Croatian minorities shall enjoy the same
 rights on equal terms as all other Austrian nationals
 and grants to them the right to educational instruction
 in their own languages at the elementary school level
 and in a proportionate number of secondary schools.
 Interpretation and implementation of these rights have
 been subject to controversy,but Austria is providing
 schools for minorities as specified by the Treaty.
 Another recent government step has been the posting of
 road signs in minority areas in minority languages.
 During the past year, there have been no notable
 confrontations between the Austrian authorities and
 the minorities.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in full effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is complete freedom of movement within and from
 the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in Political Process
 
 This freedom is in effect.

 investigation.
