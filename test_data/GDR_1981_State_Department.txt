 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC (GDR)
 The GDR faces a situation unique in Eastern Europe.
 It shares with the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)
 the most sensitive strategic position in Europe.
 There are nearly 400,000 Soviet troops on GDR
 territory. Aside from its Warsaw Pact role, the
 Soviet presence serves to bolster the regime and to
 convince most East Germans that the only realistic
 course is to come to terms with the existing
 political situation. At the same time, there are
 profound historical, cultural, and family ties
 between the people of the GDR and the FRG. The
 35-year old division of Germany has strained but not
 eradicated these ties. They are kept alive by
 millions of FRG visitors, as well as by television
 and radio broadcasts which daily expose the GDR's
 Western-oriented population to Western ideas and
 attractions.
 As the Berlin Wall testifies, the GDR tightly
 controls emigration and travel. Despite its signing
 of the 1975 CSCE Final Act in Helsinki, the GDR
 severely limits the ability of its citizens of
 pre-retirement age to travel to the West or to
 emigrate. Those attempting to cross the border
 illegally run the risk of imprisonment or death from
 border guards or automatic shooting devices, though
 border shooting incidents have declined in recent
 years.
 Over the past decade there have been modest
 improvements in limited areas. There has been
 significantly increased access to the GDR for Western
 visitors. The GDR no longer jams Western radio or TV
 broadcasts. However, since 1979, the GDR has
 increased the minimum mandatory currency exchange
 requirement for Western visitors and stiffened the
 penalties for releasing information or materials
 critical of the GDR.
 The GDR has made substantial progress in meeting the
 social and economic needs of its citizens. It has a
 highly industrialized economy, a relatively good
 standard of living, and an extensive welfare system.
 On the other hand, the GDR denies its citizens nearly
 all civil and political liberties. There is complete
 censorship of the media and publications. GDR
 citizens are regularly arrested for criticizing the
 government or party.
 Internationally, the GDR has become more active since
 1977 in providing advisors, including military and
 internal security personnel, to such revolutionary
 and independence movements as SWAPO and the PLO, as
 well as to governments of questionable adherence to
 democratic principles such as Ethiopia, Angola,
 Mozambique, Nicaragua and South Yemen.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Department of State is not aware of any reports
 of torture in the GDR. Torture is specifically
 prohibited in the GDR by the International Covenant
 
 (772)
 
 
 773
 on Civil and Political Rights, which took effect as
 law in 1976 in the GDR.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Information on prison conditions comes mostly from
 former inmates who have emigrated to the West. A
 large number of prisoners (over 1,000 per year) are
 reportedly brought out of the GDR by arrangement with
 the FRG. From these and others there are frequent
 and credible reports of cruel and inhuman treatment
 in GDR prisons. The allegations are almost all
 against prisons run by the Interior Ministry where
 inmates serve sentences after conviction. The
 pre-trial prisons where interrogations are conducted,
 run by the ministry for state security, generally
 treat the prisoners better. Although there have been
 reports of isolated cases of solitary confinement and
 mistreatment during interrogation, the principal
 methods used appear to be constant questioning and
 promises of leniency in return for information.
 Beatings by guards and other inhuman punishments for
 minor infractions or on trumped-up charges appear to
 occur frequently in the prisons. Sometimes the
 prisoner, after being severely beaten, is denied
 medical care and placed in an isolation cell for
 weeks without adequate heat, food, or sanitary
 conditions. Some prisoners have reportedly died from
 lack of medical treatment of their injuries.
 Suicides and suicide attempts occur regularly in the
 prisons. In some instances, prisoners have reported
 finding fellow inmates dead under conditions pointing
 to foul play by prison guards. However, the prison
 officials list the deaths-as suicides.
 In the last few years prisoners have been told they
 can wear tattoos. What they are not told is any
 tattoo with political overtones will be removed
 before they are released. There are frequent reports
 that the tattoos are removed in a painful manner
 which leaves a permanent scar.
 Inmates convicted of common crimes and political
 crimes are mixed together and generally tremted
 identically. Prison conditions are reportedly
 inadequate in several respects, including
 over-crowding in cells, poor food, and inadequate
 sanitary facilities. Although prisoners are supposed
 to have access to medical facilities, there are
 reports that prisoners with severe medical problems
 are refused permission to see a doctor. There are
 allegations of scarcity of medications and treatment
 by personnel with little or no medical training.
 Given the relative prosperity of the GDR, these
 inadequacies would seem to be due more to lack of
 concern than lack of resources to correct them.
 Prisoners, except those being punished, are generally
 allowed to exercise their right to have two visitors
 per month. There have been no reports in recent
 years of the use of the death penalty.
 c. Disappearances
 The Department of State is unaware of reports of
 prolonged or permanent disappearance.
 
 
 774
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The GDR penal code contains a high degree of
 subjectivity. Some laws are written in vague and
 general language so that it is not always clear what
 objectively constitutes an offense. Many actions are
 defined as criminal which would be considered
 political in free countries. For example, section
 220 of the penal code states a person can be
 sentenced up to three years for "making available
 writings, objects, or symbols which are collected in
 order to prejudice the state or public order, to
 disturb the socialist community or to bring contempt
 upon the state or social order." Section 99 of the
 code states that the transmission of information
 (even if it is not secret) to a foreign organization
 can be considered treason. This law has not been
 rigorously enforced, but it has inhibited East German
 contacts with foreign journalists and diplomats.
 Another political crime is attempting to flee the
 country or helping someone else to flee the country.
 A few people are known to have been arrested simply
 because they have applied for permission to emigrate
 and refused to give up their application. The
 authorities consider this "agitation against the
 state."
 There are no firm figures on how many political
 prisoners there are in the GDR, but estimates from
 private human rights groups in the FRG run from 4,000
 to 5,000. There are very few, if any, political
 prisoners being held for politically-motivated
 violent crimes. Amnesty International reports the
 majority of its cases in the GDR are those of
 individuals who sought to leave the country.
 Approximately 20,000 prisoners were estimated to have
 been released in an amnesty between October and
 December 1979. In the last preceding amnesty in
 1972, the GDR allowed 2,087 amnestied prisoners to
 emigrate to the West. Although many of the prisoners
 amnestied in 1979 reportedly want to move to the
 West, the GDR allowed fewer than ten of them to do so
 in 1980 and released others in 1981 only as part of
 ongoing negotiations with the FRG in family
 reunification cases. Many of those amnestied are
 living under tight police controls. For instance,
 they cannot be out late at night and friends cannot
 stay overnight with them without first obtaining
 permission from the police. Most of the amnestied
 people have been able to find jobs and housing,
 generally of lower quality than those held before
 imprisonment. The GDR government referred in the
 1972 amnesty to "political prisoners," thus
 acknowledging their existence. According to
 published reports, the GDR is continuing the practice
 of releasing rrisoners to the West in return for
 substantial payments.
 The right of habeas corpus does not exist in the
 GDR. According to paragraph 103 of the preliminary
 proceedings section of the criminal procedure code, a
 person can be held up to three months before charges
 are filed. Moreover, the public prosecutor may
 extend the detention period indefinitely if the
 investigation cannot be finished within that time.
 The officials have reportedly extended this detention
 period in several political cases.
 
 
 775
 No specific charge must be brought to detain a
 citizen under house arrest. According to the law on
 house arrest of 1961, the public prosecutor can, with
 the approval of a court, order the house arrest of a
 person, "even if a violation of a particular law has
 not occurred," if this person is considered to be a
 threat to public security and order. The officials
 used this law to hold a prominent dissident, Robert
 Eavemann, under house arrest for three years between
 1976 and 1979. He remains under extremely close
 surveillance, which effectively eliminates direct
 contacts with Westerners.
 In most political arrest cases, it takes longer than
 24 hours--often many weeks--before interested parties
 are notified. According to paragraph 128 of the
 criminal procedure code, the public prosecutor may
 postpone notification of the relatives and employer
 of the prisoner if "the objective of the
 investigation would be endangered by the
 notification." The notification will then take place
 immediately after the elimination of the grounds of
 endangerment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although GDR law provides for a fair public trial for
 all defendants, the judge can authorize a closed
 trial. This is done in almost all political trials.
 Although defendants are guaranteed the right to a
 lawyer of their choice, there are many hindrances to
 effective counsel. For instance, defendants are
 often not allowed to pick a lawyer'until a few days
 before the trial. Even if there is sufficient time
 to prepare a defense, the defense attorney cannot
 discuss the specifics of the case with his client
 until the investigation is completed and formal
 charges are brought, which may be a period of months.
 The defense attorney must also receive permission to
 meet his client in private and there is no guarantee
 that this will be granted. Trials tend to be short
 and perfunctory. In cases with high political
 interest, the prosecutor always wins. GDR cou;ts are
 not independent. According to the constitution, the
 courts are under the control of the executive body,
 the council of state. As with most other
 institutions in this de facto one-party state, the
 courts are in reality controlled by the SED. The SED
 determines appointments to the courts. A judge may
 be recalled at any time by the SED-controlled
 Volkskammer or council of state. Military courts are
 responsible for trying civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The police have the authority to enter a home almost
 at will. By law they need an authorization to enter
 and search a house (unless there is a threat to
 public order or security), but the police can
 authorize entry themselves, and the courts will
 retroactively give approval. The authorities
 reportedly do not investigate complaints of abuse.
 The police do not have to give a receipt if they
 confiscate materials in the house.
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 50
 
 
 776
 It is legal for the authorities to tap telephones and
 to open mail. Evidence collected in these ways can
 be used in court. The authorities reportedly
 practice these methods and the "bugging" of homes on
 a regular basis. East Germans often claim to detect
 bugging, mail opening, and physical surveillance if
 they have unusual contacts with Westerners or
 otherwise arouse the curiosity of the state security
 services. They also believe undercover state
 security service informers to be active in every
 apartment house, work unit, and even local bar.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Although all these freedoms are guaranteed by the GDR
 constitution, the only freedom allowed to a certain
 degree in practice is freedom of religion.
 Individuals are frequently arrested for expressing
 views which are considered "anti-socialist" or
 contrary to the interests of the state. Views which
 are critical of the government or the party are
 generally not allowed to be expressed publicly,
 although some latitude is allowed for discussion of
 specific economic problems. Many of the literary
 figures who have published works in West Germany
 critical of the regime have been encouraged to move
 to the West. During 1979-1980 several young writers
 were imprisoned, then released only when they agreed
 to emigrate.
 All forms of the media are government-controlled and
 censored. Western publications are not allowed in
 the GDR unless they are such politically acceptable
 materials as the newspapers of Western communist
 parties. Travelers to the GDR have their Western
 publications confiscated by border officials. A GDR
 citizen passing on such publications to others can be
 arrested and may also be arrested and interrogated
 even for simple possession. All areas of
 non-theological intellectual inquiry, such as
 academic work, are controlled by the party and the
 state.
 Western journalists must apply for permission from
 the government before they can interview a GDR
 citizen. This is used to prevent Western journalists
 from interviewing critics of the regime. The GDR
 imposed these restrictions in 1979 because of
 television broadcasts from West Germany showing GDR
 citizens criticizing their government. The
 restrictions have almost completely eliminated such
 West German media interviews with East Germans. In
 spite of the restrictions, the government's control
 of information is greatly hindered by the fact that
 most GDR citizens watch FRG television and listen to
 PRG radio broadcasts. The GDR does not try to
 prevent its citizens from receiving these
 broadcasts. However, it does make a special
 propaganda effort to discredit Western media and
 persuade East Germans not to tune in Western stations.
 Although the rying party is ath3istlic, the friedom
 to pra tice re gion Is permitted within certa n
 limits.
 
 
 777
 More than 40 percent of the population is
 unaffiliated with any religion. The
 Evangelical-Lutheran Church is the largest in the
 GDR; nearly 50 percent of the population are
 members. It has gained many concessions from the
 government in recent years. For example,
 applications for television broadcasts by the church
 are routinely approved; ministers are now allowed to
 work in the prisons, and several churches in new
 housing areas are being built. The GDR churches
 teceive considerable financial aid from churches in
 the FRG. The state does provide substantial funding
 for welfare activities such as church hospitals,
 homes for the aged, and child care centers, as well
 as the upkeep of cemeteries.
 The churches, especially the Evangelical-Lutheran,
 often speak out at meetings and from the pulpit in
 criticism of specific government policies. The state
 tolerates some of these criticisms. The churches
 face major problems, however. The most serious is
 attracting youth in the face of continuing
 discrimination against church members for job and
 educational opportunities.
 The other Protestant churches (less than 1 percent)
 and the Roman Catholic church (less than 8 percent)
 are generally allowed to practice their work. One
 sect, the Jehovah's Witnesses, is specifically
 prohibited. The very small Jewish community receives
 government financial support for its activities,
 including the building and maintenance of synagogues
 and the maintenance of an old-age home. There are no
 Jewish schools and no resident rabbi.
 There is no freedom of assembly. Individuals are not
 allowed to organize into groups which are not
 officially controlled, with the exception of the
 churches. There is only one trade union
 organization, and it is controlled by the party.
 Strikes are not permitted. Trade union assemblies
 are as rigidly controlled by the party as any other
 non-ecclesiastical, public meeting. They transmit
 party economic directives and propaganda for greater
 productivity. The trade unions do not represent
 workers' interests, which are taken into
 consideration by SED-controlled plant management only
 as a matter of practical necessity.
 The only ethnic minority in the GDR is the Sorbs, a
 Slavic people who make up 0.2 percent of the
 population. The GDR supports the maintenance of the
 cultural identity of the Sorbs by teaching the
 language in local schools and through a special
 publishing house for Sorbish literature. Since the
 Sorbs have long been ethnically, linguistically, and
 socially integrated into German society, the regime's
 efforts are essentially cultural and propagandistic.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within the country is generally not controlled
 unless a person is under house arrest. Travel is
 comparatively easy to the Soviet Union and to Eastern
 European countries except Poland. In autumn 1980 the
 
 
 778
 GDR imposed visa restrictions which have prevented
 tourist visits to Poland by all but a few East
 Germans with close relatives in Poland. Travel to
 the West is almost impossible for most GDR citizens
 under retirement age (60 for women, 65 for men). The
 sector line between East Berlin and West Berlin and
 the border between the GDR and the FRG are among the
 most impregnable frontiers in the world. To cross
 the border without permission is a crime punishable
 by up to five years in prison. Persons attempting to
 escape to the West also risk.wounding or death by
 border guards and automatic shooting devices.
 However, known incidents of wounding or death have
 fallen off. substantially in recent years.
 The government closed off the last open access to the
 West when it built the Berlin Wall in 1961. Although
 GDR propaganda justifies the heavily-fortified
 frontier as protection against "imperialism," the
 real reason is that over 2 million GDR citizens fled
 to the West from 1945 through 1961. This created a
 severe and still existing labor shortage, especially
 in skilled work and professions. Despite these
 obstacles, hundreds of GDR citizens manage to escape
 across the border each year. Many more (over 4,000)
 flee each year to the West via other East European
 countries.
 There is no indication how many GDR citizens would
 emigrate to the West if they could. But after the
 Helsinki Final Act of CSCE was signed in 1975, tens
 of thousands of GDR citizens applied to emigrate
 legally to the West. The vast majority of those and
 subsequent applications for exit permits have been
 refused. Many who apply to emigrate lose their jobs,
 are harassed and sometimes imprisoned. Most of those
 who do succeed in leaving legally are allowed to do
 so because they have relatives in the West, usually
 the FRG.
 The GDR contains no large refugee groups from other
 countries. For local propaganda purposes the GDR
 welcomes individual out-of-favor leftists from
 abroad. For example, an undetermined number of
 Chilean communists came to the GDR after the
 overthrow of the Allende government.
 Most people who leave the GDR, legally or illegally,
 do not return except for brief visits. Most who
 depart legally are forced to give up their GDR
 citizenship, although some are allowed to keep it if
 they wish. All people who left the GDR illegally
 before 1972 have been stripped of their GDR
 citizenship. Of the rest, only a very small number
 have applied to repatriate themselves to the GOR.
 The GDR has reportedly denied permission in most of
 these cases.
 Other than permission to travel to the West at a
 retirement age five years earlier than men, women are
 subject to the same travel and emigration regulations
 as men.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Nominally the GDR is a multi-party state. In reality
 
 
 779
 the political system is totally dominated by the
 Socialist Unity (communist) Party. Within this party
 the Leninist concept of "democratic centralism" is
 rigorously enforced. Decisions are taken by the
 politburo and other central authorities. Party
 members who disobey are disciplined or expelled, thus
 severely damaging their career prospects. There are
 four other parties, but they defer to the SED on all
 important political matters. Only once since the GDR
 was founded has one of the parties voted in the
 parliament against a bill.  (This was the Christian
 Democratic Union, which voted against a bill
 legalizing abortion.) The delegations in the
 parliament are apportioned among the parties and mass
 organizations. The SED holds a plurality. No
 opposition parties are permitted. All parties have
 their own newspapers, but all follow SED policy
 lines. All important news articles have nearly
 identical texts. All citizens are expected to vote,
 although there is only a single list of candidates on
 the ballot. A citizen can be imprisoned for refusing
 to vote. Refusal to vote or to approve the single
 list is obvious because balloting is not secret.
 Such persons are usually warned that their political
 attitude must be "corrected" or they will encounter
 unspecified difficulties--usually housing or
 employment discrimination. Public demonstrations,
 campaigns, and committees at all levels are SED
 approved propaganda events designed to advance SED
 political goals.
 3. Government Attitudi and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The GDR has taken the position that inquiries into
 its human rights policies are interference in the
 internal affairs of the GDR. The human rights
 situation in the GDR is being examined by the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights under the confidential
 1503 procedures. Requests by Amnesty International
 and other private human rights groups in the West for
 information about human rights conditions in the GDR
 have not been answered by the government. The
 government does not permit visits to the GDR by these
 groups. There is an official GDR Committee for Human
 Rights, but this is merely a propaganda organization
 which attacks human rights conditions in Western
 countries and claims that there are no human rights
 violations in the GDR. No unofficial human rights
 groups exist in the GDR, although emigre groups in
 West Berlin occasionally publicize cases of denial of
 human rights.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The GDR has a highly industrialized and centrally
 planned communist economy. All large industrial,
 retail, and agricultural operations are state-owned,
 but private small businesses with fewer than 10
 employees are allowed. According to official GDR
 statistics, 3 percent of the net national product is
 produced by private enterprise.
 The GDR, like most other Eastern European communist
 countries, compiles macroeconomic statistics in a
 different manner than most of the rest of the world.
 
 
 780
 For that reason it is difficult to devise precise
 statistical comparisons between the GDR's standard of
 living and that of other countries. Most observers,
 however, feel that the GDR has a relatively high
 standard of living, probably the highest in the
 communist world. According to the World Bank, per
 capita income for the GDR in 1979 (the latest year
 available) was 6,430 dollars. While differences in
 the quality of goods provided in the market make
 comparisons difficult, most observers believe the GDR
 citizen is better off than most of his Eastern
 European counterparts. According to official GDR
 statistics, the economy's rate of expansion has
 remained at about four percent over the last few
 years.
 Almost all GDR citizens can be considered middle
 class. Since the GDR is committed to the ideals of
 communism, it seeks to maintain a relatively small
 variation in wages. There is little real poverty in
 the GDR. Over the last five years the average
 monthly income of a CDR worker has climbed at an
 annual rate of about 3 percent. In 1979 the average
 monthly income of a fully employed worker was 1,000
 GDR marks. The GDR mark is officially traded at an
 exchange rate of one GOR mark to one deutsche mark
 (DM).
 Prices of basic goods and services have remained
 stable throughout the last decade because of heavy
 government subsidies. Shortages of consumer goods
 are periodic but not pervasivei supplies of basic
 goods, food and services are usually adequate.
 The most serious shortage in the GDR is housing,
 especially in the cities. This is partly a result of
 the damage caused in World War I, plus
 underinvestment in housing. Residents of Berlin
 sometimes wait up to eighteen months for housing if
 they are single and up to one year if they are
 married. The government is committed to a major
 housing construction program lasting until 1990 and
 made a good deal of progress in this field during the
 1970's. The vast majority of housing in the GDR is
 owned by the state. However, CDR citizens can
 acquire legal ownership of a house through family
 inheritance or if they obtain the approval of local
 authorities to buy or build a house. The waiting
 time for those who are requesting a plot of land on
 which to build a house can run into years.
 Special privileges for housing, foreign travel,
 education and consumer goods exist for people in
 certain job categories. These special benefits can
 be much more important than wages in determining
 status and living standard. Thus, they tend to
 create a privileged class. Conversely, those who are
 not in political favor are discriminated against when
 seeking employment and educational opportunities.
 Although the government claims that all citizens are
 treated equally, many people in the religious
 communities complain of discrimination in employment
 and education.
 There is an extensive welfare system which includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents.
 In 1979 there were about 266,000 places in pre-school
 
 
 781
 care centers for children under the age of 3 (in that
 year the GDR population included 619,000 children
 under 3). Free medical care is also provided. In
 1979, per 1,000 citizens the GDR had 1.98 doctors,
 .55 dentists, and 10.5 hospital beds. There were
 approximately 13 deaths in the first year of life for
 every 1,000 births. Life expectancy at birth is 72
 years. Free and universal education is supplied
 through the 12th grade, and 94 percent of all
 school-age children attend school. Approximately 92
 percent of male children and 95 percent of female
 children attend primary school. Literacy is just
 about universal. However, there is not enough room
 in the institutions of higher learning for all those
 who wish to continue their education. Competition is
 keen for these spaces, and allocation is usually made
 on the basis of the political acceptability of the
 applicant. In 1979, the last year for which
 statistics are available, there were about 76 college
 or university students per 10,000 people. Social
 services are provided to rural residents as well as
 to urban dwellers. In 1979 the GDR devoted
 approximately 7 percent of its budget expenditures to
 education, 7 percent to medical and social services,
 and 20 percent to social insurance and pensions.
 In economic matters women are in theory and in
 practice more or less equal to men. Their salaries
 are generally equivalent. About 78 percent of women
 of working age are actually employed, compared to
 about 88 percent of the men. Women can be found in
 significant proportions in all professions except-the
 militia. For example, 44 percent of the industrial
 work force is female, as are 42 percent of those
 employed in agriculture and forestry. There are very
 few women, however, in the highest positions of the
 party, government, economy and the professions. In
 the medical and other professions women are probably
 more numerous than in Western nations, but they
 seldom rise to supervisory positions in hospitals and
 similar facilities.
