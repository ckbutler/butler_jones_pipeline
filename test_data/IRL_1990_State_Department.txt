 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a
 long tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are assured by the 1937 Irish
 Constitution and subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive
 Irish governments have had to deal with the spillover into the
 Republic of terrorist violence from Northern Ireland. That
 violence led Irish authorities to adopt special legislation in
 1984 granting the police increased powers to detain and
 interrogate those suspected of acts of terrorism. During 1990
 Irish officials continued to show restraint in exercising
 these powers.
 The Irish economy, based largely on free enterprise, has grown
 rapidly as a result of long-term policies of industrialization
 and diversification which are agreed among government, the
 labor unions, and the business community. It performed well
 in 1990 despite continued fiscal austerity and a 16-percent
 rate of unemployment. Exports were strong, and the budget
 deficit was reduced.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance to
 the observance and maintenance of human rights. There were no
 reports of significant human rights abuses in 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In the past, politically motivated killings have occurred in
 Ireland as a spillover from the violence in Northern Ireland.
 In these cases, such groups as the Provisional Irish Republican
 army (PIRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA)
 usually claim responsibility. The Government uses the full
 force of law to pursue and prosecute such cases wherever
 possible. In 1990 there were no political killings in the
 Republic.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment is respected by the Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person shall be deprived of
 personal liberty only in accordance with the law. This is
 respected in practice. The same section of the Constitution
 provides for a judicial determination of the legality of a
 person's detention and requires in.such cases that the
 arresting authorities make written explanation to the court
 about the person concerned. Neither in law nor in practice is
 
 
 1189
 IRELAND
 anyone subject to arrest for the expression of political or
 religious views.
 Short-term detention without charge exists but is restricted.
 It is permitted for a maximum of 48 hours in cases covered by
 the Offenses Against the State Act of 1939, legislation
 designed to "prevent actions and conduct calculated to
 undermine public order and the authority of the State." This
 legislation was-reactivated in 1972 and broadened to include
 other "scheduled offenses" against peace and order. The
 police may now arrest'and detain for questioning anyone
 suspected of any terrorist offense involving firearms,
 explosives, membership in an unlawful organization, or
 malicious damage to property. After the 48-hour period, the
 person must be brought before a magistrate, presented with
 written charges, and given legal representation.
 The Omnibus 'Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives some increased
 powers to the police in the area of detention for
 interrogation. Critics of the 1984 Act have argued that those
 increased powers, whic did not come into effect until 1987,
 following implementation of the companion complaints procedure,
 are out of proportion to the threat addressed and are unhealthy
 for democracy. Defenders of this legislation counter that two
 issues of human rights are at stake: the right of citizens to
 be protected against terrorist crime, along with the
 safeguarding of individual rights from abuse by police.
 Neither incommunicado detention nor exile is used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. A defendant has the right to legal
 counsel. The courts are independent, and jury trial is the
 norm. The Constitution provides, however, -for the creation of
 "special courts" to deal with cases in which the "ordinary
 courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration
 of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order."
 The Offenses Against the State Act of 1939 formally set up
 such courts and provided that they may try persons for
 offenses against national security, particularly cases of
 political violence perpetrated by terrorist groups likely to
 intimidate regular juries. Rather than having juries, these
 courts have panels of judges, each consisting of an uneven
 number of judges, but in any event not less than three. Their
 verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally
 are similar to those of regular courts, except that the sworn
 statement of a police chief superintendent that the accused is
 a member of an illegal organization is considered prima facie
 evidence of such membership. Court sessions are usually
 public but may exclude certain persons, other than genuine
 press representatives.  There is provision for free legal aid
 and appeal- against conviction or sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home is
 affirmed by the Supreme Court and generally observed. The
 Constitution, however, provides that the State shall enact no
 law "providing for the grant of the dissolution of marriage."
 A proposal'to amend the Constitution to permit divorce in
 limited circumstances was overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986
 nationwide referendum. In the same year; the European Court
 
 
 1190
 IRELAND
 of Human.Rights ruled that the absence of divorce is not a
 breach of-the European Convention on Human Rights, to which
 Ireland is a party.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedomof Speech and Press
 These. freedoms are-provided for by the Constitution and
 generallyuxespected in practice. Publication or utterance of
 "blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by law.
 Ordinarily, official censorship is directed largely toward
 pornographic material. Nonetheless, the state-owned radio and
 television network, on the basis of the-constitutional
 provisions-dealing with public order and the authority of the
 .State, denies air time to members of a list of organizations
 including (Provisional) Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of
 the illegal Provisional Irish Republic army (PIRA). In 1982
 this prohibition was challenged before the Irish Supreme Court
 and upheld on constitutional grounds. All political parties
 not on the list are given access.to both publicly owned radio
 and television facilities and major independent daily
 newspapers. Criticism of the Government in such media is
 allowed and it flourishes. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such
 as PIRA and INLA, however, are illegal, and membership in them
 is an offense against national security. Political parties or
 groups associated with such organizations, such as
 (Provisional) Sinn Fein, are riot proscribed.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population of Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and there are
 no restrictions upon freedom of worship. Some Irish laws,
 such as the prohibition against divorce, reflect the point of
 view of the majority of the population. The area of family
 law--including the rights of illegitimate children--is the
 subject of current debate in which minority religious
 communities have taken a vocal and active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as
 well as freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary repatriation. Irish authorities have accepted
 asylum seekers only on a limited basis and firmly apply
 international definitions to those who claim refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 -Ireland has enjoyed a consistent history of orderly transfer
 - of power by elections since the end of the Irish civil war in
 1923. There are several political parties, and independents
 may stand for election to either house of the Irish Parliament.
 The constitutional requirement that elections be held at least
 every 7 years has always been met. Ireland uses a
 
 
 1191
 
 IRELAND
 proportional voting system, and the secrecy of the ballot is
 fully safeguarded. There is universal suffrage for those over
 18 years of age.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Hiuman-Rights
 Irish governments generally cooperate with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although they
 have not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 The Irish Council for Civil Liberties operates freely and
 without hindrance as the principal independent organization
 interested in domestic human rights issues. The Council for
 the Status of Women, representing over 70 national women's
 organizations, provides the central focus in Ireland for
 pursuit of legislative and other reforms to end discrimination
 against women and to promote fuller participation by women in
 the social, economic, and political life of the country.
 Ireland has held the vice-chairmanship of the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission, reflecting concern by both the Government
 and people for worldwide respect for basic human rights. This
 concern is reflected as well in support for Amnesty
 International's activities in other countries.
 Sectiof 5 Discrimination-Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government-social serviced provide adequate shelter, nutrition,
 health cdre, and education without regard to race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. People whose
 means are inadequate and who 'are not entitled to other benefits
 may teceive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment
 Equality Act of 1977 seek to provide protection and redress
 against sex and pay discrimination. Their operation is
 monitored by the Employment Equality Agency. The number of
 cases has fallen in recent years, but -this has not been
 accompanied by real progress in eliminating the differential
 in the key index of average hourly earnings in industiy. In
 June 1989, women's hourly earnings in the manufacturing sector
 were 61 percent of men's earnings.
 Violence against women occurs, but there have been no reliable
 studies to show the extent of the problem. The Rape
 (Amendment) Act of 1990 has criminalized rape within
 marriage. It also makes provision for free legal advice to
 the rape victim. Women's groups are seeking the extension of
 this provision to that of actual legal representation, as well
 as increased counseling and other support services for the
 victims of rape and domestic violence.
 A new Commission on the Status of Women was established in
 1990 with the mandate of promoting greater equality for women
 in all facets of Irish life. As priority objectives, it has
 identified child care, training and education, the development
 of employment opportunities, legal rights and protection, and
 the appropriate funding of representative bodies and support
 services. The women's movement continues to highlight family
 law, rape law reform, and social welfare discrimination as
 problem areas.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike. The
 right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to
 refrain from joining. About 58 percent of workers in the
 private and public sectors are members of unions. Police and
 military personnel are prohibited from joining unions or
 striking, but they may form associations to represent them in
 matters of pay, working conditions, and general welfare. The
 right to strike is extensively exercised in both the public
 and private sectors.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents
 unions in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, has 78
 member unions with 650,501 members. Both the ICTU and the
 unaffiliated unions are independent of the Government and of
 the political parties. The ICTU is affiliated with the
 European Trade Union Confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage in
 free collective bargaining. Legislation prohibits antiunion
 discrimination. Most terms and conditions of employment are
 determined through collective bargaining, which took place in
 1990 in the context of the Program for National Recovery. As
 part of the industrial relations machinery, the Labour Court,
 consisting of an employer representative, a trade union
 representative, and an independent chairman, may investigate
 trade union disputes, recommend the terms of settlement,
 engage in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint
 committees to regulate conditions of employment and minimum
 rates of pay for workers in a given trade or industry. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14 years with the written
 permission of the parents. Irish laws limit the hours of
 employment for those 15 years of age to 8 hours per day and 40
 hours per week. Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up
 to 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. These provisions
 are effectively enforced by the Minister for Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no general minimum wage legislation. However, some
 workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to
 specific industrial sectors, mainly those that tend to pay
 lower than average wages. The 1989 average weekly wage of
 $316 for production and transport workers was generally
 adequate to provide an acceptable standard of living. Working
 hours in.the industrial sector are limited to 9 hours per day
 and 48 hours per week. Overtime work is limited to 2 hours
 .per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. As part
 of the national economic pact adopted in 1987, the standard
 workweek is being gradually reduced to 39 hours. The Labor
 Department enforces four basic laws dealing with occupational
 safety that provide adequate and comprehensive coverage.
