 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarch. In practice, the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led
 by the Prime Minister, is responsible for government decisions.
 The Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the confidence
 of Parliament, which includes 13 political parties split along
 linguistic and ideological lines. The Flemish and Francophone
 Social Christians have been the major contemporary political
 force in Belgium, leading or participating in virtually all of
 the 30-odd coalition governments since World War II.
 Domestic security in Belgium is primarily the responsibility
 of the national paramilitary Gendarmerie, the judicial police,
 and a host of municipal police forces. The armed forces have
 no rold in domestic law enforcement.
 The series of terrorist attacks and bombings by the Belgian
 C.C.C. (Communist Combat Cells) that plagued Belgium in 1984
 and 1985 ceased with the arrest of the C.C.C.'s reported
 leaders in early 1986. -.The single terrorist incident in 1987
 was the October assassimation of a Syrian diplomat, claimed by
 "Syrian Mudjahedin."
 Belgium continues to contend with the social, economic, and
 racial pressures linked to the presence of a largely Turkish
 and North African immigrant population. The population
 increased in 1987 with the arrival of nearly 8,000 refugees,
 primarily from Africa and Asia.
 Respect for human rights in Belgium is provided for in the
 Constitution and laws and observed in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the authorities nor officially sanctioned groups
 engage in killing for political motives. The "Syrian
 Mudjahedin" claimed responsibility for killing a Syrian
 diplomat in October 1987. The perpetrators have not been
 caught.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions by
 government or other officially condoned groups are proscribed
 by law and did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits deliberate mistreatment or injury of
 another b3 both public officials and private individuals. In
 recent years, there have been some accusations of police
 brutality in arrests and detention of suspects. Belgian
 authorities have vigorously investigated such cases and have
 taken disciplinary action against the perpetrators and forced
 resignations.
 Aged prisons are an issue in Belgium, but there were no
 incidents involving cruel and inhuman punishment in 1987.
 There are no differences in the conditions of confinement

 BELGIUM
 based on race, sex, religion, or social class, although prison
 officials try to accommodate special religious and medical
 diets. Prisoners in two large penitentiaries rioted in
 September 1987 because British subjects extradited to Belgium
 for trial on offenses related to the 1985. Heysel Stadium riot
 were confined in a newly refurbished prison. As a result, the
 Justice Minister promised to improve the physical conditions
 in other prisons as well as the handling of people awaiting
 trial.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law. Arrested persons must be brought before a judge
 within 24 hours or released. Belgian law provides for
 pretrial confinement only under the following special
 circumstances: When a person is apprehended in the commission
 of a criminal act; when there is a risk that the suspect will
 prove a danger to the community; when there is a risk that the
 accused will flee the jurisdiction; and when the case involves
 one of a number of serious offenses specified by law. The
 premise for such confinement is subject to monthly review by a
 panel of judges.
 In practice, there is growing concern among local human rights
 groups and parliamentarians that pretrial detention is
 sometimes abused. Bail exists in principle under Belgian law
 but is rarely granted in practice. There is no limit on how
 long an accused may be held prior to coming to trial. The
 President of the Belgian League for the Defense of Human
 Rights has expressed his concern that extended pretrial
 detention occurs more and more frequently in cases involving
 immigrants.
 Exile of Belgian citizens is not permitted by law. Forced
 labor for political, ideological, discriminatory, or other
 ends is unknown.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 assured by law and honored in practice. A suspect is charged,
 if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary judicial
 investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly and
 formally stated. No one is imprisoned because of political
 beliefs.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The
 Constitution specifically provides for the inviolability of
 the home except in cases laid down. and regulated by law. The
 law forbids searches of private homes at night, except in
 special circumstances. Warrants issued by a judge are
 required unless the inhabitants of the domicile agree to the
 search. The Penal Code provides penalties for all violations
 of the home by officials as well as by private persons.
 Monitoring of telephones and interference with mail are also
 strictly prohibited. The Minister of Justice introduced a
 bill in 1987 to allow the use of court-approved wiretaps by
 law enforcement agencies under certain limited circumstances,

 including terrorist cases. This has not yet been approved by'
 Parliament.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil-Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are assured by law and respected in practice.
 Varying political, religious, philosophical, and artistic
 views are permitted free public expression, and.there is no
 political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and prod'ctions held to undermine
 "public order" (e.g., explicit pornography and incitement to
 violence). There are laws against libel, provisions for a
 citizer's right of reply to media criticism, and restrictions
 on criticism of government policies by civil servants.
 Belgium has state-owned radio and television networks, but
 there is no direct government control of program content.
 Their programs are supervised by boards of directors which
 represent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups.
 The Government has a representative on the boards but no veto
 power.
 Private radio stations, legalized in 1985, operate with
 government licenses. Belgium has yet to pass legislation
 permitting privately owned television stations. Most urban
 homes have access by cable to television from other European
 countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political, civic, religious, artistic, social, and other
 special interest groups are permitted free public assembly,
 subject to regulations concerning public order. Labor unions
 and groups.p otesting government policies or actions are free
 from harassment and persecution, although permits are required
 for open-air assemblies.
 The right to organize, strike, and bargain collectively is
 recognized and exercised freely, although government austerity
 measures sometimes limit or alter the results of collective
 bargaining. The degree of union organization is one of the
 highest in the world,..exceeding 70 percent of the work force.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but
 have important informal links with and influence on many of
 the major political parties. The unions do not allow their
 leaders to hold political office.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long'tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian,-Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status-in law, which includes a government
 subsidy. Minority "non-recognized" religions enjoy full
 freedom to'practice and are not subject to harassment or
 persecution.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the country
 and internationally, including the right of voluntary
 repatriation.

 BELGIUM
 A law took.effect in May 1985 that gives municipalities in the
 greater Brussels region the right to refuse to register new
 foreigners--defined as citizens of non-European Community
 countries--as residents. Such registration is required of all
 persons residing in Belgium, with some exceptions. Six
 municipalities have taken advantage of the new law, which in
 effect could serve to limit the freedom of foreigners to
 decide where they wish to reside in Belgium. To date, there
 is no available evidence that this law has been applied to
 discriminate on the basis of the race, religion, language,
 social status, or ethnic background of the foreigners in
 question.
 Belgium has always welcomed refugees and granted political
 asylum to applicants of many nationalities and races. That
 liberal tradition remains unchanged, although Belgium modified
 its asylum policy in 1987. Previously, anyone claiming to be
 a political refugee was allowed in the country to pursue his
 or her claim with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), which adjudicated all such requests for the
 Government of Belgium' The process often took more than a
 year, during which time the asylum seeker was able to remain
 in Belgium and receive all Belgian social benefits. Even
 those who arrived with false documents were allowed to pursue
 their claims. In 1986, 7,774 people took advantage of this
 system, of whom only about 15 percent ultimately will be
 granted refugee status.
 A new asylum law, which will be fully in effect in early 1988,
 transfers the power of adjudication from the UNHCR to a
 government commission. The new law allows border police to
 refuse at the port of entry asylum seekers who use false
 documents or make clearly fraudulent applications, and
 provides for fining carriers who transport improperly
 documented aliens. Although most aspects of this law were
 implemented in April 1987, the flow of asylum seekers has not
 dropped dramatically from last year's level.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all
 citizens. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats
 (excluding 76 of the 182 Senate seats apportioned by other
 means) are held at least every 4 years under a system of
 universal, secret, and compulsory suffrage for all adults (18
 and over). Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been
 in effect since 1919 for men, and since 1949 for women. Under
 law and practice, opposition parties are free to operate
 without constraints or repression.
 The existence of Dutch- and French-speaking regions poses
 significant problems fcr the State. All major institutions,
 including political parties, are divided along linguistic
 lines. There are special provisions-for Dutch-, French-, and
 German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and
 linguistic needs are taken into account in national political
 and economic decisions.
 Two French-speaking Belgians, elected in 1981 to represent
 Francophone suburbs of Brussels located within the political
 boundaries of the Flemish regional council, complained to the
 European Court of Human Rights that they had been deprived of
 their right to free elections by a.Belgian law which allows
 only Dutch-speaking Belgians to be elected to the Flemish
 
 
 BELGIUM
 Council. The-court rejected their claim in 1987. Another
 case involving the refusal of the elected mayor of a mainly
 French-speaking town to use its official language (Dutch) has
 deeply divided Belgium's two communities and caused recurrent
 political tension in recent years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium. There are several active
 independent human rights groups, and they consider the
 Government open to discussion of any human rights question.
 The Government has been active in the United Nations and other
 international forums in promoting human rights, and became a
 member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in 1986. It has
 also promoted independent investigation of alleged human
 rights violations.
 Section 5   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally vibrant, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences in general are respected, and
 linguistic-rights in particular are protected. Some 57
 percent of Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily
 in the northern provinces that constitute Flanders. The 42
 percent of French speakers live mostly in the capital,
 Brussels, and the southern provinces called Wallonia. The
 small minority of German speakers live along the eastern
 border. Language differences have been the subject of
 hundreds of laws over the last century, leading to a fairly
 rigid structure designed to protect each language group from
 cultural, economic, or political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 residents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social
 status, or ethnic background. Some 25 percent of the
 residents of Brussels, the nation's largest city, are
 foreigners. Many of these are North African and Turkish
 immigrants. The immigrant population--generally poorer, less
 skilled, and less educated than average--is increasingly the
 focus of public debate concerning how to encourage greater
 assimilation of the immigrant population into Belgian
 society.
 Belgium is a leading advocate of women's rights both within
 the country and in international meetings on the subject. A
 number of commissions have been established to ensure that
 women's rights are protected and particularly to oversee
 women's eduation and working conditions. Women's average
 wage rates in nonagricultural employment in 1985 amounted to
 74.6 percent of those of men. Women are well represented in
 business and in political life. There are numerous female
 members of the Senate and Chamber of Representatives. Three
 women hold Cabinet posts in the current Government. To show
 the importance attached to promoting women's rights
 internationally, a Consultative Commission for the Condition
 of Women has- been made part of the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs. This Commission advises the Government on
 international women's issues.

 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Belgium continued to sufter in 1987 from slow economic growth
 and high unemployment, currently hovering just below 12
 percent. Governmental policies to promote employment and an
 extensive system of unemployment compensation and other social
 benefits have served to minimize serious individual financial
 hardship.
 Belgian working hours, mandated by law and collect:.,e
 agreements, are the shortest in Europe, averaging abuut 37
 hours a week. There are generous provisions for minimum wage
 (currently almost $600 month fo: full-tipe work for thoze over
 age 21, with a slightly lower youth minimnum), vecations, and
 unemployment benefits. Adequate hoalth and safety legislation
 exists, supplemented by collective bargaining agreements, and
 health and safety committees are mandated by law at enterprises
 with more than 50 employees. The minimum age for employment
 of children is 16; children can work and study part time from
 age 16 to 18.
