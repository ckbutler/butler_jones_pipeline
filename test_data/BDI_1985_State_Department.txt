 BURUNDI
 The Republic of Burundi is a one-party state led by President
 Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, an army colonel who came to power in
 1976 through a bloodless coup. The role of the military in
 the Government is still influential but has steadily declined
 in day-to-day governance as Bagaza has appointed civilians to
 most key government positions. The National Party for Unity
 and Progress (UPRONA) is the most important political
 institution in Burundi. As head of the party and the
 Government, President Bagaza has a dominant policy role. He
 also has certain decree powers and appoints and dismisses
 judges. The dominance of the minority Tutsi over the majority
 Hutu ethnic group is the central political and social reality
 of Burundi which continues today through Tutsi control of
 emerging political institutions and the military. However,
 Bagaza has appointed Hutus to all levels of government,
 including 5 to his 19-member cabinet, and there are about 19
 Hutu representatives in the 65-member National Assembly.
 While far from representative of the Burundi population as a
 whole (85 percent Hutu, 14 percent Tutsi, and 1 percent
 other), this Hutu presence reflects substantial improvement in
 representation in the Government over past years.
 The armed forces maintain law and order. In addition, there
 is a regular police force responsible for civil and criminal
 offenses and a separate force of security police responsible
 primarily for internal state security, including monitoring
 dissent. The state security police have the same powers of
 arrest as the regular police and are subject to the same
 process of judicial review of detentions.
 Burundi is a very poor country with one of the highest
 population densities in Africa. Most Burundi earn their
 livelihood as subsistence farmers working small, privately
 owned plots. The small monetary economy is based on coffee,
 which accounts for 85 percent of foreign exchange. Recent
 gains made in food production and agriculture have been
 largely offset by the high population growth rate.
 In the area of human rights during 1985, the Burundi
 Government and the Roman Catholic Church had a series of
 confrontations concerning appropriate hours for religious
 activities and the role of the Church in society. Twenty
 Christian clerics were imprisoned, more than 140 foreign
 missionaries were forced to leave Burundi because their
 residence permits were not renewed, and many missionaries who
 requested permission to come to Burundi were denied visas.
 Moreover, Burundi clergy were not permitted to travel to Kenya
 to meet with Pope John Paul II. In addition, the Government
 closed down all Seventh-Day Adventist churches and schools
 because of the refusal of Adventists to perform community work
 on Saturday.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no allegations of killings for political motives or
 of summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearance have been reported.

 BURUNDI
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law. Cruel treatment of suspects or
 detainees has occurred in the form of beatings at the time of
 arrest or interrogation. Such treatment is rare and occurs
 only in cases of violent crimes or resisting arrest. The
 Government admits that isolated instances of abuse of
 prisoners by prison guards or officials do occur but insists
 that those responsible for such abuses are punished.
 Prison conditions apparently are severe due to overcrowding
 and lack of adequate hygiene, medical care, and food.
 Prisoners are segregated according to the nature of their
 crimes, are allowed regular family visits, and participate in
 rehabilitative work programs, including agricultural
 production. Families are encouraged, and expected, to provide
 supplemental food and other personal items to their relatives
 in prison. Due to inadequate budgets, food rations are very
 limited, and there have been several reports of deaths in
 prison from starvation. The Government admits that there is a
 serious problem in the prisons and it is trying to improve
 conditions, with the help of the the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 Police officers are empowered to detain suspects but must
 submit a written report to the Public Prosecutor's office
 within 24 hours. The Public Prosecutor examines the report
 and can either order the detainee's release or issue an arrest
 warrant valid for 5 days. The Public Prosecutor must state
 the charges before a magistrate in the presence of the
 detainee. The Magistrate then either releases the detainee or
 issues orders confirming the detention, initially for 15 days
 and then subsequently for 30-day periods as necessary to
 prepare the case for trial. Bail is set only in cases of
 embezzlement or similar crimes involving financial wrongdoing.
 The prescribed procedures for arrest and imprisonment are not
 always followed. The elapsed time between an arrest and the
 notification of the Public Prosecutor often extends to several
 days, and detainees do not always appear before a magistrate
 within the allotted 5 days from arrest. However, a judicial
 review of the arrest almost always takes place. Relatives or
 consular representatives are made aware of arrests or
 detentions, generally at the time of incarceration. The
 general practice is to permit detainees to go to their homes
 prior to being brought to the place of detention. During
 1985, at least six people, were detained for expression of
 views critical of, or hostile to, the Government and were
 charged with violations of civil law. They are still awaiting
 trial.
 The Government does not exile its nationals. Citizens of
 other countries suspected of criminal activity or lacking
 proper residency documents are expelled; in 1985, for example,
 64 Zairians were expelled.
 Forced or compulsory labor is not permitted under current law,
 but most citizens are expected to perform community service on
 Saturdays.
 
 
 BURUNDI
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary's independence is limited by the requirement to
 adhere to the guidance and recommendations of the party, the
 Government, and the President. Judges are appointed and may
 also be dismissed at the pleasure of the President.
 Nevertheless, there is a high degree of autonomy in the
 court's daily administration of justice, and due process is
 largely observed. Though court decisions cannot be overturned
 by.the executive branch, the President has the power to pardon
 or reduce sentences.
 Burundi has separate court systems to deal with military,
 ciyil/criminal, and state security cases. Military tribunals
 have jurisdiction only over military personnel. The State
 Security Court has jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel, and its proceedings need not be made
 public. To date, this Court has not been used. Burundi law
 provides the right to counsel, and indigents are provided
 counsel by the State. Pretrial proceedings may involve
 lengthy investigations. The public prosecutor's office
 generally dismisses cases where the evidence in support of the
 charges is weak and only proceeds to trial when it believes
 guilt has been established.
 During the past 5 years, the Government has taken steps to
 improve the judicial system, and the 1984 Party Congress
 recommended additional judicial reforms. New courts have been
 created, the number of magistrates has tripled, and training
 seminars and conferences have been held. Simultaneously,
 however, prison populations have doubled or tripled, and the
 courts are hampered by a lack of trained legal personnel and
 by heavy case loads.
 There are no verified cases of purely political prisoners,
 although one or two such cases have been alleged. Defamation
 of a public figure is a civil offense, and several persons are
 serving short sentences (under 12 months) after convictions
 for this offense. There are also approximately 10 detainees
 being held for criticizing government restrictions on
 religious activities and for reportedly advocating
 disobedience.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of correspondence and the inviolability
 of the home are guaranteed in the Constitution and respected
 in practice. A judicial warrant is required for a law
 enforcement official to enter and search a private residences.
 Membership in the political party and its affiliated
 organizations is open to all but is not required. The State
 Security Office monitors political dissent through the state
 security police and by employing paid informers who report on
 discontent and dissension as well as on criminal activity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government controls all domestic print and broadcast
 media. The French language daily and Kirundi language weekly
 are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 
 
 BURUNDI
 operates the domestic radio and television stations. The
 media are required to support the fundamental policies of the
 party and Government. Some criticism of government
 mismanagement and policies is permitted in the printed press.
 Journalists are state employees and consequently would be
 subject to disciplinary action if their criticism went beyond
 what is considered tolerable. The Government rarely
 interferes with the distribution of foreign news publications
 and never interferes with radio reception from foreign sources.
 Freedom of speech is limited by statute. Criticism of the
 party and government policies or leadership is permitted only
 within party meetings. Academic freedom is also limited. At
 the primary and secondary school level, teachers are expected
 to support government policies. At the university, professors
 come from several different countries and are permitted to
 lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct research, and
 draw independent conclusions. Censorship occurs only in the
 case of sexually explicit foreign film material or
 publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The express authorization of the Government is required for
 all political meetings. This effectively guarantees
 government control of all public forums and limits association
 for political purposes to participation in the party or its
 affiliated youth, labor, or women's movements.
 The party controls the trade union confederation, the National
 Labor Union or UTB. The principal role of the UTB, to which
 virtually the entire salaried work force belongs, is to serve
 as an intermediary between workers and employers in labor
 matters. The UTB brings complaints against employers on
 behalf of its members and often forces employers to revise
 their practices. However, unauthorized advocacy of a strike
 or lockout is a criminal offense. Therefore, though they are
 technically permissible, there have been no strikes in recent
 years. The UTB participates in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and is a member of the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 The Government permits nonpolitical private associations but
 requires that they be registered and accorded legal
 recognition before they may function.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom exists within defined limits, as the
 Government considers religious organizations subject to the
 same sorts of rules and restrictions which apply to secular
 organizations. All religious associations must receive
 approval from the Government to operate. The authorities must
 be informed in advances of religious gatherings, which are
 strictly limited to recognized places of worship, and
 religious services are authorized only after 5 p.m. Mondays
 through Fridays, after midday on Saturday, and all day on
 Sundays. The Jehovah's Witnesses sect was banned by the
 Government in January because its doctrine challenges certain
 precepts of civil authority. Consequently, members of the
 sect cannot openly carry out activities within the faith or
 aimed at conversion. There are no reports of persons
 imprisoned for merely adhering to the sect.
 
 
 39
 BURUNDI
 The Seventh-Day Adventists' refusal to perform work of any
 kind on Saturday, their Sabbath, led to the closing of
 Adventist churches and loss of their legal status in early
 1985. Adventist churches and schools were closed, and a
 number of students were imprisoned for a weekend. Eight
 pastors and teachers were detained for approximately 4 months
 without being charged. Adventist properties remain vacant
 except for one school which is now being operated by the
 Government.
 In 1985, the Government made it clear to other Christian
 churches that they must confine their activities to religious
 and social works and stay out of political matters, which
 include Hutu/Tutsi relations. Twelve Burundi Catholic priests
 were arrested for violating restrictions on hours of worship
 services; all of them were released within weeks.  In a
 related development, two priests and nine laypersons were
 charged in connection with a tract which criticized the
 Government's recent restrictions on hours of worship. The
 author of the tract was sentenced to 5 years in prison, and a
 70-year-old priest, a former university rector and prominent
 religious leader, was sentenced to 4 years for "insulting the
 Chief of State." Three laymen were sentenced to 2 years
 imprisonment for distributing the tract, and three others were
 given nominal sentences for assisting the tract's author in
 his attempts to flee the country. The two others accused were
 acquitted for lack of evidence. Some religious symbols not on
 church buildings have been removed by local authorities.
 Since early in 1985, the Government has pursued a policy of
 reducing the number of missionaries, and thereby missionary
 influence, in Burundi by refusing applications for residence
 permit extensions. More than 140 missionaries were forced to
 depart Burundi in this way, and, though the rate of refusal
 slackened periodically, it is clear that the Government
 maintained its intention to reduce the missionary presence.
 Church access to the media is curtailed by the longstanding
 suspension of a Catholic newspaper and of religious
 broadcasts. A few other missionaries were expelled for
 writing articles or making statements which the Government
 considered critical. There are, however, no barriers to the
 training of clergy or to maintenance of links with religious
 hierarchies in other countries. Religious beliefs do not
 exclude individuals from political participation or from
 social benefits.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although government
 policies discourage urban migration. Foreign travel and
 emigration are relatively free. However, the Government
 requires exit visas as well as passports. Occasionally, the
 Government withholds these documents without explanation but
 for apparently political motives. Forty-three Catholic
 clerics who wanted to attend an ecclesiastical meeting in
 Kenya during Pope John Paul II's August visit were barred from
 traveling. Foreigners have also been forced to remain in
 Burundi for short periods without explanation.
 Burundi's Government cooperates closely with the United
 Nations High Commission for Refugees. Burundi claims to
 shelter 256,000 refugees, but most might be more accurately
 described as displaced persons. The United Nations estimates
 
 
 BURUNDI
 that there are approximately 60,000 refugees, primarily Tutsis
 of Rwandan origin who fled-to.Burundi in the 1960's. Many are
 well integrated in Burundi, although. they may acquire
 citizenship only through marriage to a Burundi. Refugees who
 fled from Burundi in the early 1970's and before continue to
 return and have full rights as citizens. Amnesty
 International has been concerned about the situation of
 refugees and asylum seekers from Zaire. Several were
 allegedly.-forcibly repatriated in. 1983, and 64 other Zairians
 without proper papers were expelled in February 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Burundi citizens do.not have the right to change their
 government. Political participation can take place only
 within the one-party structure,.and voters can express
 dissatisfaction only by voting-against--incumbents. The
 president ofthe party is. the sole candidate, for President of
 .the Republic. Power rests with the President and with the
 party's central committee. The party is open to all
 Burundians supporting its principles and claims a membership
 of about 1.4 million, about three-quarters of the adult
 -population. Theiparty regularly holds local and regional
 meetings, during which time they discuss issues and make
 recommendations. While there are multiple candidates for
 party positions, balloting is not secret.
 .Although the military retains influential presence in all the
 ,party organs and-in the Government, its role in actual
 administration-has declined markedly since 1979. Only 3
 military officers are currently cabinet members, and military
 officers hold 12 of the 69 central committee seats. The
 Constitution provides for a National Assembly, which was
 seated in 1982 with a 5-year mandate, comprising 65
 representatives, 52 elected by secret ballot under universal
 adult suffrage and the remainder are appointed. All
 candidates were drawn from a list preselected by provincial
 electoral colleges composed of party and government
 officials. Two candidates for each elective seat were
 permitted. The balloting was evidently free, as several high
 ..party and government officials failed to win seats. The
 Assembly is not intended to be a separate and independent
 power but is expected to cooperate with and complement the
 executive and other institutions. Over the last 3 years, the
 National Assembly has actively debated government policy with
 occasional pointed criticism.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Burundi is a party to several United Nations instruments on
 human rights, and its Constitution provides for the protection
 of such rights. There were no reports during 1985 of requests
 for outside investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. The last visit of the ICRC took place in late
 1983. The Government complied with the ICRC's standard
 conditions for visits to prisoners or detainees. In its 1985
 report (covering 1984), Amnesty International was concerned
 inter alia by the restrictions imposed on religious activities
 and-the detentions imposed on members of religious groups.
 Freedom House terms Burundi "not free."
 
 
 BURUNDI
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burundi is among the poorest countries of the world, with a
 1983 per capita gross national product of $240. In 1978, 55
 percent of the urban population was below the absolute poverty
 level, and the figure has changed little since then.
 Population density is among Africa's highest, with a
 population of 4.7 million (1984) inhabiting a land area of
 only 27,834 square kilometers. The population growth rate for
 1985 is estimated at 2.8 percent. Nearly 90 percent of
 Burundians earn their livelihood from agriculture. The
 traditional feudal land tenure system has been abolished, and
 most farmers own the land they cultivate.
 Burundi's relatively small monetary economy is based on the
 export of coffee, whichaccounts for 85 percent of foreign
 exchange earnings. Energy costs, high transportation costs,
 and fluctuations in world coffee prices have harmed the market
 economy. Real economic growth over the past 5 years has been
 outpaced by population growth.
 Health care is inadequate as Burundi suffers from a shortage
 of personnel, facilities, and budgetary resources. Life
 expectancy at birth is only 47 years, and the rate of infant
 mortality is 115 per 1,000 live births. Although most urban
 dwellers have access to potable water supplies, the percentage
 of the rural population with access to safe year-round water
 is very low. Educational opportunities, despite considerable
 government efforts supported by donor assistance, remain below
 the needs of the population. Only 27 percent of adults are
 literate according to 1980 figures (39 percent male, 15
 percent female). World Bank statistics for 1980 show primary
 school enrollment of 31 percent of the primary school age
 population (39 percent for males, 24 percent for females).
 Only a small fraction of those completing primary school is
 able to obtain places in the nation's secondary schools. An
 even smaller percentage of students wins places in the
 nation's sole university.
 Worker rights are guaranteed by the Burundi Labor Code and by
 the National Collective Interprofessional Labor Convention.
 Working hours vary between 40 and 45 hours per week; Saturday
 afternoons, Sundays, and holidays are times of rest. Children
 under the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity, nor
 may children under the age of 16 be engaged in dangerous or
 strenuous work. Minimum health and safety standards are
 monitored and enforced by the Ministry of Labor. Burundi has
 a minimum wage and has been trying to reduce the high levels
 of unemployment and underemployment.
 Women in society hold a secondary position, although their
 status is undergoing considerable change from traditional
 patterns. The Constitution provides for legal equality.
 Significant improvement in the legal status of women came with
 the issuances of a new legal code on families which prohibits
 polygamy and the dowry, and allows women some control of
 family matters. Women still cannot inherit land and cannot
 work if forbidden to work by their husbands. Although fewer
 women than men attain an education, once it is attained women
 can generally find suitable employment. The Government does
 not discriminate against women in hiring or in respect to the
 jobs which are open to them. Women are represented at all
 levels in the political life of the country. However, their
 
 
 42
 BURUNDI
 main vehicle of political expression is the Burundi women's
 movement which is affiliated with the party. The party
 remains dominated by males.
 The minority Tutsi have for centuries dominated the majority
 Hutu. Civil strife in 1972, which culminated in
 government-sanctioned massacres, led to nearly 200,000 Hutus
 fleeing to neighboring Rwanda and Tanzania. Since the advent
 of the Bagaza Government in 1976, the degree of ethnic tension
 has been markedly reduced. Thousands of Hutu refugees have
 returned to Burundi. Intermarriage has also contributed to a
 blurring oftethnic distinctions. The low level of economic
 development in rural areas affects both Tutsi and Hutu, making
 differences in economic status between the two groups scarcely
 discernible in-the countryside. However, because of their
 longstanding dominance of the Government and access to
 education, the Tutsi predominate in the modern sector. The
 military remains under Tutsi control. Nevertheless, there is
 no evidence'that:Hutus are denied equal protection of the law.
