 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a multi-
 national, federal state comprised of six republics (one of
 which has two autonomous provinces). The Communist Party
 organizations of each republic and province maintain
 monopolies on political power. In practice, the theory of
 Socialist self-management, as established by the late President
 Tito and his close associate, Edward Kardelj, allows
 considerable autonomy at the republican, provincial, and local
 levels, and Yugoslav communism thus differs fundamentally from
 highly centralized Marxist-Leninism. Socialist
 self-management, in theory, allows workers to run their own
 enterprises; it also permits a small amount of private
 enterprise and small-scale private farms.
 Although fundamental tenets of Socialist self-management cannot
 be questioned within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia,
 there is relatively open debate on the implementation of this
 concept. There is also open debate about the key issues of the
 day, including economic reform, the functioning of the
 political system, and the appearance of nationalism in Yugoslav
 politics and society. In the key areas of the administration
 of government and the management of the economy, the party has
 delegated power and responsibility to the Federal and
 republican/provincial executive councils as well as to the
 organizations of associated labor.
 The legitimacy of the current regime rests primarily upon its
 opposition to the Axis occupation in the Second World War, its
 triumph over other groups in a fierce civil war, and its
 subsequent ability to balance the national aspirations of the
 country's diverse ethnic groups and to raise significantly the
 population's living standard. Over the past four decades, and
 particularly after Tito's break with Stalin in 1948, Yugoslavia
 has gradually and steadily evolved into a more pluralistic
 society, as the Government has granted more freedoms
 (particularly the freedom to travel) and tolerated more open
 discussion in the media. Today, there are few topics which are
 not aired in the media to some degree. Restrictions upon
 freedom of political expression remain, however, and some
 topics, including criticism of the late President Tito and the
 system of Socialist self-management, are generally forbidden.
 Some guarded and cautious discussions of those subjects,
 however, have taken place in recent years. The Government does
 not tolerate public denigration of the "brotherhood and unity"
 of Yugoslavia's diverse peoples or writings it considers to be
 efforts to arouse expressions of regional nationalism.
 Yugoslavia emerged from the disintegration of the Ottoman and
 Hapsburg Empires. The Yugoslav Federation's constituent
 peoples--Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, Montenegrins,
 Albanians, Hungarians, and many others--have diverse
 experiences in the turbulent history of the Balkans. After the
 formation of the country at the end of the First World War,
 there was only a brief period of parliamentary democracy.
 Historic ethnic and national tensions, as recently as the
 Second World War, have burst into open, fratricidal conflict.
 Animosities persist and remain at the root of many domestic
 issues with human rights implications, such as the unrest in
 the Autonomous Province of the Kosovo which erupted again in
 the spring of 1981. Although there has been considerable
 
 (1171)
 
 
 1172
 
 material progress since 1945, the Yugoslav Government has
 enjoyed only limited success in overcoming disparities in
 economic development within the country.
 The human rights situation in Yugoslavia is mixed, and 1983 was
 a year of mixed developments. There was no reversal of the
 general trend toward more openness, nor were there any giant
 steps forward in the area of human rights. By and large, the
 Government and the party were preoccupied with the country's
 economic problems and reform of the economic system.
 Discussion of political changes has also begun, and the general
 concept of change received the party's qualified endorsement at
 the 10th plenary session of its Central Committee held on
 October 25, 1983.
 RESPECT FORHUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The issue of "political" killings arises essentially in the
 context of historic inter-ethnic hatreds, either as a result of
 tensions between groups within the country or as a result of
 the activities of the Yugoslav secret police and emigre groups
 outside the country. During the past few years, there have
 been reports in the Western European press that the Yugoslav
 secret police have been responsible for a series of murders in
 Western Europe of members of anti-Yugoslav emigre
 organizations. Some of the victims were allegedly engaged in
 terrorist acts against Yugoslav officials and establishments
 abroad.
 In May 1982, a high-ranking employee of Yugoslavia's largest
 petroleum company, INA (Industrija Nafte), Stjepan Djurekovic,
 disappeared amid rumors of embezzlement, only to appear several
 months later in the Federal Republic of Germany, where he set
 up the Croatia Publishing House. On July 2, 1983, he was
 murdered. Yugoslav press accounts suggest Djurekovic was
 killed by other emigre leaders envious of his popularity. Some
 emigre organizations claim he was a victim of the Yugoslav
 secret police.
 On March 9, 1983, two Armenian terrorists assassinated the
 Turkish Ambassador in Belgrade, the second such terrorist
 attack against diplomats to take place in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav
 police, aided by bystanders, apprehended the assassins, who are
 still awaiting trial. One Yugoslav student died trying to
 prevent the assassination, and a retired military officer was
 permanently paralyzed because of a wound suffered trying to
 halt the assassins.
 b. Disappearance
 Few instances of the permanent or prolonged disappearance of
 persons inside Yugoslavia have been reported, although cases do
 occur in which no public notice is made of an arrest or trial
 until sentence is pronounced, and not all cases are reported.
 In the past, Amnesty International and the international press
 have also reported alleged instances of kidnapping of Yugoslav
 emigres by the Yugoslav Intelligence Services in order to
 return them to Yugoslavia for trial.
 
 
 1173
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution guarantees the "inviolability of the integrity
 of the human personality" and states that any extortion of a
 confession or statement shall be forbidden and punishable.
 Numerous passages in the Yugoslav code of criminal procedure
 have similar wording. Nevertheless, Amnesty International
 reports the receipt of allegations that people have been
 beaten, tortured, or threatened during pretrial detention.
 Several allegations of the misuse of psychiatry also have been
 received by the American Psychiatric Association and Amnesty
 International. The use of torture has become a legal issue in
 several court cases.
 Conditions within Yugoslav prisons generally appear to be
 severe, but not inhumane. There have been credible reports,
 however, of particularly harsh conditions in some Yugoslav
 prisons, including allegations that some prisoners have been
 held in solitary confinement for extended periods. The
 Yugoslav press has occasionally reported and editorialized
 against abuses of authority by the police and against excessive
 use of force. While medical care is generally available to
 prisoners, there are persistent reports alleging denial of
 proper medical treatment to prisoners with special medical
 problems, although in some cases (Franjo Tudjman, Gojko Djogo)
 individuals have been paroled for medical treatment either in
 Yugoslavia or, more rarely, abroad. Prisoners may receive
 visits from family members, but sometimes visits are restricted
 in pretrial cases on the grounds that they would prejudice
 ongoing investigations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest. Yugoslav
 legal organizations and procedures derive from French
 (Napoleonic) law, which does not include such principles as
 habeas corpus and trial by jury. There is a requirement under
 the Constitution, however, to bring a defendant before a judge
 within 24 hours of arrest in order to bring about "judicial
 awareness" of the reason for detention. The accused has the
 right to counsel from this time. Normally, arraignment quickly
 follows arrest, and indictment must be brought within three
 months unless an extension is approved by the court.
 The Government continues to arrest and imprison Yugoslav
 citizens for acts that are considered political offenses even
 though they are committed abroad and are not crimes in the
 country in which they took place. Arrests on such charges also
 have occurred when the accused has become a citizen of the
 country in which the act took place, since the law considers
 such a person a dual national unless a petition for
 renunciation of citizenship has been approved. This practice
 appears to have occurred with less frequency, however, during
 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public except in cases
 involving military or "national security" questions, when the
 judge has the authority to hold proceedings in camera. The
 accused has the right to independent counsel from the time he
 or she is brought before the judge. However, until an
 
 
 1174
 indictment is handed down, consultations between the accused
 and his attorney must take place in the presence of a court
 official. Indictment must be brought within three months,
 although the investigating judge may request from the presiding
 judge an extension of three months or even longer if
 justification is presented.
 In cases of crimes relating to national defense and security
 and to matters concerning service in the military, civilians
 may be tried in military courts. The court may also, in cases
 involving classified materials, appoint a military officer as
 counsel for the defense rather than civilian counsel. The
 trial record does not necessarily provide a full transcript,
 and all testimony is recorded in the words of the presiding
 judge. Government controls on the media also affect the degree
 and nature of publicity accorded the proceedings.
 The Government, however, has not always remained impartial in
 judicial proceedings, particularly in cases of political
 interest. Human rights organizations believe that the outcome
 in political cases is predetermined before the accused goes to
 trial. Amnesty International has reported the reluctance of
 some lawyers to take political cases for fear of reprisal. In
 ordinary criminal and civil proceedings, however, the courts
 act according to the law and Constitution, and the defendant's
 civil rights are generally respected. The accused has the
 right to counsel, and Yugoslav lawyers have often vigorously
 defended their clients.
 Yugoslav law treats as "political crimes" acts which seek the
 overthrow of the constitutional order or attack the country's-
 territorial integrity and basic constitutional values,
 including "the brotherhood, unity, and equality of the Yugoslav
 peoples." Thus, there is official recognition and definition
 of "political prisoners," although the category does not
 correspond precisely to international concepts. Some of the
 political acts treated as crimes by the criminal code are:
 "counter-revolutionary attacks,"  "endangering the independence
 of the state," "association for hostile activity," and
 "hostile propaganda."   However, political crimes also include
 "crimes against the bases of the Socialist self-management
 systems and the security" of Yugoslavia, and abuse of public
 property by government officials or members of the party.
 Reform of these and other articles has been the subject of
 public discussion by Yugoslav legal experts in recent years,
 and in late 1983 one lawyer specifically proposed the abolition
 of "hostile propaganda," which accounts for most of the
 political indictments and which generally carries the least
 severe sentences. Yugoslav officials, however, have defended
 these articles on the grounds of the threat to society posed by
 efforts to revive historic animosities among some of the
 country's constituent peoples.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to ascertain,
 despite the relatively open official definition of political
 crime. In recent years, however, the federal prosecutor has
 made public the number of persons indicted for political
 offenses. Indictments for "criminal activities with political
 implications and anti-self-management offenses and abuses of
 public and private property" increased from 555 in calendar
 year 1980 to 594 in 1981, but fell again in 1982 to 516.  Of
 the 516, some 473 were convicted in 1982, and 422 of those
 received prison sentences. Of the indictments, 65 percent,
 involving 340 individuals, were for verbal offenses (hostile
 
 
 1175
 propaganda, inciting nationalist hatred, damaging the country's
 reputation, and spreading false news), which generally carry
 sentences of only a few months. While the overall number of
 indictments declined 15 percent over the previous year, the
 number of verbal offences increased by 15 percent.
 According to an October 1983 Federal Secretariat for Internal
 Affairs report, 62 percent of those indicted for political
 crimes were ethnic Albanians charged with "irredentist"
 activities. In an October 1983 interview, the Federal Public
 Prosecutor, Milos Bakic, attributed the increase in verbal
 offenses to stricter enforcement in the wake of the spring 1981
 demonstrations in the Province of the Kosovo. Bakic noted that*
 Albanians made up 90 percent of the Public Prosecutor's cases
 in the Kosovo, where Albanians form the overwhelming majority
 of the population. The Secretariat also reported breaking up
 seven illegal groups, involving 130 individuals, in the Kosovo
 and Macedonia as of late 1983, and a 90 percent increase in
 arson. Also in October 1983, the President of the Provincial
 Committee of the League of Communists of the Kosovo, Ilijaz
 Kurtesi, reported that since the beginning of the recent
 troubles in the Kosovo, 595 individuals had been sentenced to
 prison. Since the sentences were for at least one or two
 years, most of these individuals are probably still in prison.
 In Croatia, according to local authorities, there were 67
 political prisoners serving sentences in June 1983, and 10 more
 individuals being held in pretrial confinement. Of the 52
 prisoners who were sentenced in 1982, nine were released on
 parole, one individual was sentenced to more than 10 years in
 prison, seven received 3-10 year sentences, 19 received 1-3
 years, and 16 less than one year.
 The decline in the number of individuals indicted for political
 offenses suggests that the number of political prisoners may
 also have decreased by about 100 to roughly 700, over half of
 whom were detained in connection with disturbances in the
 Kosovo.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is some interference by the Yugoslav Government with the
 private lives of citizens. For example, the code of criminal
 procedure contains elaborate provisions for conducting
 searches, including the requirement for a court order, except
 under certain limited circumstances. However, the Constitution
 provides that entry may be made without warrant if this is
 indispensable for the immediate arrest of the perpetrator of a
 criminal offense, to protect the safety of life and property,
 or if it appears obvious that evidence in criminal proceedings
 could not be obtained otherwise. There are no indications of
 widespread violations of these provisions. Many dissidents,
 however, believe that the authorities eavesdrop on their
 conversations and read their mail. Others, however, are less
 certain and believe such practices are gradually being
 eliminated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are limited. There is, however, a
 distinct and widely acknowledged trend towards greater openness
 and media freedom, particularly in the last few years.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 75
 
 
 1176
 Unorthodox, public expression of political dissent is
 frequently suppressed, particularly when it involves the verbal
 expression of local nationalisms, which the Government
 considers incendiary. As noted above, 65 percent of all
 political crimes in 1982 fell into the "verbal" category, and
 most of the political trials reported in the press involve the
 verbal offenses of "hostile propaganda," "inciting national
 hatreds," and "damaging the country's reputation." Dissent and
 disagreement with agreed policy (on other than these forbidden
 topics) and with the positions of established political groups
 within the Federation are increasingly expressed in political
 forums and in the media.
 In publishing, restraints normally are exercised by the
 publishing house boards, which tend to act independently of the
 party. Disputes between publishing boards and party organs, as
 well as between publishing boards and editorial boards, are
 often reported in the press. However, publication and
 circulation of written materials are also subject to
 regulations involving registration and post-publication
 censorship. In-May 1983, for example, the Public Prosecutor
 reported that eight works had been banned from distribution
 during the previous year. A map and the statistical yearbook
 were banned for not defining inter-republican borders. Three
 student newspapers were banned, one for ridiculing Leonid
 Brezhnev. (Several years earlier, a student newspaper was
 banned for ridiculing the Pope.) Two Catholic publications and
 a poster were banned for their political content. The most
 notable case, however, was the banning of a collection of
 documents concerning the case of poet Gojko DJogo, who was
 imprisoned for poems which allegedly insulted former President
 Tito. His artistic freedom became an issue openly championed
 by the Belgrade intellectual community, leading to his release
 for medical reasons. The local party organization closed the
 publishing house which had published his poems as well as other
 offending works, but the case has become part of a larger
 debate between some members of the Serbian Writers' Association
 and some members of the Serbian League of Communists. In early
 1983, a local Croatian party committee also expelled from
 membership the publisher of "The Real and The Possible," a
 collection of essays by prominent Serbian writer Dobrica Cosic,
 which it assessed as nationalistic. Similarly, in 1983, the
 Federal Trade Union Publishing House party organization
 expelled the author of The Knife, a novel about ethnic strife
 in wartime Bosnia, but to date the author has kept his job with
 the publishing house as a journalist.
 In academia, toleration of divergent views is mixed but
 generally continues to grow. The party continues to apply
 pressure upon professors at Pristina University suspected of
 propagating Albanian nationalism, reflecting its concerns about
 youth attitudes. The professors, however, remain at their
 posts. Members of the "Praxis" group at Belgrade University
 continue to work at their center for philosophy and social
 theory, which published in mid-year with a Serbian republican
 subsidy Vojislav Kostunic's and Kosta Cavoski's Party Pluralism
 or Monism, a controversial history of the political currents in
 Yugoslavia during and immediately after World War 1I. The book
 argues that the Communist political leadership at that time
 accepted a multiparty political system, which disappeared only
 because of external, i.e., Soviet, influence. Furthermore,
 Belgrade University administrators successfully resisted
 political pressure to discipline or-fire an eminent literature
 professor, Nikola Milosevic, for arguing that Stalinism was not
 
 
 1177
 an independent phenomenon, the product of one personality, but
 rather had its roots in Leninism. Finally, a Slovene journal
 of literary and cultural criticism, Nova Revija (New Review),
 has continued to be published despite attacks on it from some
 party circles.
 Apart from religious publications, many of which enjoy wide
 circulation, Yugoslav media are owned by the Party or
 Government. They are subject to party direction, although the
 scope of this supervision varies from republic to republic.
 Well-informed Yugoslavs consider the press thorough and
 reliable in its treatment of external affairs, the only
 commonly agreed-upon weakness being a pro-Palestinian bias.
 The press can be outspoken in its criticism of the Government;
 criticism of the handling of the situation in the Kosovo and
 frank discussion of the country's economic difficulties, for
 example, have appeared regularly in the press. During 1983,
 the chief editor of the Belgrade daily Politika was replaced,
 in part for political reasons, and personnel changes were made
 at the major Zagreb and Belgrade weekly news magazines Danas
 and Nin, although without a notable impact on the quality of
 reporting. In general, when the Government and party do take
 action against the media, they employ a mix of criticism,
 warnings, fines, personnel changes, and occasionally judicial
 indictments.
 The general availability of printed matter, recorded material
 and films from Western countries has been decreased by
 financial austerity measures, although the Yugoslav Government
 did set aside hard currency to ensure an adequate supply of
 foreign publications during the tourist season, and the
 situation in late 1983 is better than it was early in the
 year. Individual items, including material the Internal
 Affairs Secretariat judges offensive, are censored, and during
 1982 several individual editions of Italian and West German
 newspapers were banned from distribution. The apparent cause
 in most cases was the appearance of articles about Milovan
 Djilas, Tito's wartime subordinate, who was expelled from the
 party in the 1950's and subsequently became a major dissident
 voice. Amnesty International has also reported several
 instances where Yugoslavs were imprisoned for possessing or
 circulating certain emigre journals critical of the
 Government. Tourists occasionally are detained and fined for
 possession of printed works the Government regards as hostile
 to its policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political gatherings are permitted only on the authority
 of official bodies and organizations. In practice, the right
 to political assembly is exercised almost exclusively by groups
 supporting government policy. Others are usually suppressed,
 as was the case when eight Belgrade University students with
 "Solidarnosc" placards were arrested by the police at a
 pro-Palestinian demonstration organized by city authorities in
 July 1982. (Pro-Solidarity demonstrations had been permitted
 by Slovenian authorities in February 1982.) However, in 1983,
 authorities tolerated Monday evening gatherings at the Writers'
 Club in Belgrade in support of imprisoned poet Gojko Djoko, at
 which as many as two hundred intellectuals gathered, often
 sharply criticizing the authorities.
 Trade unions are organized not by industry but geographically
 by republic and province. Though organized and sponsored by
 the state as part of the workers' self-management system, the
 
 
 1178
 unions no longer work solely to win workers' support for the
 Government's economic policy, but are playing a larger role in
 representing workers' interests. In August 1983, unions took
 the lead in speaking out against price increases that followed
 the expiration of price controls, and unions have pressed
 frequently for the need to preserve workers' and pensioners'
 living standards, particularly in connection with the annual
 budget process. Strikes, called "work stoppages," are not
 prohibited by law. According to official statistics, 175
 stoppages occurred in the first six months of 1983, up
 significantly from the previous year. They have been caused in
 most cases by economic factors, primarily the ten percent drop
 in the standard of living since the first of the year. Unless
 the strikers commit acts of violence against persons or
 property, they are not punished, although their political
 reputation with the local party organization may suffer.
 Yugoslavia is a member of the International Labor Organization.
 Professional groups, such as scientific bodies and lawyers'
 associations, maintain regular ties with their counterparts in
 recognized international bodies in their fields. The degree of
 application of political criteria for employment purposes,
 which was virtually absolute for many years after World War II,
 now has diminished. Nevertheless, a "moral and social fitness"
 criterion--measuring loyalty to the state and party--is still
 applied to those seeking white-collar employment, particularly
 with the Government. For government positions, membership in
 the party remains practically a prerequisite.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Most Yugoslav believers belong to the Catholic and Orthodox
 Churches, or to the Islamic faith. Since World War IT, the
 Jewish community has numbered only several thousand persons.
 Although the Government and party actively encourage atheism,
 freedom of religion is generally honored so long as religious
 organizations do not engage in activities that the authorities
 consider political. However, members of the clergy, notably
 several Catholic priests, are currently in prison for making
 remarks from the pulpit considered "anti-state" or "inciting
 ethnic hatreds." The most publicized religious case in 1983
 involved twelve Muslim intellectuals, who were sentenced in
 August to 5 to 15 years in prison for "hostile activity" and
 other offenses. Yugoslav authorities stated that freedom of
 religion was not the issue, but rather an attempt by the
 defendants to create an ethnically pure Islamic Republic in
 contradiction to constitutional guarantees to all Yugoslav
 nationalities. The defendants maintained that they were
 addressing conditions outside of Yugoslavia. Similarly,
 authorities have maintained tight control on the area around
 Medjugore, where the Virgin has been alleged to appear.
 Pilgrims, however, are permitted to visit the church and some
 two million have reportedly done so through mid-1983.
 Persons who actively practice religion reportedly do not gain
 access to top party and government jobs; religious
 practicioners do hold some middle or lower level positions, but
 access and career mobility are limited here as well.
 Constraints are imposed on proselytizing activities and
 religious education for children. Seminaries exist for
 training adults as clergymen, but they are taxed, and seminary
 students do not get military deferments. There are no
 rabbinical seminaries. Churches and mosques may be restored
 and new buildings have been erected, sometimes at government
 
 
 1179.
 expense, but religious leaders have persistently complained
 that permits are not readily forthcoming. The complaints of
 religious leaders have been made public from time to time; most
 notably, the semi-official newspaper Borba reported the
 grievances enumerated by the Serbian Orthodox Church at its
 annual synod in May 1983, as well as Patriarch German's
 subsequent meeting with Serbian President Ljubicic to discuss
 the grievances.
 The number of religious publications vastly outnumbers
 publications on Marxism and Leninism. Religious newspapers are
 now being printed and sold in churches and by subscription, but
 the Government does not allow them to be sold in street
 kiosks. Importation of religious literature also is strictly
 controlled. Religious travel, like all foreign travel, is
 freely permitted; many Muslim Yugoslavs have undertaken the
 Haj, and Christian priests and laymen have participated in
 conferences abroad. This year, only 50 Yugoslavs reportedly
 made the pilgrimage to Mecca; in 1982, the number was 500. The
 apparent reason for the decline is the imposition of a foreign
 travel deposit (see Section d, "Freedom of Movement").
 Religious figures from foreign countries have also travelled to
 Yugoslavia for meetings with both the clergy and the laity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed in the
 Constitution. Almost all Yugoslavs are able to travel abroad
 at will. Half of the country's population possesses valid
 passports. Austerity measures introduced by the Federal
 Executive Council in October 1982, still in force, imposed a
 5,000 dinar deposit (approximately US $42 at the current rate
 of exchange), refundable after one year, for travel abroad,
 with the deposit for each subsequent trip per year going up in
 2,000 dinar increments. The deposit is equivalent to about
 one-third of the average monthly wage. This measure has
 reduced significantly the number of Yugoslavs travelling
 abroad, but it has generally been accepted as necessary and
 temporary. Yugoslavs do not need exit permits to travel to
 those countries with which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or
 consular relations. In September 1980, the Yugoslav
 Constitutional Court ruled that the authorities must inform
 citizens, except in what the Government terms "national
 security" cases, of the reasons for denial of a passport. A
 small number of dissidents has been denied passports on
 national security grounds. The weekly magazine "Nin" said in
 July 1982 that 26,000 passports have been denied to date,
 mainly to people with a criminal record.
 The provincial government of the Kosovo has tried to stem the
 continuing migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from this
 predominately Albanian area. Figures made public by the
 Serbian Internal Affairs Secretariat (Kosovo is an autonomous
 province of Serbia) in 1983 revealed that roughly 2,500 Serbs
 and Montenegrins left the Kosovo for Serbia proper in the
 second half of 1982, and Federal Internal Affairs Secretariat
 figures for the first nine months of 1983 show another 2,600
 Serbs and Montenegrins emigrated to other parts of Yugoslavia.
 In an early October interview, Kosovo President Sefcet Jasaric
 said 13,000 Serbs and Montenegrins had left the province since
 March 1981.
 
 
 1180
 The law on the entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia notes the
 right of asylum and provides for government assistance to
 persons granted that right. In cooperation with the office of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Yugoslavia
 has provided temporary assistance to political refugees from
 Eastern Europe who are seeking resettlement in a third
 country. Over 600,000 Yugoslav workers are currently employed
 in Western Europe. There are no restrictions on emigration.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 While the two milliop-member League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 maintains a monopoly on political power, that authority is
 widely dispersed throughout the multinational Yugoslav
 federation. Final authority within the party rests with the
 roughly 160 members of the Central Committee, not the 24-member
 party presidency. Furthermore, the federal party organization
 is not supported by a large bureaucracy, and responsibility for
 implementation of conclusions reached at Central Committee plena
 and party congresses rests with the republican and provincial
 parties. Under the Yugoslav Constitution, holders of high party
 office may not simultaneously hold high governmental office, but
 prominent individuals move back and forth between party and
 Government. Continued exercise of power depends on maintenance
 of a strong base in republican or provincial political
 organizations.
 Governmental authority at the Federal level is exercised by the
 State Presidency, the Federal Executive Council (cabinet) and
 the Federal Assembly. The collective leadership in the
 Presidency, representing each of the republics and provinces,
 rarely exercises its broad powers in public. Most of the daily
 administration of government is conducted by the cabinet, with
 the Federal Assembly, representing the interests of the
 republics and provinces, serving as a counterweight to the
 federal administration.
 Selection to all of these bodies is through a complex delegate
 system. Nominations originate in the party's "mass
 organization," the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of
 Yugoslavia, and proceed through a series of endorsements from
 other "social-political" organizations such as the trade
 unions. Ordinary workers can play an active role in the
 nomination process.
 Only one candidate is nominated for each office, and although
 not all officials are party members, the overwhelming majority
 are. Prior to nomination for high office, the major political
 figures in the republics and provinces appear to negotiate the
 choice of candidates so that the overall process preserves the
 appearance of unity. A system of rotation ensures that all the
 republics and provinces are equally represented at the highest
 echelon.
 Multi-party elections do not exist, although the possibility of
 multiple candidates has been broached. There is dissatisfaction
 with the delegate system, particularly as a means to choose
 delegates to the Federal chamber of the Assembly, and discussion
 of some changes has begun.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Yugoslav Government has shown a willingness to discuss and
 raise general questions of human rights in international forums,
 
 
 1181
 including meetings of the non-aligned countries and the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe review
 meetings. It remains sensitive to charges of human rights
 violations within Yugoslavia, although it has permitted Amnesty
 International visits. The United Nation's Economic and Social
 Council (UNESCO) Committee on Conventions and Recommendations
 (Human Rights) also has discussed Yugoslav cases, with the
 participation of the Yugoslav delegation.
 Amnesty International's 1983 Report for Yugoslavia cites its
 concern about detention and imprisonment of political prisoners
 and various charges of ill-treatment during pre-trial detention,
 unfair trials, poor conditions in some prisons, and use of the
 death penalty. It also issued a special report in February 1983
 entitled "Yugoslavia. Prisoners of Conscience."
 Freedom House rates Yugoslavia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Yugoslavia in 1983 was approximately
 22,826,000, with an annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. Personal
 income is fairly evenly distributed, and per capita income in
 1981 was $3,344.90. The significant variation that exists in
 per capita income levels between the various republics stems
 from historic, regional, and natural resource differences. Life
 expectancy at birth in 1980 was 70.45 years, and in 1983 the
 infant mortality rate was 30.7 per 1,000. There is an extensive,
 system of social security and other benefits for those who are
 old, disabled, or without employment. The Government pays for
 children's allowances and provides a system of day-care
 nurseries for working mothers.
 In 1983, the Yugoslav economy continued to suffer from a foreign
 liquidity crisis as a result of excessive foreign borrowing in
 previous years, and the Government adopted a long-term program
 of economic stabilization designed to reorient the economy
 toward more competitive exports and more rational internal
 organization. Inflation, due in part to costly energy imports
 as well as to widespread wage and salary hikes in excess of
 productivity increases, has not been brought under control. The
 average Yugoslav experienced a continued decline in his living
 standard during 1983.
 The Yugoslav economy is decentralized, with a high degree of
 autonomy at the republic and local level. Yugoslavia limits the
 individual's right to accumulate personal property for private
 use. Farmers may own up to ten hectares (approximately 25
 acres) of tillable land plus ten hectares of mountainous terrain
 as pastureage.
 The 1974 Constitution spells out a complicated system for
 organization of business enterprises. In theory, the means of
 production are owned by the society as a whole and entrusted to
 the workers, organized in enterprise-level workers' councils.
 In practice, it appears that workers' councils exert significant
 influence over the choice of management of enterprises, their
 broad policies, and distribution of enterprise income. There
 are no business enterprises owned and operated directly by the
 state, with the possible exception of some defense-related
 establishments and agricultural research stations.

 The "right to education" is guaranteed to all Yugoslav citizens,
 as is schooling in the languages of the various Yugoslav
 peoples. The adult literacy rate is 85 percent, and the 1979
 primary school enrollment ratio was 99 percent. There is little
 discrimination in the Yugoslav educational system based on
 family or political background.
 The Constitution charges state authorities at all levels with
 protecting the cultural rights of the "peoples." and
 "nationalities" of Yugoslavia. The use of the major local
 language is required in official communication between Belgrade
 and the various republics, and local languages also are used in
 the schools, courts, and local media. Each citizen has the
 right to address the courts and government agencies in his own
 language. Some discrimination continues, however, particularly
 against ethnic Albanians and gypsies, despite Federal policy.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens regardless
 of sex. The Government consistently has supported this concept
 through measures designed to improve the status of women,
 including provision of equal access to education, professional
 status, and equality of pay, and support for working mothers in
 the form of day-care centers and maternity leave. The main
 problems of equal treatment of the sexes occur in those areas of
 the country where economic development has lagged or where
 traditional Balkan attitudes about female roles persist.
 Women are represented in most walks of life, including
 government positions, and receive equal pay for equal work.
 Woman are, however, underrepresented in high-level government
 and management positions. Yugoslavia generally remains a
 male-dominated and male-oriented country with women having
 limited access to top positions in the party, Government or
 business. The present Prime Minister, Milka Planinc, a woman,
 is an important exception to this general rule.
