 MARSHALL ISLANDS
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands, a self-governing nation under the Compact
 of Free Association with the United States, is composed of 34 atolls in the central
 Pacific, with a total land area of about 70 square miles. The approximately 56,000
 inhabitants are of Micronesian origin and concentrated primarily on Majuro and
 Kwajalein atolls.
 The Constitution provides for free and fair elections, executive and legislative
 branches, and an independent judiciary. The legislature consists of the Nitijela, a
 33-member Parliament, and a Council of Chiefs (Iroij), which serves a largely con-
 sultative function dealing with custom and traditional practice. The President is
 elected by majority Nitijela vote and he appoints his Cabinet from its membership.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security, and the Marshall Islands has no external security force
 of its own. The national and local police forces have responsibility for internal secu-
 rity. These agencies honor constitutional and legal civil rights protections in execut-
 ing their responsibilities.
 The economy depends mainly on transfer payments from the United States. Coco-
 nut oil and copra exports, a small amount of tourism, and the fishing industry gen-
 erate limited revenues.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, but its influence
 leads to occasional instances of media self-censorship in sensitive political or cul-
 tural areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly forbids such practices, and there were no reports that
 officials employed them. Prison conditions, while Spartan, meet minimal inter-
 national standards. The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 trial, and the Government generally respects this right.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary. However, the Government
 has injected itself into judicial matters. The President assumed and retained the
 Ministry of Justice portfolio following his January reelection until his death on De-
 cember 20. The Acting President has now assumed the Justice portfolio. Govern-
 ment interest in an allegedly improper probate procedure involving the relative of
 an influential local leader led to the resignations of the Chief Justices of both the
 Supreme Court and the High Court. In another action, legislation, followed by direct
 instructions from the Cabinet, caused the Attorney General to remove from the So-
 
 
 726
 cial Security Administration a private counsel who had upset influential individuals
 by his efforts to collect outstanding debts from them. In a further action, the legisla-
 ture passed a bill denying the application of certain foreign court money judgment
 decisions in the Marshall Islands.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from such practices, government authorities re-
 spect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally honors these rights in practice. How-
 ever, government influence leads to occasional self-censorship by the media in areas
 of political or cultural sensitivity. There are four operating radio stations, one gov-
 ernment owned and three privately owned, including one owned by a prominent
 member of the opposition. There is a cable television company which normally
 shows US. programming but occasionally covers local events. Me cable company is
 owned and operated by members of the political opposition.
 A U.S. citizen and longtime resident operates the country's sole privately owned
 newspaper. The editor and two reporters are U.S. citizens as well.
 The Government publishes a monthly gazette containing official news and notices
 only
 Rne Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and this is observed in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigratin, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 There are no recent reports of refugees. The Government has not formulated a
 policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage for citizens 18 years of age and older. The
 Government is chosen by secret ballot in free and open elections every 4 years.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties, although political ac-
 tivity by foreigners is prohibited. Until his death in December, the country had the
 same President since 1979 due primarily to traditional loyalties and concentrated
 political influence. The election of a new President took place January 14, 1997.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. Two women hold deputy minister positions. The mayor of Majuro, the country's
 capital and principal urban center, also is a woman. Society is matrilineal, and
 those men and women who exercise traditional leadership and land ownership pow-
 ers base their rights either on their own positions in the family, or on relationships
 deriving from their mother's and sister's lineage. Although women have an increas-
 ing role in government, their cultural responsibilities and roles are not seen to be
 managerial or executive in nature, and they remain underrepresented in Parliament
 and other government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations have been formed. No international human rights organization has ex-
 pressed interest or concern or visited the country.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, lan-
 guage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, place of birth,
 family status or descent, and the Government respects these provisions.
 Women.-There are allegations of violence against women, mainly related to do-
 mestic abuse. Wife beating is not condoned in society, and most assaults occur while
 the assailant is under the influence of alcohol. The Government's health office ad-
 vises that few such cases are reported to the authorities, but many more are be-
 lieved to go unreported. Assault is a criminal offense, but women involved in domes-
 
 
 tic violence are reluctant to prosecute spouses in the court system, and disputes are
 usually resolved through traditional methods involving apology and reparation to
 the members of the aggrieved party's family. Women's groups have been formed to
 publicize women's issues and to create a greater awareness of the rights of women.
 Violence against women outside the family is not considered a growing problem, al-
 though women in the urban centers would assume a risk by going out alone after
 dark.
 Inheritance of property and of traditional rank is matrilineal, with women occupy-
 ing positions of importance within the traditional system. No instances of unequal
 pay for equal work or sex-related job discrimination were reported.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through its pro-
 grams of health care and education, but these have not been adequate to meet the
 needs of the country's sharply increasing population. Marshall Islands is working
 to incorporate the provisions of the Convention of the Rights of the Child into law.
 The Domestic Relations Amendment of 1993 defines child abuse and neglect and
 makes them criminal offenses. Other legislation requires teachers, caregivers, and
 other persons to report instances of child abuse and exempts them from civil or
 criminal liability as a consequence of making such a report. Child abuse is thought
 to be neither common, widespread, nor a growing problem, and there have been few
 child abuse prosecutions.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no apparent discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. There
 are no building codes, and there is no legislation mandating access for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of free asso-
 ciation in general, and the Government interprets this right as allowing the exist-
 ence of labor unions, although none has been formed to date. The Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, and the Government has not addressed this issue.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation con-
 cerning collective bargaining or trade union organization. However, there are no im-
 pediments to the organization of trade unions or to collective bargaining. Wages in
 the cash economy are determined by market factors in accordance with the mini-
 mum wage and other laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits invol-
 untary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law does not prohibit the em-
 ployment of children. Children are not typically employed in the wage economy, but
 some assist their families with fishing, agriculture, and other small-scale domestic
 enterprises. The law requires compulsory education for children from 6 to 14 years
 of age; but the Government does not enforce this law due to a lack of classrooms
 and teachers. There is no law or regulation setting a minimum age for employment
 of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a government-specified minimum
 wage established by law, and it is adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in this subsistence economy where extended families are expected to help less fortu-
 nate members. The minimum wage for all government and private sector employees
 is $2.00 per hour. (The U.S. dollar is the local currency.) The Ministry of Resources
 and Development oversees minimum wage regulations, and its oversight has been
 deemed adequate. Foreign employees and Marshallese trainees of private employers
 who have invested in or established a business in the country are exempt from mini-
 mum wage requirements. This exemption does not affect a significant segment of
 the work force.
 There is no legislation concerning maximum hours of work or occupational safety
 and health. Most businesses are closed and people generally refrain from work on
 Sunday.
 A government labor office makes recommendations to the Nitijela on working con-
 ditions, i.e., minimum wage, legal working hours and overtime payments, and occu-
 pational health and safety standards in accordance with International Labor Orga-
 nization conventions. The office periodically convenes board meetings that are open
 to the public. There is no legislation specifically giving workers the right to remove
 themselves from situations which endanger their health or safety without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and there is no legislation protecting workers who
 file complaints about such conditions.
