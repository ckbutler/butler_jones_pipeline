 INDIA
 India, the world's largest democracy, is a secular republic
 with a multiparty political structure based on Indian political
 traditions and aspects of the British parliamentary system.
 Free elections are held regularly at national and state
 levels. National elections in May and June were forced by the
 resignation in March of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, who had
 come to power in November 1990 at the head of a splinter group
 from the Janata Dal, supported from the outside by the Congress
 (I) Party. Following polling in all states except Punjab and
 Jammu and Kashmir, the Congress (I) formed a minority
 Government headed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. On the
 state level, President's Rule (direct rule from New Delhi)
 remained.in force throughout the year in the states of Punjab
 and Jammu and Kashmir. It was lifted in Assam on June 30,
 following the installation of a democratically elected state
 government.
 The 25 states have the primary role in maintaining law and
 order, but both in law and practice the central Government is
 responsible for protecting the fundamental rights guaranteed
 under the Constitution. The internal security apparatus
 combines national and state-controlled paramilitary and police
 forces. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs controls the
 nationwide Indian police force, the paramilitary forces, and
 the intelligence bureaus. Over the four decades since India's
 independence, control of law and order operations has become
 increasingly centralized under the Home Ministry. This
 tendency stems in part from the rapid growth of the
 intelligence bureaus, which function with little reference to
 the state governments, and in part from the increased use of
 paramilitary forces against armed insurrectionists in disturbed
 areas. These forces are deployed in Kashmir, Punjab, and the
 northeastern states. Both the paramilitary and the police
 forces have been responsible for significant human rights
 abuses. Ultimately, abuses by the paramilitary and police are
 questions of the effectiveness of civilian oversight and the
 extent of the Government's willingness and ability to prosecute
 offenders vigorously.
 India has a mixed economy, with agriculture, most nonfinancial
 services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy industry
 in the private sector. India's economic policies pursued over
 the past four decades-rapid industrialization, massive state
 intervention, subsidies to middle class consumption, tax
 exemptions for large landholders, barriers to foreign and
 domestic competition--skewed the distribution of income and
 wealth. In July the Congress (I) Government began structural
 reforms. Trade and foreign investment restrictions were
 relaxed, foreign exchange controls were being phased out, and
 the government deficit was being brought under control.
 India's economic problems were compounded by rapid population
 growth (863 million, growing by over 2 percent per year).
 About 40 percent of th6 urban and 51 percent of the rural
 population live below the poverty level as defined by the World
 Bank.
 India is a functioning democracy with strong and legally
 sanctioned safeguards for individuals and an independent
 judiciary. A vigorous free press and active civil liberties
 organizations report extensively on human rights abuses
 throughout the country. Nonetheless, significant areas of
 abuse remain, many of them generated by severe social tensions
 related to violent ethnic, caste, communal, and secessionist
 politics and the authorities' reactions thereto. The catalog
 
 
 1389
 INDIA
 of the main problem areas in 1991 varied little from what it
 has been in past years, and included: security force excesses
 against civilians, particularly in Kashmir in response to
 attacks by militants; political murder, kidnaping, and
 extortion by militants in Punjab, as well as extrajudicial
 actions (beatings, extortion, and "fake encounter" killings) by
 the police; incommunicado detention for prolonged periods
 without charge under national security legislation; political
 killing on an increasingly wide scale; torture, rape, and
 deaths of suspects in police custody; inadequate prosecution of
 police and security forces implicated in abuse of detainees;
 widespread intercaste and communal violence; uneven
 implementation of laws affecting women's rights; infrequent
 prosecution of "dowry deaths" (wife murder); and widespread
 exploitation of indentured, bonded, and child labor.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Government continued to follow strict law and order
 policies to control growing'political and terrorist violence,
 particularly militant separatist activity in the states of
 Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Assam, as well as violence
 resulting from widespread tensions over religion, politics, and
 caste. Nevertheless, there was no reduction in'the scale of
 political killing. Some killings result from ethnic and
 communal strife, some from separatist militant activity. Some
 can be attributed to excesses by individual security force
 members in encounters with terrorists, while in some cases
 government security forces have killed civilians in apparent
 retaliation for terrorist attacks; some can be attributed to
 extrajudicial actions taken by security and police forces
 against prisoners in detention. Little is done to punish those
 responsible for extrajudicial killing.
 In Jammu and Kashmir state, militant groups seeking Kashmiri
 independence continued to carry out politically motivated
 killings, targeting government and police officials (and their
 families), alleged police informers, members of the press, and
 members of rival factions. Among the victims were K.M. Shaban,
 editor of Al-Safa, an Urdu-language newspaper; Ghulam Mustafa
 Malik, a former state legislator; Hissamuddin Bandey, a former
 state minister, and Sheikh'Sadiq, cousin of the former chief
 minister, Farooq Abdullah. Under the Jammu and Kashmir
 Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir)
 Special Powers Act, both passed in July 1990, security force
 personnel have sweeping powers, including authority to shoot to
 kill suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace and to
 destroy structures suspected of harboring militants or arms.
 In Punjab, militant Sikh organizations targeted civil servants,
 political candidates, journalists, presumed government
 informers, and police officials (and their families), and
 undertook random killings against public figures. The nine
 principal militant groups claimed their terrorist activities
 were part of the struggle for an independent Sikh state
 "Khalistan." Twenty-three candidates for state and national
 office in Punjab were killed by militants during the spring
 election campaign. Among other militant killings, on January
 28 militants stopped traffic on the road leading to Bhikowal,
 identified 13 Hindus, and shot them. On March 22, militants
 
 
 1390
 INDIA
 stopped a bus carrying factory workers in Ropar district and
 shot 30 passengers, killing 27. On June 15, gunmen entered two
 trains near Ludhiana and fired indiscriminately, killing 75.
 Four moving trains were fired at.by militants in early
 September, killing six. In September and October, militants
 targeted relatives of police officials, killing 86 in less then
 a month.
 Human rights organizations have documented hundreds of cases of
 "encounter killings," in Punjab in the past 7 years. In the
 typical scenario, police take into custody suspected militants
 or militant supporters without filing an arrest report. If the
 detainee dies during interrogation or is executed, officials
 deny that he was ever in custody and claim he died during an
 armed encounter with police or security forces. The Armed
 Forces (Punjab and Chandigarh) Special Powers Act of 1983 and
 the Punjab Disturbed Areas Act of 1983 grants army,
 paramilitary, and police members wide discretion in the use of
 lethal force, thus permitting easy justification by authorities
 for encounter killings.
 In Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), a highly publicized encounter killing
 of Sikhs took place on July 12 when police stopped a bus near
 Pilibhit, carrying 27 Sikhs on a pilgrimage to holy places.
 According to investigations carried out by human rights
 organizations and political parties, police ordered 11 men into
 police vehicles. The next day 10 of the men were.split into 3
 groups and executed. Police claimed the Sikhs were militants
 killed in armed encounters. On August 21, a judicial panel,
 headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice Misra, ordered the U.P.
 state government to pay compensation to the families of the
 victims. A further judicial inquiry into the matter was still
 under way as of year's end.
 In Andhra Pradesh, credible reports indicate that a large
 number of Naxalites (tribal militants using violence to bring
 about radical land reform and other populist policies) were
 also killed in fake encounter killings in 1991.
 In Assam, the law and order situation had deteriorated to a
 point where President's Rule was imposed on November 28, 1990.
 The terrorist organization, United Liberation Front of Assam
 (ULFA), had been responsible for killing an increasing number
 of politicians, police officials, businessmen, and innocent
 civilians over a 2-year period. With the imposition of
 President's Rule, the army commenced operations to restore law
 and order under the code name Operation Bajrang. The operation
 was suspended in April and terminated in mid-June, at the time
 of elections. On September 15, the army once again moved
 against ULFA, under the code name Operation Rhino, following a
 summer of ULFA kidnapings, killings, and extortion carried out
 despite the state government's offer of a general amnesty and
 release of over 400 of the ULFA prisoners detained during
 Operation Bajrang. Under the Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed
 Forces Special Powers Act for Assam, the army and security
 forces Were given wide discretion for the use of lethal force.
 opposition parties claimed that the army killed at least seven
 innocent civilians during its actions against ULFA. The army
 denied these charges.
 Violence surrounding the nationwide May/June election campaign
 resulted in at least 150 deaths. Thirty-four candidates were
 assassinated (23 in Punjab alone). Former Prime Minister Rajiv
 Gandhi was assassinated while campaigning in Tamil Nadu on May
 21. The assassin, who also died from the explosives wrapped
 
 
 1391
 INDIA
 around her waist, and her accomplices were believed to be
 members of supporters of the Sri Lankan Tamil separatist
 movement, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The
 remaining deaths were primarily the result of clashes between
 supporters of rival political parties.
 In West Bengal, the Border Security Force (BSF) reportedly
 fired indiscriminately on March 17 on villagers who had locked
 up BSF members in protest against inaction regarding the theft
 of cattle. Eleven people were killed. One local politician
 was killed in June when, in a settling of scores following
 elections, approximately 100 supporters of the Communist Party
 of India (Marxist), wielding swords and axes, attacked local
 Congress (I) politicians and supporters in Kendua village, West
 Bengal.
 According to the Home Ministry, 158 people were killed in the
 first 6 months of 1991 in riots sparked by either tension
 between different religious groups or disputes between rival
 villages or castes. At least 51 passengers were massacred by
 militants who boarded a train in Ludhiana district on December
 26 and fired indiscriminately.
 b. Disappearance
 Reports of disappearance are extremely difficult to verify,
 particularly in Punjab, Kashmir, and Assam.
 Militants in Kashmir increasingly used kidnaping both of
 prominent Indians and foreigners to attract international
 attention to their cause and to force the Government to release
 militants in detention. They have also kidnaped security force
 personnel. Most of those kidnaped were eventually released,
 but several subsequently were killed and some are still being
 held. Kidnapings were also common in Assam and Andhra Pradesh.
 c. Torture and-Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel treatment or punishment are prohibited by
 law, and confessions or information extracted by force may not
 be admitted in court. Significantly, however, under Section 15
 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
 (TADA), a confession made to a police officer is admissible as
 evidence, provided the police have "reason to believe that it
 is being made voluntarily." Press accounts and reports by
 human rights groups indicate that police brutality under this
 law both to extract confessions and for extortion is common.
 In theory, citizens may lodge a complaint for assault, wrongful
 confinement, and death in custody, but in many jurisdictions,
 including Delhi, prosecution of policemen requires the
 permission of the police hierarchy. In the case of a death in
 police custody, magistrates are empowered by sections of the
 criminal procedure code to hold inquiries; however, such
 inquiries may be conducted by an executive, not a judicial,
 magistrate, and the results of these inquiries are generally
 not made available. Human rights groups say most abuses in
 prisons and jails are directed at the poor and uneducated
 castes, who are unlikely to understand their right of redress.
 Members of the police have been disciplined for abuse of
 detainees, though civil liberties groups say punishment is
 usually light (suspension or transfer) and occurs only in a
 small percentage of actual cases of abuse. Among these few
 
 
 1392
 INDIA
 cases, eight Delhi policemen were arrested and charged and
 three others suspended for involvement in five deaths in
 custody between January and August. As of year's end, the
 cases had not come to trial. Three other members of the Delhi
 police were suspended in August in relation to the beating of a
 woman in detention. A policeman in Narasinghpur, Madhya
 Pradesh, was suspended on September 21, pending trial for
 alleged involvement in the rape of a tribal woman in July.
 Members of the Bombay police were suspended for their
 involvement in the sexual abuse of a woman in February.
 Numerous Indian human rights groups have detailed cases of
 torture during interrogation by security forces in Kashmir and,
 Punjab, including beatings, burning with cigarettes, suspension
 by the feet, and electric shocks. Under the special powers
 given to the security forces (see Section l.d.), they are not
 liable for prosecution for their actions in civil courts,
 leaving victims no legal forum for the redress of grievances
 other than courts-martial. Army and security force authorities
 reportedly have, in some cases, court-martialed or disciplined
 members found guilty of torture, but the results of these
 actions generally have not been made public and cannot be
 confirmed.
 Press and human rights groups regularly report on torture in
 Punjab as well. Such abuse most often takes place in police
 stations during interrogations, though there have been numerous
 reports of police going into villages and beating groups of
 male residents and raping women.
 Political parties and student and civil liberties groups
 accused the army, paramilitary, and police forces in Assam,
 which had arrested several thousand suspected ULFA militants
 and sympathizers during Operation Bajrang, of torturing many of
 these detainees. There were also accusations of numerous rapes
 during the operation. The army denied specific charges but
 maintained that when personnel had been found guilty of
 wrongdoing, they had been punished. It did not disclose
 individual cases or the punishment administered.
 Scheduled castes and tribes (Harijans, or untouchables) remain
 particularly vulnerable to police violence. There were
 consistent reports that police, usually drawn from the upper
 castes, had deliberately targeted members of these castes for
 beatings and rape.
 Press reports about prison conditions also include charges of
 sexual abuse-of prisoners, the use of prisoners by prison
 officials for domestic labor, the sale on the black market of
 food and milk meant for prisoners, and the sale of women
 prisoners to brothels. Women constitute 2 to 6 percent of the
 total prison population, according to the 1987 Justice Krishna
 Iyer report, which also noted that cells are seldom
 segregated. It was only after a female inmate had been raped
 in custody that she could be transferred to a cell staffed by
 women, the report continued.
 At least 20,000 children and youngsters under 18 years old are
 reported to be in jail, comprising nearly one-eighth of the
 prison population. Although Parliament passed the Children's
 Law in 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and
 exploitation, most states have not followed with their own laws
 to implement it; consequently, nearly 40 percent of the 380
 districts in India are without a children's law. The Supreme
 Court has criticized the states for not providing separate
 
 
 1393
 INDIA
 facilities for children in jails and for not constructing
 reformatory institutions.
 It is estimated that at least 10,000 people with mental
 disorders who have committed no crimes are held in prisons
 throughout India. In West Bengal, a state minister reported
 there were 1,000 such persons being held in Calcutta jails
 alone.
 Three classes of Indian prison facilities exist. Class "C"
 cells are the worst. They often have dirt floors, no
 furnishings, poor quality food, are overcrowded, and the use of
 handcuffs and fetters is common. Prisoners in these cells
 reportedly suffer the most abuse, such as beatings and being
 forced to kneel for long periods. Prisoners are designated
 class "C," not based on the nature or severity of the crimes
 involved, but on their standing in society--those who cannot
 prove they are either college graduates or income taxpayers
 when they come before the magistrate are designated class "C."
 Class "B" cells are for college graduates and taxpayers.
 Crowding is less of a problem in "B" cells, and the food and
 treatment of prisoners are reportedly better than in class
 "C." Class "A" cells are for "prominent persons," as
 determined by the Government. Prisoners in these cells are
 accorded private rooms, visits, and adequate food, which may be
 supplemented by their families. Very few prisons actually
 maintain class "A" cells; class "A" prisoners are usually held
 in government guest houses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite legal safeguards, there continued to be credible
 reports of widespread arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 Constitution requires that an arrested person be informed of
 the grounds for arrest, given the right to be represented by
 counsel, and produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of
 arrest. At this initial appearance; the accused must either be
 remanded for further investigation or released. These
 provisions have been upheld by the Supreme Court and are
 generally respected in states and areas not experiencing an
 internal security problem or insurgency. However, they do not
 apply to persons arrested under national security laws and,
 while the right to judicial determination of the legality of
 the detention may be sought from the higher courts to redress
 unlawful detention, these rights are often unavailable to
 families of poor or uneducated victims. These rights are also
 ignored occasionally in states and areas that are not
 disturbed; see Section 2.a. for a discussion of the case of an
 editor of a Hindi daily who was arrested on charges of sedition
 and who reportedly was not produced before a magistrate
 following his arrest.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws in the event of threats to public welfare and national
 security. Such laws provide for limits on the length of
 detention (up to 2 years) and for judicial review of such
 detention. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA) permits detention of persons
 considered security risks; police anywhere in India (except
 Kashmir) may charge suspects under NSA provisions. At year's
 end, 21 of 25 state governments had invoked the NSA. The Jammu
 and Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978, provides corresponding
 procedures for that state. To be released from detention under
 this law, a court must determine that all grounds for detention
 
 
 1394
 INDIA
 are invalid. NSA detainees are permitted visits by family
 members and lawyers. Under NSA's strict provisions for special
 and preventive detention, a person may be detained for up to 1
 year without charge or trial (2 years in Punjab) on loosely
 defined security grounds but must be brought before a Defense
 Ministry advisory board within 7 days of arrest. At this time
 the detainee may be released on the basis of "insufficient
 grounds." According to government statistics, 1,101 people
 were detained under the provisions of the NSA in 1991; 501 were
 subsequently released, leaving 600 in custody. Human rights
 groups claim, however, that no accurate record is kept of the
 many people held without charges on nonsecurity grounds, so
 they have no way of making accurate estimates of the number of
 persons in detention.
 The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
 (TADA), though enacted to fight terrorism in Punjab, is
 applicable in all states. At years end, 16 of 25 state
 governments had invoked the TADA. On August 12, Parliament
 voted to extend the Act for an additional 2 years. The law was
 promulgated to punish those found guilty of terrorist and
 disruptive acts with no less than 5 years imprisonment and up
 to the death penalty for certain terrorist crimes. Disruptive
 activities include speech or actions that disrupt or challenge
 the sovereignty or territorial integrity of India. In
 designated areas, pursuant to the TADA, incommunicado detention
 is permitted. The Act permits maximum detention of 2 years,
 but it provides the right of review and access to legal counsel.
 It is difficult to determine how many people are held
 throughout India at any one time under the TADA. Civil
 liberties organizations often use a figure of 35,000, including
 approximately 10,000 in both Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir,
 5,000 in Tamil Nadu, 3,000 in Gujarat, and 1,000 in Assam. The
 Government said such figures are greatly exaggerated. The Home
 Ministry claimed that, since its inception in 1985, only 37,533
 people had been arrested under the TADA; of these, 26,533 had
 been released on bail and 318 had been convicted. According to
 the Government's figures, 10,687 were still being detained
 under the Act.
 There were widespread accusations that the Act was being
 misused in states not experiencing civil unrest as a convenient
 way to hold people without trial. In Gujarat, since the Act
 was invoked in 1987, over 10,000 people had been arrested under
 its provisions, primarily as a result of communal
 disturbances. Civil liberties groups claimed many of these had
 been innocent bystanders; they also accused the police of
 having used the law disproportionately against Muslims. In
 Madhya Pradesh, police arrested over 100 members of tribal
 communities under the TADA for communal disturbances.
 Several court decisions overturning detention of persons under
 the TADA in the state of Maharashtra reflected the view that
 the police there were using the TADA to detain people they
 could not btherwise legally detain.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 India's legal procedures generally assure a fair trial, but the
 process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor.
 Defendants have the right to choose counsel from an Indian bar
 that is fully independent of the Government. The Indian bar
 
 
 1395
 INDIA
 has a record of vigorously protesting infringements of human
 rights. Effective appeal channels exist at all levels of the
 judicial.system.
 The Indian Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial
 in most cases but under certain circumstances it allows
 significant exceptions, including in proceedings involving
 official secrets, trials in which statements prejudicial to the
 safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of
 national security legislation such as the TADA. Sentences
 must, however, be announced in public.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive branch. Judges
 are selected by the Law Ministry following consultations with
 the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Islamic religious law
 governs some noncriminal matters concerning Muslims, including
 divorce. The Government's declared policy is not to interfere
 in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the
 effect that discriminatory personal laws, often against women,
 are upheld.
 The Terrorist Affected Areas (Special Courts) Act of Parliament
 (TAAA) permits the establishment of special courts sitting in
 camera and allows the identity of witnesses testifying before a
 special court to be kept secret. Under an unusual provision of
 the TAAA, a defendant charged with "waging war" carries the
 burden of proving his or her innocence. Civil rights groups
 charge that these special rules are contrary to the presumption
 of innocence customary in Indian law.
 In Kashmir and Punjab, where armed militants demand
 independence for their states, the legal system barely
 functioned. There were no convictions of alleged terrorists in
 these states, even though some militants had been in detention
 for years. Intimidation by militants also prevented the
 judicial system from functioning normally. Judges were
 reportedly reluctant to sit, and witnesses often did not appear
 for trials involvingsuspected terrorists.
 According to November press reports, 17 of 22 detainees in West
 Bengal who had been held without trial for up to 10 years on
 charges of terrorist activities have been released. Four
 others are expected to be released shortly. One other has been
 tried and convicted of a terrorist crime and is serving a long
 jail sentence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Indian law, warrants are normally required for seafches
 and seizures. In a criminal investigation, police may conduct
 searches without a warrant if obtaining one would cause undue
 delay, but they must justify such searches in writing to a
 member of the senior executive police administration. Under
 the Disturbed Areas Legislation in Assam, Punjab, and Jammu and
 Kashmir, the authorities continue to have special powers to
 search and arrest without a warrant and to shoot to kill
 suspected lawbreakers or disturbers of the peace.
 Surveillance of communications, including tapping of telephones
 and intercepting personal mail, is authorized under the Indian
 Telegraph Act "on the occurrence of any public emergency or in
 the interest of the public safety or tranquility." Various
 members of the Parliament exchanged.allegations that their
 opponents, when in power, had used telephone tapping for
 
 
 1396
 INDIA
 political purposes. In Tamil Nadu, the press and the
 opposition Dravida Munetra Kazhagam (DMK) party accused the
 state's Chief Minister Jayalalitha of ordering the bugging of
 opposition politicians' telephones. The Postal (Amendment)
 Bill empowers the Government to censor mail in certain
 circumstances, such as in a public emergency. These powers
 have been used by every state government against specific
 persons.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only
 Muslim-majority state, further deteriorated in 1991. The
 Muslim population in Kashmir valley was increasingly alienated
 from India and largely sympathized with the demands of armed
 militants for Kashmiri self-determination. Approximately
 400,000 Indian army and paramilitary forces remained in the
 valley to maintain law and order and check the militant
 separatist movement. The Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act
 and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act
 strengthened the hand of the security forces in using force
 against suspected terrorists; some human rights observers
 criticized the Act for giving too much latitude to these
 forces. A compilation of statistics drawn from press accounts
 indicates killings in Kashmir during 1991 totaled approximately
 2,360, including 900 civilians, 1,305 alleged militants, and
 155 security force members.
 Militants maintained a reign of terror in the valley throughout
 the year, targeting security force personnel, supposed police
 informers, and others perceived as opposing their cause.
 Invariably innocent civilians were caught up in the violence.
 Militants routinely planted bombs in and around military and
 paramilitary installations, as well as at bridges and
 communications targets. Militant groups kidnaped government
 officials, foreigners, and family members of prominent
 politicians and businessmen, killing some of them. They also
 carried out extortion and protection rackets. (See also
 Sections l.a, l.b., and 2.a.)
 Security forces used excessive force against mass gatherings or
 in retaliation against attacks on them by armed militants. On
 January 19, at least 12 civilians were killed and at least as
 many were injured when security forces fired on passers-by in
 the crowded Magharmal Bagh Area of Srinagar following a grenade
 attack on their vehicle. On May 8, security forces fired on a
 funeral procession in Srinagar, killing 16 mourners.
 Twenty-five civilians were killed by security forces at Chota
 Bazaar in Srinagar on June 11, reportedly in retaliation for an
 earlier ambush by militants in which a security force member
 was killed. (See also sections l.c. and l.d.)
 Government officials admitted that excesses by security forces
 took place. They claimed that guilty parties were disciplined,
 though the'cases involved and the punishment administered were
 not made public. As of mid-October, a court-martial was still
 under way in the case of two members of the elite "Black Cat"
 National Security Guards accused of raping a Canadian tourist
 in Kashmir in 1990.
 According to initial press reports, between 23 and 40 women
 were raped when an army unit conducted a cordon and search
 operation in the village of Kunan Poshpora in Kupwara District,
 
 
 1397.
 INDIA
 Kashmir, on the night of February 23/24. The district
 magistrate for Kupwara reported that 23 women had been raped.
 According to the Home Ministry, an investigation by the
 Divisional Commissioner of Kashmir, along with an army officer,
 a Border Security Force officer, the Deputy Commissioner, and
 the Superintendent of Police had concluded that the charges
 against the army were unfounded. A team from the Press Council
 of India (see Section 2.a.), headed by a respected journalist,
 visited Kupwara and--citing a lack of credible evidence--
 concluded the incident was an "invention." However, human
 rights activists and most independent observers who visited the
 site and interviewed the alleged victims concluded that-
 multiple rapes had taken place.
 Most ceitral security forces in Kashmir are non-Muslims; the
 state police in Kashmir-mostly Muslim-were relegated to the
 sidelines because of suspicion of its loyalties.
 According to the Home Ministry, over 72,000 families, primarily
 Hindu, had fled the violence in the valley since the beginning
 of 1990. Two-thirds of them had moved to the Jammu region,
 with another quarter going to Delhi.
 In Punjab, the intractable problems of ethnic strife, violent
 activity by militants defanding a separate Sikh state,
 lawlessness, and actions by the police and security forces
 pushed the number of deaths to 5,890 for the year, according to
 press reports. These numbers included 3,340 civilians, 2,150
 alleged militants, 375 security force members, and 25 persons
 the Government claims crossed intb India from Pakistan to
 perpetrate terrorist acts in Punjab.
 Twelve persons were killed and many injured on June 2 when
 police opened fire on workers protesting the sale of the
 state-owned Uttar Pradesh Dalla-Cement-Factory to a private
 entrepreneur. Human rights and trade union activists charged
 that the firing was a direct result of collusion between the
 state government and management. The state government'ordered
 an inquiry into the incident.
 In Bihar, at least 14 Harijans (untouchables) were killed on
 June 23, allegedly by persons hired by upper-caste landlords in
 retaliation for the killing of three upper-caste persons
 charged with carrying out a massacre of 22 Harijan political
 supporters in 1989.
 In Karnataka, 17 people were killed when police fired on
 protesters on December 14. The crowd was protesting a central
 government decision on water rights to the Cauvery River.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and expression are protected by the Constitution,
 and newspapers vigorously reflect a variety of public, social,
 and economic beliefs. Several major national publications
 regularly publish investigative reports and allegations of
 government wrongdoing, and the press as a whole champions human
 rights causes and criticizes perceived government lapses.
 Civil liberties groups argue this is not the case in disturbed
 areas, such as Punjab and Kashmir. They claim press reports
 generally are based on official government statements, and do
 not focus adequately on abuses by government forces in these
 areas. One common accusation is that the Government, through
 
 
 1398
 INDIA
 its control of the allocation of newsprint, as well as the
 placement of government and public sector advertisements,
 exerts unfair influence over the press.
 Even in areas not considered disturbed, legal protections
 against arbitrary detention can be ignored. Rajendra Baid,
 editor of a Siliguri Hindi daily, reportedly was detained in
 Sikkim in November on charges of sedition for having allowed
 his press to print pamphlets allegedly defaming Sikkim's Chief
 Minister. Baid said that he had not appeared before any
 magistrate following his arrest and that he had been hit and
 kicked by Sikkim police after his detention.
 The Press Council of India is an independent board of
 journalists, with the director (in 1991 a retired Supreme Court
 justice) appointed by the Government. Designed to be a
 self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates
 complaints of irresponsible journalism and sets a code of
 conduct for publishers. This code recommends against
 publishing articles which might incite caste or communal
 violence. Council findings carry no legal weight, though it
 publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes to
 have broken the code of conduct. Many journalists complain
 that the Council's actions promote self-censorship, resulting
 in a chilling effect on investigative reporting. Under the
 Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict
 publication of sensitive security stories, but this is
 sometimes interpreted quite broadly to suppress criticism of
 government policies.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies,
 are frequently accused of manipulating the news to the benefit
 of the Government. The Broadcasting Corporation of India,
 proposed by an act of Parliament in 1990, was intended to grant
 greater autonomy to the electronic media. Actual creation of
 the Corporation was put off by both Chandra Shekhar's
 government in late 1990 and Narasimha Rao's Government in
 1991. As of year's end, there was no sign that the bill would
 be implemented.
 In Punjab as well as Kashmir, journalists and editors were
 harassed and intimidated by terrorists, local leaders, and
 special interest groups. Militant organizations forced
 newspapers to print their propaganda, under threat of death.
 In Punjab, Amar Nath Verma, a journalist and editor of a weekly
 magazine, Quomi Bulhara, was killed by militants on February
 8. In Kashmir, K.M. Shaban, editor of the Urdu daily Al-Safa
 was shot down in his office on April 23 by terrorists.
 On April 4, Governor Saxena of Jammu and Kashmir invoked the
 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act. Under the Act, a
 district magistrate may restrict media from carrying material
 resulting in "incitement to murder and other offenses."
 Punishment permitted under the Act includes forfeiture of
 newspapers as well as printing and other media equipment. The
 Governor daid the decision to invoke the Act was made to
 counter newspapers printing stories dictated by militants.
 Films are reviewed by the Censorship Board before being
 licensed for distribution. The Board deletes mateiial deemed
 offensive to either public morals or religious or communal
 sentiment. Private sector video newsmagazine producers are
 also required to clear their products with government censors.
 This has resulted in numerous delays in the release and editing
 of a number of stories on controversial issues.
 
 
 1399
 INDIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations. These rights are generally
 respected. Government authorities sometimes require permits
 and notification prior to holding parades and demonstrations.
 At times of civil tension, local governments may ban public
 assemblies and impose a curfew. Ordinarily, local governments
 respect the right to protest peacefully, including such
 traditional Indian forms of protest as "gherao," in which an
 official or his office is surrounded by protesters who allow no
 movement, and sitdowns blocking public thoroughfares.
 Srinagar, in Kashmir, was under a continuous night curfew
 throughout the year. In addition, government authorities
 routinely imposed day curfews on communities experiencing
 violent disturbances. In Punjab and Assam night and day
 curfews were also sporadically imposed in response to militant
 activities. Violent communal clashes throughout the country
 provoked an imposition of curfew for 3 days or more in 18
 cities in 6 different states during the first half of the year.
 In December Indian authorities detained 14 Tibetan activists
 without charges for approximately 1 week during the visit of
 Chinese Premier Li Peng, to preclude thier organizing
 anti-Chinese demonstrations. The Supreme Court ordered the
 detainees released and established a judicial investigation of
 allegations of molestation of female Tibetan detainees by Delhi
 police.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state in which all faiths enjoy freedom of
 worship. Government policy does not favor any religious
 group. Nevertheless, tensions over religious differences
 continue to be a social problem and pose challenges to the
 secular nature of the Indian polity.
 There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian
 Christians, but the Government limits the number of foreign
 missionaries, and laws in some states discourage them from
 openly proselytizing. State officials in Arunachal Pradesh
 continued to bar foreign Christian missionaries from the state
 owing to a sharp increase in conversions among tribals there,
 which has caused some social and religious tensions.
 Indian religious organizations may maintain communications with
 coreligionists abroad. Financial contributions from abroad are
 subject to scrutiny and licensing by the Ministry of Home
 Affairs.
 Despite acts in various states to remove obstructions to the
 exercise of religious freedom, Harijans ("scheduled castes" or
 "untouchables") are still prevented from entering Hindu temples
 in some areas.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Ordinance
 makes it an offense to use any religious site for political
 purposes or to use temples for harboring persons accused or
 convicted of any crime. While specifically designed to deal
 with Sikh places of worship in the Punjab, the Ordinance
 technically applies to all religious sites. However, the
 Government has been careful to avoid placing restrictions on
 Sikh religious practices or on the management of Sikh places of
 worship.

 INDIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Indian citizens enjoy full freedom-of movement within the
 country, except in certain border areas where, for security
 reasons, special permits are required. Foreigners (including
 diplomats) must obtain special permission to visit Assam as
 well as other sensitive border areas in the northeast. Foreign
 travel and emigration are without political restrictions.
 Millions of people of Indian origin live abroad.
 India admitted millions of refugees and displaced persons at
 the time of partition in 1947 and granted them citizenship,
 integrating them fully into Indian society. Subsequent
 migratibn to India has largely been the result of upheavals in
 nearby countries, and some of the refugees in these migrations
 have not been granted citizenship or been fully integrated. In
 some cases, both the refugees and their hosts consider their
 stay temporary, although it may be for an indefinite period.
 India does not, however, offer permanent resettlement.
 Refugees it recognizes are placed in camps. Afghans,
 Bangladeshis, Nepali-origin Bhutanese, and Burmese generally
 are not deported; neither are they recognized as refugees.
 These and other nationalities either receive a renewable
 residence permit or are ignored. A dwindling flow of Afghans
 continued to enter India.
 Tamils fleeing armed conflict in Sri Lanka moved into the
 Indian state of Tamil Nadu in large numbers in 1990. Over
 120,000 Tamil refugees were in over 300 camps, with
 approximately 80,000 more living independently in the state.
 The state government, using central government resources,
 provided shelter and subsidized food to those in the camps.
 The Indian government did not accept assistance from the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the Sri
 Lankan refugees; nor did it permit UNHCR access to the camps.
 India continues to provide humanitarian assistance and
 protection to the large communities of Tibetan refugees in
 Himachal Pradeth, Karnataka, and elsewhere in India, who number
 over 100,000. At least 500 new refugees entered in 1991.
 Ethnic Nepalese from southern Bhutan moved to parts of Assam
 and West Bengal in late 1990 and 1991, in response to a
 Bhutanese government implementation of a strict nationality
 policy. The number of these people fluctuated in response to
 political tensions in Bhutan; it was estimated that over 15,000
 ethnic Nepalese were in these regions in mid-October. The
 Indian Government did not recognize these people as refugees
 and did not provide them with aid.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 India has a democratic, parliamentary system of government with
 members el6cted under full adult suffrage; the voting age is
 18. Multiparty elections are held regularly at state and
 national levels. A Parliament sits for not more than 5 years
 unless dissolved earlier for new elections, except under
 constitutionally defined emergency situations. State
 governments (headed by an appointed governor) are also elected
 at regular intervals except in states under President's Rule.
 Although the central Government spoke earlier of its desire to
 replace President's Rule with elected state governments, law
 and order problems in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir remain
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1401
 INDIA
 obstacles to the holding of state assembly elections. Polling
 in Punjab for the state assembly and the lower house of the
 national Parliament, scheduled for June 22, was postponed by
 the election commissioner on June 20, ostensibly because of the
 deteriorating law and order situation. It was generally
 believed, however, that the move was designed to allow the
 Congress (I), which was boycotting the elections in Punjab, to
 participate in future polling. The Congress (I) Government
 subsequently canceled the elections but continue to affirm its
 commitment to a special round of voting before February 15,
 1992.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may declare
 President's Rule or a state of emergency in any state in the
 event of war, external oppression, internal disruption, or
 collapse of the constitutional machinery. Under President's
 Rule, the central Government, through Parliament, the
 President, and the appointed governor, directly administers the
 state, bypassing the elected state government. President's
 rule is for 6 months and must give way to new elections, but
 may be extended by Parliament in increments of 6 months.
 President's Rule in Punjab was first instituted on May 11, 1987
 and has been extended every 6 months since then. On September
 18, Parliament extended President's Rule in the Punjab for an
 additional 6 months, effective November 11. The Government
 promised to create a situation conducive to fair assembly
 elections by February 15, 1992. Jammu and Kashmir state was
 under President's Rule throughout the year. It was extended on
 August.26 for another 6 months, effective September 3.
 President's Rule in Assam, imposed November 28, 1990, was
 lifted on June 30.
 National elections were held in May and June. The campaign and
 polling were marred by widespread violence and corruption, and
 at least 150 people (including 34 candidates) died in
 election-related violence. The press reported that throughout
 the country politicians had hired armed gangs to disrupt
 polling, to intimidate voters, and to steal or stuff ballot
 boxes. Such violence and corruption was particularly prevalent
 in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.
 According to the Home Ministry, polling was temporarily
 adjourned or repolling was ordered in 2,594 polling stations
 (out of 600,000 in the country) because of vote rigging and
 ballot box stuffing. In addition, five elections for
 parliamentary constituencies were nullified for the same
 reasons.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Independent Indian human rights organizations are active and
 vocal. They include the Peoples' Union for Democratic Rights,
 the People's Union for Civil Liberties, the South Asia Human
 Rights Documentation Center, Citizens for Democracy, and the
 Indian People's Human Rights Commission, all of which send out
 teams to study specific allegations of human rights abuses and
 publish reports on their findings, which are often highly
 critical of government authorities. All of India, including
 Kashmir and Punjab, is open to investigation by Indian civil
 liberties groups. However, individual human rights monitors
 and people who file human rights complaints have been harassed
 and in some cases physically assaulted by police.
 
 
 1402
 INDIA
 The central Government, while tolerant of dissent within India,
 is sensitive to international allegations of human rights
 violations. Asia Watch sent a team of investigators to Punjab
 and Kashmir in 1990. Though it did not request permission for
 the visit, it did inform the Government of its plans and
 requested appointments with officials. Amnesty International
 repeated its requests for authorization for an investigative
 team to visit several areas in India. As of year's end, no
 authorization had been granted, although the Government claimed
 to have the requests under consideration.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of race,
 religion, and language severely divide Indian society in spite
 of laws designed to prevent discrimination. Sporadic violence
 occurred throughout the year based on these differences.
 Despite several provisions in the Constitution promising
 equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination on the
 basis of sex, legally sanctioned sex discrimination is
 manifested in the family, marriage, and inheritance laws of
 several of India's religious communities. In recent years,
 changes have been made in personal, criminal, and labor laws
 governing women, including the Dowry Prohibition Act, the Equal
 Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, and
 the Sati (Widow Burning) (Prevention) Act, and the media have
 reported more extensively on the treatment of women.
 Nonetheless, as evidenced by increasing numbers of court cases
 brought by women's rights groups, deeply rooted traditions,
 often tied to religious or social practice, continue to
 contribute to uneven enforcement of these laws, particularly in
 the countryside.
 Existing laws relating to asset and land ownership give women
 little control over land use, retention, or sale. None of the
 personal laws, except Hindu family law, makes distinctions
 between ancestral and self-acquired property in the matter of
 inheritance. The Hindu Succession Act provides equal
 inheritance rights for Hindu women, although in practice
 married daughters are seldom given a share in parental
 property. Islamic personal law, while recognizing the right to
 inheritance of both sons and daughters, specifies that a
 daughter's share should be only one-half of a son's (a son has
 responsibility for caring for the parents in their old age).
 Under the tribal land system, notably in Bihar, tribal women do
 not have the right to own land; the practice of putting women
 to death there as "witches" is closely linked to the denial of
 property rights. Female bondage, forced prostitution, and
 child marriage remain common in parts of Indian society. Child
 prostitution is rampant in the larger urban areas, particularly
 in Bombay and Delhi. In Bombay alone, there are approximately
 100,000 prostitutes, many of them minors held in bondage at
 brothels.
 Sex determination-tests (amniocentesis) are widely used,
 resulting in a disproportionate number of abortions of female
 fetuses. Coupled with a marked disparity between mortality
 rates of male versus female infants in the 0-5 age group, this
 has resulted in the unusually low ratio in the Indian
 population of 933 females per 1,000 males (the ratio varies
 considerably among states). Parents often give priority in
 both health care and nutrition to male infants over females.
 Female infanticide is also believed to contribute to the
 
 
 1403
 INDIA
 disparity between rates of male and female mortality. Women's
 rights groups point out that the burden of providing an
 adequate dowry for girls is one factor in making births of
 females less desirable to the parents.
 On September 12, the Government introduced the Prenatal
 Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse)
 Bill 1991 to combat the use of sex determination tests leading
 to the abortion of female fetuses.
 According to an Indian government study, published several
 years ago but supported by current press repcrting, violence
 against women--including molestation, rape (including while in
 police custody), kidnaping, and wife murder ("dowry
 deaths")--has shown an upward trend over the past decade.
 Whether this is due to more reporting, a higher incidence, or a
 combination of both is unknown. The claim that "dowry deaths"
 (usually by burning) of young married women result from their
 inability to meet property demands by their husband's families
 has been challenged by women's rights groups who contend that
 insufficient dowry is often used as an excuse for societally
 condoned violence against married women.
 Dowry crimes are a-complex issue involving attitudes of parents
 toward daughters, the social and economic status of women, laws
 that do not adequately stipulate investigation and enforcement
 procedures, and the failure of police to enforce existing
 laws. There are no accurate statistics on the number of dowry
 deaths per year, as much domestic violence is unreported or is
 not registered by the police. Women's groups contend that, at
 best, there has been no decrease -in the numbers in recent
 years, despite the strengthening of the Dowry Prohibition Act.
 By law, every unnatural death of a woman in the first 7 years
 of marriage must be investigated by the police and a
 magistrate. According to the Home Ministry, there were 4,836
 reported cases of dowry death in 1990. The Ministry did not
 have statistics on how many of the reported cases were
 registered for prosecution or ended in convictions. A member
 of the Indian police on the Union Public Service Commission
 stated in 1990 that about 95 percent of registered cases of
 dowry death end in acquittal as corrupt police and medical
 officers tamper with crucial evidence. Likewise, the Home
 Ministry noted 9,518 reported cases of rape but offered no
 information regarding prosecution or convictions.
 About 150 women's organizations in India are active in working
 for social justice and economic advancement of women and in
 linking women's problems to larger social concerns.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
 Atrocities) Act of 1989 added to other protective legislation
 by specifying a new range of offenses and providing stiffer
 sanctions with special courts. It has not, however, checked
 atrocities committed against these groups. The Government
 announced that there had been a total of 16,810 cases of
 atrocities (including murder, rape, burning, and beating)
 against scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in 1990. In the
 first 3 months of 1991, the rate of atrocities had increased,
 with 5,456 cases reported. There were no convictions under the
 1989 Act, although the Government's minorities commission noted
 that many cases were pending.

 INDIA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of association as
 defined by the International Labor Organization (ILO). Workers
 are guaranteed the right to form and join unions of their own
 choosing without prior authorization, including in the seven
 export processing zones (EPZ's); several trade union
 confederations exist. Most trade unions have some tie to a
 political party, national or local, but they make a point of
 stressing their formal independence from political parties and,
 on occasion, differ from their respective political allies on
 labor-related issues.
 Trade unions have the legally protected right to strike, but
 public sector unions (i.e., in government-owned industries)
 have to give at least 14 days' notice prior to striking. Some
 states have laws requiring workers in certain nonpublic sector
 industries to give prior strike notice. The Essential Services
 Maintenance Act allows central government authorities to ban
 strikes and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified
 essential industries. Legal mechanisms exist for challenging
 the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope of
 this act. At least two of the EPZ's limit the right to
 strike. Approximately 730 strikes occurred in India in 1990
 (the latest year for which figures are available).
 By and large, human rights abuses against unions or unionized
 workers have not been a problem in India. On September 28,
 however, leading Madhya Pradesh trade union leader Shankar Guha
 Niyogi was shot and killed by unidentified assailants.
 Suspects included local industrialists opposed to his
 organizing activities and rival trade unionists. State
 authorities turned investigative responsibility over to the
 (federal) Central Bureau of Investigation.
 Unions are free to join and participate in international trade
 union organizations and maintain a broad range of such
 affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize (including protection against antiunion
 discrimination) and to bargain collectively has existed in
 Indian law for decades. Trade unions carry out these
 activities independently and without government or, in general,
 employer attempts to interfere. Police and judicial
 authorities are generally quick to protect peaceful union
 activities. However, the ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association considered three cases alleging antiunion
 discrimination by private and state-owned companies in
 retaliation for a union's protected activity and called on the
 Government employer to assure that ongoing disciplinary
 proceedings against workers do not violate ILO principles
 barring pr6judice in employment because of union membership or
 activities.
 In addition to the availability of normal civil and criminal
 courts, a system of specialized labor courts exists to hear and
 adjudicate labor-related complaints.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and
 settling disputes, and trade unions are usually vigorous in
 defending worker interests in this process. Where collective
 
 
 1405
 INDIA
 bargaining fails to establish locally equitable wage levels,
 the Government may set up tripartite boards, including trade
 union representation, to determine them.
 The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against union
 members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they
 discriminate. Physical access to the EPZ's ordinarily is
 limited to those who work in them, and union organizers are not
 exempt from these limitations. While workers in EPZ's have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively, trade union
 activity is rare. Women workers, who are more difficult to
 organize, constitute the bulk of the work force in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Constitution. A Supreme
 Court decision, however, has defined "forced labor" as work at
 less than the minimum wage (minimum wages are usually set by
 the.states, not the central Government). Under this
 definition, "forced labor" is widespread throughout India,
 particularly in-rural areas. "Bonded labor," the result of a
 private contractual relationship whereby a worker incurs or
 inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt
 (plus'extensive interest), is illegal and specifically
 prohibited under national legislation passed in 1976. While
 violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to 3 years,
 individual state labor departments are responsible for law
 enforcement-and prosecutions are rare. As a result, despite
 active central government opposition, the practice of bonded
 labor continues and occurs among significant numbers of
 agricultural and construction workers.
 The Government estimated that, based on reports from the
 states, as of March 31 there were 255,608 bonded workers in the
 country, of whom 222,935 had been "rehabilitated" by government
 authorities. The Gandhi Peace Foundation, however, estimates
 the number at 10 times the government figure. Private social
 organizations, such as trade unions, the Council for
 Advancement of Peoples' Action and Rural Technology, and Action
 for Welfare and Awakening Rural Environments, attempt to
 .identify cases of bondage and pursue them with relevant
 officials. However, even with better coordination and
 increased resources to overcome the complicated jurisdictional
 division between central-and state governments, the eradication
 of bonded labor is proceeding slowly.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 One-quarter of the world's child labor force is said to be in'
 India, where poverty and the lack of compulsory education make
 it an especially serious problem. According to a Labor
 Ministry survey, one out of four Indian children between the
 ages of 5 and 15 is working. Government statistics put the
 total at 17.5 million in 1985. Other figures put it as high as
 44 million.
 In 1986 legislation passed both houses of Parliament to ban the
 employment of children under age 14 in hazardous occupations
 (such as glass making, fireworks, match factories, and carpet
 weaving) and regulate their employment in others. A child
 labor division set up in 1987 in the Labor Ministry is carrying
 out child welfare projects, including health and nutritional
 programs, designed to rehabilitate child workers.
 
 
 1406
 INDIA
 Nevertheless, progress has been slow. Some employers of child
 labor have openly defied the Labor Ministry and resisted its
 attempts at enforcement. As in the case of bonded labor, the
 central Government often blames divided jurisdiction with state
 governments for its inability to curb the practice. It has
 urged private organizations, including the unions, to do more.
 Most child labor abuses, however, occur in sectors outside the
 traditional reach of labor organizations. The central
 Government's fiscal 1990 budget allotted only $2.2 million for
 all child welfare programs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 While the basic minimum wage varies according to the state and
 sector bf industry, most "organized" workers receive much more
 than the minimum wage, especially when legislatively mandated
 bonuses and other benefits are included. In the "unorganized
 sector," each state sets separate minimum wages for
 agricultural workers, which are not well enforced. The minimum
 wage for the unorganized section in New Delhi is considered
 adequate only for the most minimal standard of living.
 According to a government-sponsored report by the National
 Commission on Self-Employed Women, most rural women work as
 (unorganized) agricultural laborers, vulnerable to.
 exploitation. Overall, 94 percent of Indian women work in the
 unorganized sector, which is not adequately regulated by labor
 laws. Contractors customarily pay women wage rates lower than
 those fixed by the several states. This is so even though
 one-third of all Indian households are supported solely by
 women, while in another third women are responsible for half
 the family's income.
 The Factories Act established an 8-hour workday and a 48-hour
 workweek and provides for one 24-hour rest period which may be
 worked if overtime is paid. These standards are generally
 enforced and accepted (indeed, improved upon by various
 enlightened employers and aggressive unions) in the modern
 industrial sectors but tend not to be observed in the more
 extensive older, smaller, and less robust industries. State
 governments are responsible for the enforcement of the
 Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered
 by a small cadre of factory inspectors, with their limited
 training and susceptibility to bribery, makes for lax
 enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely,
 in general neither state nor central government resources for
 inspection and enforcement of standards are adequate. Safety
 conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's.
