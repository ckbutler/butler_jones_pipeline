 KUWAIT
 For the first 2 months of the year, Kuwait continued to be
 occupied by Iraqi armed forces which committed massive and
 systematic human rights violations. The liberation of Kuwait
 by coalition military forces resulted in the restoration of its
 traditional Government. Kuwait's rulers (amirs), drawn from
 the Al-Sabah family, have governed the country in consultation
 with prominent commercial families and other community leaders
 for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution provides for an
 elected National Assembly and details the powers and
 relationships of the branches of the government and the rights
 of citizens. However, the Amir may suspend any or all
 provisions of the Constitution by decree. The National
 Assembly was dissolved from 1976 to 1981 and again in 1986. In
 October 1990, the Amir committed himself to restoration of the
 National Assembly and government adherence to the 1962
 Constitution after liberation. In keeping with this pledge,
 the Amir announced on June 2 that elections for a new National
 Assembly would be held in October 1992.
 In postliberation Kuwait, the Ministry of Interior supervises
 the country's security apparatus, including the Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS),
 which investigates internal security-related offenses. Both
 were active in investigations of suspected collaborators, in
 coordination with the uniformed police. The Kuwaiti military,
 which shared responsibility for internal security during the
 period of martial law from February 26 to June 26, was also
 active in arresting and investigating suspected collaborators.
 Both police and military forces were responsible for human
 rights abuses, particularly in dealing with foreign nationals
 from governments or groups that had supported the Iraqi
 invasion.
 Prior to the invasion, which wreaked havoc on Kuwait's economy,
 the people of Kuwait enjoyed a high standard of living, with an
 estimated per capita gross income of $10,175 in 1989. Most of
 the country's preinvasion income derived from oil production
 and commercial investment. Iraq's deliberate destruction of
 Kuwait's oil production infrastructure significantly reduced
 Kuwait's capacity to produce oil for the next few years.
 Sizable government and private overseas investment portfolios
 were dedicated to the reconstruction of the country, which
 suffered an estimated $20 billion in war damage. Despite the
 emphasis the Government places on an open market economy,
 expatriates are not allowed to own property or majority shares
 in significant local businesses and are subject to restrictive
 labor laws.
 Kuwait's humah rights situation in 1991 can be divided into
 three parts: the final phase of the Iraqi occupation in
 January and February; the immediate postliberation period from
 late February to early April; and the remainder of the year.
 Despite United Nations' condemnation of Iraq's human rights
 practices in occupied Kuwait, Iraqi authorities made no effort
 to reduce human rights abuses by Iraqi occupation forces in
 Kuwait. Indeed, the final days of the occupation were marked
 by an accelerated and systematic terror campaign by Iraqi
 authorities against the Kuwaiti population, including but not
 limited to increased incidents of extrajudicial killing,
 torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention. Iraqi occupation
 authorities ruthlessly suppressed such basic rights as freedom
 of speech, press, assembly, movement, and fair trial. In the
 chaotic days after liberation, Kuwaiti civilians and security
 and military personnel were responsible for human rights
 
 
 1467
 KUWAIT
 violations in the course of arresting and interrogating those
 suspected of collaboration with Iraqi authorities. Human
 rights abuses during this period included extrajudicial
 killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 involuntary repatriation or deportation to'Iraq. With the
 return of government authority, the incidence of "vigilante"
 abuse began to decline. However, both during and after martial
 law, which ended on June 26, government security personnel
 continued to round up and question suspected collaborators,
 sometimes using torture to extract information. Kuwait's
 martial law courts, although keeping trial sessions open to
 public observation and providing defense counsel for the
 accused, failed to observe a number of internationally accepted
 judicial practices. Called to. account by foreign governments
 and international human rights organizations, the Kuwaiti
 Government responded by warning security personnel and citizens
 .to avoid committing anuses, improving detention conditions,
 cooperating with the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) to carry out deportations more humanely, and providing
 an appeals process for State Security Court rulings, among
 other efforts. Although these actions brought about a
 significant reduction in human rights abuses, serious problems
 remained, particularly with regard to mistreatment of
 detainees, detention of prisoners without charge, lack of due
 process in the trials of suspected collaborators, and the delay
 in bringing to trial those suspected of committing human rights
 violations. Nor has the Kuwaiti Government moved to reduce
 restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech and on the right
 of citizens to change their government. Womens' rights are
 significantly limited due to cultural mores and an unresolved
 political debate about extending them suffrage.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 During the occupation, Iraqi authorities carried out massive
 extrajudicial killings and summary executions of Kuwaitis and
 residents of Kuwait, often to maximize psychological terror.
 These killings were not limited to suspected members of the
 resistance, but included their families, other civilians, and
 children as young as 12 years of age. Families were sometimes
 forced by Iraqi troops to watch the execution of immediate
 relatives. In the days prior to commencement of the ground war
 on February 24, Iraqi secret police and military personnel
 dumped a number of bodies in the streets and other public areas
 as a warning to Kuwaitis considering resumption of armed
 resistance activity. Most of the bodies showed signs of
 torture.
 The privately organized Kuwait Association for the Defense of
 War Victims (KADWV) has gathered information on over 300 cases
 of extrajudicial killing during the occupation, not including
 deaths which resulted from fighting connected with the invasion
 and the war for liberation. There were widespread and credible
 reports of extrajudicial killings after liberation. Given the
 chaotic nature of the postliberation period and the
 Government's inability to quickly reestablish its authority
 over internal security activities, it is difficult to determine
 accurate figures or even the nationality of some of the
 unidentified victims. Similarly it is not possible to say with
 certainty how many of these killings were carried out by
 
 
 1468
 KUWAIT
 Kuwaiti civilians and military personnel seeking retribution
 against expatriates suspected of collaborating with the Iraqi
 occupation authorities or as a result of personal feuds or of
 scattered fighting after liberation between pockets of Iraqi
 soldiers and local resistance forces.
 There were numerous credible reports of Palestinians and other
 expatriates being tortured to death by police or military
 personnel (see Section l.c.). The total number of such
 incidents is estimated at 45-50. In one documented case, a
 Jordanian of Palestinian origin was detained in the Kuwait
 Military Prison, where he was registered by the ICRC on March
 23. Certification of the man's death on April 4 was later
 provided to the man's family, although the cause of death was
 not ihdicated. There were eyewitness reports that the man died
 as a result of abuse at the hands of Kuwaiti military personnel.
 Reports of extrajudicial killings subsided after early April.
 Senior Kuwaiti government authorities condemned abuses in
 general and acknowledged that some extrajudicial killings had
 taken place in the days immediately following liberation. They
 placed the blame for these deaths on vigilante elements not
 under the control of the Government. However, the Government
 has not yet charged or brought anyone to trial for such
 extrajudicial killings. Some members of the Kuwaiti political
 opposition suggest that an attempt on the life of Hamed
 al-Joaan, a prominent Kuwaiti lawyer and opposition member,
 several days after liberation may have been politically
 motivated. The lawyer was shot in the doorway of his home by
 an unknown assailant on March 3. The attack left him paralyzed
 from the chest down. Prior to the invasion, Kuwait had no
 record of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Kuwait has provided the ICRC and Iraq with the names of more
 than 2,000 Kuwaitis and residents of Kuwait, taken prisoner by
 Iraqi authorities during the occupation, who remain unaccounted
 for and are believed to be either still alive at Iraqi
 detention sites or dead at the hands of their Iraqi captors.
 Of this number, approximately 10 percent are women. Despite
 repeated calls by the U.N. and Kuwait for their release and
 return, the Iraqi Government has failed to comply with U.N.
 Security Council Resolution 687, which requires Iraq to
 facilitate the repatriation of all detainees still in Iraq.
 Reports of disappearances following liberation were widespread,
 as elements of the Kuwaiti military and vigilante groups
 scoured the city for suspected collaborators and Iraqi
 soldiers. While there is no reliable estimate of the total
 number of disappearances, approximately 140 cases remained
 unresolved in 1991.
 In some cases, there is credible evidence that disappearances
 resulted .in detention, torture, and death. For example, two
 Kuwaitis, one identified as a Ministry of Interior employee,
 asked a Palestinian physician on March 10 to accompany them for
 questioning. The physician was never seen or heard from again
 by family members. Eyewitness reports surfaced in April and
 May that he had died as a result of poor living conditions and
 beatings in a Kuwaiti detention facility. The Government
 investigated the case but with no known results.
 
 
 1469
 KUWAIT
 c.   Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Iraqi occupation authorities, in particular the secret police,
 or Mukhabarat, consistently employed torture and other cruel
 and inhuman punishment against detainees. Evidence obtained
 from interviews and photographs by international and local
 human rights groups document that techniques used by Iraqi
 forces included prolonged beatings with sticks, chains, clubs
 studded with metal nails, metal rods, and whips; electric
 shocks applied to the limbs, genitals, ears, and breasts and
 electricity applied to victims immersed in water; breaking of
 limbs; plucking out of eyes and nails; genital mutilation; rape
 and other forms of sexual abuse; prolonged suspension by the
 limbs, including suspension for extended periods from rotating
 ceiling fans; and burning, using lit cigarettes, hot irons,
 acid, and other methods. Psychological torture methods
 included mock executions, forcing relatives and friends to
 witness torture, sexual abuse, and executions, threats of
 sexual assault, and general humiliation and insults. Incidents
 of rape, almost all committed by Iraqi soldiers, were common
 during the occupation. Some victims were detained and
 tortured. In a few documented cases, Iraqi forces mutilated
 women captives by cutting off breasts and genitalia. Those
 subjected to torture and abuse included women, children as
 young as 9 years old, and the elderly.
 Several sites were converted by the Iraqi authorities into
 centers of interrogation and torture, including the Kadhima
 Sports Club, the Al-Mashatal Agricultural Research Station,
 Kuwait University, and a number of police stations and
 schools. Private residences were also used, the most infamous
 of which was the Yarmouk Palace, reputed to be the headquarters
 in Kuwait of Sabawi al-Tikriti, chief of Iraqi intelligence and
 half-brother of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
 Sanitary facilities, health care, and food and water were
 inadequate or, in some cases, nonexistent in Iraqi detention
 facilities in Kuwait and Iraq. In virtually all cases,
 detainees were held incommunicado.
 Interviews conducted by Kuwaiti health officials with Kuwaiti
 and non-Kuwaiti detainees returned from Iraq indicated that
 nearly 80 percent of all the detainees reported being subjected
 to some form of torture while in detention, with 63 percent
 reporting being subjected to physical torture, mostly beatings,
 electric shocks, and sexual abuse. There are credible reports
 that Iraqi security officials administered drugs to prisoners
 as a form of torture, to cause physical dependency, and as an
 interrogation technique.
 Although the Kuwaiti Constitution specifically prohibits the
 use of torture, there were widespread and credible reports that
 Kuwaiti military and security personnel employed torture
 against detainees following liberation. This practice was
 especially prevalent in the days immediately following
 liberation, when arbitrary arrest and detention were common and
 there was scant government oversight of security and military
 personnel activities. Reports from released detainees indicate
 that methods of torture included beatings with sticks and metal
 rods, cigarette burns, electric shock, sexual abuse, and
 psychological harassment such as verbal abuse and other
 humiliating treatment. Places where torture was used, in March
 and April, included the Sabah Al-Salem Military Prison and
 local schools and police stations which were under the control
 
 
 1470
 KUWAIT
 of the Kuwaiti military and civilian vigilante squads.
 Detention conditions were poor, with inadequate sanitation,
 food, and water, and little or no health care. Overcrowding
 was a serious problem in the Military Prison, where up to 500
 prisoners were kept in space designed for only 150. Detainees
 who required health care, sometimes as a result of abuse, were
 transferred to guarded wards in three of Kuwait's major
 hospitals--Mubarak, Farwaniya, and Al-Sabah. There were
 credible reports that detainees brought to these hospitals also
 suffered abuse there. In one case, three Kuwaiti military
 personnel were arrested and imprisoned to await trial for
 beating an expatriate whom they were guarding in one of the
 hospital wards. When evidence of abuses and poor detention
 conditions was brought to their attention, senior Kuwaiti
 goveinment officials acted to improve the situation by opening
 new detention facilities, some of which had been damaged during
 the war and required time to repair, and by working to ensure
 the provision of adequate food, water, and medical care for
 prisoners.
 In a public speech to security personnel on May 26, the Kuwaiti
 Crown Prince warned that those responsible for human rights
 violations would be punished severely, and reports of abuse,
 particularly by vigilante elements, declined rapidly
 thereafter. Nonetheless, credible reports of abuse and poor
 detention conditions at the Kuwait State Security (KSS)
 facility and at Al-Jiwan (a Defense Ministry facility)
 continued into the summer months. For example, former
 detainees at the KSS facility reported extreme overcrowding,
 inadequate food, water, and health care, and persistent
 beatings by security personnel. There is evidence that some
 detainees were kept in detention butdoors because of lack of
 space inside the facility, which was not designed to serve as a
 prison. By September there were indications that conditions
 had improved as KSS arrests declined, but credible reports of
 abuse by unsupervised guards at the facility continued.
 Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a defense in
 Kuwaiti courts, and confessions or other evidence obtained
 through torture are not admissible. HoweVer, the sentences of
 a number of defendants tried before the martial law courts were
 based on confessions, despite their assertions that those
 confessions had been made under duress.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 In the course of the Iraqi occupation, a large number of
 Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaiti residents of Kuwait were detained and
 imprisoned in Iraq, including military, resistance members, and
 civilians. In the last weeks before the liberation, Iraqi
 authorities detained an estimated 3,000 Kuwaitis and
 non-Kuwaiti residents of Kuwait, many of them randomly, and
 sent many to detention facilities in southern Iraq. Captured
 Iraqi documents indicate that government authorities ordered
 the roundup. While the exact number is unknown, adding the
 number of detainees believed still held in Iraq, the more than
 6,000 detainees who were returned in ICRC-monitored prisoner
 exchanges in March and April, and those released from prisons
 in southern Iraq as a result of the Shi'a rebellion in March,
 the total is estimated to be at least 10,000.
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are prohibited by the Kuwaiti
 Constitution. The Kuwaiti Penal Code stipulates that a
 detainee may not be held for more than 4 days without charge.
 A public prosecutor's approval is required for detention
 
 
 1471
 KUWAIT
 periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter, the suspect must either
 be released or charged by a prosecutor, who may authorize
 detention for an additional 21 days. Further detention pending
 trial may be authorized by a judge.
 The foregoing requirements, including issuance of warrants for
 arrest, were generally not observed by Kuwaiti authorities
 during the period of martial law (February 26 to June 26). It
 is estimated that as many as 5,800 persons, mostly non-Kuwaitis
 suspected of collaboration with Iraqi occupation authorities,
 were arrested and detained during this period. Persons
 targeted in these efforts included but were not limited to the
 following nationality groups: Jordanians (mostly of
 Palestinian origin), Iraqis, stateless Arabs of bedouin origin,
 Egyptians, Yemenis, and Sudanese. While there are no precise
 figures available, credible reports indicate that a large
 number of these arrests were arbitrary and that detainees were
 sometimes held for several days, weeks, or even months without
 being charged.
 Lack of adequate Interior Ministry investigative staff and
 public prosecutor's office personnel significantly delayed
 investigations and issuance of charges or releases. As of the
 end of June, the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry announced that it
 held nearly 3,000 persons in prison, who were either charged
 or under investigation. There were credible reports that, of
 these, some 800 to 1,000 remained in detention without charge,
 awaiting investigation. By September Kuwaiti authorities had
 caught up with the backlog of cases under investigation and had
 either formally charged these persons or had expelled them.
 Many detainees were held incommunicado for some time, without
 access to family members or defense counsel. When the
 Government granted the ICRC access to detention sites in March,
 the ICRC was able to inform the families of many detainees of
 their whereabouts. Families were subsequently granted visiting
 privileges, but access was granted only on a sporadic basis at
 the discretion of individual detention site authorities. By
 the end of July, the ICRC had access to all known detention
 facilities. Detainees were often transferred from one
 detention site to another without prior notification to family.
 members or other concerned parties. This practice had subsided
 by September. Approximately 700 persons remained in detention
 at the end of 1991.
 Under Kuwaiti law, no Kuwaiti may be exiled or denied return to
 Kuwait. A noncitizen, however, even if a long-term resident,
 may be summarily expelled without charge or judicial recourse
 if the authorities deem him a "troublemaker" or "security
 risk." Expatriates were also subject to expulsion if they were
 unable to find or retain employment after the occupation. Most
 government ministries and many private employers terminated the
 work contracts of Palestinians, Jordanians, Iraqis, and other
 nationalities associated with Arab states and leaders that
 supported the Iraqi occupation. As a result, facing possible
 expulsion and having no employment, these expatriates left the
 country voluntarily. For example, by September an estimated
 50,000 to 70,000 of the estimated 120,000 Palestinians still
 resident in Kuwait after liberation had departed for Jordan and
 other countries.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There was no evidence that Iraqi occupation authorities
 conducted trials or other legal proceedings in the case of
 
 
 1472
 KUWAIT
 detainees. Punishment, including executions, was carried out
 summarily. Despite Iraqi claims to govern Kuwait as part of
 Iraq, occupation authorities did not make any efforts to extend
 even the slight protection afforded by the Iraqi judicial
 system.
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and in most cases
 provides for fair public trial and the right of appeal. The
 martial law courts and the State Security Courts were notable
 exceptions; the former made no provision for appeal and did not
 meet international standards of due process; the latter also
 does not meet standards for due process.  Judges in the
 regular judicial system are appointed by the Amir on the
 recommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals who
 serve as judges usually receive lifetime appointments, while
 many non-Kuwaiti judges serve under 1- to 3-year contracts,
 which are renewable. The Justice Ministry may remove judges,
 but such removal is rare.
 By law, all defendants in felony cases have to be represented
 by attorneys, court-appointed if necessary. In misdemeanor
 cases, which include crimes punishable by less than 3 years'
 imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, and the court is not
 required to appoint a defense attorney. Courts were required
 to give consideration to defendants' allegations of police
 mistreatment in reaching verdicts and sentencing. Defendants
 tried in absentia-have the right to appeal. There were no
 reports of government interference in the issuance of verdicts
 or of discrimination against defense counsel.
 Trials conducted by the martial law courts generally did not
 meet international standards of due process. These trials were
 convened from May 19 until the end of martial law on June 26 to
 handle all cases of suspected collaboration with Iraqi
 occupation authorities and crimes committed under martial law.
 In the opening session of the trials May 19, five cases were
 tried, and sentences passed the same day. The defendants in
 these proceedings were not assigned defense counsel until they
 were in court and claimed to have made confessions under
 duress. In a number of martial law cases, direct evidence was
 not presented, and cited witnesses were not made available for
 examination. The courts generally did not recognize the
 defense that a person's labor was forced in situations of
 alleged collaboration with the occupying Iraqi forces. Human
 rights groups, whose observers attended the trials, criticized
 the proceedings for, among other things, failing to take into
 account all evidence before issuing sentences and issuing
 sentences disproportionate to the crimes considered. However,
 the trials were, with the exception of one session, open to the
 public, press, and observers from embassies and international
 human rights organizations. The courts assigned defense
 counsel to unrepresented defendants. Defense lawyers were
 allowed to pursue an active defense, although few defendants
 were allowed pretrial access to-counsel. Both the prosecution
 and the defense were able in most instances to cross-examine
 witnesses and challenge evidence presented.
 The four martial law circuits, composed of panels of three
 civilian judges and two military officers each, resolved 74
 cases involving 164 defendants. Of this number, 115 were
 convicted, 47 were acquitted, and 2 had their cases referred to
 other courts. The courts tried 31 persons in absentia. A
 total of 29 persons received death sentences, which were later
 commuted to life sentences by the Crown Prince after review of
 all martial law court sentences by a specially appointed
 
 
 1473
 KUWAIT
 three-member panel of judicial officers. Other than review by
 this panel, there was no opportunity for appeal through the
 courts. Seventy-two other cases, which came before the courts
 but which were not concluded before the end of martial law,
 were set aside to be tried in the State Security Courts or the
 criminal courts at a later date.
 Kuwait's State Security Courts had not resumed trials of
 suspected collaborators as of the end of 1991. The courts are
 presided over by three-member judges' tribunals and may, at the
 judges' discretion, choose to hold court proceedings in
 camera. State Security Court proceedings served as the basis
 for martial law court proceedings. Consequently, many of the
 same concerns outlined above also applied to the State Security
 Courts. However, in August the Kuwaiti Government passed a new
 law establishing an appeals process for the State Security
 Courts for the first time. Under the new law, defendants
 sentenced in the State Security Courts are allowed to appeal
 their cases to the Higher Court of Appeal (or Cassation), which
 can decide to review the casqs to determine whether the rule of
 law was correctly applied in determining sentence. Appeal for
 cases tried in absentia was allowed prior to the invasion.
 Under the Constitution, the Amir has the power to pardon and
 commute all sentences, and has exercised this perogative in the
 past.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were numerous credible reports that, during the
 occupation, Iraqi military and security personnel engaged in
 forced entry into private and diplomatic residences, seized
 private possessions and personal documents, looted commercial
 and public establishments, and harassed Kuwaiti residents at
 military checkpoints. They also monitored phone calls and
 maintained a network of informants to track down individuals
 for arrest and subsequent detention.
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Kuwaiti Constitution but was not observed
 in all cases by the Kuwaiti authorities after the country's
 liberation. Search warrants issued by the court or the
 prosecutor are required under Kuwaiti law unless the police are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or
 there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter public premises are issued
 by a public prosecutor. During the period of martial law, this
 requirement was waived, and Kuwaiti military personnel manning
 checkpoints were at liberty to search vehicles for weapons and
 other contraband items. There were numerous reports of
 harassment of expatriates at these checkpoints.
 In 1986 the Government restricted the right of Kuwaiti males to
 marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval in advance
 would henceforth be required. Government officials indicated
 the action was motivated by concern over how to meet the
 State's responsibilities toward the children of non-Kuwaiti
 spouses residing outside the country. The Government, and the
 public at large, were also concerned about the growing number
 of Kuwaiti males marrying foreigners rather than Kuwaiti
 women. After liberation, as before the Iraqi invasion, Kuwaiti
 women were publicly advised against marrying foreign nationals.
 
 
 1474
 KUWAIT
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Iraqi occupation authorities did not recognize the right of
 free speech. Their troops used the most brutal measures to
 quell any criticism of Iraq's invasion, including summarily
 executing Kuwaitis for mere possession of photographs of the
 Amir or literature supporting the Kuwaiti Government. Iraq
 denied access to Kuwait to foreign journalists and threatened
 to consider as spies anyone entering Kuwait without official
 permission. Kuwait's seven daily newspapers were forced to
 discontinue publishing. In their place, the Iraqi occupation
 authorities established the newspaper Al-Nida, which was
 heavily censored and reflected completely the views of the
 Iraqi Government.
 Kuwaiti constitutional provisions respecting freedom of speech
 and press are subject to such conditional phrases as "in
 accordance with conditions and manner specified by law." After
 liberation, as before the invasion, Kuwaitis and foreign
 residents of Kuwait have felt free to offer their opinions in
 private without fear of official retaliation, but no one may
 publicly criticize the Amir, the ruling family, or Islam.
 Opposition viewpoints are freely discussed in private and-even
 in some public meetings, although public meetings are subject
 to obtrusive physical surveillance by Interior Ministry
 personnel. Kuwait has a censorship department which reviews
 all books, films, videotapes, periodicals, and other material
 entering Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes. In
 practice, such censorship is sporadic and aimed mostly at
 material considered to be morally offensive. International
 newspapers and newsmagazines are freely available and, with a
 few exceptions, generally uncensored. Radio and television are
 government owned and controlled. After liberation, the
 Government reimposed press restrictions, decreed by the Amir in
 1986, which established prior censorship. The 1986-decrees
 also authorize the Government to suspend for up to 2 years any
 publication found to be serving foreign states or
 organizations, receiving assistance from foreign sources
 without the approval of the Information Ministry, or publishing
 material conflicting with Kuwait's interests. The revised
 censorship rggulations also toughened existing penalties for
 violators, prescribing prison-sentences of up to 3 years and
 fines up to $17,000 for offenses by publishers, editors, and
 journalists.
 The Press Law and the 1986 Amiri decrees forbid the press to
 publish any material that contains direct criticism of the Ami-r
 and the ruling family, that involves official confidential
 communications or treaties and agreements with other states, or
 that "might incite people to commit crimes, create hatred, or
 spread dissension among the people." Kuwaiti editors and
 journalists confirmed that government censorship of editorials
 and articles continued, although at lower levels than before
 the invasion. Prior to the Amir's decrees, there was selective
 enforcement of the list of proscribed topics, and violators
 were usually only issued warnings. After July 1986, however,
 government censors reviewed press items before their
 publication and ensured compliance by excising offending
 material or having it rewritten. After liberation, this
 practice continued. However, on those political topics not
 proscribed and on a wide range of social and economic issues,
 even on the topic of censorship itself, the press was free to
 engage in vigorous debate. Newspapers were free to criticize
 
 
 1475
 KUWAIT
 government policies and even government officials, as long as
 criticism was not of a personal nature. In a break with
 previous restrictions, the Kuwaiti press was allowed to openly
 criticize other Arab governments, particularly those of Iraq
 and Jordan, for their role in the invasion and occupation of
 Kuwait. .Foreign press and media reporting from Kuwait is
 uncensored, and foreign journalists have generally open access
 to the country.
 From the issuance of the July 1986 decrees to the time of the
 invasion, senior government officials held periodic meetings
 with Kuwait's chief editors. At these sessions,, editors were
 warned to avoid sensationalism and publication of items which
 might be offensive or harmful to state security. After
 liberation, editors still consulted with the Minister of
 Information and senior officials on an informal basis. Editors
 often practiced self-censorship on particularly sensitive
 issues, such as those related to national security. For
 example, editors prevented the publication of any editorials or
 articles which could be construed as being "pro-Iraqi."
 All newspapers must operate with a license from the Ministry of
 Information. "February 26", a grassroots postliberation
 newspaper, was forced to close in March after the Information
 Ministry said it could not operate because it did not have a
 license. By law, publishers lose their license, issued by the
 Information Ministry, if their publications do not appear for 6
 months.
 Academic freedom was subject to the same general restrictions
 that applied to the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Iraqi occupation forces recognized no right of free. assembly in
 Kuwait and used force, sometimes lethal, to suppress any
 unauthorized public demonstrations or gatherings.
 Political parties are banned in Kuwait, as they were befor6 the
 Iraqi occupation. Political activity finds its outlet in
 informal, family-based social gatherings known as "diwaniyas."
 The Constitution affirms the right to private assembly, public
 meetings, processions, and gatherings that are peaceful and not
 contrary to public morals. However, any group of more than
 five people desiring to meet for public discussion or to meet
 privately and then to issue a statement must receive prior
 permission from the Ministry of Interior. Authorities can
 prevent such an assembly merely by ignoring the request.
 Opposition groups, including Sunni and Shi'a fundamentalists,
 former Parliament deputies, members of the Sunni merchant
 class, and intellectuals, held public meetings on two occasions
 in June and July to protest Kuwaiti government policies related
 to elections and the reinstitution of the National Council.
 Interior Ministry officials were present in the area where both
 meetings were held but refrained from breaking them up, in
 contrast to their reaction to similar meetings in previous
 years (see also Section 3.) The Ministry of Interior was
 responsible for approving public meetings and demonstrations
 and reportedly denied permission in several cases.
 Professional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies
 are permitted to establish international contacts without
 government interference. University student groups resumed
 activity in the fall and were once again free to express
 
 
 1476
 KUWAIT
 publicly their views on international and, to some extent,
 domestic politics. A number of professional groups and
 associations resumed hosting seminars, at which such issues as
 democratic reform and foreign, economic, and social policy were
 openly discussed and debated.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no evidence that Iraqi occupation authorities
 attempted to suppress religious practices.
 The Kuwaiti Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute" but must not "conflict with public policy or
 morals." Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) is, according to the Constitution, "a main source
 of legislation." The ruling family and most prominent Kuwaiti
 families are Sunni Muslims. There are no restraints on worship
 by Shi'a Muslims, who constitute approximately 40 percent of
 all Kuwaitis. Kuwait has a tiny Arab Christian minority who
 are allowed to practice their religion freely; there are a
 number of expatriate Christian congregations and churches,
 including an American-sponsored Protestant church. Expatriate
 practitioners of Eastern religions (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and
 Buddhists) are not allowed to establish places of worship but
 may worship privately in their homes. Proselytizing of Muslims
 by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqi occupation authorities flagrantly violated the
 fundamental right of freedom of movement during the
 occupation. Many Kuwaitis and other nationals were prevented
 from leaving Kuwait and Iraq. There was little movement within
 the country as Kuwaitis and others feared harassment or
 arrest. Iraqi authorities periodically opened the Kuwait-Saudi
 border to allow for one-way exit for some Kuwaitis. Males over
 the age of 16 were detained at the border and prevented from
 leaving. More than 400,000 Kuwaitis, who were either out of
 the country at the time of the invasion or fled the country
 afterwards, spent the occupation in exile and were unable to
 return. In December 1990, Iraq allowed a small number of
 Klawaitis to return to Kuwait through Iraq; however, this
 movement quickly ebbed as it became apparent that those
 Kuwaitis who returned were subject to repressive measures,
 including detention. The U.N. Security Council condemned these
 actions, including efforts by Iraqi forces to destroy Kuwait's
 civil records, as an Iraqi attempt to change the demographic
 composition of the population of Kuwait.
 After liberation, most citizens were required by the Government
 to delay their return until after April so that basic utilities
 and infrastructure, severely damaged during the occupation and
 war for liberation, could be reconstructed to support the
 .returninzg population. Beginning in May, the Government
 sponsored free flights for Kuwaitis returning home in order to
 facilitate their movement and the pace of reconstruction. By
 the end of August, approximately 90 percent of Kuwaiti citizens
 had returned. In the first weeks after liberation, the
 Government temporarily restricted exit out of the country to
 prevent the escape of Iraqi soldiers and suspected
 collaborators. By the end of March, Kuwaitis were free to move
 overland to Saudi Arabia. By the end of May, citizens were
 generally free to travel inside and outside the country, to
 emigrate, and to return. Although there were no different
 
 
 KUWAIT
 legal standards regarding the internal or foreign travel or
 emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands could prevent
 their wives and minor children from leaving the country.
 Representatives of societies, associations, and trade unions
 wishing to travel abroad and participate in international
 meetings must receive-prior permission. The Government's
 policy, prior to the invasion, of revoking the citizenship of
 some Kuwaitis contradicted the constitutional provision that
 "no Kuwaiti may be deported from Kuwait or prevented from
 returning thereto." In some cases, such action was based on
 the voluntary acquisition by the individual of foreign
 citizenship. However, there was no evidence that the
 Government revoked citizenship in the postliberation period.
 An anomalous situation exists, however, in the case of
 so-called stateless "bidoon" ("without" in Arabic) persons,
 mainly of Iraqi, Syrian, Saudi, and Iranian origin, who resided
 in Kuwait and who claimed not to have any other nationality but
 who were unable to document claims to Kuwaiti citizenship. In
 the late 1980's and up to the time of the invasion, the
 Government promulgated a series of measures which, inter alia,
 dropped stateless, persons from the census rolls and stripped
 them of civil identification cards entitling the bearer to a
 variety of social services.
 At the time of liberation, an estimated 150,000 of the
 preinvasion bidoon population of around 250,000 remained in
 Kuwait. The rest had reportedly resettled in Iraq, where most
 were believed to have family ties. Those bidoon who remained
 in Kuwait and who either refused to reveal their true
 nationality or could not claim or prove other citizenship were
 left in limbo, without the legal right to work, attend school,
 and obtain official documents, or the practical ability to
 travel in and out of Kuwait.
 After liberation, the Government began to rectify the status of
 the bidoon by establishing a screening process for those
 serving in the defense and security forces and those in special
 categories, including children of Kuwaiti-bidoon marriages.
 Those who met screening requirements, which .reportedly included
 loyalty to the Kuwaiti Government and a declaration of
 nationality or lack of it, were granted 2- to 5-year legal
 residency, with the prospect of qualifying for eventual -
 citizenship. Those screened out were required to return to
 their country of origin or, as in the case 6f some
 Syrian-origin bidoon, were offered the opportunity to remain in
 Kuwait as a national of the originating state. There are no
 reliable estimates as to how many bidoon fall in any of these
 categories.
 With the exception of bidoon who served in the Kuwaiti military
 and became prisoners of war in Iraq and except for certain
 family reunification cases, the Kuwaiti Government denied the
 opportunity to return to bidoon residents of Kuwait who were in
 Iraq at the time of liberation. Over 5,000 persons claiming to
 be bidoon residents of Kuwait attempted to reenter Kuwait from
 Iraq after liberation but were prevented from doing so by
 Kuwaiti border guards. As a result, many chose to stay in the
 Abdali refugee camp on the Kuwait-Iraq border. By September
 the number of persons still in the camp had dwindled to less
 than 1,000, as most presumably found life easier in Iraq than
 at the camp. Those who remained insisted that they were
 residents of Kuwait and demanded right of return, while the
 Kuwaiti Government considered the group to be Iraqis attempting
 
 
 1478
 KUWAIT
 to enter Kuwait illegally, using false claims and documentation
 and, therefore, deemed to be a security risk. At the end of
 August, the Government invited the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) to screen the Abdali Camp population to
 determine the true status of these persons, most of whom were
 women and children. The Abdali camp was closed in October. Of
 the 700 remaining residents, 600 bidoon were allowed to return
 to Kuwait and 43 were given refugee status. The remaining
 residents (Iraqis and third country nationals) were repatriated
 to their countries of origin.
 Due to the collaboration of some bidoon, Palestinians, Iraqis,
 and other expatriates with Iraqi occupation authorities, the
 Kuwaiti Government moved to reduce the presence of these
 groups. The Government deported an estimated 5,700 persons and
 terminated the public sector contracts of a large number of
 expatriates in "high-risk" nationality groups. Of this number,
 approximately 500 (not including dependents) were.deported,
 both overland to Iraq and by air to Egypt and Jordan, prior to
 the Government's agreement to allow ICRC monitoring of
 deportation operations starting in early July.
 Under the arrangements worked out between the Interior Ministry
 and local ICRC representatives, the ICRC was able to interview
 all deportees to ensure that those who feared persecution in
 Iraq were not forced to go there. The Government started
 issuing new residency permits beginning in September and set
 November 15 as the expiration date for temporary identification
 documents. This expiration date was subsequently extended to
 December 31. After that date, expatriates were required to
 possess valid permanent permission, which was usually only
 obtainable through a sponsor, i.e., employer. Certain
 expatriate groups, including Palestinians, Iraqis, and bidoon,
 found it difficult to find employment and maintain residency.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Kuwaiti citizens do not have the right to change the government
 by democratic means. Under the Constitution, executive power
 is vested in the Amir and, under him, in an appointed Council
 of Ministers headed by the Crown Prince, who traditionally
 serves as Prime Minister. Following liberation, the Amir
 reinstated the 75-member National Council, an
 extraconstitutional interim advisory body created in 1990, and
 announced that elections for the National Assembly, or
 Parliament, suspended since 1986, would be held in October
 1992.
 In 1963, 2 years after gaining its independence, Kuwait
 inaugurated a National Assembly composed of 50 deputies elected
 by secret ballot, plus cabinet members sitting ex officio. The
 electoral law provides that candidates for the National
 Assembly be self-nominated, with multiple candidates permitted
 to compete for the 50 seats. A "grandfather clause"
 effectiVely limits suffrage to adult males who resided in
 Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a residence there until 1959,
 and to their adult male descendants (age 21 or over). In 1986
 the National Assembly approved an amendment to the 1966
 nationality law that postponed for 10 years, until 1996, the
 granting of votes to Kuwait's so-called second-category
 citizens. The latter are certain long-term Arab and non-Arab
 residents who do not meet the "pre-1920" qualification. The
 nationality law was further amended in 1987 to extend from 20
 to 30 years the period that naturalized Kuwaitis must wait
 
 
 1479
 
 KUWAIT
 before acquiring the right to vote. Distinctions made on the
 basis of parentage, length of residence, and gender established
 a limited class of citizenship with the privilege to
 participate in the political system. Prior to the Iraqi
 invasion, only an estimated 65,000 Kuwaitis were eligible to
 vote.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir
 in July 1986, was still in effect in 1991. The 1986 decrees
 also suspended various constitutional provisions, including
 Article 107,'which specified that, within 2 months of the
 Assembly's dissolution, either special elections were to be
 held for a new Assembly or the dissolved one was to be
 reinstated. The Assembly had previously been dissolved in 1976
 and reinstated in 1981. In the Assembly's absence, the Amir
 rules by decrees having the force of law. Far from being a
 rubber stamp, the Assembly over the years served, as an
 important forum for the expression of diverse political views,
 some sharply at odds with those of the Government, and its
 dissolution represented a setback for citizens' political
 rights.
 Informal contacts between ruler and ruled are an important
 feature of the political system, as is the tradition that the
 Amir should govern in consultation with community leaders.
 Traditionally, adult male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy
 access to their leaders, including the heads of the prominent
 merchant clans and the ruling family itself, through the system
 of "diwaniyas," informal family-based discussion groups to
 which anyone could come and freely speak his mind. Following
 the Assembly's dissolution in 1986, cabinet ministers
 instituted the practice of setting aside several hours a week
 to receive the public in their offices.
 Following the proparliament movement of late 1989 and early
 1990, during which government security forces often forcefully
 broke up public opposition meetings and temporarily arrested
 key leaders, the Amir in April 1990 announced the convening of
 a National Council, the primary purpose of which was to advise
 the Government on the restoration of Parliament. The Amir gave
 the Council's 50 elected members and 25 appointed members a
 4-year mandate. Opposition leaders generally condemned the
 National Council as insufficient and extraconstitutional and
 organized a boycott of the June 1990 -elections for the
 Council's 50 elected members. Despite the boycott, over 60
 percent of the Kuwaiti electorate participated in the election
 amid opposition charges of election fraud. The Council was in
 session for less than a month before the invasion, but was
 reinstated by the Amir in June and held its first
 postliberation session July 9. The Council is not a
 legislative body but is authorized to comment on draft decrees
 submitted by the Cabinet as well as propose measures to the
 Council of Ministers. The Council is also charged with
 monitoring the work of government departments and with
 reviewing public finances. The Amir reinstated the Council
 with the understanding that it would serve only until the time
 of elections for the new National Assembly. He also did away
 with the Council's mandate to appraise the "parliamentary
 experiment" and advise the Government on the restoration of the
 National Assembly. Council members engaged in public and
 sometimes contentious discussions on issues of national
 concern, both among themselves and with government ministers,
 who routinely consulted with the Council. Five government
 ministers served in appointed positions on the National
 Council.
 
 
 1480
 KUWAIT
 The Amir announced in April that parliamentary elections would
 be held in 1992. This announcement kept a pledge made at the
 Pan-Kuwaiti Conference which was called in Saudi Arabia in
 October 1990 during the Iraqi occupation to discuss future
 political reform and which was attended by over 1,000 prominent
 Kuwaitis, including members of the opposition. The Amir later
 specified that elections would be held in October 1992.
 Opposition members initially complained that the date set for
 elections should be earlier in 1992 and that the Government was
 stalling in order to buy more time to consolidate its own
 position.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Iraqi authorities never allowed international human rights
 groups or humanitarian agencies access to occupied Kuwait and
 made no efforts to improve the abysmal human rights situation
 during the occupation.
 After the liberation, three domestic entities dealt with human
 rights issues:
 --The Kuwait National Committee for Captives and Missing
 Persons Affairs, created in May, was entrusted by the
 Government with primary responsibility for leading efforts to
 secure the release of Kuwaiti captives still held in Iraq.
 -The privately organized Kuwait Association for the Defense of
 War Victims (KADWV), created in March, also assisted efforts to
 secure the return of internees and worked to address the
 physical and psychological needs of former prisoners of war and
 torture victims of the Iraqi occupation. The Association also
 sought to curb abuses against expatriates in postliberation
 Kuwait andtook special interest in alleviating the problems of
 the bidoon. The Government did not recognize the Association
 but did.not interfere with the group's work.
 --The Kuwait Committee for Human Rights, in existence prior to
 the invasion, was a government-sponsored body charged with
 working with international human rights groups. Until May the
 Committee was responsible for collecting information on Kuwaiti
 detainees in Iraq but subsequently took a less active role.
 The Committee is headed by the Under Secretary of the Justice
 Ministry.
 In 1991 the Kuwaiti Government took a generally cooperative
 approach toward international organizations and private
 agencies concerned with human rights. Representatives of
 Amnesty International, Middle East Watch, the Lawyers'
 Committee for Human Rights, Physicians for Human Rights, and
 other groups were allowed to visit Kuwait, sometimes
 repeatedly, and to document the postliberation human rights
 situation. Kuwaiti Justice Ministry officials invited human
 rights observers to monitor martial law court proceedings, and
 officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice
 often met with these representatives.
 Government officials also cooperated with international
 humanitarian organizations, including the ICRC, the League of
 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (Licross), International
 Organization for Migration (IOM), and the UNHCR. ICRC
 delegates arrived in March with the concurrence of the Kuwaiti
 Government to begin monitoring the status of persons in
 
 
 1481
 KUWAIT
 detention. Kuwaiti responsiveness to ICRC requests for access
 to detention sites led to an improvement in detention
 conditions. When concerns were expressed over Kuwait's
 deportations of expatriates to Iraq in May and June, the ICAC
 was able to obtain Kuwaiti agreement to ICRC monitoring of
 deportation operations to ensure that they met the relevant
 international standards. In April the Government invited
 Licross and IOM delegates to begin work at the Abdali refugee
 camp to ensure the provision of adequate relief care to camp
 residents and to facilitate transportation of
 third-country-nationals to their countries of origin. In
 August the UNHCR was invited to screen both Abdali camp
 residents and those Iraqis who refused deportation to Iraq for
 potential refugee status. Government officials expressed
 interest in continued cooperation with international
 humanitarian organizations in order to improve the overall
 human rights situation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kuwaiti women are alloted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are unable by tradition to
 choose freely their role in society. Nevertheless, some
 Kuwaiti women have'been outspoken in their demand for a broader
 role in society, particularly in the aftermath of the
 occupation. During the occupation, Kuwaiti women took an
 active and critical role in resistance activities; a number
 were killed, tortured, and raped for their involvement. In
 postliberation Kuwait, this active role translated into public
 calls for granting womens' suffrage. The Amir and the Crown
 Prince 'said on several occasions that the Government was
 studying the possibility of granting women the right to vote in
 the near future. Kuwaiti women are permitted to drive cars,
 may wear Western dress in public, and have access to higher
 education inside and outside the country, Women have the right
 to litigate against men, for example, in child custody cases.
 In recent years, more Kuwaiti women joined the work force and
 competed for government and corporate employment. Some women
 reached senior government positions, up to the level of
 assistant under secretary and director general.
 Article 60 of the Kuwaiti Criminal Law of 1960 states that a
 person who "beats or injures or causes bodily harm or exposes
 another person's body to disrespect" may be sentenced to
 imprisonment for a period of 2 years and be subject to a fine.
 Violence against women in postliberation Kuwait was known to
 occur, but little is known about its extent (rape and
 mutilation of women by Iraqi occupation forces is detailed in
 Section l.c.) Although physical and sexual abuse of expatriate
 women is punishable by law, after liberation there were
 widespread reports of abuse and rape of expatriate women
 working as domestic servants. Domestic servants and other
 expatriate women are able to take legal recourse against their
 employers for such abuse, but incidents generally go unreported
 because of fear of reprisals.
 Before the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1986,
 Islamic groups within that body were able to secure a bar on
 the granting of citizenship to non-Muslims. The Government
 accommodated the National Assembly's demands for the
 application of some fundamentalist principles but blocked
 attempts to apply Islamic law across the board. Commercial law
 is based on Western practice. Expatriates are prohibited from
 having majority ownership in any significant business and are
 
 
 1482
 KUWAIT
 not allowed to own property. Significant labor restrictions
 continued to be applied to expatriates, although the rule that
 expatriates must work for their initial employer for at least 3
 years before working at another-job was ignored in practice by
 Kuwaiti employers following liberation.
 There was no evidence of discrimination among citizens in the
 idministration of Kuwait's extensive welfare programs, but
 members of Kuwait's Shi'a minority are less likely to be
 appointed to sensitive government positions. The Government
 did stop providing free education to those expatriate children
 who continued to attend school during the Iraqi occupation.
 Expatriates continued to enjoy access to free medical care.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 During the occupation, the Iraqi authorities attempted to
 eliminate the Kuwaiti labor movement. The headquarters of the
 Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF) was ransacked, and union
 membership records were either stolen or destroyed. Some
 members of the KTUF leadership were arrested, and at least
 three died as a result of ill-treatment. There was no evidence
 that the Iraqi occupation authorities respected worker rights.
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to establish and join unions,
 but Kuwaiti law prevents the establishment of more than one
 union per functional area. After liberation, approximately 90
 percent of Kuwait's preinvasion total of 27,000 trade union
 members, organized into 14 unions, had reregistered. All but
 two of the 14 unions, the Bank Workers Union and the Kuwait
 Airways Workers Union, are affiliated with the KTUF.
 Expatriate workers, who comprised about 80 percent of the
 roughly 700,000-strong preinvasion work force, were permitted
 by law to join unions after 5 years' residence but only as
 nonvoting members. In practice, expatriates interested in
 union membership were able to join within a year or less after
 starting employment and residency in Kuwait. Kuwaiti labor law
 stipulates that any new union must include at least 100
 workers, 15 of whom have to be Kuwaiti. Unions are independent
 organizations, though the Government maintains a large
 oversight role with regard to union financial records; 90
 percent of union budgets are in the form of government
 subsidies. Unions must also follow a standard format for
 internal rules and constitutions, which includes a prohibition
 of any involvement in domestic political, sectarian, or
 religious issues; in practice, these prescriptions are
 generally neither observed nor enforced.
 The vast majority of union members are Kuwaitis. Expatriates
 made up only 15 percent of membership prior to the invasion and
 less than 5 percent after liberation. The KTUF, grouping
 together nine civil service unions and three oil sector unions,
 is a member of the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 The right to strike is recognized but is limited by Kuwait's
 Labor Law, which provides for compulsory negotiation followed
 by arbitration if a settlement cannot be reached between labor
 and management (see Section 6.b.). There were no strikes in
 1991.
 
 
 1483
 KUWAIT
 Under the law, a union may be dissolved by a court decision for
 violating labor law or laws concerning the "preservation of
 public order and morals"; such a court decision may be
 appealed. The Amir may also dissolve a union by decree. No
 union has been dissolved in either manner. Union members have
 the right to elect representatives of their own choosing
 provided the candidates can demonstrate no criminal record.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively, subject to the restrictions cited above. Union
 rights are incorporated in the Labor Law and have generally
 been respected In practice. Antiunion discrimination is
 prohibited by law. There were no reports of discrimination
 against union or nonunion employees-
 Kuwaiti labor law provides for direct negotiations between
 employers and "laborers or their representatives" in the
 private sector. If an amicable agreement is not reached, the
 parties may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor
 for settlement. If no agreed solution is reached by this
 means, the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration board
 composed of officials representing the High Court of Appeals,
 the Attorney General's office, and the Ministry of Social
 Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law makes no stipulation for collective
 bargaining between government union workers and their
 employers. Civil Service wages are administratively set by the
 Gdvernment. In practice, government workers' representatives
 and ministry officials hold coordination meetings on a periodic
 basis. If no agreement is reached between the individual-
 ministry-and its workers, the i'ssue is raised to the Council of
 Ministers, whose chairman, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister,
 is also chairman of the Civil Service Council. Union officials
 are able to resolve most issues at the working level and
 enjoyed free access to the Crown Prince and other senior
 officials.
 There are no export zones in Kuwait, and labor laws are applied
 uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Durin- the Iraqi occupation, the Iraqi authorities-threatened
 to arrest and imprison anyone who did not report to work.
 Except for those in vital sectors such as oil, health care, and
 power and water, most Kuwaitisand some other residents of
 Kuwait boycotted work durinS the occupation.
 The Kuwaiti Constitution prohibits forced labor "except in
 cases specified by law for national emergency and with just
 remuneration." This prohibition appears to have been generally
 respected by the Kuwaiti Government.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age under Kuwaiti law is 18 years for all forms of
 work, both full- and part-time. This law appears to be
 generally observed although, in practice, some small
 businessmen, particularly shop owners, employ their children on
 a part-time basis. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor
 enforces minimum age regulations.- Employers can also obtain
 permits from the Ministry to employ juveniles between the ages
 
 
 1484
 
 KUWAIT
 of 14 and 18 in certain trades.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legal minimum wage in the private sector, but this
 has little impact on Kuwaitis since Kuwait is not a low-wage
 country. Unskilled expatriate laborers in the private sector,
 including domestic servants, receive substantially lower wages
 than Kuwaitis, although these wage rates are considerably
 higher than what they could expect to earn in their home
 countries. In the public sector, the minimum wage is
 sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 General conditions of work were established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sectors, with the oil
 industry treated separately. Kuwaiti civil service law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. The
 law limits the workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per
 week, provides for a minimum of 14 days leave per year, and
 establishes a compensation schedule for industrial accidents.
 Reflecting the impcrtance of the petroleum sector in Kuwait,
 the law governing employment in this sector is more generous
 than the general laws. It provides for a 40-hour workweek,
 overtime pay for shift work, 30 days' annual leave, and a
 generous sick leave policy which authorizes sick leave for as
 much as up to 2 years. Women are permitted to work, except in
 "dangerous industries and trades harmful to the health," and
 are promised "remuneration equal to that of a man provided she
 does the same work." Laws establishing work conditions are not
 always uniformly applied to expatriate workers.
 A 1979 ministerial decree created a permanent commission to
 coordinate activities in the field of public health and
 occupational safety. It had some success in raising safety
 awareness and improving government coordination. The Ministry
 of Social Affairs and Labor is responsible for enforcing the
 labor laws. The Government has issued occupational health and
 safety standards; however, compliance and enforcement appear to
 be spotty, especially for unskilled expatriate laborers.
 Iraq's invasion compelled an estimated 1 million expatriate
 workers and their families to flee Kuwait, with a resultant
 loss of livelihood and severe physical and financial hardship.
 After liberation, the Government announced that expatriates
 unable to return to Kuwait could make application for
 uncollected salaries and indemnity benefits at Kuwaiti
 embassies worldwide. In practice, expatriates drew up powers
 of attorney to authorize their relatives or other agents in
 Kuwait to collect benefits and close out personal affairs.
 In October 1990, the Government announced the termination of
 all expatriate government worker contracts retroactive to
 August 1, 1990. Despite the fact that expatriates continued
 working.in vital sectors, such as health care and power and
 water, the Government refused to provide remuneration for these
 persons for the period of the occupation. A large number of
 postliberation contracts for expatriate workers are generally
 of a short-term nature (up to 1 year), and payment is limited
 to "advances" as a percentage of salary, with payment of full
 salary deferred to a later date. Those expatriates who left
 the country were generally able to collect benefits and back
 salary up to August 1, 1990, prior to departure.
