 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 
 The human rights situation in the Central African Empire
 deteriorated sharply in 1979. Atrocities committed by
 Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa were in large measure respon-
 sible for his overthrow on September 20 and the re-
 establishment of the Central African Republic under
 former President David Dacko. An increased sense of
 political awareness and resentment of Bokassa's author-
 itarian rule, coupled with an accelerating economic
 decline, led to widespread riots in January which were
 brutally suppressed by the Emperor's forces. Political
 agitation continued, particularly among high school
 students, until in April the Emperor had some hundreds of
 schoolchildren arrested and over 100 were massacred with
 appalling cruelty in Bangui's Ngaragba prison. Amnesty
 International published accounts of the killings, which
 were later confirmed by a team of African jurists who
 visited Bangui in June. The jurists also stated that
 Bokassa had personally ordered the massacres and had
 almost certainly participated himself.
 Revulsion against these atrocities spread throughout the
 world. The Emperor was informed in June 1979 of a U.S.
 decision to terminate assistance to his country. In
 August, France, long the chief source of economic aid,
 announced the withdrawal of all support except in the
 areas of food, health and education. On September 20
 David Dacko arrived in Bangui supported by several hundred
 French soldiers and proclaimed the re-establishment of a
 Republic.   The take-over was unopposed, and Bokassa, who
 was away at the time of the coup, has found asylum in the
 Ivory Coast. The new government is publicly and profoundly
 dedicated to improving human rights practices in the
 Central African Republic. However, the implementation of
 this commitment will be difficult. Political institutions
 have been corrupted and discredited, and the economic
 picture is bleak despite resumption of French and other
 assistance. Although the constitution proclaimed by
 Bokassa in 1976 has been abrogated, the CAR judicial
 system with the exception of the Supreme Court has resumed
 most functions. The creation of political, governmental
 and other institutions which can guarantee the government's
 viability and assure appropriate regard for human rights
 may prove a long and complicated process. Despite these
 problems, however, prospects for an improved human rights
 record in the Central African Republic are good.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Bokassa regime was characterized by brutality and was
 responsible for numerous atrocities. The new government
 has made no public statement specifically prohibiting
 torture but its overall commitment to human rights suggests
 that torture will not occur.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prison conditions during Bokassa's reign were often
 
 
 39
 shocking, and the slaughter of schoolchildren described
 above was a particularly heinous incident. Although
 prison conditions are still substandard, there has been a
 marked improvement in the treatment of prisoners since the
 Emperor's overthrow. About 20 officials allegedly in-
 volved in the killings and 30 others closely connected
 with Bokassa's rule are being held at Ngaragba, but their
 treatment, as confirmed by press and television visits to
 the prison, has not been harsh. Families and represent-
 atives of the ICRC and similar organizations have access
 to prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary imprisonment, frequently clandestine, was
 commonplace under Bokassa's rule and many prisoners were
 held for long periods without trial or simply disappeared.
 The new regime has not yet established institutional
 prohibitions against arbitrary arrest, and the absence of
 a codified judicial system complicates trial procedures
 except for minor criminal and property cases.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials for major offenders were a rarity
 under the Emperor despite constitutional and legal guaran-
 tees. The Republican Government has announced that the
 judicial system Vill ensure that laws (patterned on the
 French system) are properly executed and that legal
 procedures are fairly and openly applied.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The imperial constitution guaranteed inviolability of
 the home but this commitment was frequently and blatantly
 ignored in the last months of Bokassa's rule. At present
 there is no constitutional safeguard for the sanctity of
 the home, but in practice this right is being generally
 respected.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education:
 Within the limited resources available and with the
 assistance of foreign donors, the Empire had some success
 in implementing its commitment to improve the lot of
 individual Central Africans. However, Bokassa and some of
 his ministers embezzled huge sums from the country's
 sparse revenues and the overall economic picture deter-
 iorated. Lack of infrastructure, particularly transport,
 caused many farmers to abandon cash crops and return to
 subsistence agriculture and hunting. Over 80 percent of
 the population is involved in rural agriculture and the
 problems of establishing and implementing a development
 program are overwhelming. The Republican government is
 committed to economic development and has announced its
 intention to stress basic human needs as well as infra-
 structure. Several foreign donors and international
 financial institutions have indicated a readiness to make
 large-scale contributions to assist the Republic's economic
 development. The organization and coordination of these
 efforts will probably be beyond the country's capabilities
 and may require substantial numbers of foreign experts.
 
 
 Even with massive assistance the Central African Republic
 will remain for some years among the poorest countries of
 the world. Education has received substantial government
 support, but no more than 25 percent of the country is
 literate. Health care is substandard and in many parts of
 the country non-existent. Bokassa's depredations and the
 country's overall economic decline have left many Central
 Africans disillusioned and suspicious of government
 efforts in their behalf. The country is not without
 resources and the economy is based pragmatically on a
 capitalist system with some state involvement, but the
 fulfillment of vital needs for the Republic's population
 will be a long and costly process.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of religion was respected in theory and practice
 under the Empire. Religious organizations and missionary
 groups were protected by the constitution and in practice,
 and it is anticipated that religious freedoms will be
 continued under the Republic. Press and television were
 rigidly controlled by Emperor Bokassa. The press was
 carefully censored, foreign journalists were harassed, and
 on one celebrated occasion in 1977 an American journalist
 was beaten and detained by the Emperor. This situation
 has been greatly modified under President Dacko, who has
 stopped censorship, assured freedom of the press and
 generally permitted free access for journalists. However,
 a French journalist who interviewed an opposition figure
 accused of inciting demonstrations against Dacko was
 expelled in October 1979.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Although there are security checks for travelers, there
 are few limitations on movement within the country.
 Financial and educational constraints rather than Government
 controls restrict foreign travel and emigration. In his
 last months Bokassa intensified control over travel and
 emigration, but the new Government has removed these
 restrictions and liberalized travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Bokassa regime was dictatorial, and the Emperor's
 control over his government, the armed forces, the judiciary
 and the sole political party was absolute. Local elections
 to town and city councils were held in July 1979 but
 under strict limitations and, in one instance, the Emperor
 nullified an election because he disapproved of the
 winning candidate. Trade unions which had been abolished
 in 1977 were reestablished in 1979, but again were answer-
 able directly to Bokassa. Trade union activity will
 continue, apparently free of control by the Dacko govern-
 ment.
 President Dacko has announced that political parties may
 be established and can function freely, and has promised
 general elections within two years. Organization of
 political institutions in the CAR's current chaotic
 
 
 political situation will be complicated and difficult.
 Elections will probably be impossible until after the
 establishment of formal constitutional procedures.
 Women were legally equal to men under the imperial consti-
 tution, and several women held high office in the Govern-
 ment and in the imperial court. The Republican Government
 intends to continue this practice, although no women
 were named to President Dacko's first cabinet. In rural
 areas of Central Africa, however, women generally remain
 in their traditional subservient role.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Amnesty International allegations concerning the April
 1979 massacres were vehemently and categorically denied by
 Emperor Bokassa. However, he and his government welcomed
 and facilitated the visit of a commission of African
 jurists to investigate the Amnesty International charges.
 The Commission interviewed students, teachers, and govern-
 ment officials; and its report, published in July, was one
 of the principal causes of Bokassa's overthrow. No
 international organization so far has attempted to examine
 the Republic's attitude regarding such investigations, but
 every indication'is that President Dacko and his government
 will be receptive to outside investigations of alleged
 violations of human rights.
