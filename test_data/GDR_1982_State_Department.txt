 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic is a one-party, centralized
 state ruled by its Communist Party, the Socialist Unity Party.
 The country was created out of the former Soviet occupation
 zone of Germany following World War II. Some 400,000 Soviet
 troops are still stationed in the country. There remain
 profound historical, cultural and familial ties between its
 people and those of the Federal Republic of Germany. These are
 kept alive by West German radio and television broadcasts,
 which can be received in most of East Germany, and by millions
 of visits annually by West Germans. Concern for this constant
 exposure to Western ideas has led the East German regime to
 exercise extremely tight control over its citizens. The role
 of the Soviet Union in underpinning party control has also led
 to almost total East German subservience to Soviet foreign
 policy and security interests.
 The German Democratic Republic has a highly industrialized and
 centrally planned economy. Only a small percentage of net
 national product is produced by private enterprise. The
 standard of living is high by both world and communist-bloc
 standards. There is relatively small variation in wages and
 little real poverty. Supplies of basic goods and services are
 usually adequate except for a serious housing shortage which
 exists especially in urban areas. There is an extensive
 welfare system, free education, and full medical care. Access
 to higher quality social services is often dependent on
 demonstrated political loyalty. Women are fully integrated
 into the workforce: 87.6 percent work or are in vocational
 training, mainly because of the prevailing labor shortage.
 Women have equal rights and are well represented up to the
 middle management level. However, few women hold positions of
 authority in the state, or in the economic hierarchies.
 The East German regime does not permit the exercise of civil or
 political rights which contest state policy or doctrine.
 Freedom of speech, press, or assembly is not guaranteed.
 Permissible political activity is determined by the party.
 Freedom of religion is allowed, but active or devout believers
 usually face educational and career discrimination. The regime
 does not permit freedom of movement. There is no systematic,
 organized pattern of physical torture or cruel and unusual
 punishment. Amnesty International receives occasional reports
 of beatings and other forms of prisoner maltreatment. While
 there is no known political murder, individuals attempting to
 flee the country are fired upon by border guards whose orders
 are to shoot the individual rather than allow an escape. There
 are also automatic firing devices and minefields at places
 -along East Germany's borders with the Federal Republic. Many
 escape attempts result in death. Laws in East Germany are
 often vague and open to subjective interpretation by the'
 authorities. Investigations, arrests, and trials can easily be
 manipulated by the executive authorities for political
 purposes. The German Democratic Republic has always been a
 tightly-controlled police state. There are no trends to
 indicate that liberalization is a realistic prospect.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no known executions for political reasons in the
 German Democratic Republic during 1982. Border guards,
 
 
 902
 however, do shoot and often kill citizens who attempt to leave
 the country without official permission. The number of deaths
 has dropped in recent years because of the demonstrated
 efficiency and deadly effect of the border control system and
 the Berlin Wall. On March 25, 1982, the East German
 legislature passed a law making it the legal duty of border
 guards to use weapons to stop "border violations," including
 unauthorized departures. While shooting escapees is not new,
 such orders had earlier been contained only in military
 .directives. They are now codified in public law, and soldiers
 can be prosecuted for not following these orders.
 b. Disappearance
 Prolonged or permanent disappearance is not known to have
 occurred in the GDR in 1982
 c. Torture
 There were no known reports of systematic, organized physical
 torture in East Germany in 1982. Although there are no GDR
 laws explicitly outlawing torture, the country is a signatory
 of the international covenant on civil and political rights,
 which took effect in the German Democratic Republic in 1976.
 Specific GDR laws state that the life, health and ability to
 work of arrestees and prisoners must not be jeopardized during.
 confinement. However, arrestees have reported long,
 uninterrupted interrogations with denial of sleep, food and
 drink, followed by intense pressure to sign a statement
 certifying humane treatment.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Fragmentary information on prison conditions comes mostly from
 former inmates who have emigrated. There are frequent
 allegations of cruel and inhuman treatment in East German
 prisons. The allegations are almost all against prisons
 operated by the Interior Ministry, where inmates serve
 sentences after conviction. The Ministry for State Security
 controls the pre-trial prisons where interrogations are
 conducted; there prisoners generally seem to be treated
 better. Though isolated cases of solitary confinement and
 mistreatment during interrogation occur, the principal methods
 used to elicit information appear to be constant questioning
 and promises of leniency in return for information.
 Beatings by guards and other inhumane punishment for minor
 infractions or on trumped-up charges appear to occur frequently
 in the post-conviction prisons. Sometimes the prisoner, after
 being severely beaten, is denied medical care and placed in an
 isolation cell for weeks without adequate heat, food, or
 sanitary conditions. Some prisoners have reportedly died from
 lack of medical treatment of their injuries. Suicides and
 suicide attempts are said to occur regularly in prisons. In
 some instances, prisoners have reported finding fellow inmates
 dead under conditions pointing to foul play by prison guards,
 though prison officials list the deaths as suicides.
 Inmates convicted of common crimes and political crimes are
 mixed together and generally treated identically. Prison
 conditions are reportedly inadequate in several respects,
 including over-crowding in cells, poor food, and inadequate
 sanitary facilities. Although prisoners are supposed to have
 access to medical facilities, prisoners with severe medical
 problems are allegedly refused care. There are also
 
 
 903
 allegations of scarcity of medications and treatment by
 personnel with little or no medical training. Given the
 relative prosperity of East Germany, these inadequacies seem
 due more to a lack of concern than resources. There have been
 no reports in recent years of the use of the death penalty.
 Prisoners, except those being punished for violations of prison
 regulations, are generally allowed to have two visitors per
 month.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The East German penal code is so vaguely written that it is not
 always clear what objectively constitutes an offense. Many
 political actions are defined as criminal. For example, the
 penal code provides that a person can be sentenced up to three
 years for 'making available writing, objects, or symbols which
 are collected in order to prejudice the state of public order,
 to disturb the socialist community or to bring contempt upon
 the state of social order.' Transmitting information (even if
 it is not secret) to a foreign organization can be considered
 treason. This law has not been rigorously enforced, but it has
 inhibited East German contacts with foreign journalists and
 diplomats. Attempting to flee the country or helping someone
 to do so is considered a political crime. A few people are
 known to have been arrested simply because they applied for
 permission to emigrate and refused to withdraw their
 application. The-authorities consider this "agitation against
 the state.*
 There are no firm figures on how many political prisoners there
 are in East Germany, but estimates from private human rights
 groups range from 4,000-5,000. There are very few, if any,
 political prisoners being held for violent acts. Amnesty
 International reports the majority of its cases in the German
 Democratic Republic are those of individuals who sought to
 leave the country.
 The right of habeas corpus does not exist in East Germany.
 Under the criminal procedures code, a person can be held up to
 three months before charges are filed. Moreover, the public
 prosecutor may extend the detention period indefinitely until
 the investigation is finished. This has occurred in several
 political cases.
 No specific charge need be brought to detain a citizen under
 house arrest. According to the law on house arrest of 1981,
 the public prosecutor can, with the approval of a court, order
 the house arrest of a person, 'even if a violation of a
 particular law has not occurred,' if this person is considered
 to be a threat to public security and order.
 In most political cases, it takes longer than 24 hours -- often
 many weeks -- before interested parties are notified. The
 public prosecutor may postpone notification of the relatives
 and employer of the prisoner if *the objective of the
 investigation would be endangered by the notification. The
 notification will then take place immediately after the
 elimination of the grounds of endangerment.'
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although East German law provides for a fair public trial for
 all defendants, a judge can authorize a closed trial if he
 determines the case affects public order or the security of the
 state. There is no hearing prior to the judge's decision and
 
 
 904
 no appeal from it. Additionally, the judge can, on the same
 grounds, ban selected individuals or groups from open trials.
 Identity checks outside courtrooms where sensitive trials are
 held can also close trials de facto, since routinely the police
 turn away those who have "no business" there. Virtually all
 political trials are closed. Although defendants are
 guaranteed the right to a lawyer of their choice, there are
 many hindrances to effective counsel. For instance, a
 defendant is often not allowed to pick a lawyer until a few
 days before the trial, or to discuss the specifics of the case
 with his lawyer until the investigation is completed and formal
 charges are brought, which may be a period of months. The
 defense attorney must also receive permission to meet his
 client in private, and there is no guarantee that this will be
 granted. Trials tend to be short and perfunctory. In cases
 with high political interest, there are no known cases of
 acquittal of the defendant. The courts constitutionally are
 under the control of the Council of State, but are in reality
 controlled by the party. The party appoints judges, and a
 judge may be recalled at any time by the state. Military
 courts try civilians only in military espionage cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The police have the authority to enter a home almost at will.
 By law, they need an authorization to enter and search a house,
 but the police can authorize entry themselves, and the courts
 will retroactively give approval. The authorities reportedly
 do not investigate complaints of abuse. The police do not have
 to give a receipt if they confiscate materials in a home.
 It is routine and legal for the state security organs, solely
 on their own authority, to tap telephones and open mail.
 Evidence collected in these ways are used in court. The
 authorities reportedly practice these methods and "bug" houses
 on a regular basis. East Germans often claim to detect
 bugging, mail opening, and physical surveillance if they have
 unusual contacts with Westerners or otherwise arouse the
 curiosity of the state security services. There is also a
 widespread belief that undercover state security service
 informera are active in every apartment house, work unit, and
 even local bar.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The media are Government-controlled and censored. Western
 publications are not allowed in East Germany, unless they are
 politically acceptable, such as the newspapers of Western
 communist parties. Border officials confiscate Western
 publications carried by travelers to East Germany. An East
 German citizen can be arrested and interrogated for simply
 possessing such publications or for passing them to others.
 Except for theology, all areas of intellectual inquiry are
 controlled by the party and the state.
 Law and practice severely limit East German contacts with
 Western journalists. In spite of the restrictions, the
 Government-s aontrol'of information is greatly hindered because
 most East German citizens watch West German television and
 listen tosWest German radio broadcasts. The regime does not
 try to prevent its-citizens from receiving these broadcasts.
 It'does~however,,make a special propaganda effort to discredit
 Western media and to persuade East Germans not to listen.
 
 
 905
 Many literary figures who have published works in the West
 critical of the regime have been encouraged to emigrate, many
 after first being jailed. Individuals who publicly express
 'anti-socialist" views are frequently arrested. During 1982,
 many youths who began wearing armpatches depicting the Biblical
 quotation 'swords into ploughshares,' as symbols of their
 dedication to peace, were detained by police who forcibly
 removed the patch. This patch had been legally produced in
 East Germany as a symbol for a Lutheran Church sponsored peace
 discussion group. The state retroactively decided such signs
 of pacifism "harmed the socialist community.*
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of assembly. Individuals are not allowed
 to organize into groups which are not officially controlled,
 with the exception of the churches. The only trade union
 organization permitted is controlled by the Communist party.
 Strikes are not permitted. Trade union assemblies are rigidly
 controlled by the party as are any other non-ecclesiastical
 public meetings. They transmit party economic directives and
 propaganda for greater productivity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The freedom to practice religion is permitted within certain
 limits, although the state discourages such practice. Nearly
 50 percent of the population are members of the Lutheran
 Church. The Church has gained many concessions from the
 Government in recent years: e.g. applications for television
 broadcasts by the church are routinely approved; ministers are
 now allowed to work in the prisons; and several churches in new
 housing areas are being built. East German churches receive
 considerable financial aid from churches in the Federal
 Republic. The state does provide substantial funding for
 church hospitals, homes for the aged, child care centers, and
 cemetery maintenance. The churches, especially the Lutheran,
 often criticize government policies in certain areas without
 retaliation. The most serious problem facing the churches is
 the declining membership in the face of continuing
 discrimination against active church members.
 The other protestant churches (less than 1 percent of the
 population) and the Roman Catholic Church (less than 8 percent)
 are generally undisturbed.   Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian
 Scientists are prohibited. More than 40 percent of the total
 population is unaffilitated. The very small Jewish community
 receives Government financial support for its activities,
 including the building and maintenance of synagogues and the
 maintenance of an old-age home. There are no Jewish schools
 and no resident rabbi.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country is generally not controlled. Foreign
 travel is comparatively easy to the Soviet Union and Eastern
 European countries, except Poland. Travel to the West is
 almost impossible for most East German citizens under
 retirement age (60 for women, 65 for men). The sector line
 between East Berlin and West Berlin and the border between East
 and West Germany are among the most impregnable frontiers in
 the world. To cross the border without permission is a crime
 punishable by up to five years in prison. Though it is
 extremely dangerous, hundreds of East German citizens manage to
 
 
 906
 escape each year. Known incidents of wounding or death have
 fallen off substantially in recent years. Many East German
 citizens flee to the West via other East European countries.
 According to figures published in West Germany, 269 East
 Germans risked death to-escape-rover the rborder between January
 and November 1982:and another 2,123 left the country illegally
 via other-means.
 The German Democratic Republic contains no large refugee groups
 from other countries, though for local propaganda purposes the
 regime welcomes individual leftist refuges from abroad.
 Most East German citizens who depart legally are forced to give
 up their citizenship and wait five years before returning to
 visit. Individuals who left the country illegally before
 January 1, 1981, are eligible, under regulations issued in
 1982, to apply for permission to return to visit. Many are
 understandably reluctant to do so, and it is said that only
 about half of those who have applied have obtained visas. In
 June, the regime revoked East German citizenship for some
 50,000 East Germans who had fled to West Germany prior to
 January 1, 1981, thus enabling them to visit and transit East
 Germany without a priori eligibility for arrest.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The East German political system is totally dominated by the
 Socialist Unity (Communist) Party. Within this party
 *democratic centralism' is vigorously enforced, and decisions
 are taken by party leaders. Party members who disobey party
 direction are disciplined or expelled. The four other existing
 parties have no real power; their existence is a token of
 'democracy". All parties have their own newspapers, but all
 follow the Socialist Unity Party's policy lines. All important
 news articles have nearly identical texts. All citizens are
 required to vote, although there is only a single list of
 candidates on the ballot. A citizen can be imprisoned for
 refusing to vote. Refusal to vote or to approve the single
 list is obvious because balloting is not secret, and dissenters
 face such penalties as discrimination in housing or
 employment.
 The Lutheran Church provides a limited forum for political
 discussion outside state controls. Some individuals who have
 been critical of government policies in these discussions have
 been the object of government retaliation.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government has taken the position that inquiries into its
 human rights policies are interference in the internal affairs
 of the country. Requests by Amnesty International and other
 private human rights groups in the West for information about
 human rights conditions have not been answered. The Government
 does not permit visits by these groups. The official East
 German committee for human rights is a propaganda organization
 which attacks human rights conditions in Western countries
 while claiming that there are no human rights violations in
 East Germany. No unofficial human rights groups exist in the
 country, although emigre groups in West Berlin occasionally
 publicize cases of denial of human rights. Allegations of
 human rights violations are presently under consideration by
 the U.N. Commission on Human Rights under the confidential
 procedures of ECOSOC Resolution 1503.
 
 
 907
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation.
 The German Democratic Republic has a highly-industrialized
 and centrally-planned economy. It is generally an importer of
 raw materials and an exporter of manufactured goods. All large
 industrial, retail, and agricultural operations are
 state-owned, but small private businesses with fewer than 10
 employees are allowed. According to official East German
 statistics, 2.9 percent of the net national product is produced
 by private enterprise.
 It is difficult to devise precise statistical comparisons
 between East Germany's standard of living and that of other
 countries because of the manner in which data is compiled in
 East Germany. The country, however, has a relatively high
 standard of living, possibly the highest in the communist
 bloc. According to the World Bank, per capita income in 1979
 was $6,430. According to official East German statistics, the
 economy's rate of expansion has remained at about four percent
 over the last few years, although the growth rate in 1982 was
 about three percent.
 Almost all East German citizens can be considered middle-class,
 although a small number of political and industrial leaders
 live in relative opulence. There is little real poverty in the
 country. Over the last five years the average monthly income
 of an East German worker has climbed at an annual rate of about
 three percent, but this growth rate is declining.
 Prices of basic goods and services have remained stable
 throughout the last decade because of heavy government
 subsidies. The caloric supply available for consumption is 139
 percent of the nutritional requirement. Most outside observers
 believe that prices have been rising slowly over the last few
 years. Shortages of consumer goods are periodic but not
 pervasive. Supplies of basic goods and services are usually
 adequate, but other consumer goods such as bed linen, candles,
 and furniture often disappear from the stores for long
 periods. During 1982, there were periodic shortages of meat,
 butter, and cooking oil.
 The most serious shortage in East Germany is housing,
 especially in the cities. This is partly a result of the
 damage caused in World War II, plus underinvestment in
 housing. Residents of Berlin usually wait more than 18 months
 for housing if they are single and often more than one year if
 they are married. The Government is committed to a major
 housing construction program lasting until 1990; it has made
 good progress during the 1970's.
 Special privileges for housing, foreign travel, education, and
 consumer goods exist for people in certain job categories.
 These special benefits can be much more important than wages in
 determining status and living standard, and thus they tend to
 create a privileged class. Many people in the religious
 communities complain of discrimination in employment and
 education.
 There is an extensive welfare system which includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents. In 1980
 there were about 284,000 places in pre-school care centers for
 children under the age of 3 (in that year the East German
 population included 702,000 children under 3). Free medical
 care is also provided. In 1980, per 1,000 citizens East
 Germany had 2.03 doctors, .58 dentists, and 10.3 hospital
 
 
 908
 beds. There were approximately 13 deaths in the first year of
 life for every 1,000 births. Life expectancy at birth is 72
 years. Free and universal education is supplied through the
 12th grade, and 94 percent of all school-age children attend
 school. Approximately 92 percent of male children and 95
 percent of female children attend school. Literacy is almost
 universal; however, there is not enough room in the
 institutions of higher learning for all those who wish to
 continue their education. Competition is keen for these
 spaces, and allocation is usually made on the basis of the
 political acceptability of the applicant. In 1981, there were
 about 78 college or university students per 10,000 people.
 Social services are provided to rural residents as well as to
 urban dwellers. In 1980 the Government devoted approximately 6
 percent of its budget expenditures to education, 5.9 percent to
 medical and social services, and 20 percent to social insurance
 and pensions.
 In economic matters, women are treated more or less equal to
 men. Their salaries are generally equivalent. About 87.6
 percent of women of working age are actually employed, compared
 to about 88 percent of the men. Women can be found in
 significant proportions in all professions except the militia.
 For example, 44 percent of the industrial work force is female,
 as are 42 percent of those employed in agriculture and
 forestry. There are very few women, however, in the highest
 positions of the party, government, economy, and the
 professions. In the medical and other professions women are
 probably more numerous than in western nations, but they seldom
 rise to supervisory positions in hospitals and similar
 facilities.
