 CAMEROON
 Political power in Cameroon is concentrated in the Presidency
 and a single party, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement
 (CPDM). President Paul Biya is Head of State and president of
 the CPDM. He makes all major decisions and appoints all senior
 government and party officials. Members of the 180-deputy
 National Assembly may initiate bills and amend measures
 proposed by the Government. However, in practice, provisions
 the Government finds inimical are never brought to a vote by
 the full house. Cameroon's political system is influenced by
 its ethnic and linguistic diversity, which comprises 230
 languages and major dialects and 3 separate European colonial
 traditiGns (German, French, and British). Balance among the
 various groups is required to maintain political cohesion,
 which acts as a check on government power.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national
 police, the national intelligence service (CENER), the
 gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Administration
 (MINAT), military intelligence (SEMIL), the army, and, to a
 lesser extent, the presidential security service. MINAT is in
 charge of prisons, and its local-level officials (prefects)
 play a key role in ensuring order. The gendarmerie and the
 police have the dominant role in enforcing internal security
 laws. In the 7 of the country's 10 provinces which experienced
 significant unrest during the year, all security forces were
 under the nominal command of an "'operational commander" from
 late May until early December. In 1991 there were numerous
 credible reports of human rights abuses committed by security
 forces.
 Cameroon's per capita gross- domestic product (GDP) of about
 $1,000 in 1989 placed it among the lower middle-income
 developing countries, a slight decline from 1988. Preliminary
 data indicated that GDP declined again in 1991. Cameroon's
 food self-sufficiency helps mitigate the effects of declining
 terms of trade and other external difficulties.
 The human rights climate in Cameroon deteriorated sharply in
 1991. In several cases, there was evidence of government
 tolerance for human rights abuses and throughout much of the
 year of government inaction in the face of widespread,
 continuing abuses. Continuing human rights abuses included
 extrajudicial killings, torture and other mistreatment of
 prisoners, harsh prison conditions, repeated arbitrary arrest
 and detention, restrictions on freedoms of speech and assembly,
 and limitations on women's and worker rights. Starting in the
 spring, there were a number of serious incidents and abuses,
 some of which caused many civilian deaths. Beginning in April
 with student protests and continuing with general strikes
 called by the opposition, public demonstrations often met
 brutal repression by security forces. In addition, the
 Government banned six associations, closed newspapers it found
 troublesome, and harassed the political opposition, using
 arbitrary arrest and detention and administrative
 restrictions. This repression abated somewhat at year's end.
 Responding to pressure for reform, President Biya in October
 announced that multiparty elections to the National Assembly
 would be held in 1992, in accordance with procedures developed
 in coordination with the opposition political parties.
 However, sharp disagreements between the Government and the
 opposition, and within the opposition itself, left it unclear
 at year's end whether a date could-be agreed on. During the
 year, the Government legally recognized over 40 political
 
 
 43
 CAMEROON
 parties, permitted the return of a number of political exiles,
 and released over 100 persons imprisoned for political reasons
 or who had never been tried.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were over 100 instances of extrajudicial killing in
 Cameroon during 1991. These instances varied widely, from
 police beating a baker to death in Mbouda to mob lynching of a
 gendarme in Douala and to ethnic clashes in Meiganga. Often
 the deaths occurred during the heat of a confrontation between
 security forces and crowds protesting against government
 policies. Victims included security officers as well as
 civilians.
 Among the many examples was the incident at Yaounde University
 on May 6. -Students and many others claim that at least 3 and
 as many as 20 students were killed after the gendarmerie
 intervened to break up a meeting of a student organization. A
 government-named special commission found no evidence that
 security forces had killed anyone, but many persons claim that
 fear of retribution kept potential witnesses from providing.
 testimony that would have constrained the commission to find
 otherwise.
 In mid-April confrontations between security forces and
 political demonstrators led to between two and nine deaths in
 Ngaoundere, capital of Adamaoua Province. A son of the local
 traditional ruler and at least one security officer were among
 those killed. Following a night of disorder, on April .19,
 including vandalism and some physical violence, a young woman
 who was 5 months pregnant was brutally tortured and sexually
 abused by security forces, leading to her death (see Section
 lc.).
 Credible reports indicated that the authorities in the Adamaoua
 Province town of Meiganqa exploited longstanding ethnic
 tensions in an effort to break the opposition-led general
 strike, known as "Operation Ghost Towns." In mid-July these
 tensions boiled over into an interethnic skirmish which left at
 least 40 dead. As far as is known, there was .po investigation
 into the circumstances leading to this trageejbr-%f the many
 instances of killings by security forces during 1951.
 In early September, a retired archbishop was strangled at his
 home in Ngaoundere shortly after he met with President Biya.
 It is widely believed that political motives prompted the
 murder  however, the'police investigation was neither energetic
 nor thorough and has not produced any suspects.
 b. Disappearance
 Various sources reported that between 53 and 68 students
 disappeared following the May. 6 incident at Yaounde
 University. All but one of these persons were accounted for
 soon thereafter by a special commission. The unreliability of
 student registration rolls complicated efforts to follow up on
 allegations of disappearance.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Penal Code proscribes torture, renders
 inadmissible in court evidence obtained thereby, and prohibits
 public servants from using force against any person, there were
 many credible reports of security forces inflicting severe
 beatings, systematic torture, and other inhumane treatment
 during 1991. Sanctions against those responsible are almost
 unknown. Investigations are rare because abused persons
 frequently fear reprisals against themselves and their families
 in the event they lodge a complaint. Prison conditions are
 abominable, though overcrowding in the major Douala and Yaounde
 prisons eased somewhat in 1991.
 Among the examples of brutality by security forces and of harsh
 prison conditions was the case of the pregnant woman mentioned
 in Section l.a. Prior to her death, she told a Western
 diplomat that she had suffered repeated mistreatment, including
 regular, severe beatings, denial of food and exercise, and, on
 the first night in prison, being forced to strip naked and
 share a 12 square-meter cell with 20 naked male prisoners.
 Shortly after making these reports, she was returned to
 Ngaoundere Prison, where she was reportedly interrogated about
 her discussions with the Western diplomat and subjected to
 further mistreatment, including being repeatedly raped. When
 she fell into a coma, she was returned to the hospital, where
 she died, chained to her bed.
 Other examples included severe police beatings in January of a
 group of persons demonstrating peacefully for the release of
 political prisoners in Garoua, capital of the North Province.
 They had disobeyed an order to disperse and sat on the ground.
 The responsible civil administrator was later transferred to an
 equivalent position in another area. Following unrest in
 Yaounde on April 2, state television showed security officers
 beating the bottoms of the feet of two prisoners seated on the
 ground. An article in the government-owned newspaper reporting
 the trial of a man suspected of stealing a sewing machine
 stated in part: the suspect "denied that charge...but he later
 succumbed to the allegations under torture." On another
 occasion, the government newspaper reported that an angry mob
 burned the houses of six gendarmes after the security officers
 beat five suspects about the feet and legs so badly that the
 men could no longer walk.
 In another instance, in the town of Mora, gendarmes beat dozens
 of suspects following arson attacks on their homes provoked by
 the May 16 shooting death of a local youth. In several cases,
 heads of households were stripped naked in front of their wives
 and children by gendarmes and police, a practice calculated to
 inflict special humiliation in this heavily Muslim area. Naked
 prisoners at the gendarmerie brigade in Mora were crowded in
 large numbers into a small holding cell devoid of sanitary
 facilities. At least 30 persons were later transferred to the
 gendarmerie legion headquarters in Maroua, where gendarmes
 subjected the detainees to beatings and other torture and
 degrading treatment twice each day for 15 days. Prisoners were
 kicked, had the bottoms of their feet beaten, were swung from
 the wrists and ankles, were ordered to pray and then beaten
 about the head for so doing, and were compelled to engage in
 acts of sodomy. Many showed scarring on wrists, hands, and
 lower legs consistent with the type of mistreatment they said
 they suffered. Some had medical certificates describing their
 injuries.
 
 
 CAMEROON
 Security forces grossly mistreated opposition figures
 throughout the year; there was no evidence of government action
 or intention to put an end to it. On July 5, military, police,
 and gendarmes sealed a group of opposition leaders inside the
 private home of Cameroon Democratic Union President Adamou
 Ndam-Njoya. As others arrived to join the meeting, they were
 forced to undergo humiliating treatment. For example,
 according to an eyewitness report, one leader of a minor party
 was forced to walk the length of the street on his knees,
 resulting in ruined trousers and bloody knees.
 In another incident, members of several opposition political
 parties were meeting on the premises of a Douala computer
 assembly company on August 4 when police and gendarmes entered
 the cdmpound ,firing guns and tear gas canisters. Also present
 and armed were a local administrative officer and an official
 of the ruling CPDM. Those captured were split into two groups,
 one of which was taken to the-gendarmerie legion headquarters
 where eyewitnesses report they saw about 100 naked men and
 women being forced to walk on knees and elbows across gravel
 for over an hour. After 2 nights spent in the mud and rain,
 the prisoners were split into.groups of about 20 and placed in
 underground cells about 20 meters square with.no beds and only
 a sink for plumbing. After 7 days, they were moved.to
 windowless cells in another location, where they were forced to
 sleep in a mixture of excrement and water in small cells
 lacking plumbing of any kind. During this time, one female
 detainee was denied access to her child to breastfeed it.
 On August 21, following a confrontation between security forces
 and the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) in'Bafoussam,
 10 soldiers badly battered a number of civilians, prompting the
 Catholic Bishop to protest to the West Province Governor. In
 response to inquiries concerning this incident, Douala
 authorities claimed those-detained were linked to an arson
 attack; however, no one was ever charged.
 On September 23 and 24, authorities in Douala took into custody
 24 opponents of the Government (see also Section 2.b.). Though
 they were released within 2 days, mbst suffered serious
 mistreatment while in detention. Samuel Eboua, President of
 the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) and lawyer
 Charles Tchoungang were among those hospitalized as a result of
 having been severely beaten with iron rods and rubber
 truncheons. Progressive Movement (MP) Party President
 Jean-Jacques Ekindi, who was placed under house arrest and
 denied access to visitors for an additional day after his
 release, received even harsher treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary, prolonged detention remains a serious problem.
 Under Cameroonian law, a person arrested for a nonpolitical
 offense may be held in custody up to 24 hours before being
 charged. .The period may be renewed three times. However,
 after a magistrate has issued a warrant to bring the case to
 trial, the detainee may be held in "pretrial detention"
 indefinitely pending court action. Furthermore, a 1990 law
 permits detention without charge for renewable periods of 15
 days "in order to combat banditry." During 1991 public
 officials sometimes abused this authority in order to suppress
 political expression. The number of arbitrary detentions that
 took place during 1991 is impossible to estimate accurately but
 may have exceeded 10,000.
 
 
 46
 CAMEROON
 A presidential decree reducing sentences for many crimes, an
 amnesty law voted by the National Assembly in April, and the
 conclusion of an effort by the Ministry of Justice to clear the
 prisons of persons being held for reasons no longer known, cut
 the national prison population significantly and resulted in
 the closure of three notorious political prisons. The amnesty
 law brought about the release of the last of the prisoners held
 in connection with the failed 1984 coup attempt. In the Center
 Province alone, the Justice Ministry's initiative reduced the
 number of persons in pretrial detention (i.e., awaiting trial
 or whose cases were on appeal) from 2,568 to 671.
 Persons taken into detention are frequently denied access
 either to legal counsel or family members. The law permits
 release on bail only in the Anglophone provinces, whose legal
 system retains features of British common law. Even there,
 bail is granted infrequently. CENER and SEMIL do not implement
 fully the penal code requirement that detainees be brought
 before a magistrate for investigation of possible offenses and
 have held detainees incommunicado. Persons placed in
 administrative detention or taken into custody by security
 forces do not disappear. They are eventually released, though
 the families are not always informed promptly of their
 whereabouts. The law does not provide for judicial
 determination of the legality of detention, and judicial
 authorities are precluded from acting on-a case until the
 administrative authority who ordered the detention turns the
 case over to the prosecutor.
 On August 29, the Lamido of Rey Bouba, a powerful traditional
 ruler who had traveled to Garoua to welcome President Biya to
 the North Province capital, took 50 local residents hostage
 after Garoua youths stoned his motorcade. In spite of pleas
 from local authorities, the Lamido refused to release the
 hostages until after his return to Rey Bouba. During the time
 the Lamido was holding the hostages, President Biya decorated
 him for service to the nation.
 Cameroon does not generally engage in the practice of forced
 exile, and many prominent exiles returned to-Cameroon in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Cameroonian court system is subordinate to the Ministry of
 Justice. Thus, it is part of the executive, not a separate or
 independent branch of government. Magistrates in Cameroon are
 career civil servants responsible to the Minister of Justice,
 and they are subject, particularly in political cases, to
 government direction. Numerous magistrates have commented that
 rendering a decision that displeases the Government may result
 in transfer to a less desirable position. However,
 magistrates' decisions in nonpolitical cases are not usually
 subject to government interference. There have been reported
 cases of the Government refusing to pay damages when a court
 has found against it. Public trial by a presiding magistrate
 is provided for in law, and this practice is followed except in
 the case of persons held under administrative detention. In
 late 1991, Minister of Justice Douala Moutome several times
 enjoined his Ministry's officials to be fair and impartial in
 the conduct of their duties.
 Traditional courts continue to play an important role in
 Cameroon, particularly in rural areas. Their authority varies
 by region and by ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters
 of property and domestic disputes and may serve a probate
 
 
 47
 CAMEROON
 function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of.
 decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 Civilians accused of subversion Or weapons offenses are liable
 to trial before the State Security Court, which was established
 by a law enacted in late 1990. This Court has-seven members,
 five of whom must be trained magistrates; these were not
 appointed until November 14, so the Court has not as yet heard
 any cases. This Court's ruling may, not be appealed except with
 respect to a point of law.- There were no known political
 prisoners being held at the end of 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While both invasions of the home and tampering with
 correspondence are violations of Cameroonian law, there have
 been frequent reports of police harassing citizens and entering
 homes without warrants during periodic searches. This practice
 was particularly widespread in neighborhoods near Yaounde
 University in April and May and in Douala in August and
 September. Police officials also sometimes enter homes and
 demand to seereceipts for household property as a customs law
 enforcement measure. Surveillance of suspected dissidents and
 the monitoring of their mail and telephone conversations are
 common practices.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution. of 19q2 provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, Cameroonian law and practice have
 long restricted these freedoms. While there are nd overt
 restrictions on private speech, some civil servants in 1991
 reported having been subjected to involuntary transfers,
 suspension from their duties, and other administrative
 sanctions as a result of their membership in or support of
 opposition political parties. Such actions appear to have been
 at the initiative of overzealous supporters of the Government'
 or ruling CPDM and'do not appear to be derived from government
 policy.
 In late 1990, a new law established more.liberal regulations
 for the creation of newspapers and magazines and opened the
 door to eventual private broadcasting. That same law, however,
 formally enshrined prepublication censorship and granted the
 Minister of Territorial Administratfon authority to suspend the
 right to publish.  While censorship and suspensions may he
 appealed, the competent court is hot obliged to rule until 1
 month has elapsed--with obvious ramifications for
 time-sensitive media.
 The Government publishes two official newspapers--the English
 and French editions of the Cameroon Tribune--and controls radio
 and television (the most important media). Most official
 journalists are civil servants who may be transferred to less
 desirable positions if they do not practice self-censorship. A
 number of television journalists were taken off the air in 1991
 following incidents in which they implied disagreement with
 government actions. The government-controlled broadcast media
 also provided disproportionately high levels of coverage to
 even minor CPDM functions while blacking out the most important
 oppostion events.
 
 
 48
 CAMEROON
 The press was subjected to repeated attacks during 1991. In
 January two journalists, including prominent essayist Celestin
 Monga, were arrested and charged with having insulted the
 President, the Niational Assembly, and the judiciary in an "open
 letter" to President Biya. The arrests and trial provoked an
 international outcry and led to the first massive
 antigovernment demonstrations in Douala since independence.
 The journalists were convicted and given token sentences, but
 censorship was subsequently relaxed for several months.
 Censorship returned with a vengeance in June and July as
 seizures of newspapers multiplied rapidly. Even cartoons were
 censored. When one newspaper attempted to publish the second
 in a series of articles concerning the report on Cameroon in
 the U.S. Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights
 Practices for 1990, the entire page was censored. Although the
 law requires that publishers be notified of seizure orders,
 that prescription was seldom followed in practice, and security
 forces frequently entered kiosks and bookstores and confiscated
 copies of putatively offensive publications without formal
 authority.
 On July 22, Minister of Information and Culture Augustin
 Kontchou Kouomegni set up a special newspaper reading unit at
 the national printing company charged with detecting and
 censoring anything the Government deemed unworthy of
 publication. Legally, this Ministry has no authority to censor
 anything, but neither President Biya nor Prime Minister Hayatou
 ordered Kontchou to dismantle the unit. Many publishers began
 to print their newspapers in Nigeria, and the Government
 continued its policy of seizures. Foreign publications
 imported into Cameroon are also occasionally seized. In
 October the Ministry of Information and Culture proposed a code
 of ethics for journalists and a draft law governing the
 exercise of the journalistic profession. The proposals angered
 journalists, who viewed them as another heavy-handed government
 attempt to censor them.
 After one newspaper published a document establishing that
 gendarmerie authorities in Douala had taken protection money
 from local merchants, Minister of Territorial Administration
 Gilbert Andze Tsoungui banned three independent newspapers.
 The newspapers responded by changing their names and continuing
 to publish. The Minister promptly banned the new
 publications. In mid-November, the bans on six of the (by that
 time) seven banned papers were lifted as part of an agreement
 between the Government and the opposition. On September 4,
 security forces in Douala attacked a group of journalists and
 other citizens protesting the banning of independent newspapers
 and invaded the offices of La Detente, where some of the
 protesters had taken refuge. Employing rubber truncheons and
 firing live ammunition and tear gas, the security forces
 brutally took some 40 persons into custody for several hours.
 Several of those detained reportedly suffered serious injuries,
 including broken limbs and at least one gunshot wound.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, though it is
 generally believed that CENER informants pervade the campus of
 the University of Yaounde. Some university professors believe
 that their political viewpoints and activism have had a
 negative impact on professional opportunities and advancement.
 
 
 49
 CAMEROON
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are provided for in law but
 are restricted in practice. Laws.enacted in late 1990
 liberalized Cameroonians' ability to form private associations
 and political parties but did not address the formation of
 labor unions (see Section 6.a.). The Penal Code prohibits
 public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior
 government approval. The 1990 law on freedom of association
 provided that Cameroonians may freely form associations simply
 by notifying the responsible administrative authority according
 to a set procedure. The authority is required formally to
 acknowledge that notification by issuing a receipt to the
 associations' organizers. Barring notification to the
 contrary, the group is considered to be a legal entity on the
 60th day after issuance of the administrative receipt. In
 practice, some administrators refused to issue the receipt
 called for by law, providing instead a piece of paper promising
 to deliver the receipt at a later date. As a result, a number
 of groups were put into a sort of legal limbo, neither
 authorized nor refused authorization. In mid-July Minister
 Tsoungui banned six groups on the grounds that they had engaged
 in activities no foreseen in their charters and had advocated
 civil disobedience. The organizations banned were: the
 self-described human rights groups, Cap-Liberte, Cameroon
 Organization for Human Rights (OCDH), and Human Rights Watch;
 the women's rights group, Collective of Women for the New Deal
 (CFR); the Cameroon Professional Drivers Association; and.the.
 Sportsmen's Association of Cameroon. Although the law permits
 organizations to appeal a banning order, the groups were unable
 to commence action for nearly 6 weeks because the Government
 refused to provide the official notification of banning
 required by the law until about August 22. Meanwhile, law
 enforcement and administrative authorities took action to
 prevent the groups in question from holding meetings.
 Authorities continue occasionally to compel citizens to attend
 rallies in support of the Government or the ruling party. In
 March, for example, the subprefect for Maroua wrote a decree
 ordering traditional rulers in his jurisdiction to participate
 in a CPDM meeting, warning that "no absence would be tolerated."
 The 1990 law on political parties established criteria for-the
 formation of political parties. Although some political party
 leaders expressed suspicion that the Government was
 unreasonably delaying authorization of their parties, there is
 no evidence that government officials failed to respect the
 letter of the law in that respect. By the end of 1991, more.
 than 40 political parties were in existence.
 The Government's record on permitting parties to carry out-
 their activities is not nearly so positive. While the law
 calls for 7 days' advance notification to the responsible
 administrative authority of any public meeting or march, the
 ruling CPDM was on several occasions permitted to schedule
 demonstrations on less than 7 days' notice. Opposition
 parties, on the other hand, frequently experienced the
 frustration of having their marches canceled at the last minute
 by civil administrators citing vague threats to public
 security. As tensions rose in the period after May 16--when
 the opposition called for concerted action against the central
 Government--some prefects banned all demonstrations of a
 political nature in their areas of responsibility. However, in
 a number of cases, the ruling CPDM was nonetheless permitted to
 continue to hold meetings and other functions. For several
 
 
 50
 CAMEROON
 months during 1991, the opposition Social Democratic Front
 (SDF) sponsored thrice-weekly marches in Bamenda, refusing to
 seek the required permit.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is a secular state. There is no established
 religion. Roughly 25 percent of Cameroonians are Muslims, 40
 percent are Christians, and the rest follow traditional
 beliefs. Some blend elements of Christianity with traditional
 practices. Officials of the Government and the CPDM include
 members of all three groups. Freedom of religion is provided
 for in the Constitution, but a religious group must be approved
 and registered with the Ministry of Territorial Administration
 in order to exist and function legally. In 1991 a small group
 called Universal was banned without explanation in the
 Southwest Province. Government officials state that no
 Jehovah's Witnesses are imprisoned as a result of their beliefs
 and that the Witnesses, banned from 1970 until 1990, are now
 free to practice their religion. While there have been
 isolated incidents of religious intolerance, the Government
 discourages such acts, and most Cameroonians are proud of their
 tradition of religious harmony.
 The Government does not discourage the practice of traditional
 religions. Acts of witchcraft, divination, or magic "liable to
 disrupt public order or tranquility, or to harm persons or
 property" are outlawed, with potential penalties of up to 10
 years' imprisonment. Missionaries played a major role in the
 development of Cameroon and continue to be active. Foreign
 clergy suffer no ill-treatment. There are no particular
 restrictions on places of worship, the training of clergy,
 religious education, or participation in charitable
 activities. Conversions are common. Independent Christian and
 Muslim publications exist in Cameroon, and there is no evidence
 they are more heavily censored than is the secular press.
 There are no restrictions on religious travel, such as the hajj.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. Police frequently stop travelers to check identification
 documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts as a
 security and immigration control measure. After the onset of
 widespread civil unrest in mid-May, the checks became pervasive
 and occasionally oppressive. Ordinary citizens were at times
 hindered in going about their business by as many as 10
 roadblocks within a 100-kilometer stretch of highway.
 Personnel manning these roadblocks frequently solicit bribes to
 speed passage. Authorities sometimes employed these roadblocks
 to limit the activities of political parties. At one time, the
 road between Douala and Yaounde was closed for 2 days as part
 of a government effort to prevent opposition sympathizers from
 traveling to the capital.
 The Government has sometimes used its passport control function
 against those it considers real or potential threats. Writer
 and economist Celestin Monga's passport was seized at Douala
 International Airport on orders of the national police chief in
 late August without legal justification. Monga said he was
 told his passport was "a privilege granted to you by the
 national chief of police, and he may withdraw it at any time."
 During the same period, five opposition leaders had their
 planned visit to France in late August disrupted by the
 
 
 51
 CAMEROON
 Government's decision to delay their departure through
 temporary passport seizures and other administrative means.
 After the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)
 collapsed in late June, many Cameroonian residents of Pakistani
 and Indian nationality having no connection to BCCI or its
 Cameroonian affiliate were temporarily prevented from traveling
 outside the country by confiscation of their passports.
 Over the years, Cameroon has served as a safe haven for
 thousands of displaced, persons and refugees. An estimated
 35,000 refugees ate currently in Cameroon. The majbrity are
 Chadians who irrived in the early 1980's and who live,
 unregistered, in border areas. In December 1990, an additional
 influx of 3,500 refugees entered Cameroon after the fall of the
 Habre government in Chad. Most returned to Chad in early
 1991. The latest group of Chadian refugees came to Cameroon in
 October 1991. Numbering about 1,.000, they are bein assisted
 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the
 Poli Faro zefugee camp. Although Cameroon occasionally returns
 illegal Chadian immigrants, there were no reports of forced
 repatriation of recognized refugees in 1991.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens'
 to Change Their Government
 Major legal changes effected late in 1990, if fully and fairly
 implemented, would permit a return to the functioning
 multiparty system abandoned in 1966. Throughout 1991, however,
 Cameroon continued to be a de facto one-party state with
 political power and administrative authority concentrated in
 the Presidency. The President app6ints all cabinet members,-
 governors, and prefects. The Prime Minister, whose position
 was restored by constitutional amendment in 1991, has
 considerable responsibility in the economic sphere but no power
 to remove ministers or to deal directly with theNational
 Assembly. However, the elected National Assembly continued a
 recent trend toward playing a more active role in determining
 the country's darection.
 During the year, many opposition political parties were
 authorized. Widespread dissatisfaction with the Government and
 the CPDM boosted opposition parties' popularity. A coalition
 was formed among the opposition parties which demanded that.the
 Government hold a national conference. The Government refused,
 arguing that such a meeting would be nondemocratic and
 extraconstitutional. In response, the opposition organized a
 series of general strikes and acts of civil disobedience, known
 as "Operation Ghost Towns," which lasted from mid-May until
 early December. In December President Biya promulgated a new
 electoral code, which, together with constitutional amendments
 enacted earlier, delineates a parliamentary system under which
 the Prime Minister would be chosen from the party or parties
 comprising the National Assembly's majority. Ir October
 President Biya announced that multiparty elections would be
 held on February'16, 1992. At year's end, most opposition
 parties were lobbying strongly for a date in late May amid
 numerous credible reports of irregularities in the voter
 registration process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In November President Biya named members to the National
 Committee on Human Rights And Liberties which he had created a

 CAMEROON
 year earlier. At year's end, government officials indicated
 that these members would be installed in January 1992. The
 decree which established the committee stipulated that it would
 act as Cameroon's official link to nongovernmental
 organizations concerned about human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Cameroonian citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis. President
 Biya has repeatedly stressed publicly the dangers of tribalism,
 but there remains deep-seated suspicion among ethnic groups, to
 which government officials are far from immune. Cameroon is
 officially bilingual, but the Anglophone minority (20 percent)
 often charges that it is denied economic opportunity and real
 political power. The Francophone Bamileke, the country's
 largest single ethnic group (also about 20 percent of the
 population), level similar charges against the rest of the body
 politic. Following unrest at Yaounde University in April and
 May, security forces frequently targeted Anglophone and
 Bamileke students for harassment solely because of their
 linguistic/ethnic affiliation. Most observers agree that
 interethnic animosity became more open and more venomous during
 1991. Independent newspapers associated with the opposition
 frequently attacked the Beti, while those close to the
 Government fulminated against the Bamileke, Anglophones, and,
 to a lesser extent, Northerners.
 Women are granted equal rights under the Constitution. and some
 are politically active in the party and the sole legal labor
 federation. However, significant cultural pressure is brought
 to bear on women to remain subservient to men. Polygamy is
 permitted by law and tradition, but polyandry is not. The
 extent to which a woman may inherit from her husband is
 normally governed by customary law in the absence of a will,
 and traditions vary from group to group. In cases of divorce,
 the husband's wishes determine custody of children over the age
 of six. A married woman may not legally obtain contraceptives
 without her husband's consent; neither may she be sterilized
 without his authorization. While a man can be convicted of
 adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a
 female can be convicted irrespective of venue.
 In many traditional societies, custom grants greater authority
 and benefits to male than to female heirs. The percentage of
 female secondary school students increased by 45 percent
 between 1970 and 1986. Girls made up 45.7 percent of primary
 school pupils in 1986, but that percentage drops to 38.3
 percent at the secondary level and to only 14 percent at
 university level.
 Women's rights advocates report that violence against women has
 surged in the past 2 years, and the law does not impose
 effective penalties against violators. Wife beating is not, of
 itself, a legal ground for divorce. Most women regard having
 been the victim of a sexual assault as so profoundly shameful
 that they cannot bring themselves to confront the assailant.
 The commission investigating the behavior of security forces
 during unrest at Yaounde University wrote, "We found that the
 chances that there were rapes are very high, but no young woman
 presented herself to be heard." Frequently, a victim's family
 or village takes matters into its own hands and imposes direct,
 summary punishment upon the suspected perpetrator through means
 ranging from destruction of property to lynching.

 While there are no reliable statistics on the frequency with
 which violence against women takes place, newspaper articles
 indicate the frequency is high. Female circumcision is not
 common in Cameroon. It is practiced by a limited number of
 traditional Muslim families and is almost unheard of in other
 groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The 1990 law on associations specifically excluded trade
 unions, and there is still no law pertaining to the
 organization of trade unions. There are reports of at least
 three nascent trade unions that find themselves unable to
 function fullybe6ause of the ambiguity of their status. Civil
 servants are not permitted to join trade unions.
 The Organization of United Cameroonian Workers (OSTC), the
 umbrella group for the country's officially sanctioned trade
 unions, annoubced during 1991 that, because Cameroon was moving
 toward a multiparty system, it had severed its formal links
 with the ruling CPDM and would henceforth be neutral within the
 context of party politics.
 Strikes are authorized only on a few, severely restricted
 grounds; likewise, political activity by trade unions, except
 for action designed to protect economic and other interests, is
 prohibited. Strikes do occur, however, though they are usually
 directed at single enterprises and seldom last more'than a few
 days. Most strikes during 1991 were by employees of
 government-owned enterprises seeking payment of overdue wages
 and salaries. Most strikes were settled through negotiation,
 but the Government showed mixed tolerance for strikers trying
 to attract the attention of higher authorities to their
 concerns.
 The OSTC is a member of the continentwide official trade union
 body, the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, but all
 contact with foreign trade union organizations requires
 government authorization-
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 Experts (COE) noted once again in 1991 that various legislative
 provisions, which regulate the right of public servants to
 organize, restrict their right to strike, and ban foreign
 workers from trade union office, are inconsistent with ILO
 Convention 87 on freedom of.association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the Labor Code recognizes the right of trade unions or
 trade union federations to engage in collective bargaining with
 employers or groups of employers, true collective bargaining
 between employers and-workers is rare. Under the law, all
 employers 6f more than 10 workers must permit the election of a
 worker representative from among the employees. This worker
 representative has a statutory right to discuss labor
 conditions with the employer on behalf of the employees and
 enjoys special protection from arbitrary dismissal. Candidates
 for these positions must be approved by the OSTC. While the
 Labor Code does not provide specific penalties for those who
 violate its provisions, it does state that any act in
 contravention of its provisions shall be null and void. Also,

 CAMEROON
 employees may, and often successfully do, pursue formal labor
 complaints, which often include demands for payment of damages.
 There are no export processing zones in Cameroon, but one is in
 the formative stages, and others are under consideration.
 Legislation enacted to govern operations within such zones
 states that "the current terms and conditions of employment
 must be consistent with internationally accepted workers'
 rights."
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Labor Code. However,
 concerns expressed in 1990 by the ILO's Conference Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations concerning
 the use of prison labor (inmates from Cameroon's "production
 prisons" are sometimes rented out to private employers as day
 labor) remained valid in 1%91. There have been reports of
 communal labor being employed in some traditional societies.
 In December the government-owned newspaper reported that
 "slavery is still practiced" in Rey Bouba (see also Section
 l.d.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code sets the minimum working age at 14--a rule that
 appears to be respected and enforced in the modern wage
 sector. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor are empowered to
 enforce provisions of Cameroon's Labor Code, as are labor
 courts. In rural areas, where 80 percent of Cameroon's
 citizens engage in farming, children participate at an early
 age in agricultural work alongside adults. In addition, young
 relatives, especially girls from rural areas, are often
 employed in the household as domestics. Street vendors in
 urban areas are occasionally under age 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum monthly wages are set by the Government for all public
 and private sector jobs and cover a wide range. These rates
 are determined by a complex formula which takes into account
 geographic location, education, experience, and profession and
 type of industry. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 making the necessary calculations. Most workers in the modern
 sector are paid well in excess of the minimum wage. The lowest
 wages are insufficient to support a family but usually are
 supplemented by a second job or another family member's
 earnings. Workers with middle-range wages also are likely to
 need second incomes to support a family, especially in Yaounde
 and Douala.
 Under the Labor Code, the minimum annual paid vacation is 18
 days, and the legal workweek ranges from 40 hours for
 nonagricultural employees to 56 hours per week for security
 guards. In order to make room for younger workers, civil
 servants are encouraged to retire upon reaching the minimum
 retirement age of 55.   The Ministry of Labor sets health and
 safety standards, which are enforced by labor inspectors.
 Enforcement of standards varies. Labor inspectors will
 generally investigate complaints and frequently find for the
 complainant. However, many employees are loath to file
 complaints, and spot inspections are rare.
