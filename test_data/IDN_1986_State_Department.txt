 INDONESIA
 Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world and
 the largest nation in southeast Asia, with a population
 estimated in 1985 at 173 million. Its "New Order" Government,
 came to power in 1966 after an abortive Communist Party-backed
 coup. Authority is concentrated in a small group of retired
 and active-duty military officers and civilian technocrats
 under the leadership of President Soeharto. A partly elected,
 partly appointed Parliament serves as a forum for consultation
 on and promulgation of legislation proposed by the Executive
 Branch. In reaction to the legacy of political and economic
 turmoil from the Sukarno days, the Government has established
 priorities of stability, economic development, and social
 equity. While it has achieved some successes in each area,
 efforts to achieve wider distribution of economic benefits,
 particularly in light of the problems the country faced in
 1986, have yet to bridge the enormous disparities in wealth and
 access to economic advantages development has brought.
 Faced with a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, and
 religious groups, Indonesian governments have sought to create
 a unique national identity and develop a governing system which
 can accommodate this diversity while assuring internal security
 and strengthening national unity. In meeting this challenge,
 the Soeharto Government has made "Pancasila" the national
 social and political ideology and the centerpiece of its
 political program. Pancasila, a centrist and eclectic
 formulation, consists of five principles: belief in one Supreme
 God, belief in a just and civilized humanity, Indonesian
 national unity, democracy, and social justice. To build a
 national identity, the Government emphasizes social harmony and
 the traditional Indonesian process of consultation and
 consensus as a major element in decisionmaking.
 Indonesia has a mixed economy with the State involved in nearly
 all sectors. The remarkable economic growth over the past 2
 decades suffered severe setbacks in 1986 due to the drop in
 petroleum and commodity prices and continued domestic economic
 inefficiencies. Ethnic Chinese citizens of Indonesia are
 heavily represented in the small but economically important
 private sector. Indonesia's national ideology and current
 5-year economic plan stress improved social welfare for all
 without discrimination.
 Although there were modest improvements in some areas of human
 rights in 1986, problems continue in others. These include
 reports of torture and cruel treatment of prisoners and
 restrictions on freedom of speech and press, on freedom of
 movement and activities of political parties, and on labor
 organizations.
 The Government continued efforts to consolidate its control and
 improve the welfare of the people in East Timor. Periodic
 skirmishes between Fretilin guerrillas and the army occurred
 with unknown but relatively small numbers of casualties on both
 sides. The Government continued to permit selective access,
 including escorted diplomatic visits, tours by Western newsmen,
 and, for the first time since 1975, a visit by a Portuguese
 Parliamentarian. International human rights organizations were
 denied general access or permission to observe subversion
 trials. As a result of ambitious government plans, East Timor
 is benefiting from significant improvements in social services,
 particularly education and health centers, communications, and
 economic conditions.

 In Irian Jaya, Organization for a Free Papua (OPM) rebels have
 increased their militant activity, although actions are taken
 more often against fellow Irianese villagers than against any
 Indonesian Government forces in the province. Over 700
 Irianese fled to Papua New Guinea in the past year, reportedly
 in response to rebel warnings or fears of OPM and Indonesian
 army activity in their home areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Covert summary executions of suspected criminals, a campaign
 begun in early 1982 in response to the fast-rising rate of
 violent crime, virtually stopped in 1986. The Government
 stated in July that the campaign of so-called "mysterious
 killings" had ended. The specific perpetrators of these
 executions have never been publicly identified.
 It is believed the incidence of such killings was very low in
 1986. It is difficult to estimate the number of killings as
 they are frequently indistinguishable from many other acts of
 violence, particularly among criminal bands. In early 1986
 there were press reports from Central and Eastern Java of
 "mysterious killings," closely linked to security forces,.which
 involved other than suspected criminals. Neither the purpose
 nor the perpetrators of these acts became known.
 There were no public reports of further implementation of the
 1985 police policy of "shoot to kill" in instances of violent
 crime. However, a shoot-to-wound policy toward allegedly
 escaping criminals in North Sumatra occasionally resulted in
 deaths of purported criminals.
 In 1986 there were reports which could not be independently
 verified of political killings in Irian Jaya or East Timor.
 Both are areas of ongoing internal strife between authorities
 and local rebel groups, and the Government limits access. The
 Government continued to offer amnesty to rebels in both
 provinces. Over 50 Fretilin guerrillas reportedly surrendered
 in East Timor in 1986 and were permitted, under terms of the
 amnesty, to settle within the local community under the
 supervision of the police and the church. There are no reports
 of rebels in Irian Jaya surrendering to the authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 Knowledgeable observers report continued incidents of
 disappearances in 1986, usually believed to be at the hands of
 security authorities operating under special legal provisions
 exempting them from the criminal code. Reports are often
 unspecific and virtually impossible to confirm as the
 Government rarely if ever responds to inquiries concerning
 alleged disappearances. Observers believe the number of
 disappearances is very small. Many disappearance reports
 relate to events that took place before 1986 in East Timor or
 fellowing the riots in the Jakarta port area of Tanjung Priok
 in 1984. Regularized International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) access to prisons in East Timor and elsewhere in
 Indonesia has helped to locate some persons thought to have
 disappeared.
 
 
 718
 INDONESIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although stated government policy discourages torture and cruel
 punishment of prisoners or detainees, instances of torture,
 cruel treatment, and even death while under detention are
 reported periodically in the press and by knowledgeable
 observers. Standard police treatment of detainees, even in
 minor incidents, often results in physical abuse. A policy of
 shoot-to-wound criminals allegedly attempting to elude arrest,
 instituted in North Sumatra in 1985, continued throughout
 1986. The local press reported 36 such shootings in Medan in
 the first 6 months of 1986, in which all alleged criminals were
 shot in the legs. Authorities, and related press reports,
 indicate such incidents declined toward the end of 1986
 although the program continued. Occasionally victims have died
 from their wounds.
 In a report on the treatment of Muslim prisoners, Amnesty
 International reported in 1986 incidents of intimidation and of
 cruel and degrading treatment, including beatings and coercion
 of testimony. The Government denied the allegations but no
 independent investigations were permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although the December 1981 Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP)
 contains protections against arbitrary arrest and detention and
 specifies the right of prisoners to legal counsel. and
 notification of family members, these safeguards frequently are
 not respected in practice. Emergency security provisions
 permit exceptions under which arrests and detentions may be
 made by the Command for the Restoration of Security and Order
 (KOPKAMTIB). The provisions of the criminal code are honored
 more often in urban areas than in small towns or remote
 provinces, in part because of a shortage of trained trial
 lawyers and ignorance of the law by those detained as well as
 by the police. Authorities are known to make arrests to
 intimidate or inhibit activities;. such arrests may have little
 or no legal basis, but the vagaries of the legal system
 preclude redress of grievances in most cases.
 Indonesian law does not specifically include the right of
 habeas corpus or its equivalent. The military organization
 KOPKAMTIB has wide powers to detain and interrogate persons
 thought to endanger national security. These special powers
 supersede the criminal code provisions and apply particularly
 to cases of suspected subversion, sabotage, secession, or
 corruption. Arrests or detentions made under these powers are
 rarely if ever made known publicly, although the arrest of
 three students from East Timor in 1986 was officially
 acknowledged (and the students were subsequently released).
 Persons arrested and held under KOPKAMTIB provisions have no
 automatic right to legal aid or other protection.
 Precise numbers of persons detained without trial are
 unavailable. Human rights observers believe there may be as
 many as 500 throughout Indonesia. In addition, at the end of
 1986, 631 persons remained in detention on Atauro Island, East
 Timor, for suspected support of Fretilin. According to
 government officials, they will be returned to their home area
 of Viqueque when security conditions there permit. Most of the
 3,400 other detainees who had been held at Atauro have been
 resettled in their home areas; some have been settled elsewhere
 in the province and have not been permitted to return to their
 
 
 719
 INDONESIA
 original homes, for security reasons according to the
 Government. The ICRC continues to provide nutritional and
 medical assistance to those still on Atauro.
 There have been no reports of the use of forced labor in
 Indonesia in recent years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As government employees, judges in Indonesia come under the
 jurisdiction of the executive branch. Legal experts have noted
 that interference from the executive branch greatly affects the
 independence of the judiciary. A bill to change this is
 periodically introduced in Parliament, but none has yet been
 passed. Corruption is also a problem in the Indonesian legal
 system. In criminal proceedings, defendants are frequently
 able to buy their-way out of prosecution at various stages of
 the proceedings. In civil cases, court decisions are sometimes
 influenced by the payment of bribes. In response to these
 abuses, the Government from time to time has taken action
 against particularly flagrant offenders; but by and large these
 practices continue unabated.
 In cases involving what could be defined broadly as "security"
 issues, particularly instances in which persons are being tried
 under the subversion provisions of 1963, the accused are
 rarely, if ever, found innocent. No defendant in such a case
 is known to have been found innocent in 1986. In all such
 security-related cases, it is widely believed the Government
 will ensure conviction irrespective of the evidence presented
 in court; such convictions are aided by the court's ability to
 restrict evidence presented. Although the Government has not
 announced data on the number of persons serving sentences for
 subversion, one reliable estimate suggests there may be several
 hundred. Several subversion trials took place in 1986, most
 related to the 1984 Tanjung Priok riots or their aftermath or
 to alleged Muslim extremist activity. There were no reports
 that in any such trials the accused were found innocent.
 Adnan Buyung Nasution, a well-known human rights activist and
 one of the defense attorneys for retired General H. R. Dharsono
 in his 1985-86 trial, was accused of contempt of court for
 behavior during the Dharsono trial. The alleged contempt of
 court action took place before Indonesia had any contempt of
 court statute. Nonetheless, despite questionable legal
 grounds, the Government pursued its case against Nasution.
 In the autumn of 1986, the Government executed nine former
 Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) activists. The Government
 states that all had been tried in the late 1960's in accordance
 with Indonesian law and had been able to appeal their sentences
 up to the President. Their appeals were turned down. Various
 human rights organizations, however, have expressed concern
 over the conduct and fairness of these trials and subsequent
 appeal proceedings. A dozen or more other former Communist
 leaders remain in prison under sentences of death.
 Indonesia's criminal justice system lacks the number of courts,
 trained judges, prosecutors, and police needed to cope with the
 increase in crime in recent years. As a result there are
 frequently lengthy delays in scheduling trials. Trials are
 conducted by a three-judge panel which hears evidence, decides
 guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Although the
 right of appeal is not absolute, it is observed in most cases.
 Initial judgements are rarely reversed, although sentences are
 
 
 720
 INDONESIA
 occasionally reduced. Most court sessions are open to the
 public, and most defendants have access to counsel if they can
 pay or, if desitute, find private legal help such as that
 provided by the Legal Aid Institute. There is no direct system
 of public funding of court-appointed attorneys for those unable
 to afford legal assistance.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases
 involving suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by security
 agencies reportedly occurs periodically. Both local and
 international telephone calls are believed to be monitored
 selectively by government security agencies. Although
 correspondence generally is not monitored, letter mail to and
 from East Timor is subject to official scrutiny.
 Permits are required for the import of foreign publications and
 video tapes, which must be reviewed by government censors.
 Some foreign newspapers and magazines, especially from
 Australia, cannot be imported. Foreign publications which do
 enter Indonesia are subject to censorship. The import of
 Communist publications is prohibited. Excepting one
 quasi-official daily newspaper which uses Chinese characters
 and claims a circulation of over 100,000, Chinese language
 publications can neither be imported nor produced
 domestically. Chinese characters are routinely blotted out of
 foreign news photos and advertising. There are no laws against
 speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy stress on the
 learning and use of the national language, Bahasa Indonesia, to
 promote national unity.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is circumscribed. The Constitution
 gives Parliament the authority to legislate these
 restrictions. In recent years, Parliament has helped create a
 body of law delimiting the rights of individuals and of the
 Government. In the absence of implementing regulations for
 many of these laws, different government agencies frequently
 interpret them as they choose. The result is that these
 agencies have considerable discretionary authority in the
 field of civil rights, e.g., freedom of the press and speech.
 Governmental concern about public statements or publications
 which could be perceived as critical of the Government, and
 therefore threatening to the nation's stability, is a major
 factor inhibiting the exercise of free speech and press.
 Opposition groups are generally free to meet privately and
 formulate views, but they are inhibited from disseminating them
 publicly because of media reluctance to risk official
 disapproval or because of informal government instructions not
 to publish the opinions of or news about prominent opposition
 figures. As in past years, authorities provided general topic
 guidelines to Muslim speakers during the Muslim holidays when
 preachers addressed large gatherings. In a few instances
 preachers who went beyond these guidelines were arrested.
 Authorities canceled public readings by popular poet Rendra in
 Jakarta and at a literary gathering in Jogjakarta for
 anticipated "inappropriate" topics, although subsequent
 
 
 721
 INDONESIA
 readings of other material have been permitted. A play by
 Rendra with substantial political undertones was permitted to
 be staged in 1986 in Jakarta and drew record audiences despite
 the high ticket price.
 The general lack of specific, clear guidelines on what is
 permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press.
 School faculties sometimes refrain from producing materials,
 including dissertations, which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers also are unwilling to
 accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues. Foreign
 books critical of the Government or dealing with sensitive
 topics, such as human rights, similarly are avoided by
 importers. Foreign periodicals, readily available in
 Indonesia, are scrupulously censored by their private importers
 in order to avoid government confiscation of the materials.
 With few exceptions this self-censorship is thorough and
 effectively responds to government concerns.
 The press is largely privately owned. While espousing a "free"
 press, the Government expects the media to be "responsible" by
 supporting national economic development goals and domestic
 stability. While journalists and publishers practice
 considerable self-censorship, the Government closely monitors
 the media for material it finds unacceptable. In such
 instances, editors or journalists routinely, receive oral
 instructions from government officials about news which cannot
 be reported. Articles and editorials do address sensitive
 issues, however, and within the vaguely defined limitations,
 journalists sometimes have surprisingly wide latitude.
 There are nonetheless very real limits.-In October 1986, the
 Government closed down the major Jakarta daily,. Sinar .Harapan,
 for printing a government working paper proposing economic
 changes. Subsequent to the closing of Sinar, three other
 newspapers received written government warnings and two
 received oral warnings to avoid printing "speculative" articles
 which could "create uncertainty and confusion among the
 public." In November the Government banned three issues of the
 Asian Wall Street Journal which featured exposes of the
 Soeharto family's business dealings.
 Earlier in the year, in response to articles in the Australian
 press about Soeharto family and associates' government-favored
 businesses, the Government banned Australian journalists from
 the country and deported two who had come as part of the White
 House press corps for President Reagan's visit to Bali. A
 regional New York Times correspondent also was not permitted to
 remain in the country at the same time. Later in the year the
 Government permitted her to reenter. Two resident American
 correspondents for the Far Eastern Economic Review were
 required to leave during the year, apparently because of
 government dissatisfaction with their reporting.
 The Attorney General banned several books, both foreign and
 Indonesian.. There is a single government-operated television
 network. Private radio stations, of which there are more than
 400 throughout the country, are restricted to using government-
 provided news programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Regional and national meetings of virtually all organizations
 must have government permission, and local jurisdictions often
 
 
 722
 INDONESIA
 require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While
 such approval is usually granted, local authorities can and do
 withhold permission. Student gatherings are frequently the
 target of such disapprovals. There are restrictions on
 meetings in East Timor, where the Government authorizes public
 assembly for social and ceremonial events and, as long as there
 is no perceived security risk, for political parties.
 In mid-1985 the Parliament passed a "Social Organizations" law
 (known as the "ORMAS Law") which requires all organizations,
 including religious orders and associations, to accept the
 state ideology of Pancasila as their sole principle. The law
 empowers the Government, with the approval of the Supreme
 Court, to disband any organization it believes to be acting
 against the tenets of Pancasila. The Government took no such
 actions in 1986. In addition, government approval is required
 before any organization can accept funding from foreign
 donors.
 Indonesian workers are organized in a single national body, the
 SPSI. It has a total membership of some 3 million out of a
 work force of 65 million, in which some 15 million persons are
 employed in the industrialized sector. The SPSI is the only
 trade union body legally permitted in Indonesia, and all
 organized workers must belong to it. The Government
 established this organization in 1985 as a replacement for the
 preceding quasi-independent national labor federation FBSI.
 Political activity by the SPSI is forbidden. It is not
 permitted to organize civil servants or workers in
 government-owned enterprises nor in major sectors of the
 economy declared by the Government to be vital, such as air
 transportation and oil. However, some professional
 organizations, such as those for teachers, do act as unions in
 some respects. Although Indonesia is a party to a number of
 International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions on the right
 to organize and bargain collectively and on forced labor,
 government officials have made clear that Indonesia's
 obligations under these conventions will not be allowed to
 interfere with "Pancasila" labor relations.
 Restrictions on the SPSI's autonomy include the imposition of
 government appointees in many of it positions, a requirement
 that its senior officials be active members of the government-
 sponsored GOLKAR (see Section 3), and extensive government
 intervention in labor-management relations. The law requires
 government permission for strikes, which as a matter of
 practice is never given.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of religious freedom apply only
 to those religions recognized by the state--Islam,
 Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Although the Indonesian
 population is overwhelmingly Muslim, practice and teaching of
 the other recognized faiths are permitted. A plethora of
 mystical and other "folk religions" and sects also exists; a
 number of these have been banned, affecting perhaps 20,000
 adherents, while others are actually encouraged by government
 leaders. While it appears that the Government tolerates
 private practice of banned religions, adherents of these groups
 are occasionally harassed by local authorities. The legal
 requirement to accept Pancasila as governing ideology extends
 to all religious, as well as secular, organizations. A 1972
 letter of the Supreme Prosecutor reiterated a Presidential
 Decree of 1962 banning membership in Jehovah's Witnesses and
 
 
 723
 INDONESIA
 the Baha'i faith. Although technically belief in one of these
 faiths is not prohibited, legal decisions based on the 1972 and
 the 1962 decrees made clear that such belief implies
 membership, which is illegal. Baha'is from time to time are
 harassed or discriminated against by authorities for their
 religious beliefs and several have been strongly pressured to
 convert to Islam. Because the first tenet of Pancasila
 specifies belief in a Supreme Being, atheism is forbidden.
 Some animists in remote parts of Indonesia have reportedly been
 pressured to convert to Islam or Christianity in order to
 fulfill the requirement of belief in a Supreme Being. There
 are no legal bars to religious conversion, and conversions
 between faiths do occur. However, proselytizing in heavily
 Islamic areas is seen as potentially disruptive and is
 discouraged. For this reason, restrictions on the activities
 of foreign missionaries, such as difficulty in obtaining or
 renewing visas or residence permits, are periodically imposed
 in such areas. In other areas, missionary activities are
 relatively unimpeded and in fact are welcomed in remoter
 districts, where government resources in fields such as
 education and health are insufficient.
 Official holidays include Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist, as
 well as Muslim holy days. Indonesian Muslims, Christians, and
 Buddhists maintain active links with coreligionists inside and
 outside Indonesia. Travel to religious gatherings is
 permitted. Hajj trips to Mecca are available only through
 government-organized and priced tours. A set number of
 pilgrims is permitted to make the hajj annually.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although movement within Indonesia generally is unimpeded,
 restrictions do exist. The Government requires permits to
 change residence in certain areas, primarily to control the
 further shift of population from rural to urban locations.
 Since 1958-59, noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the
 right to live in rural areas of Java. There are restrictions
 on movement to and within East Timor and within parts of Irian
 Jaya. A majority of rural East Timorese living in the central
 and eastern parts of the province have been resettled in
 government-provided housing since 1979 to isolate them from
 Fretilin rebels and to facilitate their access to health,
 education and other government services. Former political
 detainees associated with the abortive 1965 coup attempt are
 required to notify authorities of travel away from their
 homes. Members or alleged supporters of the PKI outside
 Indonesia have not been allowed to return except on a
 case-by-case basis. The Government has tried to keep track of
 all of the 2.5 million former members of the PKI and some 20
 million members of its front groups. However, government
 statements indicate that it has lost track of several million
 of them (including fairly senior members).
 The Government periodically restricts foreign travel of
 domestic critics and others in disfavor with it. Some 5.000
 Indonesians currently are not permitted to leave the country,
 and this number includes critics of the Government, those
 arrested in the student riots of 1974, and others. However,
 other critics of the Government are free to travel abroad, and
 a person banned at one time may be permitted to travel
 subsequently. Students do not need government permission to go
 abroad to study. A Rp. 250,000 (US $150) departure tax, while
 instituted as a means to restrict travel abroad and thereby
 
 
 724
 INDONESIA
 save foreign exchange, has by itself the effect of limiting
 freedom of foreign travel.
 The Government continued with preparations to move several
 thousand "illegal immigrants" to the Island of Sumba. None has
 been moved to date. Most of these are understood to be Chinese
 who left Indonesia for China in the 1950's and 1960's. They
 subsequently returned to Indonesia but are considered by the
 Indonesian Government to have reentered illegally.
 Under its humane refugee policy, Indonesia has given first
 asylum to over 100,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. The
 Indochinese refugee population stood at 4,400 at the end of
 1986. In cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), the Government also provided one of the
 region's three refugee processing centers, where Indochinese
 refugees who landed in Indonesia received training to prepare
 them for permanent residence in other countries. In view of
 decreasing need, the training center was closed by UNHCR in
 October.
 In 1986 perhaps over 700 residents of Irian Jaya crossed into
 territory of Papua New Guinea, joining Irianese already in
 refugee camps in that country. Virtually all primitive tribal
 people, they reportedly fled their homes in response to rebel
 warnings, fears of Indonesian government and OPM clashes or
 other disturbances in their home areas. OPM allegations of
 Indonesian military reprisals against border crossers
 apparently discouraged most from returning to their homes.
 Foreign Minister Mochtar, however, reported some 5,000 border
 crossers have returned to Irian Jaya since 1984, and the
 Indonesian Government has given the Government of Papua New
 Guinea their names. (See Papua New Guinea report for
 additional details.)
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government's authority is largely concentrated in the hands
 of a small group of active-duty and retired military officers
 and civilian technocrats led by President Soeharto. This
 system ensures the continued preeminence of the military in all
 fields of governmental activity. The Parliament, political
 parties, and the general public have little ability to
 influence government decisions. However, particularly in
 budgetary matters, including military procurement, civilian
 technocrats exercise decisive influence, and government
 ministers are obliged to defend their departments' budgets and
 programs before parliamentary committees, the proceedings of
 which receive good press coverage.
 Elections for Parliament, held every 5 years, are scheduled for
 April 23, 1987. All adult citizens, except active-duty members
 of the armed forces and convicted criminals serving prison
 sentences, are eligible to vote. In mid-1985 the Government
 announced that thousands of persons implicated in the 1965
 PKI-inspired coup attempt or accused of sympathies or
 affiliation with the PKI or associated organizations may be
 permitted to vote for the first time under the New Order
 Government. To do so, however, they were required to pass a
 stringent government review of current and past activities to
 ensure no lingering PKI taint. There has been no announcement
 of how many will be cleared to vote.
 
 
 725
 INDONESIA
 In national elections, voters cast ballots for party lists of
 candidates for national, district, and local assemblies. While
 voting is not mandatory, there are strong social pressures to
 participate. Protest votes take the form of blank or
 deliberately spoiled ballots.
 Currently, the military is represented in Parliament by 75
 appointed members, who join the 360 elected members and 25
 other appointed ones for a total of 460. In accordance with
 the 1985 law, in the 1987 election 400 members of Parliament
 will be elected; there will be 100 appointees, all from the
 military. The President is elected by the People's
 Consultative Assembly (MPR), which consists of Parliament plus
 an equal number of members appointed by the President and
 regional governments. The MPR meets after the general election
 to promulgate a political program for the coming 5 years and to
 elect the President and Vice President. Its next meeting is
 set for March 1988.
 Parliament considers laws presented to it by government
 departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own.
 The Government seeks to resolve any potential parliamentary
 concerns before the bills are officially presented. Parliament
 can and does change the text and occasionally intent of bills
 it reviews. Bills of major significance, however, are often
 passed with little or no alteration. Usually Parliament works
 on the basis of consensus, not majority voting, to resolve any
 differing views during committee consideration of a bill.
 A 1975 law limits the number of political parties to three.
 One of these is made up of four former Muslim political parties
 and another of former nationalist and Christian parties.
 Members in these two parties occasionally reflect their earlier
 party affiliations, thereby exacerbating factional splits in
 their new parties. Party leaders are approved or named by the
 Government, and party activities are closely scrutinized and
 often guided by government authorities. These factors weaken
 the parties' election prospects and diminish their ability to
 represent effectively their constituents' concerns to the
 Government. The third, GOLKAR, is a longstanding,
 government-sponsored organization of functional groups which
 serves a role similar to that of a political party. In the
 three national elections since 1971, GOLKAR has won with more
 than 60 percent of the vote each time. Civil servants and
 their families are expected to vote for GOLKAR. Districts
 which support non-GOLKAR candidates may find government
 resources devoted to development projects in the area reduced.
 The two parties and GOLKAR are prohibited from organizing and
 operating officially below the district level except during
 election campaigns. Critics contend this system gives GOLKAR
 an advantage, since its civil service members have constant
 access to small towns and villages because of their official
 duties. All candidates for election to Parliament must pass a
 Government security check before their names appear on ballots.
 The PKI, the former Socialist Party (PSI), and a formerly
 powerful Muslim party, MASYUMI, linked with separatist
 rebellions in the late 1950's are specifically banned. With
 rare exceptions, members of the first and many leaders of the
 last are not allowed to run for office or to be active
 politically.
 
 
 726
 INDONESIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Amnesty International representatives, for example,
 have been refused access to Indonesia (and East Timor, in
 particular) because of their organization's continued criticism
 of the Government and the Government's belief it is biased.
 Similarly Asia Watch and other international human rights
 groups have-been denied permission to visit. There is no local
 chapter of Amnesty International, although individual citizens
 may have memberships. The Government is hostile toward
 citizens who maintain close ties with foreign human rights
 organizations and reportedly has arrested at least one person
 who allegedly passed human rights-related information to such
 an organization. He was later released. Local human rights
 activists complain that the Government uses harassment, press
 censorship, financial controls, and other forms of intimidation
 to suppress meaningful human rights activities.
 Under an agreement the Government concluded with. the ICRC in
 1985, the ICRC continues to conduct regular visits to persons
 jailed in connection with events in East Timor; to provide
 medical and food aid to detainees on Atauro Island as well as
 to assess the situation of those persons returned to the main
 island after having been held on Atauro; to carry out
 medical-nutritional surveys in vulnerable villages in East
 Timor; and to reunite divided families in East Timor and abroad
 (mainly Portugal). In addition, the ICRC is permitted to visit
 prisoners convicted of participation in the 1965 PKI-backed
 attempted coup.
 The Government was critical of Amnesty International's 1986
 report on what Amnesty International termed Muslim "political
 prisoners" and denied that these prisoners were being treated
 cruelly or inhumanely. The Government normally does not
 respond to specific allegations from foreign organizations or
 to public queries on human rights-related cases.
 A number of domestic organizations are concerned with human
 rights. The Department of Justice has an agency charged with
 drafting legal codes to replace colonial laws still in effect.
 This agency also has responsibility for the establishment of
 legal documentation facilities and for programs to inform
 citizens of their legal rights. In addition, several state
 university law departments and private groups associated with
 mosques and churches are involved in providing legal counseling
 services.
 There are private legal aid organizations which help in a wide
 variety of legal cases, including those accused of subversion
 or related activities, by defending or representing aggrieved
 parties in court and by stimulating press attention and
 discussion. These private legal aid organizations have
 established offices in many larger Indonesian cities. They are
 dependent on donations, many of which come from foreign private
 or government donors, for which Government approval is required
 and sometimes refused. Human rights activists in Indonesia
 contend that the ORMAS Law passed in mid-1985 is a direct
 attempt by the Government to monitor and influence human rights
 activity in the country.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Indonesian women generally enjoy a high degree of economic and
 social freedom, and there is significant cultural latitude for
 women's participation in public life. The status of women is
 much higher in the middle and upper classes than in any rural
 or working-class group. Women occupy important mid-level
 positions in the civil service, educational institutions, labor
 unions, the military, the professions, and private business.
 The Cabinet named in 1983 includes two women: The Minister of
 State for Women's Affairs and the Minister for Social Affairs.
 Although legislation guarantees women equal treatment, women
 seldom receive equal pay for equal work. In addition to a
 government-sponsored women's organization in which membership
 and participation are mandatory, there are several voluntary,
 private groups which work to advance women's legal, economic,
 and political rights. Chief among these is KOWANI (Congress of
 Indonesian Women), an umbrella organization for some 55 women's
 groups.
 Ethnic Chinese are pressured to take Indonesian names. While
 they are also encouraged to become citizens, some Chinese find
 legal avenues to citizenship blocked or are discouraged by the
 time-consuming and expensive task of obtaining citizenship
 documents. Chinese who have been unable to obtain Indonesian
 citizenship, although perhaps born in Indonesia, can lose their
 right to residence should they be abroad for a period of more
 than 3 months. Government regulations prohibit the operation
 of all-Chinese schools and institutions of higher learning,
 teaching in Chinese languages, the formation of exclusively
 Chinese cultural groups or trade associations, and the use of
 Chinese characters on signboards or in publications. However,
 social and religious groups which are, in effect, all-Chinese
 are not proscribed and do exist.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Employment of children under age 14 is forbidden by the basic
 labor law of 1948. The law also established an 8-hour day,
 48-hour week, 1 rest day per week, and a definite vacation
 period. An extensive body of labor law and ministerial
 regulations provide for minimum standards of industrial health
 and safety. In practice, these statutes are rarely observed.
 Indonesian law provides that the Department of Manpower Office
 in each region shall, at regular intervals, establish a minimum
 wage for its particular region. A new minimum wage for
 Jakarta, for example, was established in November 1985 at $1.18
 per day. The range of regional minimum wages is from a high of
 $1.18 per day in some areas to a low of 50 cents per day in
 others. The Department of Manpower and the Central Statistical
 Office also report for each region a minimum physical needs
 figure.
 Wages of many workers in the modern sector exceed minimum wage
 figures, and the Government and labor unions are working
 seriously to raise minimum wages to meet minimum physical
 needs' figures. Observance of the minimum wage regulations
 varies from sector to sector and region to region. Reliable
 figures on the total compliance situation do not exist.
