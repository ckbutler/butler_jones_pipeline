 ALGERIA
 According to its Constitution, Algeria is a Socialist, Islamic
 state in which ultimate power is vested in a single political
 party, the Front de Liberation Nationale. Chadli Bendjedid
 monopolizes key positions as Secretary General of the party,
 President of the Republic, and Minister of Defense.
 Nonetheless, most important decisions are taken by consensus
 involving the military, government, and party elites.
 These elites are bound together by the common experience of a
 harsh struggle for independence. A sense of 'revolutionary,
 anti-colonial mission' is basic to their self-perception of
 what Algeria is and ought to be. Importantly, this
 revolutionary consensus is the principal source of popular
 legitimacy for the Government of a nation which has little
 else to draw on in creating a spirit of national cohesion.
 Urban police and the rural-oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. Military security forces in practice are
 given greater leeway, although there are no documented cases
 of abuse.
 Although equal before the law, women are restricted in the
 enjoyment of their freedoms by tradition. The status of women
 is slowly improving through greater education and increased
 participation in public life, but the great majority of women
 remain in traditional roles.
 Tensions over cultural rights for Berbers, who constitute from
 one-quarter to one-third of the population, are being reduced
 by government efforts to accommodate Berber needs.
 The economy is Socialist and largely under state control. The
 private sector is, however, increasingly recognized as a
 valuable participant. The development of extensive
 hydrocarbon resources allowed Algeria to undertake ambitious
 industrialization programs in the past two decades. The next
 Five-Year Plan (1985-89) will continue to emphasize
 revitalizing agriculture, creating employment, and building
 housing and schools. Major problem areas include
 underemployment, lack of productivity, and gaps in the supply
 and distribution system.
 Although the Constitution contains human rights guarantees,
 civil liberties remain restricted and political rights in
 particular are circumscribed by the party and the Government,
 which limit electoral choices and restrict public debate to
 officially sanctioned forums. On balance, however, the trend
 has continued to be favorable, including the May amnesty of 90
 political prisoners and reduced tensions with the Berber
 minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings in 1984.
 
 
 1172
 ALGERIA
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 neither condoned nor practiced. There were no accusations of
 such practices in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Tne Constitution prohibits torture. Nevertheless, Amnesty
 International has reported receiving unconfirmed reports of
 torture or ill-treatment in Algerian prisons.
 Prison conditions are said to range from primitive to modern.
 In the primary civil prison in Algiers, prisoners are often
 crowded and sanitary conditions are poor. Better conditions
 are found in some smaller outlying prisons. All prisons have
 medical facilities, and each prison has a contract with a
 local doctor who visits the prison regularly to treat ill
 prisoners. Prisoners who are seriously ill may be transferred
 to local hospitals. Prison diet is often inadequate;
 prisoners' families may provide much of their food. Families
 are allowed to visit prisoners and in some cases, at the
 discretion of local prison authorities, conjugal visits are
 permitted. Prisoners convicted of civil crimes are quartered
 apart from those convicted of crimes such as terrorism. The
 treatment, however, is generally similar.
 Lawyers are allowed regular access to their clients. Meetings
 take place under visual supervision of a guard.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted,
 arrested, or held except as provided by law. It also provides
 that detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be
 charged or released. The penal code provides for informing
 detainees immediately of charges against them.
 Tnough theoretically bound by the same provisions as the
 police, Military Security in fact operates under fewer
 restrictions and is said to hold suspects up to a month before
 releasing or charging them. Military Security is authorized
 to investigate not only military offenses, but also cases
 involving internal security and foreign intelligence
 collection. In cases that involve subversion, Military
 Security may also investigate civil crimes.
 Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive
 detention while his case is investigated. This detention can
 last many months: 23 Islamic fundamentalist leaders arrested
 in December 1982 were not brought to trial until September
 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel. As far as is known, defendants
 are made fully aware of the charges against them at the time
 they are bound over for trial. Trials are public, and
 defendants have the right of appeal. The judicial system is
 divided into three parts: civil courts, military courts, and
 the State Security Court. The civil courts are generally
 independent of executive or military control. Military courts
 
 
 1173
 ALGERIA
 deal directly with espionage and with offenses committed by
 military personnel, such as absence without leave and theft.
 The State Security Court at Medea is not in permanent session,
 but has jurisdiction over cases that are deemed "to endanger
 the national security.* At least a ministerial-level decision
 is required to refer a case to the State Security Court. It
 generally provides procedural protections similar to those of
 civilian courts.
 The Administrative Court for Financial Accountability was
 active in early 1984, convicting numerous middle-grade
 officials of financial corruption but was generally quiescent
 in late 1984. Procedural protections similar to those of
 civilian courts are provided.
 All political prisoners arrested prior to February 1979 have
 been released since President Bendjedid took office. The
 Algerian Government also granted amnesty on May 13, 1984 to 90
 political prisoners, some of whom had been held without trial
 for 2 years. Reported among those released were 10 former
 ministers of the Ben Bella Government, 30-45 Islamic
 fundamentalists, 3 feminist leaders, a group of Trotskyite
 students, some alleged illegal arms smugglers, a prominent
 attorney and a medical doctor. There were also numerous
 political bureau meetings between August and October to
 consider amnesty for those Algerians (many of whom apparently
 fled Algeria) who may have committed "political crimes* during
 the preindependence revolutionary period.
 The 23 fundamentalist leaders arrested at the end of 1982 were
 tried publicly in September 1984 and, after a hearing of five
 days, were found guilty of civil crimes committed in 1982.
 The sentences, ranging from 20 months to 8 years imprisonment,
 were far more lenient than those requested by the State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except
 for senior government and military officials who must be
 members of the party. Otherwise the Government does not
 interfere with the private lives of Algerians.
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution
 and generally is honored in practice except in some cases
 involving military security. Police may not enter a house
 without a warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating
 magistrate, nor may they enter a residence during night hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it
 also states that such freedom may not be used to "undermine
 the foundations of the Socialist revolution.' The print media
 are published either by the Government or the party.
 Journalists are government employees. The distribution of
 foreign newspapers and magazines is also controlled, though
 such publications are available. The French-language weekly
 Jeune Afrique is proscribed, and the French-language daily Le
 Monde is occasionally seized. The Government does not permit
 criticism of its authority. However, criticism of specific
 programs and policies and the performance of government
 offices and state enterprises is allowed and even encouraged.

 ALGERIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is only one legal political party and one inclusive
 labor union, the General Union of Algerian Workers. These and
 other 'mass organizations' for youth, women, farmers, and
 veterans, all tightly controlled by the party, are the primary
 recognized associations. Security personnel watch public
 gatherings closely. Limited political opposition, such as
 occasional student demonstrations, is tolerated. There were
 no significant political demonstrations in 1984. Opposition
 political tracts are sometimes circulated, almost certainly
 with official knowledge. Strikes are illegal in the public
 sector, but workers have successfully used strikes, without
 the sanction of the national union, to win more pay and
 benefits.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state, Algeria protects the rights of the
 very small Christian and Jewish minorities. There is little
 evidence of individual prejudice. Christian churches and
 Jewish synagogues exist and are permitted to observe their
 rites. There are no formal restrictions on missionary
 activity, but in general the Christian clergy directs its
 activities to the Christian expatriate community.
 The Islamic "clergy" is government-trained. Friday sermons
 are not formally censored, but government monitoring
 constrains the clergy's freedom of expression. Religious
 travel such as the Hajj (the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) is
 government-organized. There were no overt manifestations of
 Islamic dissidence in 1984, although the funeral of a
 prominent fundamentalist leader in Algiers in April drew a
 significant gathering on short notice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One
 of the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to remove
 the exit visa requirement. However, government permission is
 still necessary to travel to Morocco. There is also an
 unannounced restriction on .travel to Spain growing out of a
 gas dispute with that country. Passports may sometimes take
 months to acquire but this is improving. The amount of hard
 currency which Algerians may carry abroad remains the primary
 limitation on foreign travel.
 The Algerian and French governments have agreed on a series of
 measures, such as special benefits, to encourage some of the
 nearly 1 million Algerian workers in France to return
 voluntarily to Algeria.
 Except for foreign diplomats, who must apply for permission to
 travel farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted. Visitors must fill out
 police registration forms if they are staying overnight in a
 locality. The gendarmerie routinely sets up vehicular
 checkpoints in the countryside.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 According to estimates of international experts, there may be
 as many as 160,000 to 165,000 refugees in camps near Tindouf
 in southwest Algeria. Most of them are said to be from the
 
 
 1175
 ALGERIA
 Western Sahara. Algeria also admitted between one and two
 thousand Palestinians from Lebanon in 1983, many of whom have
 since departed. There also are several thousand refugees of
 the Sahel drougnt, mostly from Mali and Niger. The Government
 contributes to the support of all of the Saharan and Sahelian
 refugees, as does the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 The Government hosts various foreign opposition and dissident
 groups, such as the Polisario and Palestinian Liberation
 Organization. Many of their representatives are located in
 Algiers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Rights of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of the
 party, government, and military, all three headed by President
 Bendjedid. The political process is confined to the single
 party, which significantly limits deviation from the path
 prescribed by ruling authorities. While fundamental policy
 decisions are not questioned, there is considerable airing of
 popular aspirations and grievances within the party
 organization, the National Popular Assembly, the provincial and
 local councils, and in the government-controlled press. The
 Assembly also has legislative functions. There is universal
 adult suffrage. All candidates for office are nominated by the
 party, though voters usually have a choice among several
 candidates. Freedom House says that elections are managed by
 the party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There was a visit by a French human rights organization in
 April 1984. There are no internal human rights organizations.
 Algeria supports human rights initiatives in U.N. and regional
 forums, but usually does not take the lead.
 In its 1984 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the long-term detention without trial of individuals on
 political grounds, prolonged incommunicado detention, and
 reports of ill-treatment of detainees. Freedom House calls
 Algeria 'not free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Algerian economy is largely Socialist, with the main
 economic sectors run by state enterprises; however, recognizing
 that private enterprise has an important contribution to make,
 the December 1981 Party Congress officially endorsed a larger
 role for the private sector. At present, about half of the
 arable land remains with independent herders and farmers, most
 retail businesses and service firms are privately owned, and
 there are several thousand small private industrial firms in
 operation.
 An estimated 3.1 percent annual population increase and a
 fertility rate of 7.4 (1982) make it difficult to meet all
 nutritional and social needs and to provid4 full employment,
 but minimum vital needs are being met. Housing is in extremely
 short supply. About 16.6 percent of the active working
 population was unemployed in 1982, the latest year for
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 75
 
 
 1176
 ALGERIA
 which figures are available. A 1977 estimate put the urban
 population living below the absolute poverty level at 20
 percent.
 Per capita gross national product (GNP) was estimated at $2,085
 in 1983. About 60 percent of GNP is consumed while 40 percent
 is invested. This rate of investment is high, reflecting a
 conscious government policy. The rate of real growth in 1983
 was estimated at 12 percent.
 The Government controls most food supplies, although the
 private sector is increasingly important. One-third of the
 nation's food must be imported because of inefficient
 agriculture. While food supplies are adequate, the cost is
 high and supply irregular.
 Most health care is rudimentary, but free and widely
 available. Life expectancy was 57 years in 1984, compared with
 47 in 1960. Infant mortality was 106 per 1,000 live births in
 1984. While most of the population was considered to have
 access to safe water, water-borne diseases remain a serious
 problem, especially for young children.
 Education is free through the university level and is
 compulsory between the ages of 6 and 13. Educational
 facilities have been vastly expanded since independence, but
 are still insufficient in both rural and urban areas. The
 literacy level in Arabic, French, or both is approximately 40
 percent of the population over 9 years of age, but is steadily
 increasing as the large majority of children now attend school.
 The total Berber population has been estimated at between
 one-quarter and one-third of Algeria's 21 million inhabitants.
 In the last few years there have been demonstrations by
 Berbers, sometimes leading to violent clashes over cultural
 rights. The Government has shown more concern in recent years
 for reconciling its policy of developing the identity of
 Algeria as an Arab nation with Berber desires to preserve their
 own culture and language, while retaining French as a language
 of work and education. Concessions have been made, including
 the introduction of Berber as an academic subject in the major
 universities. Moreover, Berber regions have received extra
 attention in government programs to build schools, housing, and
 municipal infrastructure. Although Berber particularism
 remains an area of concern, no major confrontations were
 reported in 1984.
 The status of women is improving, but tradition and culture
 make it difficult for women to follow an independent path. The
 great majority of women remain in traditional roles, although
 their participation in public life is growing. Ten women have
 been elected to the Popular National Assembly, two are members
 of the Central Committee of the party, and several women have
 been elected to the Council of the National Committee of the
 party. Women also serve in the armed forces.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women from
 men in education. According to government statistics, 62
 percent of all school-age girls were enrolled in 1980 compared
 with 39 percent in 1965. In 1979, about 40 percent of all
 students were female. A new family code was formally approved
 in 1984. Among its principal components is encouragement of
 'birth spacing.'
