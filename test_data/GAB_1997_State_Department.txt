 GABON
 A one-party state until 1990, Gabon held its first multiparty elections in 1991,
 with President Omar Bongo's party retaining a large majority in the National As-
 sembly. President Bongo, in o ice since 1967, was reelected in 1993 in an election
 marred by serious irregularities. After several months of contention and civil unrest,
 political parties supporting the President and the principal opposition parties nego-
 tiated in October 1994 the "Paris Accords." These agreements included promises of
 reforms to amend electoral procedures, to include opposition leaders in government,
 and to assure greater respect for human rights. These were approved by a national
 referendum in July 1995. Opposition parties won disorganized municipal elections
 in the capital in October and November, while in December parties supporting the
 President won more than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly in poorly
 run, fraudulent elections. Regional councils later elected 91 members of the new na-
 
 
 tional Senate, more than half of whom represent the President's party. The judiciary
 is independent but remains vulnerable to government manipulation.
 The national police and the gendarmerie enforce the law and maintain public se-
 curity. In conformity with the Paris Accords, the National Assembly reassigned au-
 thority over these security forces from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of
 the Interior and redesignated as the "Republican Guard," an elite, heavily armed
 corps that protects the President. In 1994 the Defense Minister used this corps for
 violent repression of public dissent; there have been no reported incidents since that
 time. Security forces on occasion beat persons in custody.
 The Government generally adheres to free market principles, particularly in the
 export sector, in which trade is dominated by petroleum, timber, and minerals. A
 majority of workers in the formal sector are employed by the Government or by
 large, inefficient, state-owned organizations, although the country did make
 p rgress in 1997 toward its privatization goals. Per capita inome is approximately
 4,600 annually, and inome distribution is badly skewed in favor of urban dwellers
 and a small economic elite. Immigrants from other African countries dominate the
 informal sector. The rural population is poor and receives few social services. Finan-
 cial mismanagement and corruption have resulted in significant arrears in domestic
 and external debt. The Government continued to meet most of its structural adjust-
 ment performance goals.
 The Government generally respected the rights of its citizens in many areas; how-
 ever, longstanding human rights abuses continued.
 The security forces beat and tortured prisoners and detainees, and prison condi-
 tions remained abysmal. Societal discrimination and violence against women, and
 exploitation of expatriate children as domestic and agricultural workers remained
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 On August 25, following a round of voting in a local legislative by-election, five
 people were killed and at least three wounded during a clash over transporting a
 allot box near the city of Makokou. Claiming election fraud, supporters of one party
 attempted to block gendarmes from moving the ballot box to the official ballot count-
 ing site. Both party members and gendarmes claimed the other side initiated the
 shooting.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel and inuman punishment. However, se-
 curity forces often beat or physically mistreat prisoners and detainees as punish-
 ment and to exact confessions.
 Conditions in mostprisons are abysmal and life threatening. Sanitation and ven-
 tilation are poor, and medical care is almost nonexistent. Prisons provide inad-
 equate food for inmates. There were no known visits by human rights monitors to
 prisons during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, during which time police must charge a detainee before
 a judge. In practice, however, police rarely respect this provision. Bail may be set
 if there is to be a further investigation. Pretrial detainees have the right to free ac-
 cess to their attorneys, and this right is respected in practice. Detainees have the
 right to an expeditious trial, as defined by the law. Pretrial detention is limited to
 6 months for a misdemeanor and to 1 year for a felony charge. These eodsmay
 be extended for 6 months by the examining magistrate. The Attorney General's of-
 fice estimates that roughly 40 percent of persons in custody are pretrial detainees.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The judiciary is generally independent but remains vulnerable to government
 manipulation.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a public trial and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights are generally respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, proce-
 dural safeguards are lacking, particularly in state security trials. The law applies
 the concept of presumed guilt. A judge may thus deliver an immediate verdict at
 the initial hearing, if sufficient evidence is presented by the State.
 The judicial system includes the regular courts, a military tribunal, and a civilian
 State Security Court. The regular court system includes trial courts, appellate
 courts, and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court is a separate body charged
 
 
 122
 with examining constitutional questions, including the certification of elections.
 There are no traditional or customary courts. In some areas, minor disputes may
 be taken to a local chief, but the Government does not recognize such decisions. The
 State Security Court, last convened in 1990, is constituted by the Government as
 required to consider matters of state security.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from surveillance, from searches without war-
 rant, and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As
 part of criminal investigations, police may request search warrants from judges,
 which they obtain easily, sometimes after the fact. The Government has used them
 in the past to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Gov-
 ernment authorities also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, per-
 sonal mail, and the movements of citizens.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and in practice, citizens speak freely and criticize leaders. Legislators
 in the National Assembly openly criticize government policies, ministers, and other
 officials.
 The only daily newspaper is the government-owned L'Union, but there are more
 than a hal-dozen weekly or periodical publications in newspaper-format, represent-
 ing independent views and those of various political parties. All-including
 L'tnion-actively criticize the Government and political leaders of.all parties. Most
 also criticize the President.
 The National Communication Council (NCC), an appointed body, imposed restric-
 tions on opposition-owned media several times. One opposition weekly was sus-
 p ended for a month for publishing an article that allegedly threatenedthe Presi-
 dent, and an opposition-owned radio station was twice censured for broadcasting
 interviews and listener comments judged by the NCC to be dangerous to public
 order.
 The Government controls the national electronic media, which reach all areas of
 the country. Four private radio stations have been licensed. A fifth station pre-
 viously operating under a temporary closed for financial -reasons. Journalists are
 subject to an extensive code of rights and responsibilities approved by the National
 Assembly in 1995.
 The Government does not interfere with broadcasts of international radio stations
 Radio France 1, Africa No. 1, or the Voice of America. Foreign newspapers and mag-
 azines are widely available. -
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens and recognized orga-
 nizations normally enjoy freedom of assembly and association, which are provided
 for by the Constitution. Groups must obtain permits for public gatherings in ad-
 vance, and the Government usually grants them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and au-
 thorities do not engage in religious persecution or favoritism. There is no state reli-
 gion. While the Government has not lifted its ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, neither
 has it enforced this ban.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights. There are no legally man-
 dated restrictions on internal movement. Police and gendarmes frequently stop trav-
 elers to check identity, residence, or registration documents, and members of the se-
 curity forces regularly harass- expatriate Africans working legally as merchants,
 service sector employees, and manual laborers. They extorted bribes and demanded
 services with the threat of confiscation of residence documents or imprisonment.
 Residence permits cost up to $1,000.
 An unevenly enforced law requires married women to have their husbands' per-
 mission to travel abroad. An exit visa is no longer required for citizens to travel
 abroad. Aliens resident in the country must obtmn a visa in order to leave and re-
 turn.
 The -Government strictly controls the process of refugee adjudication. Coordination
 with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is generally adequate, and
 during the year the Government provided first asylum to more than 1,500 persons.
 However, in the course of an involuntary repatriation of Rwandan nationals in Au-
 gust, the Government deported at least eight individuals who had been recognized
 by the UNHCR as having a legitimate claim to refugee status. These individuals
 were returned to Rwanda despite the objections of the UNHCR. There were about
 800 refugees at year's end.
 
 
 123
 On November 5, gendarmes arrested and forcibly repatriated two prominent polit-
 ical refugees from Equatorial Guinea. Felipe Ondo Obiang (former president of par-
 liament) and Guillermo Nguema Ela (former finance minister) were seized by gen-
 darmes just prior to the November 6 ACP summit in Libreville. The arresting officer
 reportedly told the two men, who were registered with the UNHCR as political refu-
 gees, that they would be released after the conference. However, instead of being
 released, the Government's head of immigration control in charge of refugees de-
 clared that they had no claim for asylum. They reportedly were returned to Equa-
 torial Guinea at the request of the President, whose plane was used to deport them.
 They were detained at the presidential complex in Equatorial Guinea, but report-
 edly released on November 11. The Government failed to respond to international
 protests over the treatment of these refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution explicitly provides this right, but mismanagement and seri-
 ous irregularities in both the 1990 and 1996 legislative elections and the 1993 presi-
 dential election called into serious doubt the extent to which this right exists in
 practice.
 In a July 1995 constitutional referendum, citizens approved by a 96 percent ma-
 jority reforms previously agreed in the Paris Accords, including most significantly
 the establishment of an independent National Eletoral Commidssion (NEC). The ref-
 erendum was carried out under arrangements that assured that all political parties
 could monitor voting and vote counting.
 National Assemby, Senate, and municipal elections Were held in late 1996, after
 a series of postponements due to both legislative inaction and requests by the NEC
 for additional time. Delays in registering voters and organizing elections were at-
 tributed by all sides to logistical rather than political obstacles.
 Local elections held in October 1996 were poorly organized and were later re-
 peated in key districts. In both rounds, opposition parties won most of the municipal
 council seats in the capital, Libreville. This outcome was reversed in the official re-
 sults of poorly run legislative elections held in December 1996, in which parties
 supporting the President took more than 80 of the 120 National Assembly seats, in-
 cluding 8 of the 10 seats representing the capital. The military and NEC mag-
 istrates fraudulently ensured victory for parties supportig the President by arbi-
 trarily altering vote counts, particularly in the capital. In early 1997, municipal and
 regional leaders elected 91 members to the new national Senate without con-
 trovery. There are no restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 politics. There are 6 women among the 120 National Assembly representatives, 9
 of 91 members of the Senate are women, and there is 1 woman in the Cabinet.
 Women serve at all levels within the various ministries, the judiciary, and the oppo-
 sition. Despite governmental protections, indigenous Pygmies rarely participate in
 the political process, and the Government has made only marginal efforts to include
 them (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government officially allows the existence of independent human rights
 groups. There are two human rights groups, neither of which was active. There were
 no reports of harassment by officials.
 There have been no active inquiries from foreign groups in recent years.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gender, or
 opinion. The Government does not uniformly enforce these constitutional guarantees
 and tolerates a substantial degree of discrimination against women, especially in do-
 mestic affairs. It has also provided a lower level of health care and educational serv-
 ices to children of families of other African nationalities than it provided to citizens.
 Women.-Violence against women is common and is especially prevalent in rural
 areas. While medical authorities have not specifically identified rape to be a chronic
 problem, religious workers and hospital staff report that evidence of physical beat-
 ings of women is common. Police rarely intervene in such cases, and women vir-
 tually never file complaints with civil authorities. Only limited medical and legal
 assistance is available.
 The law provides that women have rights to equal access in education, business,
 and investment. Women own businesses and property, participate in politics, and
 work throughout the government and the private sector. Women nevertheless con-
 tinue to face considerable societal and legal discrimination, especially in rural areas.
 
 
 By law couples must stipulate at the time of marriage whether they will adhere
 to a monogamous or a polygynous relationship. For monogamous married couples,
 a common property law provides for the equal distribution of assets after divorce.
 Wives who leave polygynous husbands suffer severe reductions in their property
 rights. In inheritance cases, the husband's family must issue a written authorization
 before his widow can inherit property. Common law marriage, which is socially ac-
 cepted and widely practiced, affords a woman no proprty rights.
 The law still requires that a woman obtain her husband's permission to travel
 abroad; however, this requirement is not consistently enforced.
 Children.-The Government has used oil revenue to build schools, to pay ade-
 quate teacher salaries, and to promote education, even in rural areas. The country
 has a relatively high infant mortality rate, and not all children have access to vac-
 cination. Traditional beliefs and practices provide numerous safeguards for children,
 but children remain the responsibility of the extended family-including aunts,
 grandmothers, and older siblings. There is little evidence of physical abuse of chil-
 dren. Protection for children's rights is not codified in law.
 There is concern about the problems facing the large community of children of Af-
 rican noncitizens. Almost all enjoy far less access to education and health care than
 do children of Gabonese, and are sometimes victims of child labor abuses (see Sec-
 tion 6.d.). Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, occurs among
 the resident population of expatriate Africans. There are no laws against FGM, but
 according to local women's groups it is not practiced on Gabonese children.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, nor providing for access to buildings or services.
 Indigenous People.--Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in northeastern
 Gabon. In principle they enjoy the same civil rights as other citizens. Pygmies are
 largely independent of formal authority, keeping their own traditions, independent
 communities, and local decisionmaking structures. Pygmies did not participate in
 government-instituted programs that integrated many small rural villages into larg-
 er ones along major roads. As a result, their access to government-funded health
 and sanitation facilities was limited. There are no specific government programs or
 policies to assist or hinder Pygmies.
 National IRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Persons from all major ethnic groups contin-
 ued to occupy prominent psitions in government, in the military services, and in
 the private sector. Credible reports suggest, however, that ethnic favoritism in hir-
 ing and promotion is pervasive. There was evidence, especially within the armed
 forces, that members of the President's ethnic group held a disproportionately large
 share both of senior positions and of jobs within the ranks.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution places no restrictions on the right
 of association and recognizes the right of citizens to form trade and labor unions.
 Virtually the entire formal private sector work force is unionized. Unions must reg-
 ister with the Government in order to be recognized officially. Public sector employ-
 ees may unionize although their right to strike is limited if it could jeopardize public
 safety. Until 1990 there was only one recognized labor organization, the Gabonese
 Labor Confederation (COSYGA), to which all unionized workers contributed a man-
 datory percentage of their salaries. In 1992 the Government accepted the establish-
 ment of independent unions and abolished the mandatory contribution to COSYGA.
 In 1994 the National Assembly passed an extensively revised version of the Labor
 Code, which was published and implemented in early 1995. The Code provides ex-
 tensive protection of worker rights.
 Strikes are legal if they are held after an 8-day notice advising that outside arbi-
 tration has failed. The Labor Code prohibits direct government action against indi-
 vidual strikers who abide by the arbitration and notification provisions. It also pro-
 -vides that the Government cannot press charges against a group as a whole for
 criminal activities committed by individuals. Unions and confederations are free to
 affiliate with international labor bodies and participate in their activities. COSYGA
 is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, while the Gabo-
 nese Confederation of Free Unions (CGSL) is affiliated with the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions. Both COSYGA and CGSL have ties with numerous
 other international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate differences, and the
 Ministry of Labor provides an observer. This observer does not take an active part
 in negotiations over pay scales, working conditions, or benefits. Agreements also
 apply to nonunion workers. While no laws specifically prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 
 
 tion, the court may require employers found guilty by civil courts of having engaged
 in such discrimination to compensate employees.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there are no reports that it exists in the adult community. The Government also
 specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively. As reported by UNICEF and other concerned organizations,
 immigant children in particular are often found working as domestic or agricul-
 tural'help.
 An international human rights group has reported children in countries such as
 Togo and Benin were seized and sold into domestic servitude in Gabon. No con-
 firmed cases were available at year's end. There is no organized local market in
 child labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 below the age of 16 ma not work without the express consent of the Ministries of
 Labor, Education, and Public Health. These ministries rigorously enforce this law
 with respect to children, and there are few Gabonese under the age of -18 working
 in the modern wage sector. A significant number of children work in marketplaces
 or perform domestic duties. The United Nations Children's Fund and other con-
 cerned organizations have reported that government officials often privately use for-
 eign child labor, mainly as omestic or agricultural help. These children do not go
 to school, have only limited means of acquiring medical attention, and are often vic-
 tims of exploitation by employers or foster families. Laws forbidding child labor
 theoretically extend protection to foreign children as well, but abuses often are not
 reported. Education is compulsory until age 16.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not en-
 force this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code governs working conditions
 and benefits for all sectors and provides a broad range of protection to workers. The
 Code stipulates a 40-hour workweek with a minimum rest period of 48 consecutive
 hours. Employers must compensate workers for overtime work. All companies in the
 modern wage sector pay competitive wages and grant generous fringe benefits re-
 quired by law, including maternity leave and 6 weeks of annual paid vacation.
 Traditionally, representatives of labor, management, and the Government met an-
 nually to examine economic and labor conditions and to recommend a minimum
 wage rate within government guidelines to the President, who then issued an an-
 nual decree. This procedure was not followed in 1995, 1996, or 1997, in part because
 the Government was pursuing a policy of wage austerity recommended by inter-
 national financial institutions. The monthly minimum wage was kept at its 1994
 level of about $110 (cfa 64,000). Wages provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and family.
 The Ministry of Health has established occupational health and safety standards,
 but does not effectively enforce or regulate them. Application of labor standards var-
 ies greatly from company to company and between industries. The Government re-
 portedly does not enforce Labor Code provisions in sectors where the bulk of the
 labor force is non-Gabonese. Foreigners, both documented and undocumented, may
 be obliged to work under substandard conditions; may be dismissed without notice
 or recourse; or may be physically mistreated, especially in the case of illegal aliens.
 Employers frequently require longer hours of work from noncitizen Africans and pay
 them less, often hiring on a short-term, casual basis in order to avoid paying taxes,
 social security contributions, and other benefits. In the formal sector, workers may
 remove themselves from dangerous work situations without fear of retribution.
