 Uruguay is a constitutional republic governed by an elected
 president and a bicameral legislature. On November 26, 1989,
 a free and fair presidential election took place for the first
 time since Uruguay returned to constitutional government in
 1985 after 12 years of military rule. (The 1984 election was
 not completely free since the armed forces prohibited 'some
 politicians from campaigning.) Luis Alberto Lacalle of the
 National (Blanco) Party was elected President and will begin
 his 5-year term on March 1, 1990, succeeding Julio Maria
 Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party. Uruguay's judicial branch
 is independent, as is its legislature. Political parties, the
 press, labor unions, private interest groups, and other
 nongovernmental groups function freely, and political debate
 is vigorous and unrestricted.
 Uruguay's small military establishment, consisting of an army,
 air force, and navy, is under the supervision of the Ministry
 of Defense. The military does not participate in domestic
 security matters unless ordered to do so by the civilian
 authorities. Domestic security and public safety matters are
 under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, which
 administers all of the country's police departments.
 Uruguay is a middle income country (with a per capita gross
 domestic product of $2,596 in 1988) whose economy is still
 heavily dependent on agricultural exports and agro-industry.
 After significant growth in 1986 and 1987, the economy slowed
 dramatically in 1988 and was not expected to rebound
 significantly in 1989. The slowdown is due to a reversal of
 the same trends which fueled growth in 1986-1987, such as
 increases in oil prices and higher international interest
 rates; declining domestic demand and investment; and a severe
 drought which seriously affected the agricultural sector.
 During 1989 there were no credible reports of significant
 human rights violations. After the return to democracy in
 1985, all political prisoners and even some nonpolitical ones
 received amnesty.. The most important human rights event in
 1989 was the referendum on the 1986 Law of Expiration, put
 forth by the Government under heavy pressure from the
 military, which effectively exempted military and police
 personnel from prosecution for human rights abuses committed
 during the military regime. Opponents of the law were able to
 have the issue submitted to a referendum, and on April 16 the
 law was upheld by a margin of 1,082,454 to 799,109 (57.5 to
 42.5 percent of the valid votes cast) in a national
 plebiscite. In 1989 the Supreme Court, by a 3 to 2 vote,
 again upheld the Law of Expiration in cases challenging its
 constitutionality, but only after classifying it as an
 amnesty. The Government, to avoid offending the military, had
 avoided calling the law an amnesty.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No cases of politically motivated or other extrajudicial
 killings were reported.
 
 
 753
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance were reported during 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits brutal treatment of prisoners. In
 July 1989, the death of a laborer while in police custody led
 to charges of police mistreatment. The police maintained that
 the prisoner hanged himself in his cell. The resulting
 controversy led to the resignation of the Minister of the
 Interior, and a Deputy Police Chief was convicted of
 misconduct in connection with the death. There were no other
 reports of possible mistreatment of prisoners in 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution requires a written warrant for an arrest
 except in cases where the accused is apprehended during the
 commission of a crime. It also provides for the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of detention and
 requires that the detaining authority in an arrest explain and
 justify to the judiciary the legal grounds for the detention.
 A prisoner has the right to counsel and the right to give a
 statement and appear before a judge within 24 hours of
 detention. The judge must begin the judicial process within
 48 hours of arrest. Failure to comply with this 48-hour rule
 has led to the release of detainees. Bond is allowed in those
 criminal trials which could lead to a penitentiary sentence.
 Military justice is applicable to civilians only during a
 state of war or insurrection. These constitutional provisions
 are generally respected in practice.
 The victim mentioned in Section l.c. had been detained during
 a "razzia," a random police sweep of bars and nightclubs in
 which young adults are arbitrarily detained and held for short
 periods without charge. Following the conviction of the
 deputy police chief for deprivation of liberty in this case,
 the police have ended their practice of "razzias." Young
 adults involved in the "razzias" are the only persons known to
 have been subjected to arbitrary detention. Since the end of
 the military dictatorship, no Uruguayans have been forced into
 exile for any reason.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary regained its autonomy in 1985, and military
 officers appointed by the military regime to the Supreme Court
 or the Higher Appeals Court retired from those positions at
 that time. The law provides for two military justices on the
 Supreme Court, who participate only in cases involving the
 military. The Constitution requires that all trials must open
 with a public statement of the charge by the prosecutor or the
 complainant. However, Uruguayan court procedures require the
 lawyers' arguments to be submitted to the judges in writing,
 and these written statements are normally not made public.
 There is a parallel military court system under the Military
 Justice Code. Uruguay has no political prisoners.
 Uruguay has a judicial system based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Under the provisions of the Uruguayan Penal Code, an arrested
 person may be held incommunicado by the police for a period of
 
 
 754
 URUGUAY
 24 hours. After 24 hours, the prisoner must be presented to a
 judge who, in turn, has an additional 24 hours to release the
 prisoner or issue a processing order which is based on
 evidence that the accused person could be responsible for a
 crime. When a processing order is issued, the prisoner then
 is given access to legal counsel, and if he cannot afford a
 lawyer, a public defender is appointed. If the crime carries
 a penalty of at least 2 years in prison, the prisoner is
 confined during the judge's investigation until the
 authorities agree to release him on bail, or until the case is
 closed. Trial proceedings are based on written arguments, and
 the defense attorney has access to all documents which form
 part of the written record. Under Uruguayan law, there is no
 provision against self-incrimination, and the defendant may be
 compelled to answer any questions to the judge.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The home,
 absolutely inviolable at night, can be entered and searched
 only with a legal warrant during the day. Protection for
 private papers and correspondence is equally strong, and a
 warrant is required for confiscation. These rights and
 protections are well respected. Investigations of wiretapping
 during the military regime continue, but there has been no
 evidence of any such activity after March1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 All elements of the political spectrum express their
 viewpoints in both the print and broadcast media. Formerly
 proscribed organizations such as the Tupamaro Movement, which
 conducted terrorist campaigns in the late 1960's and early
 1970's, and the Communist Party freely publish newspapers and
 operate radio stations. There are three nonaffiliated
 independent television stations and one public service
 government station. Montevideo has eight daily newspapers,
 and there are approximately 65 to 70 newspapers in the
 interior of the country (primarily weeklies). Uruguay has 23
 FM and 87 A4 radio stations, and 20 television stations. The
 only government-owned media outlets are one television station
 and one AM radio station.
 In 1988 a conservative journalist was convicted for a second
 time under the 1984 criminal libel law. He remained free
 during 1989 pending appeal of the 6-month jail sentence which
 he received. Each of this journalist's convictions resulted
 from complaints brought by private citizens.
 The National University is autonomous, and academic freedom is
 respected. University elections have been held three times
 since 1985, and student groups have resumed campus political
 activities. Most professors dismissed for political or
 ideological reasons by the military regime have returned to
 their positions, although a few cases continue under study.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association are protected by law.
 Formerly banned groups, such as the Tupamaros, are free to
 
 
 755
 URUGUAY
 organize and express their opinions. Public marches and
 demonstrations are allowed with permits from the Ministry of
 the Interior and occur without official harassment or
 intimidation. Persons denied citizenship rights by the
 military regime because of political affiliation or activity
 have had their rights fully restored.
 There were numerous attacks, generally late-night vandalism
 but some cases of arson, against the offices of political and
 labor groups, primarily but not exclusively leftist. These
 incidents resulted in little damage and few injuries. No
 arrests were made beyond that of one ex-policeman, dismissed
 in 1983, who was identified by a witness to one of the attacks.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion, provided for by the Constitution, is
 respected in practice. Most Uruguayans who practice a
 religion are Roman Catholic. Members of other religions
 exercise their faiths unhindered, and missionaries are free to
 proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are unrestricted.
 An estimated 300,000 Uruguayans left the country during  he
 military regime, some for political and many for economic
 reasons. Programs exist for their repatriation, and
 Uruguayans who wish to return are encouraged to do so. All of
 the prominent political figures exiled by the military regime
 have returned.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Uruguay have the right and ability peacefully
 to change the government. Uruguay is a multiparty democracy,
 with mandatory universal suffrage for those 18 ydars of age or
 older. Voting is not restricted by race, sex, religion, or
 economic status. The Colorado Party, the National (or Blanco)
 Party, a coalition named the Broad Front, and a coalition
 named the New Space are the four major political entities.
 Each allows ideological divisions within the party, and each
 such division may field its own slate of candidates for
 general elections. The Uruguayan electoral system combines a
 primary and general election in a double simultaneous vote.
 Each party fields different lists of candidates; in essence,
 voters express a preference for a list rather than an
 individual candidate, as well as vote for a party. The
 winning list of the party which gets the most votes wins the
 Presidency and a percentage of seats in the Senate and Chamber
 of Deputies corresponding to the percentage of votes that the
 party as a whole received. A party therefore may run multiple
 presidential candidates, each with his or her own slate of
 legislative candidates. National and provincial elections are
 held simultaneously every 5 years.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The human rights performance of the Government.since its
 return to democratic rule in 1985 has not been the subject of
 attention by international and local human rights
 organizations, with the major exception of their serious
 concern about, and opposition to, the Law of Expiration. The
 Government is open to inquiries from such organizations and
 does not restrict the activities of human rights
 investigators.
 Local human rights groups, some ot which could not operate
 openly under military rule, now function freely and without
 restriction. A prominent local human rights group, Peace and
 Justice Service (SERPAJ), was legalized in early 1985 after
 operating underground for 2 years during the military regime.
 SERPAJ investigates human rights issues, such as prison
 conditions and cases involving killing, torture, and
 disappearances which occurred during the military regime. An
 effort by SERPAJ to have the Senate deny promotions to. 11
 military officers it claimed took part in past human rights
 violations failed, and all 11 were promoted.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Uruguay has long been one of the most egalitarian countries in
 Latin America. There are few racial ox linguistic minorities
 in the country. Nonwhites are disproportionately represented
 at the lower end of the economic scale, but this is not the
 result of legislation or official policy.
 Uruguayan women enjoy equality under the law, but they face a
 number of forms of discrimination owing to traditional
 attitudes and practices. Pay is not always equal for men and
 women, especially in less skilled jobs.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, exists, but
 until recently this problem received little publicity. It is
 believed, however, that wife beating is common and widespread.
 According to women's rights activists, abuse against women,
 especially domestic violence, has apparently always been
 common in Uruguay. Since the return to democracy in 1985,
 this problem has been receiving increased public and
 governmental attention. A government body called the
 Commission of Women receives complaints of abused women, and
 the penal code mandates a sentence of 3 months in jail to 3
 years in prison for the crime of "private violence." However,
 in practice the legal system is not effective in dealing with
 what is essentially a cultural and educational problem. The
 main legal recourse for abused women lies in making a legal
 complaint against a spouse or boyfriend. However, many women
 find it very difficult to make and sustain such a complaint,
 especially those who continue to reside with their partners.
 Several women's rights groups provide assistance to abused
 women and also have programs to publicize the problem and
 educate the population. One of these groups led a
 demonstration in front of the Women's Commission offices on
 November 14, 1989, to protest the Commission's failure to
 assist a woman who was murdered by her husband on November 12,
 1989, after 17 years of abuse.
 
 
 757
 URUGUAY
 The President signed into law an antidiscrimination bill which
 calls for prison sentences, ranging from 3 months to 2 years,
 for defamation as well as incitement to, or perpetration of,
 acts of violence motivated by racial, religious, or ethnic
 reasons. The law, Equality of Opportunities and Treatment For
 Both Sexes in the Labor Field, was approved by Parliament on
 May 17, 1989.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of workers to organize
 freely, and the formation of unions is encouraged. Civil
 servants may join unions, as may employees of state-run
 enterprises. There are no legal restrictions on union
 membership for workers in special economic zones.
 All labor unions are independent of government or governing
 party control. There are no restrictions on union political
 activities. While some union members and leaders are
 politically active, unions themselves have traditionally
 refrained from participating in partisan politics. Workers
 have the right to choose their own representatives, publicize
 their views, and determine their own programs and policies.
 Union officials have the right to represent the members'
 interests. The member unions of the central labor
 organization, the Interunion Workers Assembly-National Workers
 Association (PIT-CNT), have about 250,000 members representing
 over 80 percent of organized workers. The PIT-CNT is a
 voluntary confederation of independent unions, and there are a
 number of strong autonomous unions as well.
 Uruguayan workers, including some civil servants, have the
 right to strike, and many unions did so during 1989. Sympathy
 strikes are not prohibited. Most of the contracts for the
 industrial sectors negotiated in 1988 included "no strike"
 clauses which restrict the workers' right to strike over pay
 disputes during the term of the contract (18 to 24 months).
 Of the strikes which took place during 1989, most were
 resolved when the two parties involved reached a mutually
 acceptable settlement. In the case of a job action in August
 involving port workers, the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Security (MTSS) stepped in, with the permission of both sides,
 in a mediating capacity. There are no institutionalized
 mechanisms for arbitration or mediation; the MTSS performs the
 role of mediator on an ad hoc basis.
 Workers can be legally compelled to work during a strike if
 their work is considered to be an essential service, the
 definition of which is relatively limited although it may in
 some cases exceed International Labor Organization (ILO)
 definitions. In the 1-day general strike on June 27,
 municipal public transportation was declared essential and
 minimal levels of bus service were maintained. During the
 August strike by municipal workers, garbage pickup was
 declared an essential service by the municipal government.
 Workers were ordered to return to their jobs; few responded,
 but there were no cases of workers being penalized for their
 refusal.
 There are no restrictions on unions' right to affiliate with
 international trade union bodies. By choice, the PIT-CNT is
 not officially affiliated with any 6f the three world
 
 
 758
 federations. Many individual unions are affiliated with
 international trade ;ecretariates.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Discrimination by employers, including arbitrary dismissal,
 for union activity is prohibited. There is no
 institutionalized mechanism for resolving such complaints
 against employers, however, and no formal complaints are known
 to have been filed with the Government.
 Industrial contracts are generally negotiated on a
 sector-wide, rather than plant-by-plant, basis. These
 negotiations take place under the auspices of a tripartite
 (government, workers, management) organization known as a
 Salary Council. Each industrial sector has its own council.
 The role played by the government representative can vary from
 council to council. In some, the government representatives
 see themselves as primarily arbitrators or mediators and only
 participate in the negotiations when there is an impasse. In
 others, the government representative is an active, equal
 participant in all phases of the negotiations. Individual
 firms and unions are not prohibited from bargaining outside
 the council framework. The Government must approve contracts
 before they become legally binding on the parties involved;
 during the last round of wage negotiations (1988) the
 Government approved only those contracts negotiated under the
 council system. Mostemployers like the security gained from
 the council system; most unions like the equity of wages that
 results from the sector-wide negotiations.
 In November 1989, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) reached interim conclusions regarding a
 complaint presented by the PIT-CNT alleging, among other
 things, that the Government exercises a veto power over salary
 council collective bargaining agreements that exceed
 anti-inflationary wage guidelines imposed by the International
 Monetary Fund and in some cases has directly fixed wage
 guidelines without convening the salary councils. The CFA
 concluded that these allegations were largely unfounded,
 noting that there has been a positive evolution as regards
 collective bargaining in Uruguay to the extent that 83 percent
 of the wage earners in the private sector are now covered by
 agreements negotiated essentially bilaterally. The Committee,
 however, urged the Government to legalize the right of
 employees of autonomous and decentralized state enterprises to
 conclude collective agreements.
 Workers employed in the two special export zones are fully
 covered by all labor legislation.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there is
 no evidenqe that would indicate its existence in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are protected by a child labor code, violations of
 which are punishable by fines of up to $500. Children under
 the age of 15 generally are not employed, but children as
 young as 12 may be legally employed if they have a special
 government work permit. Children under the age of 18 may not
 perform dangerous, fatiguing, or night work, apart from
 domestic employment. Salaries and hours for children are
 
 
 759
 URUGUAY
 controlled more strictly than for adults. Children over the
 age of 16 may sue in court for payment of wages, and children
 have the legal right to dispose of their own income. Children
 working in the expanding informal sector, such as street
 vendors or others with no fixed place of work or in the
 agrarian sector, are generally less strictly regulated and
 receive lower pay.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legislated minimum wage is approximately $72.37 per month
 for industrial workers. The minimum wage appears to be
 effectively enforced and adhered to by the sectors to which it
 is applicable. The minimum wage is adjusted every 4 months;
 raises in the minimum wage are indexed to 90 percent of the
 rate of inflation for the previous 4-month period. The
 minimum wage was raised in November to approximately $79.59
 per month. A family dependent on one minimum-wage income
 would be living below the poverty line and would be in th4
 poorest 20 percent of the population. The median family
 income for Uruguayans during the April-June 1988 period,
 however, was close to double the minimum wage.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours in 6 days. Industrial
 workers receive overtime in compensation for work in excess of
 48 hours. Workers are entitled to 10 days' paid vacation
 after a year of employment; this vacation period increases
 with each year of employment. Workers are protected by
 legislation regulating the health and safety of working
 conditions, and these existing laws and regulations appear to
 be effectively enforced or adhered to in practice. However,
 concern has risen in the last year over inadequacies in the
 current legislation which governs health and safety in the
 workplace, and the Parliament was studying more stringent
 measures prior to year's end. Some labor regulations cover
 urban and industrial workers more thoroughly than rural and
 agricultural workers.
