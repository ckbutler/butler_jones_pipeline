 CHINA
 The People's Republic of China (PRC) is a one-party state
 adhering to Marxist-Leninist principles, in which the Chinese
 Communist Party (CCP), backed by the military and security
 forces, monopolizes decisionmaking authority. A closed inner
 circle of a few senior leaders holds the right of ultimate
 power. Some of these party elders hold positions within the
 Politburo, the Central Military Commission, and other organs.
 Others hold no formal positions of authority but still wield
 decisive influence by virtue of their seniority in the
 Communist movement.
 The party maintains control through its widespread apparatus
 and traditional societal pressure as well as through a
 nationwide security network which includes the People's'
 Liberation Army; the Ministry of State Security; the Ministry
 of Public Security; the People's Armed Police; and the state
 judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems. The security
 forces have been responsible for human rights abuses including
 torture and arbitrary arrest and detention;.
 More than a decade of impressive economic growth and the spread
 of market forces have resulted in a reduction of the center's
 span of economic control. Although China's per capita
 income--estimated at roughly $300--is one of the world's
 lowest, wide disparities exist, with the living standards of
 some coastal residents approaching those found in more
 developed countries. China's leaders, with their overwhelming
 emphasis on stability, continued to be concerned about
 excessive growth rates and inflationary pressures but also
 continued to be willing to move toward greater reliance on
 markets to determine prices and allocation of resources.
 China's human rights practices remained repressive, falling far
 short of internationally accepted norms. After.some loosening
 of repression during the first half of 1991, heightened alarm
 following the failed Soviet coup attempt in August resulted in
 another effort by Beijing to strengthen central control,
 reinforce ideological propaganda, and repress dissent, coupled
 with efforts to bolster political stability by intensifying
 - economic reform. Serious human rights abuses persisted. The
 early 1991 trials of several dozen persons detained in the 1989
 crackdown were characterized by hasty verdicts, the defendants'
 inadequate access to legal counsel, and the Government's
 refusal to allow independent observers to attend the trials.
 Several were sentenced to lengthy terms merely for expressing
 views critical of the ruling regime. Despite statements that
 these proceedings were "basically completed," the Government
 acknowledged in mid-1991 that 21 democracy movement cases had
 still not been brought to trial. Some of these persons were
 being tried as the year ended, but.no verdicts had been
 announced.
 Other serious human rights abuses continued, including
 persistent abuses in Tibet, documented cases of torture and
 mistreatment of those accused of crimes, and the repression of
 Catholics and Protestants who refused to affiliate with
 officially sponsored religious organizations and were charged
 with conducting "illegal" religious services, proselytizing, or
 maintaining illegal liaison with foreign groups. Although
 Chinese media emphasized implementation of a new law allowing
 citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or
 malfeasance, enforcement remained problematic and there was
 little progress on political and legal reforms offering real
 protection for individual rights. Severe restrictions on
 
 
 810
 CHINA
 freedom of assembly, expression; and the press were
 maintained. Independent reports generated international
 concern about Chinese prison labor practices.
 On the more positive side, the Government released some
 detainees and in late 1990 began a limited dialog on human
 rights with its foreign critics which led to a number of
 serious exchanges with government and parliamentary
 delegations. The Chinese were exposed to a greater range of
 views on human rights practices, and modest progress was made
 in resolving a small number of human rights cases. Beijing -
 issued a comprehensive white paper in November which laid out
 in considerable detail its self-congratulatory views on Chinese
 human rights. Beijing nevertheless continued to reject the
 applicability under "special Chinese conditions" of many widely
 -accepted international human, rights concepts,-arguing that
 economic development should be the main measure of China's
 human rights progress.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no documented instances of extrajudicial killings in
 the PRC in 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance in 1991. There
 has not yet been an 'overall public accounting by the Government
 of the fate of those detained during and after the suppression
 of the 1989 demonstrations (See Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite legal safeguards, the use of-torture and degrading
 treatmentof persons detained and imprisoned has persisted.
 There-were credible reports in 1991 of police having illegally
 detained and tortured suspects, particularly those held outside
 formal detention centers in "shelter and investigation
 centers."' The Government has not yet made public its 1991
 statistics regarding investigation of such abuses, but in April
 the Chief Procurator indicated that in 1990, 472 cases of
 confession by torture were filed for investigation and
 prosecution. These figures cannot be confirmed. Punishment of
 abusers has rarely been reported, although severe punishments
 have been imposed in at least a few cases.
 The'August hunger strikes of Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming
 focussed international attention on the poor prison conditions
 afid medical care endured by many prisoners. After the
 international community expressed strong concern about these
 .cases, government officials confirmed that Wang and Chen had
 been'held in solitary confinement in cells originally designed
 to punish prisoners-who had violated prison regulations, and
 admitted that both prisoners had health problems. Wang was
 eventually hospitalized and Chen removed from solitary
 confinement, but the Government refused to allow impartial
 observers to visit the prisoners. Released prisoners and
 detainees, however, have reported abuses. Democracy activist
 brothers Li Lin'and Li Zhi (see Section 2.d.) told of having
 
 
 811
 CHINA
 been tortured during their imprisonment in Hunan province.
 Other former prisoners and detainees have indicated that
 ordinary workers and unemployed youths suffer even worse
 treatment than well-known prisoners like Wang, Chen, and the Li
 brothers, with more frequent instances of torture and degrading
 treatment. Workers are also more likely to be sentenced to
 prison, reeducation through labor, or execution than are
 students and intellectuals. According to one credible report,
 six political prisoners in Liaoning Province, including student
 leaders Liu Gang and Zhang Ming, attempted to launch hunger
 strikes during Secretary Baker's November visit to China to
 protest the harsh prison conditions they faced. According to
 the report, Liu's arm was broken by prison officials trying to
 force-feed him. This report could not be independently
 confirmed.
 Conditions in all types of Chinese penal institutions are harsh
 and frequently degrading. The emphasis on obtaining
 confessions leads to widespread abuses, particularly ii
 detention centers. Former detainees have reported the use of
 cattle prods, electrodes, prolonged periods of solitary
 confinement and incommunicado detention, beatings, shackles,
 and other forms of abuse against detained women and men. Both
 before and after trial, prisoners are subject to severe
 pressure to confess their "errors." Despite official'media and
 other reports that indicate that coerced confessions have led
 to erroneous convictions, the fact that a confession was
 coerced does not in itself prevent or invalidate a conviction.
 According to judicial officials, however, confessions without
 corroborating evidence are an insufficient basis for'conviction.
 There have been frequent credible reports frQm Tibetan refugees'
 of torture and mistreatment in penal institutions in Tibet. In
 February officials confirmed that Lhakpa Tsering, a young
 Tibetan who had been imprisoned in Lhasa (Drapchi) prison, had
 died on December 15, 1990. The Government denied reports that
 his death resulted from torture, asserting that he died from a
 ruptured appendix. Chinese officials have not, however,
 responded to outside requests that they release autopsy
 findings. Tibetan authorities have reportedly returned Sonam
 Wangdu to Drapchi prison in spite of his continued, serious
 health problems. His family has been denied permission to
 visit and assist him. Sonam is serving a life sentence for his
 involvement in a 1988 riot which led to the death of a
 policeman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 China's Criminal Procedure Law proscribes arbitrary arrest or
 detention and limits the amount of time a person can be held in
 custody without being charged. According to the law,
 interrogation should take place within 24 hours of detention,
 and the detainee's family and work unit should be informed of
 the circumstances of the detention within 48 hours. Articles
 43 and 50 of the Criminal Procedure Law, however, permit the
 police to delay notifying the family and work unit "in
 circumstances where notification would hinder the
 investigation."
 A formal arrest under the Criminal Procedure Law of a suspect
 detained by the Public Security Bureau should be approved by
 the procuratorate within 10 days of the original detention.
 Public security authorities, however, often detain people for
 long periods of time under various-informal mechanisms not
 coyered by the criminal procedure law. These include
 
 
 812
 CHINA
 regulations, some unpublished, on 'taking in for shelter and
 investigation" and "supervised residence" as well as other
 methods not requiring procuratorial approval. These
 administrative forms of detention were purportedly abolished by
 a 1980 State Council document, but are still used. In April
 the Government indicated that 3,509 cases of unlawful detention
 were filed for investigation and prosecution in 1990. These
 figures cannot be confirmed. The Government has not indicated
 if or how those responsible for such cases have been punished.
 A well-documented estimate of the total number of arbitrary
 arrests and detentions in 1991 is not possible. There are
 credible estimates, however, that hundreds of thousands of
 people, such as vagrants, the unemployed, and migrants, have
 been arbitrarily detained. In addition, dozens of persons
 involved in small demonstrations throughout the year have been
 detained. For example, according to credible reports,
 authorities in Beijing in late December detained several
 persons overnight after they tried to organize a peaceful
 memorial ceremony commemorating the death of 1989 democracy
 activist Wen Jie. In March the Government provided new
 information on detentions in Tibet in 1989, confirming that 400
 people were detained by Tibetan public security and judicial
 organs between March and November of that year. More than 300
 were later released and about 60 were brought to trial,
 according to these figures, which cannot be independently
 confirmed.
 Several hundred persons detained for activities related to the
 1989 demonstrations were held in "detention during
 investigation" or "administrative detention" status. These
 persons were not formally arrested or charged with any crime,
 although authorities began in late 1990 and 1991 to press
 charges against at least some of these detainees. Chinese
 authorities have begun to respond to international inquiries
 about those detained since June 1989, although the responses
 have not yet provided complete information. During the
 November visit of U.S. Secretary of State Baker, the Chinese
 provided a response by individual name to a list of political
 prisoners that the United States had-earlier given them and
 agreed to continue a dialog on human rights with the United
 States.
 Repeated requests for information on Zhu Mei (or Sha Zhumei),
 reported to have been arrested in 1987 and sentenced to 5
 years' imprisonment on "counterrevolutionary" charges for
 religious activities, have been met by denials from Shanghai
 municipal authorities that such a person is imprisoned in that
 city. Officials have also declined to provide information on
 many Tibetans detained since 1989 or on many members of
 unofficial Catholic and Protestant churches who have been
 detained for months before being charged or released, according
 to credible reports.
 "Crimes of counterrevolution" are dealt with under articles
 90-104 of the Criminal Law. Counterrevolutionary offenses,
 which range from treason and espionage to spreading
 counterrevolutionary propaganda, are defined by the Government
 in light of its four basic principles: upholding
 Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong thought, the people's democratic
 dictatorship, the Socialist system, and the leadership of the
 Chinese Communist Party.
 These principles are interpreted by the Government as
 circumscribing the various rights provided for in the
 
 
 813
 CHINA
 Constitution. As a result, despite constitutional guarantees
 of free expression, people who have tried to exercise this
 right have in some cases been charged with counterrevolution
 under Articles 90-104 of the Criminal Law. These articles have
 also been used to punish persons who organized demonstrations,
 disrupted traffic, disclosed official information to
 foreigners, or formed associations outside state control.
 Those detained for committing "crimes of counterrevolution" are
 in theory treated the same as those detained for other crimes,
 and their cases are supposed to be handled in accordance with
 the criminal procedure law. In practice, the law's provisions
 limiting length of detention and requiring family notification
 are often ignored in "counterrevolutionary" cases.
 Sentences imposed by criminal courts may be served in prisons
 or in reform through labor camps. Many labor reform camps are
 in remote areas such as Xinjiang or Qinghai. Some former
 inmates have been denied permission to return'to their homes.
 (See Section 6.c.)
 The Government provided in 1991 a more complete accounting of
 the number of persons detained in Beijing in connection with
 the 1989 democracy movement. According to these figures, 1,804
 were originally detained, of whom 970 have been released, 715
 convicted on nonpolitical charges, and 72 convicted on
 political charges through the end of 1990. At year's end some
 21 cases remained in pretrial detention. These figures seem
 generally credible but cannot be independently verified. They
 apparently exclude those detained in other parts of China,
 those held only briefly for questioning in 1989, and at least
 1,000 participants in the 1989 demonstrations Assigned without
 trial to reeducation through labor camps. Additional
 statistics released by the Justice Ministry in July indicated .
 that at least 37 people detained for taking part in the 1989
 democracy movement had been tried, served their sentences, and
 released. This figure cannot be confirmed.
 The 1990 report mentioned Bao Tong, Gao Shan, Li Minqi, Liu
 Gang, Peng Rong, Wang Zhixin, Xiong Yan, Yang Wei, Zhai Weimin,
 and Zhang Weiguo as among the prominent political detainees not
 formally arrested or charged by the end of 1990. In 1991 Xiong
 Yan, Yang Wei, Wang Zhixin, and Zhang Weiguo were released.
 (Section 2.a. discusses Zhang's subsequent detention.) Liu
 Gang was sentenced to 6 years in prison. Li Minqi, as well as
 journalist Wu Xuecan, was brought to trial in December, but at
 year's end the outcome of these trials was not known. The
 cases of Peng Rong and Zhai Weimin were described by the
 Government in November as "under investigation." The status of
 Bao Tong and Gao Shan remained unclear. Labor activist Han
 Dongfang was given medical parole from prison. Following
 Secretaty Baker's visit in November, charges against him were
 dropped. Hong Kong resident Luo Haixing, imprisoned in March
 for attempting to aid fleeing democracy movement activists, was
 given medical parole and allowed to return to Hong Kong.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Officials insist that China's judiciary is independent but
 acknowledge that it is subject to the policy guidance of the
 CCP. In addition, there are credible reports that party and
 government leaders predetermine verdicts and sentences in some
 sensitive cases.
 According to the Constitution, the court system is equal in
 authority to the State Council and the Central Military
 
 
 814
 CHINA
 Commission, the two most important government institutions.
 All three organs are nominally under the supervision of the
 National People's Congress. The Supreme People's Court stands
 at the apex of the court system, followed in descending order
 by the Higher People's Court (province), the Intermediate
 People's Court (prefecture), and the Basic People's Court
 (county). Separate and special military, maritime, and railway
 courts function directly under the Supreme People's Court. The
 judiciary, however, falls under the policy control of the
 party's Political and Legal Commission, headed by Politburo
 Standing Committee member Qiao Shi.
 During the 1980's the Government moved haltingly toward the
 establishment of a more autonomous and less arbitrary legal
 systei. There were efforts to clarify which offenses are
 criminally indictable by defining more precisely or even
 eliminating broad, general laws, including the legal provisions
 for "crimes of counterrevolution." Programs were set up to
 provide professional training for judges through overseas
 training courses to acquaint them with foreign legal
 procedures. As a result of the 1989 crackdown, however, the
 tightening of political and ideological controls seriously
 undermined these reforms, closed off debate on the relative
 merits of "rule by man" and "rule by law," and set back China's
 modest efforts to build a modern and more autonomous judicial
 system. Official directives to the courts to produce quick
 judgments during the anticrime campaign begun in 1990 further
 undermined the integrity of the court system. A Justice
 Ministry official acknowledged in September to a European
 Patliament delegation that trials in China were conducted too
 rapidly. He blamed a shortage of lawyers, of which there are
 an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 in China. An Australian human
 rights delegation that visited Shanghai in July found that of
 the 16,000 criminal cases filed in that city in 1990 fewer than
 half of the accused had a defense lawyer and only 30 were
 acquitted. Defense lawyers, like other Chinese, generally
 depend on their work units for employment, housing, and many
 other aspects of their lives. As a result, they are often
 reluctant to be seen as overzealous in defending individuals
 accused of political offenses.
 Due process rights are stipulated under the Constitution but
 often ignored in practice. The Criminal Procedure Law requires
 that all trials be held "in public," except those involving
 state secrets, juveniles, and "personal secrets," but details
 of cases involving "counterrevolutionary" charges have
 frequently been kept secret, even from relatives of the
 defendants, under this provision. Even when trials are
 nominally open, in many cases the only "public" allowed to
 attend are officially selected "representatives of the people"
 and immediate relatives of the accused. Numerous requests by
 independent foreign observers to attend 1991 trials of
 democracy activists were all turned aside. The Government
 asserted that foreign observers were not permitted to attend
 trials unless the alleged crime directly involved a foreigner
 or a Chinese related to a foreigner.
 The law states that a defendant may be held in custody for a
 maximum of 2 months during investigation, although a 1-month
 extension may be requested from the next higher procuratorate.
 The procuratorate then has up to 1-1/2 months to decide whether
 or not to prosecute the case. An additional month is permitted
 if "supplementary investigation" is needed. Any delay beyond
 5-1/2 months theoretically requires approval of the Standing
 Committee of the National People's Congress, but amendments to
 
 
 815
 CHINA
 the Criminal Procedure Law in 1984 allowed for further
 extensions of these periods without higher level approval,
 including pessible indefinite extensions while a suspect is
 under "mental" examination. In politically sensitive cases,
 the period of pretrial detention has often been much longer
 than 5-1/2 months; many of the democracy activists tried in
 early 1991 had been detained over 18 months, and some, who
 still await trial, have been detained for 30 months. The
 procuratorate sends to trial those persons it determines are
 guilty on the basis of the police investigations, supplemented
 if necessary by its own inquiries. The pretrial process,
 during which the question of guilt or innocence is essentially
 decided, does not give the defense adequate time and
 opportunity to prepare its case. Defense lawyers may be
 retained only 7 days before the trial. In some cases even this
 period has been shortened under regulations issued in 1983 to
 accelerate the adjudication of certain serious criminal cases.
 Persons appearing before the court are not presumed innocent;
 trials are generally, in effect, sentencing hearings.
 Conviction rates average over 99 percent. Defense lawyers may
 be retained privately, but most are appointed by the court.
 They virtually never contest their clients' guilt; rather,
 their function is generally confined to requesting clemency.
 There is an appeal process, but initial decisions are rarely
 overturned. Defendants are expected to "show the right
 attitude" by confessing their crimes, and those who fail to
 confess are typically sentenced more harshly.
 Three sets of trials involving the 1989 democracy movement took
 place in early 1991. The first set of trials, which began on
 January 5, resulted in the sentencing of seven dissidents from
 2 to 4 years' imprisonment and the release of two dissidents.
 The second set of trials, which began on January 26, decided 71
 cases. Among those sentenced to prison were student leaders
 Wang Youcai (sentenced to 4 years but since released), Wang Dan
 (4 years), and Guo Haifeng (4 years), activist Ren Wanding (7
 years), and intellectual Bao Zunxin (5 years). Intellectual
 Liu Xiaobo and 65 others were released. The third set of
 trials began on February 12 and involved four cases. Law
 professor Chen Xiaoping was released. Student leader Liu Gang
 was sentenced to 6 years. Intellectuals Chen Ziming and Wang
 Juntao were given 13 years each for allegedly masterminding the
 demonstrations. In April the President of the Supreme People's
 Court announced that the trials of cases related to the June
 1989 demonstrations had been "basically completed." In
 November, however, the Government released the names of 21
 persons involved in the 1989 demonstrations who remained in
 pretrial detention. At year's end, another series of trials
 began, though no verdicts have been announced.
 The Government characterized the trials as public and fair,
 resulting in lenient sentences. It has steadfastly defended
 its right to try and sentence any who transgress Chinese law,
 rejecting the contention that "counterrevolutionary crime" is
 an inappropriate, vaguely defined article which allows
 punishment for peaceful dissent. Moreover, the speed of the
 verdicts, the limited opportunity afforded defendants to
 prepare a defense, and the inability of independent observers
 to attend the trials raise serious concerns as to justice,
 fairness, and due process.
 In addition, a number of political prisoners jailed in previous
 cycles of repression, notably 197% Democracy Wall activist Wei
 Jingsheng, remain in prison. Press reports claimed that Wei's
 
 
 816
 CHINA
 health had deteriorated during prolonged solitary confinement,
 but authorities asserted Wei was in good health and received
 family visits. A July press report quoted Vice Minister of
 Justice Jin Jian as having said that Wei remained in solitary
 confinement but had been transferred from Qinghai province to
 Hebei province. These reports on Wei's status cannot be
 independently confirmed.
 In the northeast, five workers from Changchun (Jilin) received
 sentences ranging from 2 to 20 years in prison for their
 participation in June 1989 demonstrations. All were convicted
 under Articles 98 and/or 102 of the Chinese Criminal Code. The
 verdict was reached in a lower court in November 1990, but the
 result of a superior court review was not released until April
 1991.' In Tibet authorities continued to impose harsh sentences
 for political activities. Hotel bookkeeper Tseten Norgye was
 sentenced in February to about 4 years (exact sentence unknown)
 in prison for counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement
 and distributing leaflets on Tibetan independence, according to
 credible reports. Officials in Tibet said in July that since
 1987 there had been 50 convictions for counterrevolutionary
 activity An Tibet and that all of those convicted were still in
 prison.
 In 1990 China, citing a sharp increase in the crime rate
 (though one still low by Western standards), launched an
 anticrime campaign that continued into 1991. The CCP
 leadership ordered public security, procuratorate, and court
 officials to speed the process of investigation, trial, and
 sentencing, raising serious due process concerns. Chinese
 officials refuse to provide comprehensive statistics on death
 sentences or executions, but according to figures compiled from
 press reports, from January to July 1991 at least-449 people
 were executed, with an additional 176 sentenced to death. The
 actual numbers may be much higher. One Western source with
 access to Chinese criminologists estimated the total number of
 executions in China in 1991 might have been as high as 5,000 or
 6,000. This report could not be independently confirmed. All
 death sentences are reviewed by a higher court, but such
 reviews are often very rapid, with some completed within a few
 days after initial sentencing.
 Under a set of regulations governing reeducation through labor
 originally issued in 1957 and revised in 1979, government
 authorities can assign persons accused of minor public order
 offenses (e.g., disturbing the peace, fabricating rumors,
 hindering government officials from performing their official
 duties) to reeducation through labor camps without judicial
 review. This allows security authorities to deal with
 political and other offenders without need for recourse to even
 the nominal procedures and protections offered by the formal
 criminal process. Reeducation through labor sanctions were
 used to circumvent the formal criminal process in the cases of
 some 1979 Democracy Wall activists and appear to have been used
 in the same way to deal with some persons involved in the
 spring 1989 demonstrations.
 In 1990 Chinese officials stated that 869,934 Chinese citizens
 had been assigned to these camps since 1980, with about 80,000
 assigned each year and 160,000 undergoing reeducation through
 labor at that time. Justice Ministry officials reiterated the
 160,000 figure in July 1991. It is not possible to verify
 these official statistics; other estimates of the number of
 inmates are considerably higher. Terms of assignment run from
 a normal minimum of 1 year to a maxigum of 3, although the
 
 
 817
 CHINA
 labor reeducation committee may subsequently extend an inmate's
 sentence for a maximum of I year if his "reform attitude" is
 not good.
 The number of persons in Chinese penal institutions who would
 be considered political prisoners by international standards is
 impossible to estimate accurately. While Government officials
 deny that the PRC has any "political" prisoners, they have
 stated that there are just over 1.1 million inmates in Chinese
 prisons and reform camps, and that 0.5 percent of these were
 convicted of "counterrevolutionary crimes," for a total of
 roughly 5,500 "counterrevolutionary" convicts. This figure
 includes a substantial number convicted of crimes such as
 "espionage" that are internationally recognized criminal
 offenses; the secrecy surrounding espionage cases prevents
 foreign observersfrom determining the validity of such
 charges. On the other hand, the figure excludes the remaining
 1989 detainees, at least 1,000 in labor reeducation camps, and
 an undetermined number sentenced nominally for various criminal
 offenses including religious activities (such as receiving
 funds from abroad without authorization or changing such funds
 on the black market). Estimates by some foreign researchers of
 the number of political prisoners are much higher but cannot be
 confirmed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Personal and family life in China is extensively monitored and
 regulated by the authorities. Most persons depend on their
 work unit for employment, housing, ration coupons, permission
 to marry or have a child, and other aspects of ordinary life.
 The work unit, along with the neighborhood watch committee,
 monitors activities and attitudes. Since the 1989
 demonstrations, Chinese authorities have strengthened the
 surveillance functions of neighborhood watch committees,
 requiring them to work more closely with the police. Search
 warrants are required by law before security forces may search
 premises, but this provision is often ignored. Daily life is
 monitored in a variety of ways. Some telephone conversations
 are recorded, and mail is frequently opened and censored, in
 spite of the provision in the 1982 Constitution that "freedom
 and privacy of correspondence of citizens.. .are protected by
 law." One purpose of this Government surveillance is to
 regulate and limit contact between PRC citizens and foreigners,
 who are generally required to live in segregated and monitored
 compounds or dormitories.
 The compounds in which foreign diplomats, journalists, and
 business people live are under close physical surveillance,
 have conspicuously placed television cameras in elevators, and
 are presumed to be universally electronically monitored.
 Chinese wishing to visit foreigners are deterred by this
 pervasive system of monitoring. Since the 1989 crackdown, the
 Government has intensified its efforts to restrict contact
 between Chinese citizens and foreigners.
 China's population has roughly doubled in the past 40 years,
 seriously complicating the country's economic development. In
 the early 1980's the Government set a goal of limiting the
 population to 1.2 billion by the year 2000. To meet this
 target, it adopted a comprehensive and highly intrusive family
 policy for Han Chinese in urban areas. Numerous exceptions are
 allowed for Han in rural areas. Ethnic minorities are either
 exempted or subject to less stringent population controls. In
 
 
 818
 CHINA
 September 1991, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said the
 population of China had reached 1.15 billion; the State Family
 Planning Commission indicated in October that China's revised
 target for the year 2000 is now'l.294 billion. Individual and
 family decisions about bearing children are regulated by the
 State, with economic rewards for those who cooperate with it,
 and sanctions against those who deviate from official
 guidelines. The Government sets an annual nationwide goal for
 the number of authorized births, apportioned down to the local
 level and, ultimately, to each work unit. Fujian province, for
 example, has implemented the national family planning policy
 through a system of contracts setting population growth targets
 which extend from the provincial Governor through provincial
 leadqrs and work units to individual workers. Work units
 exercise pressure to control births, and fines may be imposed
 to penalize those who violate the terms of the contract. Birth
 statistics reflected the widespread ineffectiveness of these
 measures in limiting couples to only one child. In 1990, 21
 percent of all births were at least a family's third child, 32
 percent were second children, and 47 percent of births in
 Fujian were first children. In urban areas, couples are
 encouraged to delay marriage until well after the legal minimum
 age of 22 for men and 20 for women, and to defer childbirth
 until at least their mid-20's. For most urban couples,
 obtaining permission to have a second child is very difficult,
 although the policy is sometimes evaded.
 China's population control policy relies on education,
 propaganda, and economic incentives, as well as more coercive
 measures including psychological pressure and severe economic
 penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy
 include monthly stipends and preferential medical, food, and
 educational benefits. Disciplinary measures against those who
 violate the policy include stiff fines, withholding of social
 services, demotion, and other administrative punishments.
 Local family planning officials are also subject to penalties
 for "excess births" in their units. In Shanghai, in addition
 to 145 publicized cases of couples being fined for having an
 unauthorized child, there were 3 publicized cases in 1991 in
 which the offenders (2 women and a couple) were not only fined
 but also fired from their jobs.
 Chinese family planning officials have become increasingly
 concerned about the ability of itinerant workers, whose numbers
 are estimated to range from 70-100 million persons, to
 circumvent family planning regulations. More than 50 percent
 of these persons are in their prime child-bearing years.
 Accordingly, in November the State Council passed new
 regulations aimed at bringing this population more directly
 into family planning programs.
 Although the Government officially opposes physical compulsion
 to submit to abortion or sterilization, the practice has
 continued to occur as officials strive to meet population
 targets.. Chinese officials acknowledge privately that there
 are still instances of forced abortions and sterilizations in
 remote, rural areas, although the number of such cases is well
 below levels of the early 1980's. While recognizing that
 abuses occur, officials maintain that China does not condone
 forced abortion or sterilization and that abuses by local
 officials are punished. They admit, however, that punishment
 is rare and have yet to provide documentation of any
 punishments. In part, they explain, there is a bureaucratic
 disinclination to punish those doing the difficult, socially
 
 
 819
 CHINA
 unpopular, but economically necessary task of enforcing
 national population policy.
 According to officials in East China, local family planning
 workers are penalized not only for "excess births," but also
 for "excess abortions." Family planning workers receive
 negative performance evaluations for "excessively high"
 abortion rates. Officials have not publicly defined the term
 "excessively high."
 Enforcement of the family planning policy is inconsistent,
 varying widely from place to place and year to year. The 1990
 census data indicate that the average number of children per
 family (2.3) and the populftion growth rate (1.5 percent)
 remain significantly higher than would be produced by
 omprehensive naticnal enforcement of official policy. In many
 areas, couples apparently are able to have several children
 without incurring any penalty, while in other areas enforcement
 has been more stringent. Local officials have great discretion
 in how, and how strictly, the policy is implemented. Because
 penalties for "excess births" can be levied against local
 officials and the mothers' work units, many people are
 personally affected, providing an additional potential source
 of pressure.
 Female infanticide has persisted in some impoverished rural
 areas. Insistence that local units meet population goals has
 contributed to the persistence of this traditional practice,
 generally by parents who hope to have more sons without
 incurring official punishment. The Government strongly opposes
 infanticide and has prosecuted offenders; it has been able to
 reduce but not eradicate the practice. In order to discourage
 the abortion of female fetuses, the Government has issued
 regulations prohibiting medical personnel from using ultrasound
 equipment to determine the sex of a fetus or from disclosing
 the sex of a fetus as determined by testing conducted for
 medical reasons, according to information Chinese officials
 provided in July to an Australian human rights delegation. In
 recent years, regulations with eugenics provisions have been
 implemented in at least five provinces, beginning with Gansu.
 These regulations seek to prevent people with severe mental
 handicaps from having children and include provisions for
 mandatory sterilization before permission to marry is granted
 and compulsory abortion in the event of pregnancy. National
 family planning officials reportedly have discouraged the
 enactment and enforcement of such eugenics laws, though the
 central Government has not overridden these provincial laws.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and self-expression are severely restricted.
 Limited tolerance of some criticism of government policies and
 officials had generally increased through the 1980's, but after
 June 1989 this trend was abruptly reversed. The party has
 reasserted complete control over the press; the media's role of
 transmitting the views of the people to the leadership has been
 limited and carefully regulated. Citizens are not permitted to
 criticize senior leaders or to express opinions contrary to the
 "four cardinal principles," which provide for a Socialist state
 under the Communist Party's exclusive control. Persons who
 violate these guidelines are-punished.
 
 
 820
 CHINA
 Television and radio broadcasting has remained under strict
 party and government control and been used to propagate an
 orthodox ideological line. Programming has been heavily laced
 with party propaganda. AS part-of its control of citizens'
 access to information, the Government has continued to jam many
 Chinese language broadcasts of the Voice of America (VOA) and
 British Broadcasting Corporation. The leadership has attacked
 VOA, claiming it is part of a Western conspiracy to subvert
 China. Despite the effort to jam VOA, the effectiveness of the
 jamming varies considerably by region, with audible signals
 reaching most parts of China. Cable News Network satellite
 transmissions to international hotels were banned in Beijing
 during the 1991 anniversary of the Tiananmen repression. Many.
 foreign journalists have reported episodes of surveillance and
 harassment.
 The party has ordered the domestic press to support the party
 line and not question the "four cardinal principles." A
 Communist Party Central Committee document called for renewed
 prepublication censorship of all major state-run media,
 according to credible reports. A number of Chinese journalists
 have been detained and the ranks and leadership of many
 newspapers and journals purged. Tightened distribution has
 enabled authorities to control foreign language material more
 effectively. The September 23 issue of Newsweek, which
 contained investigative reports on prison labor, was not
 distributed to the few newsstands (mostly located in
 international:hotels) that sell foreign magazines and
 newspapers.
 The Government has attempted to curb publications advocating
 "bourgeois liberalization" (Western social, political, and
 cultural ideas). Numerous publications have been closed,
 heavy-handed ideological controls reimposed, and ideologically
 suspect journalists replaced. The Government has banned
 publications by authors considered politically unacceptable
 such as Liu Binyan, Su Xiaokang, Su Shaozhi, Bao Tong, Liu
 Xiaobo, Yan Jiaqi, and Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.
 The party has continued to impose tight controls on colleges,
 universities, and research institutes. The entering freshmen
 classes at Beijing University and Shanghai's Fudan University
 were again sent to military camps for a year of training and
 ideological indoctrination. Numerous textbooks and scholarly
 works have been either censored or prohibited by the State
 Education Commission. At all levels, the quantity of political
 study has increased.
 The heavy ideological control of academic institutions and the
 censorship of the media have forced many Chinese journalists
 and scholars to exercise great caution. Some researchers
 engaged in work regarded as sensitive were prohibited from
 accepting graduate students. Many scholars, including some of
 China's most prominent, have declined opportunities to publish
 or present papers on subjects that couldbe construed as
 sensitive. More vigorous public debate on some subjects, such
 as economic policy, has been tolerated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly'and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is severely
 restricted in practice. The Constitution has provisions for
 the right "of assembly, of association, of procession, and of
 demonstration," but such activities may not infringe "upon the
 interests of the state." A "law governing assemblies, parades,
 
 
 821
 CHINA
 and demonstrations" was implemented in 1990. Like the
 Constitution, it provides for the right to assemble and
 demonstrate but stipulates that parades and demonstrations may
 not "infringe on the interests of the state, society, and
 collectives or the legitimate freedoms and rights of other
 citizens." This provision would proscribe any protests against
 Communist Party rule, socialism, or the leadership and can be
 used to ban protests that disrupt traffic, interfere with
 business, occupy public places, or that could be interpreted as
 "infringing" on the freedoms of other citizens.
 Procedures for obtaining a parade permit discourage and
 effectively prevent the exercise of the right of assembly
 insofar as that right might challenge the perceived interests
 of the State. The Government said that some demonstrations had
 been authorized, claiming that 13 applications for
 demonstrations in 1990 were approved in Sichuan Province
 alone. Officials provided no additional details on these
 demonstrations, which attracted minimal press attention., At
 any rate, such demonstrations must by law have been perceived
 by the State as consistent with its interests. The law does
 not apply to "traditional cultural, recreational, or sports
 activities" and "normal religious activities," but local
 authorities retain the power to determine what are legitimate
 "traditional" or "normal" religious activities.
 Professional and other mass associations are for the most part
 organized and controlled by the Communist Party. Regulations
 issued in 1990 require all organizations to be officially
 registered and approved. Ostensibly aimed at secret societies
 and criminal gangs, the regulations also prevent the formation
 of unauthorized political, religious, or labor organizations,
 such as the student and worker groups that emerged briefly
 before and during the 1989 democracy movement. They have also
 been used to disband groups, such as unregistered "house
 churches" (religious congregations which gather in private
 residences), deemed potentially subversive. Security forces
 maintain a close watch on groups formed outside the party
 establishment, particularly unauthorized religious groups.
 Associations recognized by the State are permitted to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies, but these
 contacts are carefully monitored and limited.
 The Government monitors and discourages contacts between
 dissidents and foreigners. In Shanghai, after dissidents Wang
 Ruowang and Zhang Weiguo were released from detention, they
 were subsequently accused of unauthorized contact with
 foreigners (particularly the foreign media), detained, and
 questioned several times for brief periods. During a visit in
 November by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, two prominent
 dissidents, Dai Qing and Hou Xiaotian, were detained to prevent
 any contact with the Secretary's party. Dai Qing was forcibly
 removed from a hotel, sent out of Beijing, and held until after
 the Secretary's visit was over. Hou Xiaotian was briefly
 detained near Beijing. No charges were filed against either
 Dai or Hou, and Chinese authorities denied that they had been
 arrested. Dai was later allowed to leave the country.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom in China is subject to restrictions of
 varying severity. While the Constitution affirms toleration of
 religious beliefs, the Government places restrictions on
 religious practice outside officially recognized and
 government-controlled religious organizations. Religious
 
 
 822
 CHINA
 proselytizing is restricted to officially registered and
 sanctioned places of worship, although some discreet
 proselytizing and distributing of religious texts seems to be
 tolerated. The management and dontrol of religion is the
 responsibility of religious affairs bureaus across China,
 staffed primarily by party members. Buddhists are by far the
 largest body of religious believers in China. The Government
 estimates that there are 100 million Chinese Buddhists, most of
 whom belong to the dominant Han ethnic group. Other Buddhists
 belong to Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups. Han
 Buddhist leaders generally cooperate with the Government and
 have experienced few reported difficulties. In Tibet, however,
 where Buddhism and Tibetan nationalism are closely intertwined,
 relations between Buddhists and secular authorities have been
 tense. Daoism, widely practiced in southern coastal provinces,
 is officially respected as an important part of traditional
 Chinese culture, but some of its practices conflicting with
 Government strictures against superstition and waste of arable
 land have been sharply criticized.
 China permits Moslem citizens to make the hajj to Mecca, but
 limited state financing effectively constrains the number of
 hajjis. Nongovernment sources indicated that about 1,500
 Chinese made the hajj in 1991, roughly the same number as in
 1990. Officially sanctioned religious organizations are
 permitted to maintain international contacts as long as these
 do not entail foreign control, but proselytizing by foreign
 groups is forbidden. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement, the
 official Protestant church, and its Buddhist and Moslem
 counterparts have established extensive networks of
 international support. While the Catholic Patriotic
 Association has no official ties to the Roman Catholic Church,
 its leaders frequently visit Catholic and other religious
 leaders abroad. The Association ordains its own bishops and
 priests, generally follows pre-Vatican II practices, and
 rejects papal authority. Sources in Rome publicly indicated,
 however, that 20 to 30 of the more than 60 Catholic Patriotic
 Association bishops had been recognized by the Vatican.
 The Government, after forcefully suppressing all religious
 observances during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, began in
 the late 1970's to restore or replace confiscated churches,
 temples, mosques, and monasteries. The official religious
 organizations administer more than a dozen Catholic and'
 Protestant seminaries, nine institutes to train imams and
 Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist monks.
 Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate
 "political reliability," and all graduates must pass an
 examination of theological and political knowledge to qualify
 for the clergy. The Government supervises the publication of
 religious material for distribution to ensure religious and
 political conformity.
 Only those Christian churches affiliated with either the
 Catholic Patriotic Association or the Three-Self Patriotic
 Movement may operate openly, but active unofficial religious
 movements pose an alternative to the state-regulated churches
 and temples. The unofficial Catholic Church claims a
 membership far larger than the 3.6 million registered with the
 official church, though actual figures are unknown. It has its
 own bishops and priests and conducts its own services. A large
 number of Protestants worship privately in "house churches"
 that are independent of government control. There is a dynamic
 house church movement in many cities and, like their unofficial
 Catholic counterparts, house churches often attract more
 
 
 823
 CHINA
 followers than the official Three-Self Patriotic Movement
 churches.
 The Government generally tolerates the existence of unofficial
 Catholic and Protestant churches as long as they remain small
 and discreet. In some parts of south and east China, official
 and underground churches seem to coexist and even cooperate.
 In other parts of the country, however, authorities have
 sporadically continued efforts to rein in activities of the
 unapproved Catholic and Protestant movements, raiding and
 closing a number of unregistered churches. The Government
 suspects many leaders of unofficial churches of harboring
 criminal or dissident intentions and has imprisoned scores of
 them in recent years. There have been numerous credible
 reports in recent years of raids on house churches and
 detentions of members, particularly in southern and coastal
 provinces and in Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Henan provinces.
 While China remains a nominally secular society, the active
 expression of religious belief has continued to grow.
 Growth in expression of belief has been accompanied by
 continued Government pressure on believers. In February the
 Communist Party reportedly issued a secret document reflecting
 heightened official suspicion of religious activities and
 urging greater vigilance by the party in controlling such
 activity. Shanghai Catholic Bishop Fan Zhongliang was arrested
 in mid-June in Zhejiang Province, where he had reportedly
 attempted to contact underground Chinese Catholic leaders. He
 was returned to Shanghai where he remained in detention until
 mid-August, when he was released pending further
 investigation. According to Catholic sources, many other
 bishops, priests and lay people remained in detention or
 reeducation. Bishop Joseph Fan Xueyan, with the exception of a
 period from 1979 through 1981, has been imprisoned or under
 house arrest since 1958. The Government said in November that
 Bishop Fan had been released. According to credible reports at
 least 23 Catholics were detained in Hebei in December 1990,
 including Bishops Simon An. Shi'en, Peter Chen Jianzhang, Cosmas
 Shi Enxiang and Song Weili. One bishop from the group, Paul
 Shi Chunjie, reportedly died in November. Another, John Han
 Dingxian, was described by the Government in November as "under
 investigation." A third bishop from the group, Paul Liu Shuhe,
 was reportedly sent for reeducation through labor. Bishop
 Casimir Wang Milu continued to serve a 10-year reform through
 labor sentence. Cangzhou Bishop Paul Li Zhenrong and several
 other people reportedly were arrested on December 11 in Tianjin.
 Protestants faced the same sort of pressure. Members of the
 Guangzhou house church of Pastor Samuel Lamb (Lin Xiangao)
 continued to be harassed by local authorities, but the church
 remained open. According to Protestant sources, many
 Protestants remained in detention or reeducation for their
 religious activities. These included Reverend Sun Ludian,
 Reverend Song Yude, and Reverend Xu Guoxing. Many Tibetan
 Buddhists and Xinjiang Moslems have continued to oppose Chinese
 rule, and Chinese authorities have taken a harsh attitude
 toward both. The Government tightly controls and monitors
 Tibetan Buddhism and does not tolerate religious manifestations
 that advocate Tibetan independence. It has recognized the
 Dalai Lama as a major religious figure but condemns his
 political activities and his leadership of a "government in
 exile." A 1990 law sharply limits religious freedom for
 Tibetan Buddhists. It provides for government regulation of
 many religious activities, from burning incense to holding
 ceremonies.
 
 
 824
 CHINA
 The practice of religion in Tibet is also hampered by the
 limits the Government imposes on religious education and by the
 small size of the religious community compared to traditional
 norms. Access to religious sites, however, does not appear to
 be a major problem, and large amounts of money are being
 devoted to reconstruction of the main sacred sites including
 the Potala Palace in Lhasa. In areas with large Moslem
 populations, particularly Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia, there
 continues to be concern regarding the sharp restrictions on the
 building of mosques and the religious education of youths under
 age 18 mandated by the 1988 religion law. Following the 1990
 unrest in Xinjiang, the authorities issued additional
 regulations further restricting religious activities and
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government uses an identification card system to control
 and restrict residence patterns within the country. Citizens
 are required to carry their cards at all times when out of
 doors (many apparently ignore this rule) and to present them to
 authorities on demand. Individuals are registered as residents
 of a particular jurisdiction and assigned to a specific work
 unit. Change of residence or workplace is very difficult and,
 in most cases, is possible only with government permission and
 agreement by the work unit. The Government has placed travel
 restrictions on several released detainees and religious
 figures.
 Authorities try to limit unauthorized migration to urban areas,
 but they estimate there are at least a million unregistered
 persons each in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Beijing.
 Authoritative Chinese estimates of the itinerant population for.
 the entire country range from 70 to 100 million. Official
 tolerance of this itinerant population has varied with the
 economic need for a supplemental work force in the big cities.
 Foreign travel is controlled, although Chinese citizens have,
 and many exercise, the right to emigrate upon the Government's
 review of their circumstances. Tiananmen hunger striker Gao
 Xin was released and allowed to leave China for the United
 States in March. Former University of Arizona student Yang
 Wei, several other dissidents, and the families of some
 dissidents residing in the United States were also allowed to
 leave China in 1991. Secretary of State Baker was assured in
 November in Beijing that any person against whom no criminal
 proceedings were pending would be allowed to leave China after
 completing the usual formalities. At year's end, intellectuals
 Dai Qing and Li Zehou had received their passports; Dai left
 China for the United States in mid-December, and Li was
 planning to leave in early January. Other dissidents and
 religious figures, however, were still encountering problems in
 acquiring PRC travel documentation.
 The State Education Commission has stated on a number of
 occasions that a proper political attitude is a major criterion
 in selecting people to go abroad for government-sponsored
 study. The State Education Commission has also made efforts to
 restrict administratively the number of privately sponsored
 students going abroad. Regulations implemented in 1990 require
 those college and university graduates who received free
 postsecondary education to repay the cost of their education to
 the state by working for 5 years or more before being eligible
 for passports to go abroad to study. For those who have
 
 
 825
 CHINA
 overseas Chinese relatives or have not yet graduated, the
 regulations provide a sliding scale of tuition reimbursement
 exempting them from the work requirement. Students who must
 pay the full amount are reportedly charged about $500 for each
 year of study. Implementation of these regulations has varied
 from place to place, and many students still managed to obtain
 passports. Persons subject to the regulations on study abroad
 appear to have had little trouble obtaining passports to visit
 Chinese relatives overseas.
 The Government has relaxed some restrictions on internal travel
 by foreigners. Tibet and Xinjiang have allowed tourists and
 some diplomats to visit, although with significant
 restrictions. Senior officials have stated that students and
 scholars returning from overseas have not been and will not be
 punished for participation in prodemocracy activities while
 abroad. It is not clear whether this guarantee applies to
 leaders of student dissident organizations. Officials have
 indicated that if such persons wanted to return to China they
 would have to express "repentance," disassociate themselves
 from "reactionary" organizations, and refrain from "subversive"
 activities once they returned.
 The Government indicated in September that since 1989 between
 6,000 and 7,000 students had returned to China from the United
 States on holiday. Another several thousand had returned to
 work. None had been punished or refused permission to go
 abroad again. None of the approximately 150 students
 interviewed by the U.S. American Consulate General in Shanghai
 reported experiencing any difficulties with the Chinese
 Government when they returned on holiday from the United States
 to China in 1991.
 Although no instance of government harassment has been reported
 with regard to returning students, nonstudent democracy'
 activist brothers Li Lin and Li Zhi-were arrested, tortured,
 and held for 5 months when they returned in February to their
 native Hunan province. They had fled to Hong Kong after
 participating in the June 1989 democracy movement but returned
 to China after the central Government announced that it was
 safe for dissidents who had broken their ties to counter-
 revolutionary organizations to come home. Upon return, they
 were arrested by local authorities, but following appeals by
 former President Jimmy Carter and Hong Kong-based American
 businessman John Kamm, a compromise between central and local
 authorities was apparently struck whereby they were convicted
 merely of illegally crossing the Chinese border, then released
 and allowed to return to Hong Kong.
 The Li brothers' case is the only known instance of activists
 having been arrested after returning to China from abroad.
 There have, however, been reports since 1989 of harassment of
 Chinese students overseas, although the number of such reports
 dropped off in 1991. Chinese officials indicated in September
 that they intended to "be helpful" with regard to overseas
 students' passport problems. Privately funded students could
 have their passports extended as long as they had an academic
 reason to remain overseas. Publicly funded students could
 change their passport status to private by making a financial
 settlement with the work unit that had financed their studies.
 It is too early to assess the implementation of this policy.
 The Government accepts repatriation of citizens who have
 departed China without authorization, in most cases apparently
 without punishing them. For example, some 3,000 Fujianese
 
 
 826
 CHINA
 "boat people" who left China without authorization and entered
 Japan illegally were repatriated in 1990 and 1991. Although
 China accepted more than 280,000 refugees, mostly ethnic Han
 Chinese, from Vietnam and Laos between 1978 and 1982, in recent
 years it has adopted a stricter policy of no new admissions.
 China has cooperated with Hong Kong to reduce the flow of
 Vietnamese refugees into the colony. Although China has signed
 the Comprehensive Plan of Action negotiated at the
 International Conference on Indochinese Refugees held in Geneva
 in June 1989, it is unclear whether China considers itself a
 participating state. Credible reports suggest the PRC has
 repatriated persons of other nationalities seeking refugee
 status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens cannot peacefully and legally change their
 government. Chinese citizens can neither freely choose nor
 change the laws and officials that govern them. China is ruled
 by the Communist Party, the paramount source of political
 authority, on Marxist-Leninist principles. Within the party, a
 closed inner circle of a few senior leaders exercises ultimate
 power over the nation. Some hold key positions within the
 six-member Standing Cormmittee of the Politburo, the Central
 Military Commission, or other organs. Others are nominally
 retired but continue to exercise great political influence
 despite holding no formal positions in party or government.
 Although at age 87 he is less actively engaged in day-to-day
 issues, Deng Xiaoping remains first among equals in this latter
 group. These senior party leaders broadly determine poicy,
 which is then implemented by the Government.
 According to the 1982 Constitution, the National People's
 Congress (NPC) is the highest organ of state power. It
 nominally selects the President and Vice President, decides on
 the choice of the Premier, and elects the Chairman of the
 Central Military Commission. During the 1980's, the NPC had
 begun to exercise increasing independence and influence.
 Debates had become much more open, and several important
 Government proposals were sent back for revisions. After 1989,
 however, the NPC reverted to its more traditional role of
 docilely ratifying decisions already made by the senior
 leadership. There is no longer any real debate in the NPC
 public sessions, though debate in closed-door committee
 sessions on certain issues is still reportedly fairly vigorous.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no organizations within China which monitor or
 comment on human rights conditions. The Government has made it
 clear that it will not tolerate the existence of such groups.
 In Shanghai, Fu Shenqi, Gu Bin, and Yang Zhou were detained in
 the spring for "violating Chinese law" and held by public
 security authorities pending investigation of their alleged
 involvement in the establishment of a human rights society and
 newsletter.
 Despite the Chinese Government's adherence to the United
 Nations Charter, which mandates respect for and promotion of
 human rights, Chinese officials do not accept the principle
 that human rights are universal. The State Council Information
 Office's unprecedented November "white paper" on human rights
 
 
 827
 CHINA
 argued that each nation has its own concept of human rights,
 grounded in its political, economic, and social system and its
 historical, religious, and cultural background. Foreign
 Minister Qian Qichen said in his September address to the U.N.
 General Assembly that the human rights forums of the United
 Nations had been used by certain countries to wage "cold war."
 Although officials no longer dismiss all discussion of human
 rights as interference in the country's internal affairs, they
 remain reluctant to accept criticism of China's human rights
 situation by other nations or international organizations.
 They reject reports by Amnesty International, Asia Watch, and
 other international human rights monitoring groups on torture
 and other human rights violations. The Chinese Eoreign
 Ministry publicly criticized the Department of State's 1990
 report on human rights practices in China, charging that the
 report had "cited false rumors to distort and attack China" and
 was therefore "entirely unacceptable." Chinese officials have
 stepped up their criticism of human rights problems in other
 countries while arguing, paradoxically, that foreigners had no
 right to criticize human rights abuses in China.
 In 1991 Chinese officials initiated efforts to promote academic
 study and discussion of Chinese concepts of human rights.
 Articles in the official press argued that "Marxist human
 rights" emphasizing collective economic entitlements were
 superior to "capitalist human rights" stressing individual
 civil and political liberties. The Law Institute of the
 Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) held a symposium in
 June on theories of human rights. A CASS delegation visited
 North America in September and October to study international
 concepts of human rights. In November the Government
 published, and publicized widely, a report on human rights in
 China which acknowledged the need for improvements, but
 otherwise presented a one-sided and highly complimentary view
 of individual rights in China, attempting-to establish a
 dichotomy between economic development and personal and
 political liberties. The publication of the report and other
 human rights activities appear to have originated in a desire
 to improve China's image abroad and strengthen the Government's
 ability to respond to criticism of its human rights record.
 Whatever the motivation, this process of study and dialog has
 exposed more Chinese to alternate concepts of human rights.
 Chinese authorities continued to-broaden their dialog with the
 United States and other governments on certain human rights
 issues, including judicial and penal systems, amnesties,
 accounting for prisoners, emigration policy, and family
 planning. Beijing also received several U.S. Congressional
 delegations with a particular concern for Chinese human rights
 problems. An Australian human rights delegation visited China
 in July. A European Parliament delegation with an emphasis on
 human rights made a September visit. Both the Australian and
 European delegations visited Tibet. Other prominent visitors,
 including a high-level U.S. delegation led by the Secretary of
 State, also focused on human rights issues with Chinese
 leaders. All of these delegations found restrictions imposed
 by the Government which severely limited their contacts and
 travel.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While laws exist to protect minorities and women, in practice
 discrimination based on ethnicity,- sex, and religion persists
 in housing, jobs, education, and other aspects of life.
 
 
 828
 CHINA
 The economic progress of minorities is viewed by the Government
 as one of its significant achievements. Minorities benefit
 from a policy of "privileged treatment" in marriage, family
 planning, university admission, and employment, as well as
 disproportionate infrastructure investment in some minority
 areas. In practice, however, discrimination based on ethnic
 origin persists. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese
 people pervades the general thinking of the Han ethnic
 majority. The 55 designated ethnic minorities constitute just
 over 8 percent of the PRC's population. Most minority groups
 reside in areas they have traditionally inhabited, with
 standards of living often well below the national average.
 Government economic development policies have had some success.
 in raising living standards but have at the same time disrupted
 traditional patterns of living.
 The Communist Party's avowed policy of increasing minority
 representation in the Government and the CCP has resulted in
 members of minority groups accounting for 15 percent of the
 deputies in the NPC. Among the 19 chairmen and vice chairmen
 of the NPC Standing Committee, 6, or 32 percent, are of
 minority nationality. Such statistics, however, obscure the
 reality that ethnic minorities are effectively shut out of all
 but a few positions of real political and decisionmaking
 power. Some minorities resent Han officials holding key
 positions in minority autonomous regions. Ethnic minorities in
 Tibet, Xinjiang, and elsewhere have demonstrated against Han
 Chinese authority, and the underlying causes of unrest continue
 to fester. While martial law in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, was
 lifted-in 1990, foreign visitors to Tibet in 1991 observed that
 there was still a pervasive armed police and military presence
 there. Reports reaching the West in 1991 suggested the
 existence of smoldering ethnic tension in Inner Mongolia.
 Central authorities have made it clear that they will not
 tolerate opposition to Beijing's rule in minority regions.
 The Government has tried in some instances to adopt policies
 responsive to minority sensitivities, but in doing so has
 encountered the dilemma of how to respect minority cultures
 without damaging minority interests. In Tibet and Xinjiang,
 for example, there are two-track school systems using standard
 Chinese and minority languages. Students can choose which
 system to attend. One side effect of this policy to protect
 and maintain minority cultures has been a reinforcement of a
 highly segregated society. Under this separate education
 system, those graduating from minority schools are at a
 disadvantage in competing for jobs in government and business,
 which require good spoken Chinese. These graduates must take
 remedial language instruction before attending universities and
 colleges.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "women in the People's
 Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of
 life," and promises, among other things, equal pay for equal
 work. In fact, women experience many inequalities. Most women
 employed in industry work in lower skilled and lower paid jobs,
 women hold relatively few positions ofsignificant influence
 within the party or government structure, and there was no
 notable improvement in women's rights or working conditions in
 1991. Women have often been the unintended victims of reforms
 designed to streamline enterprises and give workers greater job
 mobility. Many employers prefer to hire men to avoid the
 expense of maternity leave and child care. Reports by women of
 discrimination, unfair dismissal, demotion, or wage cuts when
 they needed maternity leave have continued.

 CHINA
 The gap in the education levels of men and women has narrowed;
 women now make up over one-third of both high school and
 university students. Men continue, however, to constitute the
 majority of the educated, particularly the highly educated, and
 a disproportionate number of government-funded scholarships for
 overseas study go to men.
 The Government strongly condemns and is working hard to curb
 traditional abhorrent practices against women such as the
 abduction and selling of women for wives or prostitution, abuse
 of female children, violence against women, and female
 infanticide. In September the NPC's Standing Committee, in an
 effort to curb such practices, adopted laws on protection of
 minors, curbing of prostitution, and punishment of abductors of
 women and children. Many discriminatory practices are rooted
 in traditional rural attitudes and values. Rural parents tend
 to view girls as liabilities because they are less productive
 income earners and leave home without providing assistance for
 their parents' retirement; boys are more highly valued as
 prospective income earners and as future caretakers for elderly
 parents. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the
 perceived higher economic value of boys in providing old age
 support by establishing more retirement homes and improving the
 quality of those homes already in existence.
 Finally, there is discrimination in China on the basis of
 religion. Communist Party officials state that party
 membership and religious belief are incompatible. This places
 a serious limitation on religious believers, since party
 membership is required for almost all high positions in
 government and commerce. While there are some religious
 believers in the party, especially in minority autonomous
 regions, few hold important leadership positions. Most
 government officials responsible for religious affairs work are
 not religious believers.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The PRC's 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of
 association," but the guarantee is heavily qualified by
 references to the interest of the State and the leadership of
 the CCP. Though trade union officials recognize that workers'
 interests may not always coincide with those of the party, they
 claim their role encompasses both passing CCP demands and
 propaganda down to the workers and channeling workers' demands
 upward to the enterprises, the party, and the Government.
 While union membership is voluntary for individual employees,
 enterprises are generally required to have a union. Workers in
 Chinese-foreign joint ventures are guaranteed the right to form
 unions, which-then must affiliate with the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions (ACFTU), and joint venture managers report
 significant union activity and the need to bargain with these
 unions over wages and benefits. Union officials indicate that
 about 20 percent of joint ventures have unions, and attribute
 the lack of unions in other joint ventures to the newness of
 the firms. However, officials report that union membership is
 much larger among large joint ventures, which include the
 majority of U.S. company participation. They state that they
 are actively organizing unions in those joint ventures that do
 not have them, and report little opposition from foreign owners.
 
 
 830
 CHINA
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975
 and 1978 Constitutions, was removed from the 1982
 Constitution. In 1983, however, the Chairman of the ACFTU
 stated that, if a trade union and its labor protection safety
 officers found that a workplace was too dangerous, the union
 should organize the workers to leave the hazardous areas.
 Thus, Chinese authorities usually view strikes as justified
 only when they respond to problems such as a sudden
 deterioration in safety conditions. While Ministry of Labor
 officials deny that there have been any recent strikes, there
 were scattered press reports of strikes and other labor unrest
 in 1991. Many of these continue to relate to the issue of
 benefits for laid-off workers.
 The ACFTU, nominally an independent organization, is in fact
 closely controlled by the Communist Party. There have been
 credible reports of Communist Party harassment through union
 channels of workers with close working relationships with
 foreigners. Virtually all state sector workers and nearly 90
 percent of all urban workers belong to ACFTU chapters.
 Unemployed workers are not considered union members.
 The Government does not allow independent trade unions, and
 none operates openly. In 1983 the ACFTU added a new clause to
 its Constitution requiring that any attempt to set up or
 dissolve a union be endorsed by its membership and approved by
 higher bodies in the national trade union structure. While
 this clause appears to allow for the existence of nonunion
 worker groups, no such groups appear to be legally tolerated.
 The Workers Autonomous Federations that were formed briefly in
 the Spring of 1989 were all eliminated by arrests of their
 leaders. Worker leader Han Dongfang was released and all
 charges dropped in 1991, and the Government told the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that Liu Qiang had also
 been released, but a number of other worker leaders who
 attempted to form independent unions remain in detention.
 Reports from several sources, however, indicated that
 underground worker organizations exist in China. The Hong Kong
 press has reported that these organizations were subject to
 official harassment.
 ACFTU international activities are subject to policy guidance
 from the CCP. The ACFTU currently claims to have contacts with
 Xrade unions in over 120 countries, without regard to whether
 the foreign union is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions, or other organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the labor contract system that now covers approximately
 10 percent of China's work force, individual workers may
 negotiate with management over contract terms. In practice,
 only the very few workers with highly technical skills are able
 to negotiate effectively on salary and fringe benefits issues.
 The Government does not permit collective bargaining. Without
 legal status as a collective bargaining body, the ACFTU's role
 has been restricted to a consultative one in the decisionmaking
 process over wages and regulations affecting labor. Most of
 the terms and conditions of employment continue to be
 determined unilaterally by management in most cases. In joint
 ventures and some small collectives, workers have greater
 influence. The ACFTU has shown itself increasingly concerned
 about protecting workers' basic living standards and,
 
 
 831
 CHINA
 occasionally, protesting unsafe working conditions; it has
 organized petitions and even sit-ins demanding that laid-off
 workers' living wages be protected. Other than in cases where
 it believes workers' basic welfare is severely threatened (such
 as inadequate unemployment benefits), the ACFTU generally acts
 simply as a channel for workers' complaints to the management
 of individual enterprises and municipal labor bureaus, or as a
 channel for passing CCP demands and propaganda to workers.
 A 1988 law states that trade unions in private enterprises have
 the right to represent employees and to sign collective
 bargaining agreements with the enterprises. The significance
 of this is muted by the fact that the work force of private
 enterprises now accounts for less than 1 percent of Chinese
 urban workers. Moreover, there have been no reports of
 instances in which unions in private enterprises have
 undertaken collective bargaining over wage, contract or.safety
 issues. Worker congresses, organized in most Chinese
 enterprises, technically have the authority to remove
 incompetent managers and approve major decisions affecting the
 enterprise (notably wage and bonus distribution systems).
 Worker congresses generally meet only once a year, however, and
 appear to act primarily as rubber stamps on agreements worked
 out among factory managers, party secretaries, and union
 representatives.
 In addition, a dispute settlement procedure has been in effect
 since 1987. According to the procedure, workers who wish to
 contest a dismissal or other unfair practice must first appeal
 to an arbitration committee within the factory. If they are
 not satisfied with the committee's decision they can appeal to
 a local arbitration committee, chaired by a local labor bureau
 official with representatives from the union and the
 enterprise. If not satisfied with this committee's decision,
 the worker can bring the matter to court, though in practice,
 this has rarely, if ever, been done.
 Laws governing working conditions in China's Special Economic
 Zones are not significantly different from those in the country
 at large. While the Government has regulations limiting wages
 for joint venture employees to 120 percent of state enterprise
 employees' wages (or 150 percent in highly profitable
 ventures), these regulations are not uniformly enforced
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While China has generally abandoned its traditional use of
 massive corvee labor for construction of infrastructure
 projects and public facilities, workers are still "mobilized"
 for public works projects and to augment public security
 forces. Imprisonment in China, except for those in detention
 centers, generally entails compulsory labor. Almost all those
 sentenced by the courts to prison or labor reform camps,
 including political prisoners, are required to work, usually
 for little compensation. In addition, China maintains a
 network of reeducation through labor camps (see Section l.e.)
 with an officially reported inmate population of 160,000, not
 sentenced by a court, who also must work.
 Under the "staying at prison employment" system, some prisoners
 are denied permission to return to their homes after release
 and instead are forced to remain and work in the vicinity of
 the prison. For those assigned to camps far from their
 residences, this constitutes a form of internal exile. While
 the Ministry of Justice claims that only 200 to 300 former
 
 
 832
 CHINA
 prisoners are currently held under this system, most outside
 observers contend that the true number is far higher, although
 numbers are impossible to verify. Chinese penal policy
 emphasizes "reform first, production second," but labor is an
 integral part of the system both for rehabilitation and in
 order to help support the facilities. Prisoners in both labor
 reform and labor reeducation reportedly spend a maximum of 6
 hours per day working and 3 hours per day studying. Most
 reports indicate that work conditions in the export-oriented
 light manufacturing factories are similar to those in ordinary
 factories, but conditions on labor farms and in coal mines are
 exceedingly harsh znd in the mines possibly more dangerous than
 in ordinary mines. Various Chinese newspapers have reported
 that Chinese prison labor is used for many types of production*
 (examples in parenthesis): infrastructure (roads), heavy
 industry (coal, steel), light manufacturing (clothing, shoes,
 small machine tools) and agriculture (grain, tea, sugar cane).
 The U.S. Customs Service has issued orders barring a number of
 products which were reported to be made by prisoners from
 entering the United States and has detained several shipments
 of such goods. On October 10, 1991, the Chinese Government
 published a reiteration of its regulations barring the export
 of prison-made goods. It also reported to the U.S. Embassy on
 the results of several investigations, including one where a
 factory manager was relieved of his administrative duties. At
 year's end, the U.S. Government was actively negotiating a
 memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Government on
 obtaining the necessary information to enforce U.S. law and
 halt these exports.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Regulations promulgated in 1987 prohibit the employment of
 school-age minors who have not completed the compulsory 9 years
 of education. Statistics on school attendance indicate that
 approximately 20 percent of school-age children in the cities
 and villages do not attend school, and therefore are likely to
 be working. The number may well be higher in poorer and
 isolated areas, where child labor in. agriculture is assumed to
 be widespread. In connection with a crackdown on vices, there
 were reports in the press and by public security officials of
 female minors being sold into prostitution or to factories as
 laborers.
 In September 1988, the Ministry of Labor issued a circular
 designed to curb child labor problems; it reiterated those
 policies this year. It calls for severe fines, withdrawal of
 business licenses, or jail for employers who hire child
 laborers under 16 years old. Enforcement appears to have been
 haphazard. Provincial officials in Guangdong, where the
 problem of child labor is particularly serious, were unable to
 say how many enterprises have been prosecuted for child labor
 violations.
 e." Acceptable Conditions of Work
 China does not have a labor code. A draft is apparently
 circulating, but it remains unclear whether it will be
 published or made into law.
 There is no minimum wage in China.
 
 
 833
 CHINA
 The legal maximum workweek excluding overtime is 48 hours, of
 which 3 to 12 hours are generally spent in political study or
 "education" on current social issues.
 At factories and construction sites, occupational health and
 safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns. Every
 work unit must designate a health and safety officer; the
 International Labor Organization has established a training
 program for these officials. Despite this, general health and
 safety conditions in the workplace are poor. Both workers and
 managers often disregard safety procedures. State procurators
 deal annually with thousands of negligence and accident cases
 involving criminal or civil liability. The absence of a
 national labor code makes enforcement of safety regulations by
 labor bureaus extremely difficult. Most of the cases mentioned
 above involve physical injuries caused by machinery or
 transport of materials. Chinese epidemiological officials have
 only recently become aware of the threat to workers from.
 chemicals and are currently only beginning to monitor such
 threats.
