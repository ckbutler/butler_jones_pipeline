 IRELAND
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance and
 maintenance of human rights. Individual liberties and
 civil rights are guaranteed and protected by the constitu-
 tion. The guarantees include all those typical to highly
 developed western democracies such as freedom from
 torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment, arbitrary arrest or imprisonment, denial of fair
 trial or invasion of the home. Political institutions
 meet the highest democratic standards and political life
 is orderly. The growth of terrorist activities resulting
 from the civil unrest in Northern Ireland caused the
 Irish Government to introduct legislation to combat
 terrorism in 1976, which the Parliament adopted.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional protections are observed, although Amnesty
 International has reported some instances of alleged
 maltreatment of detainess or prisoners, where terrorism
 or other serious crimes may have been involved.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1976, the spillover into the Republic of terrorist
 activities arising from the Northern Ireland situation
 led the Irish Government to declare a state of emergency
 and to allow police to detain persons for up to seven
 days without charge. A signatory of the European
 Convention on Human Rights, Ireland duly availed itself of
 the rights of derogation from that Convention until
 security conditions improve. The new Irish Government
 decided to return to a maximum period of two days
 detention without charge, and this took effect October 12,
 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial

 299
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 e. Invation of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Ireland has kept pace with other western democracies in
 the provision of social welfare benefits to its citizens--
 within the limit of its economic means. As one of the
 least prosperous Western European states, these benefits
 are modest compared, for example, to the Nordic societies.
 The basic needs for the poor are met, and in some areas
 such as education, Ireland ranks high in the world
 community.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Irish citizens participate fully in an orderly democratic
 political system. The labor movement is free and strong.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 The Irish Government in general has a good record regard-
 ing independent, outside investigations of alleged
 human rights abuses.
