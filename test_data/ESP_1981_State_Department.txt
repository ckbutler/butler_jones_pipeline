 SPAIN
 Human rights practices in Spain are integrally linked to the
 whole process of democratization which began in November
 1975 with the death of General Francisco Franco. The Franco
 regime effectively denied the Spanish people the exercise of
 their human rights through the full panoply of authoritarian
 mechanisms, including censorship, restrictions on freedom of
 speech and banning of opposition parties and non-sanctioned
 labor unions. Most elements of current Spanish society --
 including the king, the Catholic church and all major poli-
 tical parties -- are committed both in principle and in
 practice to the realization of a democratic Spain where
 human rights are protected. Basic freedoms of speech,
 press, religion, assembly, movement and participation in the
 political process are respected in Spain.
 One of the grave problems facing Spain is terrorism -- an
 activity which is itself a gross violation of human rights.
 Terrorist activities, which are almost exclusively the
 doings of Basque separatist movements, took 32 lives during
 the first eight months in 1981. Terrorism took 121 lives
 during 1980. Some of the incidents were spectacular and
 sent a shudder through the population, already nervous after
 the attempted coup. In one week in early May eight people
 were killed by terrorists, including one general. Another
 general, head of the king's military household, was injured
 and barely escaped death in one of the attacks of that week.
 There exist significant forces in the military that are
 doubtful of the democracy's willingness or ability to deal
 with what they see as primary threats to Spain's security
 regional autonomy and terrorism. A dramatic expression of
 this occurred on February 23, 1981, when, during the voting
 for a new head of government, an attempted coup took place.
 The picture of the parliamentary process being interrupted
 and parliamentarians being held hostage by those who take
 issue with the current situation in Spain illustrates one of
 the problems facing the country. The important aspect of
 this event is that democracy did survive and that the over-
 whelming majority of the people, the military, and the
 institutions stayed loyal to the king, the constitution, and
 to democracy.
 Despite the difficulty of this year for Spain, the process
 of democratization continues. Support for human rights is
 still strong; the effort to bring practices into line with
 law is constant. The government continues to report to
 parliament every three months on application of the anti-
 terrorism law which suspends certain constitutional guaran-
 tees in an effort to combat terrorism. Under the law, a
 prisoner charged with supporting terrorism can be held inco-
 mmunicado for ten days, have his home searched, mail opened
 and telephones tapped. The judge must review these suspen-
 sions of rights periodically to decide if they may continue.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom frome
 a. Torture
 Article 15 of the constitution guarantees the right to life
 and to physical and moral integrity. It specifically
 (865)
 
 
 866
 forbids the use of torture, but reports of torture occa-
 sionally are heard. The most notable case, which received
 extensive media coverage, was that of Jose Ignacio
 Arregui, accused of involvement with the Basque terrorist
 group ETA-Milltar. Arregui died of pneumonia while being
 held incommunicado under the Anti-terrorist Law. The
 investigation of the police officers involved in Arregui's
 interrogation is still pending; the doctor who was accused
 of denying adequate medical aid has been relieved of his
 duties.
 Another alleged case of torture occurred when three youths
 were arrested by the civil guard in Almeria, immediately
 after the attempted assassination of the head of the
 king's military household by  three ETA members. The
 civil guard said that the three died as the car in which
 they were riding went out of control after a struggle
 between the three and their captors. Others accuse the
 civil guard of staging the accident to cover up deaths by
 torture. A special prosecutor has been appointed to
 investigate the case and determine if it should go to
 trial.
 There also have been accusations that Basques are some-
 times arrested indiscriminately and then tortured. (The
 sources of these accusations are invariably Basque; the
 non-Basque press and public devote little time to the
 issue.) In almost all cases, the accusers say, those
 arrested are then released for lack of evidence when their
 cases are brought before the courts. The government
 denies these charges.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment is formally
 prohibited by article 15 of the constitution. While law
 enforcement authorities generally respect the law and the
 rights of the accused, there have been reports of mal-
 treatment. Maltreatment is not condoned by the govern-
 ment, and such reports are investigated.
 There have been charges made against some individual
 prison directors about their treatment of prisoners.
 (Again, these charges stem exclusively from Basque sources
 -- often family members of the prisoners.) These charges
 have not been proved to the satisfaction of government
 authorities. Prison overcrowding is a problem recognized
 by all, including the government and responsible penal
 officials.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known cases of abduction, secret arrests or
 clandestine detention by official or quasi-official secu-
 rity forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 17 of the constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. It also provides that there be maximum
 periods of preventive detention (72 hours); that an
 arrested person must be informed of his rights, including
 the right to an attorney, and that a detainee is entitled
 to an explanation of the reason for his arrest. Such
 rights and prohibitions, including habeas corpus, are
 respected in practice by law enforcement officials. In
 
 
 867
 the case of terrorists, these rights are modified by the
 anti-terrorism law. There have been accusations, noted
 above, of indiscriminate arrests in the Basque region,
 with subsequent release. No such reports have been proved
 to the satisfaction of Spanish authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by the
 constitution (article 24) and respected in practice. The
 full range of defendants' rights is also provided for and
 protected in practice. The new military code of justice
 enacted this year prohibits the charging or trying of
 civilians by military courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 While article 18 of the constitution states that "the home
 is inviolable" and that "no entry or search may be made
 without legal authority," article 55 permits an organic
 law to suspend this provision in individual cases. The
 antiterrorism law does so, but special judicial permission
 must be obtained on a case-by-case basis, "for certain
 persons with respect to investigations having to do with
 the activities of armed bands or terrorist elements."
 Some entries have occurred in the Basque region under this
 law.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All are specifically protected by the constitution. The
 press is free and is, in fact, the source of many of the
 allegations of abuse noted in this report. There is no
 state religion and the constitution states that "freedom
 of ideology, religion and cult of individuals and commu-
 nities is guaranteed." The right of free assembly is
 specifically guaranteed in the constitution and is used
 frequently by groups across the political spectrum.
 Unions are free to organize, strike, and bargain collec-
 tively under article seven of the constitution.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Spain has been actively involved in the resettlement of
 refugees and in the past has accepted groups of Indo-
 chinese and has integrated them (with the help of the
 foreign ministry and International Red Cross) into the
 society. The Spanish have also accepted and resettled
 Cubans for many years.
 There are no restrictions placed on Spaniards by the
 government regarding foreign or domestic travel. Women
 are not subject to different rules in internal or foreign
 travel, emigration or repatriation.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political system is a democratic multiparty system
 with universal suffrage, in which opposition parties
 operate freely and with access to the media. Based on an
 elected parliament, free speech and the full range of
 other democratic norms, Spanish democracy'is lively and
 meaningful to the man in the street.
 
 
 868
 In the constitution, women are guaranteed equality under
 the law. Societal factors, however, still work against
 women in seeking employment, gaining equal opportunity and
 pay, etc. Women nonetheless are represented in all walks
 of life and take part in the political process actively.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The government of Spain has voiced no objection to outside
 or internal investigations of the human rights situation
 in Spain. Amnesty International did not visit Spain this
 year, but continued to monitor events there, remarking in
 its latest report that the Spanish government had not
 specifically replied to the report of its 1979 special
 mission. The press, as noted before, reports fully on
 incidents which come to its attention. Spain is hosting
 the CSCE review conference in Madrid in which there has
 been a full discussion of the human rights records of
 European countries.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Spanish constitution specifically guarantees the right
 to work, the right to own property and rights to food,
 shelter, health care and education in accordance with the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 Some broad economic data follow (all figures are for the
 year 1979 unless otherwise stated)s Per capita GNP in
 1980 was 45,578. Life expectancy at birth is 73 years.
 The infant mortality rate is 13 per 1,000 live births.
 The annual population growth rate from 1970 has averaged
 one percentl the total fertility rate is 2.6 percent. The
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio (1978) is as
 follows:  total, 110, male, 110; female, 110. The calorie
 supply available for consumption is 128 percent (1977) of
 the nutritional requirement.
