 COMOROS
 Located in the Mozambique Channel between East Africa and Madagascar, the
 Federal and Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims a
 fourth, Mayotte, which is still governed by France. Until the assassination of Presi-
 dent Abdallah in November 1989, the Comoros was a de facto one-party state. There
 followed a brief rule by European mercenaries, who had served as officers in the
 presidential guard, and then French troops arrived to stabilize the situation. Early
 n 1990, opposition politicians returned from exile, and a wide spectrum of political
 leaders an eight political parties contested presidential elections in two stages. The
 acting President, Said Mohamed Djohar, emerged the winner in the second round.
 Following the President's inaugration on March 20, 1991, the Djohar coalition
 Government went through a number of reorganizations and survived three coupat-
 tempts, the most recent one on September 28 involving two sons of the late resi-
 dent Abdallah. While there are several opposition groups, the main opposition to the
 Djohar coalition comes from the Udzima party, formerly the sole legal party. Post-
 poned legislative elections finally took place in November and December and re-
 sulted in a truly representative National Assembly. Although Udzima refused to
 participate, about half of the 42 seats went to parties opposed to President Djohar.
 1e      on for Democracy and Decentralization, a new, pr-Djohar party from
 Anjouan island, received the most seats, with seven, and was expectedto furnish
 the Prime Minister. Most of the 15 other victorious parties won only 1 or 2 seats
 each.
 French military advisers assisted the Djohar Government in restructuring and re-
 ducing the regular military and police forces to about 1,700 persons. In 1991 the
 security forces came under effective civilian control, and in 1992 the small profes-
 sional officer corps supportd the Government in thwarting the September coup at-
 tempt. There were no data avail able from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency on Comors' total military expenditures. While no actual reductions in mili-
 tary spending have been implemented yet, public debate to reduce all government
 salaries-both civilian and military-by 25 percent has taken place.
 Agriculture dominates the economy, but the Comoros is running out of arable
 land, and soil erosion on the steep volcanic slopes is exacerbating the problem. Reve-
 nues from the main crops-vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, andcloves-cntinue to
 fall as the population increases at one ththe fastest rates in the world. Comores
 is part of the French franc monetary zone and depends heavily on France for budg-
 etary support and technical and security assistance.
 Despite the coup attempt and the poor economic conditions, the human rights sit-
 uation improved n  1992. Following a year of little progress, 22 political parties
 signed a pact of national reconciliation in December 1991, and the Government held
 a national conference in early 1992 to draft a new constitution, which was adopted
 by a popular referendum in June. The new Constitution provides for a number of
 basic political and civil rights, including freedoms of speech, press, assembly, asso-
 ciation, and political choice. The legislative elections in November and December
 were generaly regarded as free andfair. Notwithstanding the progress, the Govern-
 
 
 58
 ment has continued to hold alleged opponents in detention rather than bring them
 to trial and has banned public demonstrations on several occasions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Fredom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no substantiated reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment in 1992. However, prison conditions can be
 unhealthful, with overcrowding and inadequate diet common. Civilians suspected of
 involvement in the September coup attempt were confined with up to 15 people per
 cell, with inadequate ventilation and broken toilets. They were forced to sleep on
 the floor and were given a diet of mostly rice, with meat twice a week. The pris-
 oners' families were not allowed to visit them, and items such as soap and medicine,
 which were given to prison authorities for the prisoners, were never passed on to
 them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution does not specify a
 time limit between arrest and appearance before a magistrate; however, according
 to usual Comorian procedure, this must occur within 48 days. There is no official
 law that allows for indefinite detention of prisoners for security reasons. Following
 the September coup attempt, the Government arrested a number of opposition lead-
 ers and soldiers, including former Minister of Interior Omar Tamou, who heads the
 Udzimaparty, and two sons of former President Abdallah, Lieutenant Abderemane
 Ahmed Abdallh and Lieutenant Cheick Ahmed Abdallah. Tamou remains in pris-
 on, along with M'Tara Maecha and four other civilians accused of involvement in
 the September coup. Military prisoners Abderemane and Cheikh Abdallah, Captain
 Combo, and at least five others remain jailed in a military prison.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1992 Constitution provides for the equality
 of all citizens before the law and the right of all accused persons to defense counsel
 The Comorian legal system applies Islamic law and an inherited French legal code.
 Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first instance.
 In regular civil and criminal cases, the judiciary is largely independent, and trials
 are public. The Supreme Court has the power to review the decisions of lower
 courts, including the Court of Appeals.
 National security cases-involving attempts to destabilize the country or over-
 throw the Government by violent means-are handled in the regular court system.
 However, in national security cases observed since 1990, suspects have never been
 brought to trial. Most have eventually been freed, but only after periods of detention
 of up to 1 year. For example, the five Supreme Court judges, who attempted to de-
 pose President Djohar in 1991, were released in December 1991 without being
 charged. Similarly, Ahmed Bacar Boina and Ali Soilihi, who spent over 7 months
 in detention in connection with the 1990 coup attempt, were also released in Decem-
 ber 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1992 Constitutionprovides for the inviolability of home and property. There were
 no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy, including with correspond-
 ence. The Paris-based Indian Ocean Newsletter and Lettre de Comores, which are
 often highly critical of the Government, arrive unhindered through the international
 mail.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, thought, and conscience, and Comorians discussed and criticized the Govern-
 ment and its leading personalities openly. A wide spectrum of political views was
 aired throughout the year. Although heightened security measures were taken for
 a short time after the coup to protect the radio station, all of the political parties,
 including Udzima, were allowed air time throughout the campaign for the legislative
 elections. The private station, Radio Tropiques, was ordered to stop broadcasting
 news on September 16, but it refused to comply and the Government did not press
 the issue.
 Comorians can receive radio broadcasts from Mayotte and two French television
 stations without interference. Satellite antennas are popular, and amateur radio li-
 censes are granted without hindrance. Several small independent newspapers are
 now published, and they operate without restrictions or interference and freely criti-
 cize the Government. The weekly semiofficial newspaper sometimes also publishes
 
 
 articles critical of some government policies. Lack of funds and illiteracy are the big-
 gest obstacles to a wide press audience. Foreign journals and newspapers are avail.
 able, as are books from abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Under the late President Abdallah, Comorians
 were circumspect about organizing public political gatherings, and political
 groupings were careful not to antagonize the Government. Since 1990, as new politi-
 cal parties formed and old ones resumed activity, there have been numerous rallies
 and assemblies with a minimum of governmental interference. However, following
 oup attempts, the Government banned public demonstrations for 1 month in Sep-
 tember 1991 and again briefly in September 1992. At the end of the year, there
 were approximately 24 politica parties.
 c. Freedom of Reigion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the principles and
 rules which guide the state and its institutions." The State upholds the right of non.
 Muslims to practice their faith, and there are churches for the small Catholic and
 Protestant populations. Christian missions work in local hospitals and schools, but
 by local custom they are not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are freely granted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens now have the right to change their government through peaceful means.
 In 1992 President Djohar dissolved his Cabinet twice, and by late September the
 Government included members of eight parties. The new Constitution, which was
 ratified by popular referendum on June 7, gives legal status to a multiparty system
 and provides for other fundamental rights. The Co  stitution called for legisative
 and gubernatorial elections to be held on July 20, but they were postponed until No.
 vember 20 due to lack of organization and resources. While there were irregularities
 in six districts where the voting had to be repeated (with the last round on Decem-
 ber 20), overal the elections were judged free and fair by international observers.
 They resulted in the election of candidates from 16 parties to the National Assem-
 bly, with no parties heeding the call for a boycott byUdzima. As the previous legis-
 lators' t   a expired in March, there was no legislature for most of 1992.
 Although the nature of Islamic society makes it more difficult for Comorian
 women to get involved in politics, they have the right to vote and participate in the
 political process. There were 11 women candidates in the legislative elections, none
 of whom was victorious. In August 1991, the first Comorian woman was appointed
 to a high gevernment position: Sittou Raghadet Mohamed was named Secretary of
 State for Population and the Condition of Women.
 Traditional social, religious, and economic institutions also importantly influence
 the countrs political le. Interisland rivalries have been a persistent and growing
 factor. Village notables and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of tuman Rights
 In May 1990, a group of private citizens established the Comorts Human Rights
 Association (CHRA-also know as the Comorian Association for the Rights of Man).
 The CHRA received praise for its report on prison conditions from the Minister of
 Justice, along with promises to change the conditions, but nothing was ever done.
 In the months since the coup attempt, the CHRA has been very outsoken in its
 condemnation of human rights abuses. The Government did not respond to Amnesty
 International's 1991 appeal that those arrested in 1990 in connection with the al-
 leged coup attempt be released or given a fair trial.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens regardless of race,
 sex, or religion. Nevertheless, within Comorian society, men have the dominant role.
 Change in the status of women is most evident in the major towns. Women are find.
 ing increasing employment opportunities in the small paid labor force and generally
 receive wages comparable to those of men in similar work. However, school enroll-
 ments for females are well below those for males. A Comorian Women's Federation,
 formed in late 1989, has the goal of developing a family bill of rights. Women are
 not required to wear a veil. Prperty rights do not disfavor women; for example,.the
 house the father of the bride         provi    t         at the time of their
 m   mtoil ge  n  b en . her nronertv, even in the case of divorce.

 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs. However, medical au-
 thorities, the Women's Federation, and the police believe that violence against
 women is rare, in part because of the nonviolent nature of Comorian society. The
 Government has not addressed this issue specifically, and there are no stu dies or
 statistics indicating the extent of the problem. In principle, a woman can seek pro-
 tection through the courts in the case of violence, but in reality the issue would
 most likely be addressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution allows workers, including most
 public sector workers, to form unions and to strike, but these rights only became
 a reality in 1990 with the association of some workers into small unions. Farming
 on small land holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily
 activity of most of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is small (less than
 9 500 with government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding government em-
 ployees). Since 1990 gups of teachers, civil servants, and dock workers-which in
 previous years formed temporary associations to press their demands--have created
 unions for purposes of collective action.
 In 1992 there again were work stoppages of teachers, hospital workers, and the
 courts. As in the previous year, there was no interference by the Government, but
 payments of salaries were delayed because of the country's financial problems.
 Unions are free to join in confederations and to associate in international bodies,
 although given the nascent state of trade union development these rights have not
 yet been exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no laws that pro-
 hibit antiunion discrimination or protect collective bargaining, which is still in its
 infancy in the Comoros. Labor legislation, to the extent that it exists is found main-
 ly in the Labor Code, which is not rigidly enforced. The Labor Code does not address
 the issue of collective bargaining. In the private sector, wages are set by informal
 employee/employer negotiations. Public workers' wages are set by government polic y
 through the Ministries of Finance and Labor. It is economic rather than political
 impediments which stand in the way of a more active role by labor organizations.
 Unofficial unemployment figures exceed 70 percent. There are no export processing
 zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is for-
 bidden by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines 15 years
 as the minimum age for the employment of children. The Ministry of Labor is lax
 about enforcing this provision but child labor is not an issue due to the lack of em-
 ployment opportunites for adolescents and young adults. Children generally help
 with the work of their families in the large subsistence farming and fishing sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a legislated minimum wage, which is
 barely adeqate to cover basic human needs. However, most workers also have ac-
 css to some subsistence agriculture or fishing and receive support from the ex-
 tended family. The hours of work in any one job rarely exceed 35 hours per week.
 The Government periodically reminds employers to respect the Labor Code, which
 guarantees a day off per week, plus a month of paid vacation per year, but does
 not set a standard workweek. Overall, there are very few standards set by the Min-
 istry of Labor. As there is virtually no manufacturing, little attention has been
 given to health and safety standards in this sector.
