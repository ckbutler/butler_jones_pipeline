 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 emirates, each of which retains extensive control over such
 vital issues as economic policy (including petroleum),
 internal security, and defense. There are no elections.
 Emirate rulers' legitimacy is grounded in longstanding tribal
 tradition. The rulers comprise a federal Supreme Council-
 which, in theory, is the UAE's highest legislative and
 executive body but which seldom meets. The Supreme Council
 selects a president and vice president from its membership.
 The president appoints a prime minister and a cabinet. A
 Federal National Council, appointed by the emirate rulers,
 offers the federal government nonbinding advice on legislation
 and reviews government operations.
 The economy is based on oil and gas production, which has made
 the UAE's per capita national income one of the world's
 highest. A small citizen population controls the country's
 economic life but depends heavily on a much larger contingent
 of foreigners to provide manual labor and vital technical
 skills. Foreigners have virtually no political role.
 Some of the individual emirates of the UAE maintain
 independent internal security organizations, which concentrate
 mainly on antiterrorist activity.
 There are no formal restrictions on citizens' rights to
 associate, pursue private interests, or hold private
 property. Women play a restricted public role, out of
 tradition rather than explicit government policy.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation
 in 1987. In the political sphere, the ruling families and
 their allies continued to play a dominant role. There was no
 discernible movement to extend the boundaries of formal
 political participation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No political disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The provisional Constitution prohibits torture or degrading
 treatment of any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an
 accused person. No instances of torture were reported. Prison
 conditions, including diet and medical facilities, are
 adequate. Prisoners are permitted visits from family members,
 friends, and lawyers. Consular access to imprisoned foreign
 nationals is permitted, although it is sometimes delayed.
 There is no evidence that the authorities allow mistreatment
 of prisoners.

 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 There were no instances of the amputation of a hand for theft
 or stoning for adultery under the system of Shari'a law, which
 is in integral part of the'judicial system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest,-Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The provisional Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention-, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law,
 and the laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without
 probable cause. -By law, the police mtit report any arrest to
 a judge within'48 hours for his determination whether to
 charge, ï¿½release, or, with sufficient police justification,
 allow limited further detention during a continfiing
 investigation. Prolonged detention without charge is rare,
 although in 1987 one UAE citizen was detained for approximately
 Smonths. Once charged, kuspects come to trial expeditiously.
 In 1987 there were no'reported instances of preventive
 deteiftion. "Foeced labor is not practiced. '. The provisional
 Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a and civil courts, which
 deal with criminal and civil cases. Each court system has a
 multilevel appeal process. Either the plaintiff or the nature
 of the case determines which court system hears a particular
 case.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent
 a defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint
 legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no
 system of state' payment of public defenders exists.
 Thete are no jury trials. All cases', except national security
 cases and those deefted-by the judge likely to upset publi6
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. There has
 been evidence in past years of rulers occasionally interfering
 in the judicial process, but there was no evidence of such
 praCtice in 1987. The court system is generally regarded as
 fair and its judgments well considered.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The provisional Constitution prohibits entry of homes without
 permission, except in accordance with the law. Although the
 police can enter homes without a warrant and without
 demonstrating probable cause in advance, an officer is
 answerable if he abuses his authority in doing so. Anyone
 other thahi a police officer must have a court order to enter a
 private home. Local custom and practice give high value to
 privacy, and violations are rare. Surveillance of private
 correspondence is not practiced. Except for rare instances
 involving 'national security, no cases of arbitrary
 interference with privacy have been reported in recent years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 UAE citizens are constitutionally assured freedom of speech.
 In practice, however, most inhabitants, especially foreign
 nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive
 political topics.

 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Although most of the local English- and Arabic-language
 newspapers are privately owned, all but one receive government
 subsidies. The press operates under a law which codifies the
 powers of censorship and media closure, and it generally
 adheres to reporting guidelines.
 These regulations, along with self-censorship by journalists,
 make official censorship rare. Local newspapers are normally
 cautious in reporting on government policy, the ruling
 families, national security, and relations with neighboring
 states. However, in 1987 two newspapers were temporarily
 closed down by government authorities. The Arabic daily,
 Al-Fajr, was closed for 2 weeks in February for publishing an
 article critical of slow progress toward federal unity. In
 the emirate of Sharijah in June, Sharjans involved in an
 attempted emirate government takeover closed the Arabic daily,
 Al-Khaleej, for 2 days.
 The Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture scrutinizes all imported newspapers, periodicals,
 films, and videos, and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam or Christianity, favorable to
 Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of
 the ruling families.
 The Ministry of Information and Culture and some emirate
 governments own radio and television stations and assure that
 programs and news reporting are in conformity with the
 standards imposed on the other media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Organized public gatherings require a government permit. In
 practice, public gatherings are rare. Political parties are
 prohibited. The citizen population normally confines its
 political discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies,*
 held in private homes, which are a local tradition.
 There is no legal provision for the right of workers to
 organize, to engage in collective bargaining, or to strike.
 Foreign workers attempting to do so almost certainly would be
 deported. For the resolution of work-related disputes,
 workers have access to conciliation committees, organized by
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and to special labor
 courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of the UAE. Non-Muslims are
 free to practice their religion but may not publicly
 proselytize or distribute religious literature.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for security areas such as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are permitted to citizens. Exit visas are not
 required. The right of return is extended to all citizens.
 There are no known instances of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons.

 UNITED ARAB-EMIRATES
 The UAE and its member emirates have long accepted groups of
 dispi%%'cdbeisons, such as Palestinians, and those attracted
 by economic opportunity, such as Iranians. Although lacking a
 formalized procedtirefof accepting refugees, thd UAE
 occasionally'grants Iranians refuge if they can demonstrate
 that they would face persecution in Iran. However, most
 Iraniafi "-Vf-lnterceted& attempting -t6enter the country
 illeally,'ar  turned back.
 Sectio 3-'.R~spect  for Political Ilights: The Right of Citizens
 to Chan e Their Government
 The UAE has-nd formal democratic institutions. Most of its
 citizens hdre little or no say ifh the choice of leaders. The
 bulk df executive tnd legislatie power is in the hands of the
 seven emiraUe rullh'r, their families,-and those individuals
 and families to whom they are allied by historical ties,
 marriage, or common interest. These emirate political leaders
 constitutR ht-i'doinant  olitical force at the national level,
 especiall' th&high their use of power in the Supreme Council
 of emirate rulers.
 The positiohb and powers of individual rulers are determined
 by traditional concepts of authority rather than -constitutional
 prescription. Although the rulers and ruling families are
 presumedI t have a right to rule, thefr incumbency ultimately
 depends- dh ee quality bf their leadership and responsiveness -
 to their subjects<fi6eds-. Emifate rulers are accessible to
 any subject who has a problem or a reques'. The choice of a
 new ruler falls to the ruling family, which is supposed to
 choose its mbst-cajiab:le and -espected'eligible member. In
 practice, to avoid violent succession disputes which were
 common in the-past,-primogeniture' has become increasingly
 common'.    -
 The political domihance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement-and influence in-economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petfo-lebm productidn, and, with important merchant
 families, haVe'a inajoi stake in the UAE's commercial life.
 With f~w ekcepti6iis,-the large foreign bommunity has no
 political role.    -
 In 1987 tief6 were few indications of movement toward more
 democratic institutions. The country's most representative
 institution, the Federal National Council, went through its
 biennial process of membership selection but did not meet.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental'Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights       "    -
 The UAE is respolive to foreign criticism of its human rights
 situation. For example, it has improved its labor laws in
 response to criticism that low-paid foreign workers were being
 mistreated. The UAE has no internal groups which monitor
 human rights. No outside human rights group visited the UAE
 in 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Conservative attitudes about women's roles and the frequency
 of early marriage still limit women's educational and
 employment opportunities. However, women's education is
 
 
 1335
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 advancing (females outscore males in many subjects at all
 levels), and opportunities for women are growing in government
 service and the news media, besides the more traditional
 fields of education and health.
 Since foreign workers can stay in the UAE only with the
 continuing approval of the Government, and would probably face
 unemployment or lower wages in their country of origin, they
 are occasionally abused or exploited by employers who take
 advantage of their reluctance to protest. The Government has
 taken steps to improve the labor law covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection of the workplace, and
 enforcement procedures.
 Legislation which would limit the marriage of UAE citizens to
 foreigners is under consideration. Although many foreigners
 have lived in the UAE for years and have held highly
 responsible positions, few have been granted citizenship.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths below 18 and
 restrict hours of work to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.
 Since the children of UAE nationals have little incentive to
 work, and only adult foreign workers are allowed in the
 country, there is virtually no child labor. There is no
 minimum wage. The Government has adopted occupational safety
 standards which are generally enforced.
