 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states, was forcibly
 annexed by the Soviet Union as a constituent republic of the
 U.S.S.R. in 1940 after having enjoyed independence between the
 two World Wars. The United States does not recognize this
 forced incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 Lithuania is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 in the Soviet Union. Moreover, Soviet policy toward the
 Lithuanian nation arouses great concern because the process of
 Sovietization and Russianization threatens its survival as a
 distinct ethnic nation.
 The non-Lithuanian segment of the population is now estimated
 at about 20 percent.  As in the other Baltic states, the
 standard of living in Lithuania is somewhat higher than the
 Soviet average. Agricultural and industrial production
 increased in 1987, but Soviet redistribution policies
 continued to force down Lithuanian living standards toward
 lower Soviet levels.
 While the situation eased somewhat during late 1986 and 1987,
 human rights violations by the authorities continued,
 particularly against human rights activists and against the
 Roman Catholic Church, which celebrated the 600th anniversary
 of Christianity in Lithuania in 1987. Although promised
 changes in the Soviet Criminal Code, which would eliminate
 some laws and regulations used to incarcerate or
 institutionalize Lithuanian human rights activists, are under
 discussion, their effect would depend on regime policy. In
 any case, several other legal tools would allow the
 authorities to repress dissidents even if the contemplated
 changes were implemented.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although in the past Lithuanian activists have died in Soviet
 custody, it is often impossible to prove official
 responsibility for the deaths of persons involved in human
 rights activities. Several Catholic priests have died in the
 past under mysterious circumstances after being warned to
 desist from human rights activities by the authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Prisoners are frequently mistreated during interrogation or
 confinement in labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted in so broad a manner
 that persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to
 
 
 964
 LITHUANIA
 exercise their basic human rights. Persons accused of
 publishing or distributing underground publications receive
 harsh sentences, including terms in prisons or labor camps,
 exile, or commitment to psychiatric hospitals. The typical
 charge is "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda."
 During 1987 the number of such arrests appeared to have
 decreased sharply, apparently in accord with Soviet Communist
 Party General Secretary Gorbachev's campaign for more
 "openness" in and "democratization" of Soviet society, which
 has improved somewhat the ability of Lithuanians to express
 their views and criticize the Government. A review of the
 Soviet criminal codes is currently under way, which might
 result in the modification of some of the "political" articles
 in the code.
 Two American-Lithuanian dual nationals were released during
 1987: Algirdas Statkevicius from a psychiatric hospital and
 Vytautas Skuodis from prison. Skuodis was subsequently
 allowed to depart for the United States. A number of other
 dissidents and human rights activists were released from
 confinement during 1987 as a result of amnesty decrees by the
 Supreme Soviet. Prominent human and religious rights activist
 Victoras Petkus, who has spent 24 years in prison camps, was
 transferred in August 1987 to exile in Buryatskaya Autonomous
 Soviet Socialist Republic at the completion of his labor camp
 term.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, the Communist party in political cases
 subverts constitutional provisions for the objectivity and
 independence of the judicial process in political cases. The
 self-determined, compelling needs of the State override the
 rights of a defendant. A few Soviet public figures spoke out
 in 1987 for strengthening the rights of defendants in Soviet
 trials, but it is as yet unclear whether or how such reforms
 will be implemented.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Through the use of informers, mail censorship, electronic
 monitoring of telephones, and other devices, government
 authorities have the ability, widely exercised, to interfere
 in every aspect of personal life. Constitutional provisions to
 the contrary, Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain
 from forced entry and illegal searches. Lithuanian Catholic
 Birute Briliute's home in Kibartay was searched on April 6 and
 again on September 8, and copies of the Lithuanian Catholic
 Chronicle were reportedly confiscated. Lithuanian Catholic
 activist Nijole Sadunaite's home was searched April 2, and
 copies of the Chronicle were confiscated. Nonetheless,
 interference with mail and telephone communications appears to
 have diminished slightly over the past year.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties as long as their exercise accords with the
 strengthening and security of the "Socialist" system. In
 practice, the authorities rarely tolerate dissident behavior
 of any kind. While Gorbachev's "glasnost" (openness) campaign
 
 
 965
 LITHUANIA
 has expanded the ability of official and unofficial writers to
 explore heretofore taboo subjects and to spotlight economic
 and social problems, these opportunities are still subject to
 controls, and their limits have not been stabilized or defined.
 No questioning of Lithuania's status as a Soviet Republic or
 the Communist Party's monopoly of power is permitted. All
 Lithuanian newspapers, magazines, journals, and books remain
 firmly under the control of the Communist Party, which
 ultimately decides what shall and shall not be published.
 Underground publications which appear regularly, despite the
 authorities' attempts to repress them, include the Chronicle
 of the Catholic Church in Lithuania, Austra (Dawn), Tautos
 Kelias (The Path of the Nation), Lietuvos Ateitis (Lithuania's
 Future), and Perspektyvos (Perspectives). The importation of
 political and religious literature from the West is strictly
 limited.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is usually interfered with
 and prevented. Nevertheless, on August 23, a large unofficial
 demonstration was held in Vilnius to bring pressure on the
 Soviet Government to renounce the signing in 1939 of the
 Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-Aggression Pact between Nazi Germany
 and the Soviet Union, which became the basis for the Soviet
 occupation and annexation of Lithuania. While the authorities
 did not openly interfere with the demonstration, they strongly
 denounced it in the press, accused Western radio stations of
 instigating it, and castigated several of the organizers.
 Some were subsequently picked up and held by the authorities
 for 24 hours and then released in the countryside. Human
 rights activist Dalia Tamutyte was fired from her job in
 November 1987 and threatened with psychiatric detention for
 her participation in the rally.
 The right of association is provided for in the Constitution,
 but the'authorities strictly control all associations and
 organizations.
 Soviet labor law and practice are enforced in Lithuania.
 Although the Constitution grants all Soviet citizens the right
 to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise this
 right independently of state-sponsored and controlled unions
 have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern that the
 ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement might
 spread, this has been especially true in Lithuania, which has
 close historical ties to Poland and the Catholic Church.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activists are
 subject to serious systematic harassment. Soviet authorities
 have apparently mounted a large-scale assault on all religious
 activities not controlled and sponsored by the State, with
 special emphasis on the work of the Lithuanian Catholic
 Church. Soviet officials reportedly have taken control of
 church committees and excluded priests from some of these
 bodies.
 Because of officially imposed limits on admissions to Kaunas
 Seminary, Lithuania's only theological seminary, over 100
 parishes are said to be without a permanently assigned
 pastor. The Government also interferes in the administration
 and admissions process of the Seminary. Qualified applicants
 for the Seminary are frequently harassed and pressured to
 
 
 966
 LITHUANIA
 serve as informants for the Committee on State Security
 (KGB). All religious orders are banned.
 Children are routinely harassed-to deter them from attending
 church services. In school the children of believers are
 sometimes forced to join atheist organizations on the threat
 of punishment. Catholics attending religious festivities have
 been interrogated and physically abused, and historic shrines
 and artifacts have been desecrated. The Vilnius Cathedral, a
 national shrine for the Lithuanian people, remains an art
 gallery, despite numerous petitions to restore it to the
 Lithuanian-Catholic Church. Another historically important
 church in Vilnius serves as a museum of atheism. Soviet
 authorities have said that a church in Klaipeda, however,
 built with official permission in the 1950's and then
 confiscated by the authorities and converted to a concert
 hall, will be returned to the local Catholic community.
 Because of the difficult conditions created by government
 reprisals and threats, the group calling itself the Lithuanian
 Catholic Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights has
 been forced to go underground. Two members of the group,
 Fathers Alfonsas Svarinkas and Sigitas Tamkevicius, who were
 convicted in 1983 of anti-Soviet agitation and'propaganda or
 disrupting public order, are still in prison, while a third,
 Jonas Matulionas, was released. A young Catholic student,
 Roman Zemaitis, who was tried and convicted with Matulionas,
 is serving 2 years in a labor camp. In November 1987, a
 petition addressed to General Secretary Gorbachev signed by
 78,000 Lithuanians and calling for the release of Lithuanian
 Catholic Bishop Julijonas Steponavicius from internal exile
 and a review of the cases of Svarinskas, Tamkeviclus, and
 Matulionas, was given to the Central Committee of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
 Despite these convictions and continuous attempts to suppress
 its activities, the Catholic Church remains active and
 vigorous. Some 15 new priests were ordained in 187, and
 approximately 140 seminarians are studying for the priesthood
 in the Kaunas Seminary. Other limited measures were taken
 which somewhat eased government pressure on the church in the
 past year, which church leaders attribute to the policies of
 Soviet leader Gorbachev. Church leaders had hoped that the
 Pope would be able to travel to Lithuania in June for the
 600th anniversary of the establishment of Catholicism in
 Lithuania, but Soviet authorities rejected his expressed wish
 to visit Catholic believers in the U.S.S.R.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Soviet authbrities do not respect the right of emigration.
 The granting-of permission to emigrate from Lithuania is
 arbitraTy and subject to tight restrictions. The authorities
 often harass Lithuanians whose desire to emigrate is known by
 denying them work in their specialty, by excluding them from
 educational institutions, and by other punitive measures.
 Nonetheless, the increase in the issuance of exit permits
 from the Soviet Union during 1987 has resulted in the
 emigration of an increased number of Lithuanian Jews, and some
 Lithuanian activists were able to depart for the West as well.

 LITHUANIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change the system of government. As
 in other areas under Soviet control, political activity
 outside the Communist Party is not tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Soviet Government in late 1986 and 1987 repeatedly
 expressed its readiness to discuss human rights issues--a
 change from previous practice--and created an Administration
 for Humanitarian and Cultural Ties in the Foreign Ministry.
 Nonetheless, the Government's attitude towards investigation
 of the human rights situation in Lithuania remained basically
 negative. The number of human rights activists known to have
 been jailed during 1987 declined, and there were no known
 cases of sentencing of such activists under "political"
 Articles 70 and 190-1 of the Russian Soviet Federated
 Socialist Republic Criminal Code. -
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. The relative homogeneity of
 Lithuania's population, its strong sense of national identity,
 and the binding force of the Lithuanian Catholic Church have
 helped to preserve many of the country's social and cultural
 traditions. Nevertheless, the disruptive effects of an
 antireligious ideology, forced collectivization, and a policy
 of industrialization have been severe. Rigid controls on
 cultural and religious expression have forced many Lithuanians
 into underground activity. Non-Lithuanians total about 20
 percent of the population.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enables women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. However, women generally hold less remunerative
 positions than men do in the same occupations.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor conditions in Lithuania are identical to those in the
 rest of the Soviet Union: The statutory minimum age for the
 employment of children in 1987 was 16, and the standard
 workweek was 40 hours. There is no indication of widespread
 violation of these norms. The minimum wage was set at $112
 per month at the official rate of exchange. According to the
 latest Soviet official data, the average wage is about $272
 per month. Sovet law establishes, in general terms, minimum
 conditions of healthy and safety. According to the Soviet
 press, the laws on maximum hours of work and health and safety
 standards are widely ignored.
