 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch who plays
 a mainly symbolic role. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the Prime Min-
 ister, holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the lower house of the bi-
 cameral Parliament. Constitutional reforms enacted in 1993 transformed Belgium
 from a unitary into a federal state with several levels of government, including na-
 tional, regional (Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels), and community (Flemish,
 Francophone, and German) levels. The judiciary is independent.
 The Government maintains effective control of all security forces. The Police
 Judiciaire and the Belgian Gendarmerie share responsibility for internal security
 with municipal police. In September the Government announced a plan to reorga-
 nize the federal and municipal police forces. The reorganization envisions an inte-
 gration of the Police Judiciare and the Gendarmerie at the federal level. At the local
 level, the plan calls for closer cooperation between federal and municipal police. The
 plan also calls for the creation of an oversight body for the federal police.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and limited
 government participation in industry. The economy supports a high standard of liv-
 ing for most citizens.
 The Government respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and the
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Prison conditions vary. Newer prisons meet international standards. Older facili-
 ties meet or strive to meet minimum international standards despite their Spartan
 physical conditions and limited resources. The Government permits visits by human
 rights monitors. In December the prison system, designed to hold 6,933 prisoners,
 had 8,231 occupants. In early 1997, the Government implemented a program of pris-
 on refurbishment and expansion designed to reduce overcrowding. The program is
 designed to improve overall conditions and expand capacity to 8,000 prison beds by
 the year 2000.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Arrested persons must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is subject to month-
 ly review by a panel of judges, which may extend pretrial detention based on estab-
 lished criteria (e.g., whether, in the court's view, the arrested person would be likely
 to commit further crimes or attempt to flee if released). Bail exists in principle
 under the law but is rarely granted. The Government no longer sees a need to sepa-
 rate convicted criminals and pretrial detainees. Pretrial detainees receive different
 benefits from convicted criminals, such as more frequent family visitation rights.
 Approximately 40 percent of the total prison population consists of pretrial detain-
 ees. Arrested persons are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their choosing or,
 if they cannot afford one, to an attorney appointed by the state.
 The Government does not use forced exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. The judicial system is organized
 according to specialization and territorial jurisdiction, with 5 territorial levels: can-
 ton (222), district (27), province (9), courts of appeal (5), and the whole Kingdom-
 the Cour de Cassation. The latter is the highest appeals court. In the wake of public
 dissatisfaction with the Government's handling of the 1996 Dutioux pedophile in-
 vestigation, Parliament enacted legislation designed to improve the functioning of
 the judiciary. This legislation included the creation of a board of attorneys-general,
 whose purpose is to oversee and streamline nationwide policy on criminal prosecu-
 tions.
 The judiciary enforces the law's provision for the right to a fair trial. When a pre-
 liminary judicial investigatory phase is completed, a suspect is formally charged if
 the evidence so warrants. Charges are clearly and formally stated, and there is a
 presumption of innocence. All defendants have the right to be present, to have coun-
 sel (at public expense if needed), to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to
 appeal.Military tribunals try military personnel for common law as well as military
 crimes. All military tribunals consist of four officers and a civilian judge. At the ap-
 pellate level the civilian judge presides. The accused has the right of appeal to a
 igher military court.
 Following its review of the judicial system, the Government implemented several
 reforms that granted stronger rights to victims of crime. These measures allow vic-
 tims to have more access to information during an investigation, as well as the right
 to appeal if an investigation does not reach a decision to bring charges. As part of
 its program of judicial reform, the Government in November opened the first in a
 series of planned "justice houses." These facilities combine a variety of legal services
 under one roof, including legal aid, mediation, and victims' assistance. The Govern-
 ment plans to open 27 justice houses in 27 judicial districts by 2001.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibitions, and vio-
 lations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Programs are supervised by boards of directors which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries and elsewhere abroad. Satellite serv-
 ices are also available.
 There are restrictions on the press regarding libel, slander, and the advocacy of
 racial or ethnic discrimination, hate, or violence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Citizens are free to form or-
 ganizations and establish ties to international bodies, but the Antiracism Law (see
 Section 5) prohibits membership in organizations that practice discrimination overt-
 ly and repeatedly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hinder the practice of any
 faith. The law accords "recognized" status to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Ju-
 daism, Anglicanism, Islam, and Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, and these religions
 receive subsidies from general government revenues. Taxpayers who object to con-
 tributing to religious subsidies have no recourse. By law, each recognized religion
 has the right to provide teachers at government expense for religious instruction in
 schools, but not all avail themselves of this right. For recognized religions, the Gov-
 ernment pays the salaries, retirement, and lodging costs of ministers and also sub-
 sidizes the renovation of church buildings.
 The Evangelical Association (a joint group of Evangelicals and Baptists) claimed
 discrimination during the year when the Government refused to consider its applica-
 tion for recognized status separate from the Protestant religion. Instead, the Gov-
 ernment offered the Evangelicals and the Baptists a joint seat in the synod of the
 already recognized Protestant religion. The Evangelicals refused the offer and plan
 to begin a new round of negotiations early in 1998. The Government successfully
 negotiated a settlement with the Union of Baptist Communities, which was granted
 
 
 993
 and accepted a seat in the synod of the Protestant religion. The lack of independent
 recognized status does not prevent religious groups from practicing freely.
 The Government established a commission to create a policy to combat the poten-
 tial dangers that sects may represent to society, especially children. In April this
 parliamentary commission issued its report, which divided sects into two broadly de-
 fined categories. It characterized a "sect" as any religious-based organization, and
 a "harmful sect" as a group that may pose a threat to society or individuals. Par-
 liament adopted the report's recommendations, including the creation of an inde-
 pendent center to observe sects. The report also recommended the creation of a spe-
 cial police unit to coordinate information exchange among law enforcement agencies
 that monitor sects, as well as the designation of special magistrates at each judicial
 district level to handle cases involving sects.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 provides first asylum, and during the first 10 months of the year, 9,753 new applica-
 tions for asylum were filed, compared to 10,079 for the same period in 1996. A total
 of 1,335 applicants, mostly from previous years, were granted permanent residence.
 Counting applications from previous years, a total of 16,154 applications remained
 pending.
 All asylum seekers can plead their cases before immigration authorities. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee/asylee
 status. Prior to March 1995, the Government had a special procedure for refugees
 from the former Yugoslavia under which 5,000 to 6,000 persons received "displaced
 person" status, while their cases were further considered. In September the Govern-
 ment offered financial incentives for travel and housing to displaced persons from
 Bosnia-Herzegovina. At that time, 4,392 displaced persons from the former Yugo-
 slavia were still residing in Belgium. In November the Government announced that
 it would grant temporary residence permits to 4,000 of the Bosnian refugees. These
 individuals may also apply for permanent resident status.
 As a result of a 1996 amendment to immigration law, asylum seekers arriving by
 air with no papers have been detained indefinitely while awaiting consideration of
 their cases. C  rs in such centers do not attend school. In September the Govern-
 ment imposed an 8-month limit on these detentions. If no asylum decision has been
 reached by the end of the 8-month period, then the asylum seeker is released or
 voluntarily repatriated. At the discretion of the Minister of Interior, the Cabinet
 may exempt certain cities, which have already accepted large refugee populations,
 from giving legal residence to new refugees/asylees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political'Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully.
 Citizens the age of 18 and older exercise this right in practice through periodic, free,
 and fair elections held on the basis of universal and compulsory (under penalty of
 fine) suffrage. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some Sen-
 ators elected by community councils and others elected by Senate members) are held
 at least every 4 years. Opposition parties operate freely.
 Belgium has failed to comply with a European Council directive requiring member
 states to accord to all citizens of European Union countries resident in another-EU
 country the right to vote in municipal elections. Because of Belgium's failure to meet
 the 1996 compliance deadline, the Europea   n Co isn has referred the case to
 the European Court of Justice.
 The Federal Government is responsible for such matters of state as security, jus-
 tice, social security, and fiscal and monetary policy. The regional governments are
 charged with matters that directly affect the geographical regions and the material
 well-eming of their residents, such as commerce and trade, public works, and envi-
 ronmentai policy. The linguistic community councils handle matters more directly
 affecting the mental and cultural well-being of the individual, such as education and
 administration of certain social welfare programs.
 Women hold some high-level positions in the Government. Two of 15 federal min-
 isters are women. In the Federal Parliament, 19 of 150 House members and 18 of
 71 Senators are women. The law requires that 33 percent of the candidates on the
 ballot in all future elections be women.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant omplexities for the State. Moat major institutions, including political
 
 
 994
 parties, are divided along linguistic lines. National decisions often take into account
 the specific needs of each regional and linguistic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on the listed factors, and the Government
 enforces it. With Dutch, French, and German as official languages, Belgium has a
 complex linguistic regime, including language requirements for various elective and
 appointive positions.
 Women.-The law prohibits the physical abuse of women, and the Government en-
 forces this ban. The law also prohibits organizing prostitution or assisting immigra-
 tion for purposes of prostitution. In November Parliament passed a law that defines
 and criminalizes domestic violence. The legislation protects married as well as un-
 married partners and also requires the government to maintain statistics concerning
 domestic violence. The intention is to make it easier to report, prosecute, and keep
 statistics on crimes involving domestic violence. Currently neither the Government
 nor NGO's dealing with women's issues have any accurate statistics on the problem,
 which the parliamentary report accompanying the bill termed still "covered by a cul-
 ture of silence."
 The Government actively promotes a comprehensive approach to the integration
 of women at all levels of decisionmaking. The Division of Equal Opportunity, a part
 of the Ministry of Labor, focuses specifically on issues affecting women, including
 violence against women, sexual harassment, and the participation of women in the
 political process. A telephone hot line for female victims of violence was shut down
 during the year; calls a ut violence are now directed toward French and Flemish
 general help lines.
 Children.-Belgium has comprehensive child protection laws, which the Govern-
 ment seeks to enforce. The Francophone and Flemish communities have agencies
 dealing with children's needs. Government and private groups provide shelters for
 runaways and counseling for children who have been physically or sexually abused.
 The Government provides compulsory education up to the age of 18.
 In 1995 the Government enacted laws designed to combat child pornography by
 increasing penalties for such crimes and for those in possession of pedophilic mate-
 rials. The law permits prosecution of Belgians who commit such crimes abroad. An-
 other 1995 law provides that criminals convicted of the sexual abuse of children can-
 not receive parole without first receiving specialized .assistance and must continue
 counseling and treatment upon their release from prison.
 Belgium is both a transit point and destination for trafficking in women and chil-
 dren. In the first half of 1997, 120 children from 37 different countries were traf-
 ficked in the country, the largest number from Romania (21).
 In 1996 the authorities uncovered a pedophile/child pornography and trafficking
 ring. The criminal investigation of this ring continued through 1997. Five suspects
 remained in detention; however, their trial was unlikely to begin before mid-1998.
 A parliamentary commission continued to investigate allegations of corruption and
 complicity in the law enforcement and judicial system. By December no judicial or
 police officers had been imprisoned or sanctioned for collusion related to the
 pedophile case.
 In response to the public outcry over the handling of the pedophile case, the Gov-
 ernment established a center for missing and exploited children. The Prime Minister
 appointed the center's president and board of directors in May, and the center
 opened in December.
 Children have the right to a voice in court cases that affect them, such as divorce
 proceedings. The law states that a minor "capable of understanding" can request
 permission to be heard by a judge, or a judge can request an interview with a child.
 Child prostitution is of limited scope, but, in response to recommendations made in
 a 1994 government study, police have received instructions to be especially diligent
 in combating prostitution among those who appear to be under the age of 18.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law provides for protection from discrimination
 against disabled persons in employment, education, and in the provision of other
 state services. The Government mandates that public buildings erected since 1970
 be accessible to the disabled and offers subsidies to induce the owners of other
 
 
 995
 buildings to make necessary modifications. Many older buildings, however, are not
 accessible.
 The government provides financial assistance for the disabled. It offers special aid
 for parents of disabled children and for disabled parents. Regional and community
 programs provide other assistance, such as job training. Disabled persons are eligi-
 ble to receive services in any of the three regions (Flanders, Wallonia, or Brussels),
 not st their region of residence.
 Nlational/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of citizens are native Dutch speakers; about 40 percent
 are French speakers; and fewer than 1 percent are German speakers.
 An Antiracism Law penalizes the incitement of discrimination, hate, or violence
 based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. It is illegal for providers of goods or services
 (including housing) to discriminate on the basis of any of these factors and for em-
 ployers to consider these factors in their decisions to hire, train, or dismiss people.
 The Center for Equal Opportunity and the Fight Against Racism, a parliamentary
 organization tasked with investigating complaints of discrimination based on race,
 handled 2,068 calls asking for information in 1996. Of these calls, 1,086 were to
 make actual complaints, leading to mediation or court action in 762 cases. In the
 first 8 months of 1997, the Center handled approximately 1,100 calls, 800 of which
 were actual complaints.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution, workers have the right to
 associate freely. This includes freedom to organize and join unions of their own
 choosing. The Government does not hamper such activities, and workers in fact fully
 and freely exercise their right of association. About 60 percent of workers are mem-
 bers of labor unions. This number includes employed and unemployed workers.
 Unions are independent of the Government but have important links with major po-
 litical p arties. Since the Government does not require unions to register, there are
 no prohibitions against antiunion actions before registration.
 Unions have the right to strike, and strikes by civil servants and workers in "es-
 sential" services are tolerated. Despite government irritation over wildcat strikes by
 air traffic controllers, no strikers were prosecuted. A number of significant labor
 strikes and work stoppages took place during the year. (Ministry of Labor statistics
 show that 37 strikes tok place in 1996, involving 13,788 workers; no figures were
 available for 1997.) Even though many strikes begin as wildcat actions, strikers are
 not prosecuted for conducting illegal strikes.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in its "Annual
 Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights 1997" noted a 1996 practice of using
 civil court rulings to end strikes. The ICFTU report stated that the rulings include
 a threat of fines against strikers. After noting that these rulings had been made
 without giving a hearingto the unions, the IFTU report concluded that such rul-
 ings call into question the free exercise of the right to strike. The report acknowl-
 edged government efforts to solve this problem. It als noted that there was a de-
 crease in the number of such court rulings. This development is a result of labor-
 management talks in 1996, which brokered an informal agreement to minimize
 court rulings in exchange for less secondary boycott activity by the unions.
 Unions are free to form or join federations or onfederations and are free to affili-
 ate with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized, protected, and exercised freely. Every other year
 the 7felgian Employers Federation and unions negotiate a nationwide collective bar-
 aining ageement, covering 2.4 million private sector workers, that establishes the
 rmeworkfor ngotiations at plants and branches. In 1996 the nationwide collec-
 tive bargaining talks failed, but talks at the branch level in 1997 resulted in numer-
 ous agreements covering 1.5 million private sector workers. Public sector workers
 also negotiate collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements
 apply equally to union and nonunion members, and over 90 percent of workers are
 thus coverdunder collective bargaining agreements. As part of the Government's
 global economic reform plan, wage increases in both private and public sectors re-
 main suspended. However, the suspension did not affect Belgium's wage indexation
 policy, which permits an across-the-board wage increase to keep workers' pay level
 with inflation.
 The law prohibits discrimination against organizers and members of unions and
 protects against the termination of contracts of membrs of workers' councils, mem-
 bers of health or safety committees, and shop stewards. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 
 
 Effective mechanisms such as the labor courts exist for adjudicating disputes be-
 tween labor and management.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding by children, is illegal and does not occur. Domestic workers and all other
 workers have the same rights as nondomestic workers. The law prohibits forced and
 bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. The
 Government also enforces laws against those who seek to employ undocumented for-
 eign workers.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children is 15, but schooling is compulsory until the
 age of 18. The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this
 prohibition effectively. Youths between the ages of 15 and 18 may participate in
 p art-time work/study programs and may work full time during school vacations. The
 labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national laws and standards. There
 are no industries where any significant child labor exists.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In August the monthly national minimum
 wage rate for workers over 21 years of age was set at $1,214 (44,538 BF); 18-year-
 olds must be paid at least 82 percent of the minimum, 19-year-olds 88 percent, and
 20-year-olds 94 percent. The minimum wage rate, coupled with extensive social ben-
 efits, provides workers with a standard of living appropriate to a highly developed
 nation. Minimum wages in the private sector are set in biennial, nationwide collec-
 tive bargaining meetings(see Section 6.b.), which lead to formal agreements signed
 in the National Labor Council and made mandatory by royal decree for the entire
 private sector. In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined in negotiations
 between the Government and the public service unions. The Ministry of Labor effec-
 tively enforces the law regarding minimum wages. By law, the standard workweek
 cannot exceed 40 hours and must have at least one 24-hour rest period. Many collec-
 tive bargaining agreements set standard workweeks of 36 to 39 hours. The law re-
 qires overtime pay for hours worked in excess of the standard. Work done from
 t   9th to the 11th hour per day or from the 40th to the 50th hour per week is
 considered allowable overtime. Longer workdays are permitted only if agreed upon
 in a collective bargaining agreement. These laws and regulations are enforced effec-
 tively by the Ministry of Labor and the labor courts.
 Comprehensive provisions for worker safety are mandated by law. Collective bar-
 gaining agreements can supplement these laws. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from situations that endanger their safety or health without jeopardy to
 their continued employment, and the law protects workers who file complaints about
 such situations. The Labor Ministry implements health and safety legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualify for disability
 and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in compa-
 nies with more than 50 employees. Labor courts effectively monitor compliance with
 national health and safety laws and standards.
 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 The 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina
 (the Dayton Accords), signed after 3 years of war, provided for the continuity of
 Bosnia-Herzegovina, originally one of the constituent republics of Yugoslavia, as a
 single state, Bosnia and~erzegovina. The Agreement also provided for two constitu-
 ent entities within the state: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federa-
 tion) and the Republika Srpska (RS). The Federation, which incorporates the areas
 with a Bosniak (Muslim) and Croat majority, occupies 51 per cent of the territory;
 the RS, populated mostly by Bosnian Serbs, occupies 49 per cent. The Dayton Ac-
 cords established a constitution for Bosnia and Herzegovina that includes a central
 government with a bicameral legislature, a three-member presidency comprised of
 a representative of each major ethnic group, a council of ministers, a constitutional
 court, and a central bank. The Accord also provided for a High Representative
 (OHR) to oversee implementation of its civilian provisions. Defense remains under
 the control of the respective entities. In 1997 the three members of the joint presi-
 dency agreed on legislation establishing a number of key common institutions, in-
 cluding laws on the central bank, the budget, and customs. The main political par-
 ties continue to exercise significant political power at all levels. These were the
 Party of Democratic Action (SDA) in predominantly Bosniak areas, the Serb Demo-
 cratic Party (SDS) in the RS, and the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina (HDZ) in Croat areas. Although the judiciary if formally independent
 
 
 in all entities, it remains subject to influence by ruling political parties and by the
 executive branches of government.
 Municipal elections, originally slated to take place concurrently with the 1996 na-
 tional and provincial elections, were postponed until September 1997 because of
 widespread fraud in registering Serb voters. There were few reports of political har-
 assment or violence during the 1997 campaign period compared with the
 preelectoral period in 1996. During the voter registration period, the Organization
 for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) enforced sanctions against parties
 that attempted to register voters fraudulently. Despite threats of a boycott by the
 Croat and Serb nationalist parties, elections took place on September 13 and 14,
 and well over 70 percent of the population took part. Most of those voting cast their
 ballots for municipalities where they had lived prior to the war. For this reason,
 election results proved difficult to implement in some areas, as majority groups at-
 tempted to prevent minority representatives from assuming their municipal govern-
 ment seats.
 One of the two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established in March 1994 and transformed the inter-
 nal structure of the Bosnian territories under Bosniak and Croat control. It is a
 mixed system with a president and a parliament that must approve the president's
 choice of prime minister. Federation structures have been implemented only gradu-
 ally. Major steps were the creation of provincial structures in the form of cantons,
 the unification of Sarajevo under Federation control, and September 1996 elections
 to a Federation parliament. The obstacles to establishing a new, unified city admin-
 istration in the ethnically bifurcated city of Mostar illustrate the difficulty of meld-
 ing Bosniak and Croat institutions.
 The Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the other entity. Its adminis-
 trative and politica. system is split, with Banja Luka as the seat of the RS presi-
 dent, and a powerful group around former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic located in
 Pale near Sarajevo. A president and two vice presidents are directly elected for 4-
 year terms. The legislative branch, the National Assembly, is elected on the basis
 of proportional   representation. The   dominant   political  party, the  SDS,
 headquartered in Pae, however, exercised real control. Until the summer, the party
 ensured conformity among local authorities in many areas of the RS and used its
 authority to ensure adherence to nationalistic positions.
 In September 1996, then-acting RS President Biljana Plavsic was elected Presi-
 dent for a full term. However, former RS President Radovan Karadzic continued to
 wield important influence behind the scenes. Starting in June, Plavsic publicly criti-
 cized SDS leaders for corruption, and when she attempted to dissolve the RS assem-
 bly and call new elections for October, the SDS leadership contested her authority
 to do so in the RS Constitutional Court. Under heavy political ressure and physical
 intimidation-including the severe beating of one judge by Bosnian thugs at the
 instigation of Serb political leaders-the Court ruled against Plavsic, despite her
 constitutional authority to dissolve the assembly. The decision did not end the politi-
 cal controversy and lacked legitimacy, since the justices were intimidated. In Sep-
 tember RS President Plavsic and Serb member of the Bosnian Presidency Krajisnik
 agreed to hold early elections for the RS Assembly. The elections were held on No-
 vember 22 and 23. Due to intense OSCE efforts, voting to ill the 83-seat assembly
 was carried out with few difficulties, and voter turnout was approximately 70 er-
 cent. The hard-line nationalist Serb parties lost their parliamentary majority. Sub-
 sequently, a Government strongly supportive of the Dayton Accords, led by a mem-
 ber of the Independent Social Democratic Party, was formed with the votes of mod-
 erate Serb parties as well as Bosniak and Croat representatives.
 The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Annex 4 of the Dayton Accords)
 made the Federation and the RS responsible for maintaining civilian law enforce-
 ment agencies that operate in accordance with internationally recognized standards.
 Under the auspices of the International Police Task Force (IPTF) established by the
 United Nations (U.N.) pursuant to Annex 11 of the Dayton Accords, police in beth
 entities is undergoing restructuring and training on proper police procedure and
 human rights. This process is expected to be completed by mid-1998. Law enforce-
 ment bodies of beth entities have on many occasions violated international stand-
 ards, giving preferential treatment on the basis of political, ethnic, and religious cri-
 teria. Another problem was the existence of special or secret police in all three eth-
 nic areas, a throwback to the Communist heritage. These forces are not in the nor-
 mal police chain of command but respond directly to the senior political leadership.
 In addition to locally recruited police forces, each entity also maintains an army. Po-
 lice throughout the country committed human rights abuses.
 The Stabilization Force (SFOR) led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
 continued its mission to implement the military aspects of the Dayton Accords and
 
 
 998
 create a more secure environment for implementation of the nonmilitary aspects of
 the settlement, such as civilian reconstruction, the return of refugees and displaced
 persons, elections, and freedom of movement of the civilian population.
 Since the Dayton Accords, signs of economic revival are evident, particularly in
 the Federation. In BiH real gross domestic product (GDP) almost doubled since
 1995, and GDP growth in 1997 was expected to be 30 percent. Unemployment
 dropped from 90 to 50 percent, and wages more than quadrupled in the Federation,
 up to $145 (260 DM) per month. Bosnia-Herzegovina remains heavily dependent on
 international reconstruction assistance, and the anticipated return of refugees from
 abroad is expected to compound the problem of creating sufficient jobs. International
 assistance, which is conditioned upon compliance with the Dayton Accords, financed
 the physical construction of infrastructure and provided loans to the manufacturing
 sector. An August donors conference garnered $1.4 billion in pledges for Bosnian re-
 construction.
 The commitment to respect citizens' human rights and civil liberties remains ten-
 uous in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the degree of respect for these rights contin-
 ues to vary among areas with Bosniak, Bosnian Croat, and Bosnian Serb majorities.
 In many areas the reduction in interethnic abuses and discrimination owed less to
 reconciliation than to the groups' continuing separation.
 Human rights abuses by the police declined in 1997, but serious problems persist.
 Police continued to commit abuses throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Police and mobs
 that appeared organized by local authorities committed a few extrajudicial killings.
 For example, West Mostar police shot and killed a retreating Bosniak man; a
 Bosniak man was killed when mobs in Jace, with police complicity, burned 4 houses
 and expelled more than 435 Bosniak returnees; and a group of displaced Bosniak
 women beat a returning Serb refugee to death in Visoko and held violent dem-
 onstrations protesting Serb returns. In two incidents in the Travnik area, ethnic
 Croat returnees were murdered by unknown assailants, and Croats in the area sub-
 sequently complained about insufficient police efforts to find the perpetrators and
 about the lack of security.
 Members of the security forces abused and physically mistreated citizens. They
 also continued to use arbitrary arrest and detention, although to a lesser extent
 than during the previous year. Criminal procedure legislation held over since the
 Yugoslav period granted police wide latitude to detain suspects for long periods of
 time before filing formal charges. Police often exceeded even the broad powers
 granted them by law-those illegally detained included two Serb men released in
 Augut who had been registered by the Red Cross as missing since September 1995
 and war criminals" in Una-Sana Canton whose arrest was not authorized by the
 ICTY. Prison conditions continued to be poor.
 IPTF and SFOR supervision of police produced a number of improvements, such
 as the dismantlement of virtually all fixed police checkpoints, which greatly en-
 hanced freedom of movement. In August the SFOR announced that it would begin
 inspecting and monitoring special police units in both the Federation and the RS
 under military provisions of the Dayton Accords. These units are composed of
 former state security police officers that are outside the regular chain of command
 and have close ties to hard-line nationalist parties.
 The judiciary in all entities remained subject to coercive influence by dominant
 political parties and by the executive. In many areas, close ties exist between courts
 of law and the ruling parties, and those judges who show independence are subject
 to intimidation by the authorities. For example, a judge on the RS Constitutional
 Court was severely beaten by thugs prior to a major politically related case. Even
 when independent decisions are rendered, local authorities often refuse to carry
 them out. Authorities in all areas infringed on citizens' right to privacy and home.
 Although authorities imposed some limits on freedom of assembly and association,
 there was marked improvement compared with 1996, especially during the election
 campaigns. Authorities and dominant political parties in their respective areas of
 Bosnia-Herzegovina exerted influence over the media, and freedom of speech and
 the press was limited to varying degrees in the different entities. Political influence
 was particularly egregious in parts of the RS broadcast media, which strongly
 backed the Pale-based SDS party leaders at the expense of RS President Biljana
 Plavsic. The RS media also made inflammatory statements against the SFOR and
 the ICTY actions directed at persons indicted for war crimes. This led the SFOR
 in October to take control of a number of broadcasting facilities in the RS. In con-
 trast, in the western RS, there was notable development of an independent media.
 International donors are attempting to expand the broadcasting range of the Open
 Broadcast Network (OBN) in an effort to promote more objective reporting in the
 RS. Academic freedom was constrained.

 Severe ethnic discrimination continues, particularly in the treatment of refugees.
 Expulsions of minorities who had remained in place throughout the war generally
 have ended, with the significant exception of the harassed Bosniak community in
 the RS town of Teslic. More often, local authorities and organized mobs violently
 resisted the return of minority refugees. RS and Bosnian Croat authorities encour-
 aged their own people to remain or move to areas where their group was in the ma-
 jority, rather than stay in or return to their homes. Inadequate property and am-
 nesty laws further impeded returns, few of which involved minorities. Some restric-
 tions on freedom of movement and the destruction of houses continued. Religious
 discrimination and economic discrimination remained problems. Mob violence was
 also a problem.
 Most wartime atrocities remained unpunished. The SFOR's July 10 arrest of one
 suspected war criminal and killing of another in self-defense, both of whom were
 on a list of sealed indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the
 Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), triggered a hail of inflammatory statements in the RS-
 dominated media and over a dozen attacks against international representatives.
 Ten Croats indicted for war crimes surrendered to the ICTY In October following
 massive international pressure on Croatia, and in December SFOR troops seized
 two more Bosnian war crimes suspects.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one report of a political
 killing by police. On February 10, approximately 750 Bosnian Croats confronted 500
 Bosniaks visiting a graveyard in West Mostar on a Muslim religious holiday. At the
 edge of the cemetery the group of Bosniaks was stopped by plainclothes and uni-
 formed Bosnian Croat police officers who began to beat members of the group. When
 the group retreated, a number of police opened fire at the crowd, killing 1 person
 and injuring 19 others. The Croat police were led by the West Mostar chief of police,
 who was in plainclothes at the time. A United Nations (U.N.) IPTF investigation
 identified five police officers who were involved in the incident. The higher court in
 Mostar handed down suspended sentences for three officers and acquitted two men.
 The Human Rights Ombudsperson for Bosnia-Herzegovina issued a special report
 in April that faulted local authorities for failing to conduct an impartial investiga-
 tion and a fair judicial proceeding.
 In the period of August 1 to 3, Croat authorities orchestrated mob protests
 against Bosniaks who recently returned to several villages in the municipality of
 Jajce. In addition to the burning of four houses, one Bosniak was found murdered
 inside a house. In view of police complicity in the events, the IPTF conducted the
 investigation into the arson and the death, and recommended dismissal of the chief
 of police and his deputy as well as disciplinary action against eight other officers.
 The local authorities implemented these recommendations, although the deputy was
 transferred to a non-supervisory post for one year rather than dismissed. II'F is
 also investigating other similar incidents.
 Mob violence continued to be a problem. For example, a group of Bosniak civilians
 beat a Serb man who was visiting a cemetery in Visoko on March 1. The man died
 of his injuries 5 days later. The case against those responsible is proceeding slowly
 in the courts.
 Extensive killings and other brutal acts committed in earlier years remained
 unpunished. These acts include the 7,000 persons missing and presumed killed by
 the Bosnian Serb army after the fall of Srebrenica, and another 1,500 to 5,000 miss-
 ing and presumed killed as a result of "ethnic cleansing" in northern Bosnia.
 The ICTY indicted 78 individuals on charges of war crimes and genocide in con-
 nection with these and other occurrences. In view of the failure of appropriate au-
 thorities to surrender the indicted persons to the ICTY, the Tribunal began to issue
 issued a limited number of "sealed" (unpublished) indictments. SFOR troops ar-
 rested some of those on the list of sealed indictments in 1997. On July 10, British
 troops in Prijedor arrested Milan Kovacevic and killed Simo Drljaca in self-defense
 when he resisted arrest. Hard-line RS media bitterly denounced the arrest and
 death and endorsed violent action against representatives of the international com-
 munity. Unknown assailants attacked the facilities of the SFOR troops and inter-
 national organizations stationed in the RS in over a dozen incidents. By the end of
 1997 only 19 of those accused by the ICTY were in custody, and 2 persons had been
 convicted.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically-motivated disappearances
 in 1997, and investigations into some earlier disappearances make progress, despite
 delays.
 
 
 1000
 Several sites have been excavated and hundreds of bodies found, but many per-
 sons from Srebrenica and Zepa are still missing.
 In addition to those killed in Srebrenica and Zepa, the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported in July that it received tracing requests from fam-
 ily members on 19,380 persons missing from the war years; 1,133 of these persons
 were accounted for. The ICRC noted that Serb, Croat, and Bosniak authorities
 should be able to provide more information in response to its inquiries, particularly
 those concerning 432 persons who are known to have been detained at one time in
 connection with the war and who are still missing. The ICRC also called for
 stepped-up exhumation efforts, although it acknowledged that in many cases this
 complex process would not lead to positive identification.
 Former Senator Robert Dole took over the chairmanship of an international com-
 mission on missing persons established by the International Committee of the Red
 Cross.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the right to freeiom from torture and cruel or inhu-
 man treatment or punishment. No reliable reports emerged that any of those in au-
 thority in Bosnia and Herzegovina employed torture as an instrument of state. How-
 ever, in all areas of the country, authorities, police, and prison officials were respon-
 sible for numerous instances of physical mistreatment at the time of arrest and ur-
 ing detention. In some areas, the growing number of complaints in part reflect citi-
 zens' increased access to international human rights groups and growing confidence
 that allegations of abuse would not trigger retribution against the complainants.
 However, frequent reports of excessive force used in some places suggests local au-
 thorities tolerate such abuses. According to a number of reports, police beat drivers
 dragged from their cars and beat detainees during questioning.
 The International Police Task Force made significant progress in its efforts to re-
 structure and professionalize the police. By the end of December the IPTF has cer-
 tified police in eight of the ten Federation cantons, six of which had integrated their
 police forces to reflect the prewar ethnic composition of the area. Human Dignity
 and basic skills training was well underway in these cantons. In the RS, police re-
 structuring had begun in Banja Luka, Trebinja, Doboj, Mrkonjic Grad, and Prijedor,
 and was scheduled to be completed throughout the entity by May 1998. Brcko de-
 ployed a certified and ethnically integrated police force in December 1997.
 Serb police often employed excessive force to prevent Bosniak former residents
 from returning to, or staying in, territory designated as RS territory in the Dayton
 Accords. Local Serb police apparently took no action against the perpetrators of se-
 vere incidents involving harassment. Similar patterns of abuse occurred in Croat-
 majority areas.
 As mentioned above, Bosnian Croat police used excessive force against a crowd
 of Bosniaks visiting a West Mostar graveyard on February 10, resulting in the death
 of one Bosniak man (see Section L.a.). A June IPTF investigation of the Sarajevo
 canton police force looked into 29 allegations of police abuse and use of excessive
 force in 5 police stations in the period from January 1 to June 15. The investigation
 substantiated seven cases of abuse, and recommended disciplinary action against
 the officers involved. Of the cases in which excessive force was alleged, 3 were un-
 true, and the remaining 20 allegations were not confirmed due to lack of evidence
 or serious injury. The Sarajevo police force took disciplinary measures against sev-
 eral of the offiers
 Human Rights Watch (HRW) has documented a pattern of severe police abuses
 by SDA-contrlled local police in Velika Kladusa and Cazin, although the frequency
 of such acts has greatly diminished since 1996 as a result of intense monitoring and
 intervention by international human rights organizations. The HRW identified most
 of those abused as persons formerly associated with Fikret Abdic, who led a break-
 away Bosniak region during the war. The IPTF investigated a number of reported
 cases of police abuse in Briko and Banja Luka, in the RS, as well as in Drvar, in
 cases~~~a weplie s i  r
 a Croat-majority region of the Federation. The officers found responsible for these
 abuses were either dismissed from the force or fined.
 In 1997 police were provided with human dignity and basic skills training. To-
 ward the end of the year, such training began in the RS as well. In addition, the
 IPTF is working with local police to develop their own internal controls and capacity
 to conduct their own investigations of police abuse. Until recently, RS police gen-
 erally had failed to cooperate with international monitors, particularly on police re-
 structuring. For example, they refused to give the IPTF the names of officers on po-
 lice rolls. After the internal dispute between competing factions in the RS broke out
 in the summer, police in the western RS took a much more cooperative attitude and
 by year's end, both the Banja Luka and Pale leaderships formally had committed
 to begin the police restructuring process. This process began in the Banja Luka
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 1001
 area. In Brcko RS police initially refused to issue identification cards to returning
 Bosniaks and improperly issued cards to nonresident Serbs in an effort to distort
 electoral results. H6wever, in October the Brcko police began to restructure their
 organization in cooperation with the IPTF.
 Conditions in Federation and RS prisbns are poor and well below minimum inter-
 national standards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were fewer cases of arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention in both the Federation and the RS compared with 1996. In both
 entities, police enjoy great latitude based on Communist-era criminal procedure
 laws that permit the police to detain persons up to 6 months without bringing for-
 mal charges against them. In the Federation, these laws are currently being revised,
 with the aim of eliminating this practice.
 Of major concern were reports of prisoners held before the Dayton Accords came
 into effect who have not been registered and whose locations are unknown to mon-
 itors. In several other instances, authorities have detained members of ethnic nii-
 norities in the hope of exchanging these prisoners for members of their own ethnic
 group who are detained elsewhere in Bosnia. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Human
 Rights Chamber reported that in a particularly egregious and well-known case,
 Tomislav Matanovic, a Croat priest from Prijedor, and his parents disappeared after
 they were arrested in the RS in September 1995. Their whereabouts remain un-
 known, although in 1996, RS authorities acknowledged their detention and ex-
 pressed interest in swapping them for Serb prisoners. On August 4, two Serb men
 who had been registered by the ICRC as missing since September 1995 were freed
 from an isolated section in the Zenica military prison.
 Una-Sana authorities are currently holding approximately 10 individuals in the
 Luka prison near Bihac on charges of war crimes. Their arrests and detentions were
 done without ICTY approval, in violation of the February 1996 agreement signed
 in Rome by the parties to the Dayton Accords (a Serb prisoner, Milorad Marceta,
 was released on August 12). Some detainees were beaten severely before their im-
 prisonment.
 There were no reports that forced exile was practiced as a juridical device. How-
 ever, police often failed to provide protection to individuals being mistreated by ele-
 ments of the population, with the same end in mind. In the RS there were continu-
 ing attempts to expel families, notably in Teslic, where Serb thugs and members of
 the civil protection unit from nearby villages intimidated or attempted to evict most-
 ly Bosnink families. Land confiscations were also reported.
 In the Federation, on February 10 approximately 30 Bosniak families were forc-
 ibly removed from their homes in West Mostar, after the cemetery confrontation
 that occurred earlier in the day (see Section l.a.). Most of those families later re-
 turned to their homes, after the international community exerted heavy pressure on
 local authorities. Pressure on Bosniaks to emigrate through land expropriation and
 denial of employment also occurred in Tomislavgrad.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, extends the judiciary's independence to the investigative division of the crimi-
 nal justice system, and establishes a judicial police force that reports directly to the
 courts. However, Yugoslav and wartime practices in which the executive and the
 leading political parties- exerted considerable influence over the judicial system per-
 sisted in all areas. Party affiliation and political connections weighed heavily in the
 appointment of rosecutors and judges. In particular, Bosnian nongovernmental or-
 ganizations (NGO's) expressed concern over the judicial selection process in eight
 Federation cantons, especially in Sarajevo and Tuzla. Bosnian legal experts argued
 that the laws on judicial selection in those two cantons are inconsistent with the
 canton and Federation Constitutions.
 The existing judicial hierarchy in the Federation is based on municipal courts,
 which have original jurisdiction in most civil and criminal cases, and cantonal
 courts, which have appellate jurisdiction over the canton's municipalities, as well as
 three federal courts (constitutional, supreme, and human rights). The Constitution
 provides for the appointment of judges who serve until the age of 70 and for internal
 administration of the judicial branch.
 The Constitution provides for open and public trials, and the accused has the
 right to legal counsel. In April an RS municipal court in the town of Zvornik found
 seven Bosniaks guilty of murdering four Serb civilians in May 1996 and of possess-
 ing illegal weapons. International organizations found the court's proceedings deeply
 flawed and called on the court to retry the case in accordance with fair trial stand-
 ards. Human rights groups pointed to the lack of evidence, torture of the defend-
 ants, and the refusal to allow effective representation by lawyers chosen by the de-
 fendants. Three of the defendants were sentenced to 21 years each for murder; the
 other four men were given 1-year sentences for illegal possession of firearms, then
 
 
 1002
 freed because they had served 11 months in jail awaiting trial. The Human Rights
 Ombudsperson for Bosnia-Herzegovina is reviewing this case.
 On August 15, the RS Constitutional Court ruled that RS President Plavsic ex-
 ceeded her authority in dissolving the RS assembly, despite clear constitutional pro-
 visions to the contrary. The Court's decision was clearly made under duress--
 Bosnian Serb thugs severely beat one of the judges in advance of the ruling.
 Human rights organizations reported that judicial institutions in both entities
 were controlled or influenced by the ruling parties. As a result, they were often nei-
 ther able nor willing to try cases of human rights abuse referred to them. Lack of
 resources and a backlog of unresolved cases provided a convenient and credible ex-
 cuse for judicial inaction. Even when the courts rendered a fair judgment, local offi-
 cials often refused to implement their decisions.
 Except for the alleged war crimes cases in Una-Sana Canton (see Section 1.d.),
 there were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides for the right to "private and family
 life, home and correspondence" and the right to protection of roperty. These rights
 were generally better observed in the Federation than the RB. Neither entityhas
 acted to bring property law into conformity with international norms. Implementa-
 tion of the laws that do exist was often guided by considerations of ethnic or politi-
 cal advantage.
 In most places the authorities continued to use their control over "socially-owned
 and privately-owned housing occupied by displaced persons or other nonowners to
 slow down or block altogether minority returns. While the main problem is the large
 number of displaced persons in relation to available housing stock, all three ethnic
 groups have used the control of housing as a major instrument for political influ-
 ence-peddling and enrichment.
 Reports continued of persons who either had returned to their homes or had never
 left who found their residences occupied after short absences, as permitted under
 Federation and RS law. In Serb- and Croat-controlled areas, authorities appear to
 have incited crowds to violence against minority returnees. In Bosniak areas as
 well, radical elements of the SDA exerted growing influence over certain groups of
 displaced persons, inciting them to acts of violence against returning Serbs. In addi-
 tion, as in the case of Jajce (see Section l.a.), there were a number of cases in which
 returnees were subsequently forced to leave their homes under threat, although in
 some cases external intervention succeeded in returning those evicted to their
 homes. In the Bosniak-majority Travnik area, Croat returnees were shot to death
 in their homes in two incidents--one in August and one in November. A joint inves-
 tigation by Croat and Bosniak police and -PTF was underway at yes end. The
 Bosniak leadership condemned the acts.
 Because few minorities dared to return to the RS, the most frequent cases of in-
 timidation against returnees occurred in Bosnian Croat-controlled regions. In addi-
 tion to the violence in Jajce, in early May Bosnian Croats burned 25 houses belong-
 ing to former Bosnian Serb residents in a village outside the western Bosnia town
 of Drvar. The organized attack, which occurred shortly after Federation mediators
 held discussions with the Drvar mayor on possible Bosnian Serb returns, was clear-
 ly intended to prevent such returns. Weeks before the arson incidents, the Drvar
 mayor incited Croats against returning Serbs on Drvar radio, and Bosnian Croat of-
 ficials appear at least to have acquiesced in the attacks, which took place over 2
 days. Other homes had been burned near Drvar in previous months. The IPTF in-
 vestigated and concluded that the chief of the criminal department and the leader
 of anti-terrorism and homicide were directly involved in the incidents. On rec-
 ommendation of the IPTF, both were relieved of duty on June 3, 1997. Organized
 mobs also repeatedly have obstructed the return of Bosniaks to Stolac, now Croat-
 controlled, through the use of violence and intimidation. On August 16, three poten-
 tial returnees, including two children, were assaulted during an assessment visit.
 The investigation of this attack is proceeding slowly.
 Evictions of those who remained in their homes throughout the war decreased
 dramatically, in large part because so many minorities had already been forced to
 relocate to areas where their group was in the majority. However, in some areas
 minorities continued to face intense pressure to move. In the RS town of Teslic,
 Bosnian Serb thugs threatened Bosniak families, burning haystacks and burglariz-
 ing homes in a campaign that appeared to be backed by local authorities. Similar
 pressure was felt by Bosniaks in Croat-controlled areas, e.g. Jajce, Stolac,
 Tomislavgrad, and Livno, by Serbs in Bosniak-controlled areas (Drvar), and by
 Croats in some Bosniac areas, e.g., Bugojno.
 In the RS, displaced persons generally were placed in dwellings alongside the pri-
 mary occupants, when the original occupants had more than 15 square meters per
 
 
 1003
 
 erson. These unwanted "roommates" were often Serbs inserted into Bosniak or
 roat households. In a few reported cases, the dwelling's owner was harassed into
 vacating his bedroom for a shed in the backyard or abandoning his property alto-
 gether.
 There were frequent and growing reports in the RS of threats against displaced
 persons, particularly those concentrated in collective centers, who spoke with rep-
 resentatives of international organizations about the possibility of returning to their
 homes in the Federation. Noncompliant displaced persons were threatened with a
 cutoff in humanitarian assistance, permanent exile from the RS, or worse, should
 they break solidarity with the Serb hard-liners on the issue of return. The work of
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNICR), in particular, was
 affected by such tactics, with persons previously anxious to return home subse-
 quently intimidated into silence.
 Throughout the country, membership in the leading party was often necessary to
 obtain, retain or regain employment, especially in the management of state enter-
 prises.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. This right was partially respected in the Federation and in the west-
 ern Republika Srpska, but less so in the eastern RS. Within the Federation, press
 freedom is more severely restricted in Croat-majority areas. Some progress has been
 made in establishing independent media in the-Federation (though only in Bosniak-
 majority areas) and in.the Republika Srpska, particularly in Banja Luka. Party-con-
 trolled media-particularly Croatian State Radio and Television-are the only elec-
 tronic media available to the vast majority of citizens in Croat-majority areas of the
 Federation.
 Some opposition and independent newspapers o rate in the Muslim-majority
 areas of the Federation and in the Republika Srpsra, principally in Banja Luka.
 Oslobodjenje and Vecernje Novine are the leading independent dailies and Dani
 and Slobodna Bosna the most influential independent magazines in the Federation.
 Dani and Slobodna Bosna are the most influential independent magazines in the
 Federation. One of the few independent magazines in the RS is Reporter, a first-
 rate weekly published by a former foreign correspondent of the independent weekly
 Vreme. Also in the RS, the Social-Liberal Party publishes an opposition magazine,
 Novi Prelom, and the Social Democratic Party publishes a daily paper. Both of these
 publications take an opposition line, and are consistently supportive of the Dayton
 Accords.
 It is difficult for independent and opposition media in the RS to gain access to
 the kiosk distribution-system. The same is true of some areas of the Federation. Dis-
 tribution is particularly problematic in Croat-controlled regions. In Sarajevo, how-
 ever, independent print media access to distribution systems is readily available.
 Some independent media in the twa entities, for example, Dani and Reporter, assist
 in the distribution of each others' publications in their respective entities.
 The dominant nationalist political parties continue to exercise strong control over
 the most influential media, i.e., television and radio. Federation state television
 (TVBiH) faithfully serves the interests of the SDA. TVBiH gives preferential cov-
 erage to SDA leaders and greatly limits reports on the opposition. Its broadcasts are
 often biased, but rarely of an inflammatory nationalist nature. Croat politicians in
 the Federation have complained about TVBiH coverage and argued against the
 Muslim ethnic homogeneity of its staff. However, TVBiH does employ journalists
 from minority ethnic groups, though their numbers are small and their influence in-
 consequential.
 Croat-controlled areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina are covered by Croatian state tele-
 vision HTV. Its news programs and editorials frequently criticize the Dayton Ac-
 cords. HTV weather maps show the Federation as part of Croatia, and coverage of
 Bosnian events often leaves the impression that the-scene pictured was actually in
 Croatia. The HTV station in Mostar refused to issue an OSCE-mandated apolog
 for inaccurate and inflammatory broadcasting, resulting in the resignation of the
 editor (in an attempt to avoid more radical measures by the Office of the High Rep-
 resentative).
 Until the SFOR acted on an OHR request to end offensive broadcasts by RS gov-
 ernment-run Serb Radio-Television (SRT), SRT followed the SDS line, with fre-
 quently inaccurate and inflammatory reporting. SRT sought to undercut the Dayton
 Accords by covering events in the Federatio n  the "international" portion of the
 news. After the SFOR actions in Prijedor against persons indicted for war crimes,
 the SET broadcasts endorsed violent actions against representatives of the inter-
 national community. The SRT backed off only when the SFOR and the OHR threat-
 
 
 1004
 ened retaliatory actions. Following RS President Plavsic's break with the Pale lead-
 ership, the SRT affiliate in Banja Luka began to broadcast its own programming,
 giving a favorable slant to Plavsic's activities. The High Representative has devel-
 oped a plan for restructuring the SRT. In the interim, only the SRT station in Banja
 Luka is authorized to continue broadcasting.
 Radio broadcasting in the Muslim-majority areas of the Federation-particularly
 in Sarajevo, Zenica, and Tuzia-is diverse, and opposition viewpoints are reflected
 in the news programs of independent broadcasters. Independent or opposition radio
 stations broadcast in the Republika Srpska-particularly in Banja Luka-but they
 tend to skirt most significant politica issues for fear of retaliation by the SDS.
 Nezavisni Radio and Nesavisna Televizija (NTV) report a wide variety of political
 opinions. Local radio stations broadcast in Croat-majority areas, but they are usu-
 ally highly nationalistic. Opposition viewpoints are not tolerated.
 The television Open Broadcast Network-with affiliates in Sarajevo, Mostar,
 Zenica, and Tuzla and a correspondents' bureau in Baija Luka-reports independ-
 ent news and public affairs programming under the sponsorship of the international
 donor community. The Network has been plagued by poor management at its Sara-
 jevo hub and problems with affiliate relations. The OBN fares extremely poorly in
 the competition for viewers with party-controlled media in the two entities. The
 quality of the network's programming is below local standards. In August the OBN
 launched a major effort to expand its broadcast range and improve programming
 quality. The Banja Luka OBNbureau has facilities to broadcast network programs
 but not to broadcast programs directly in the way affiliates in the Federation do.
 There are plans to convert the OBN affiliate in Banja Luka (ATV) into a full-fledged
 OBN affiliate. There is no Bosnian Croat participation in the OBN.
 Foreign journalists representing recognized media were able to travel freely to
 most areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnian journalists from the Federation
 were able to travel to the Republila Srpska only under the escort of accredited dip-
 lomatic personnel. Journalists from the Republika Srpska travel to the Federation
 only under the same conditions, although there have een no incidents of abuse of
 Republika Srpska journalists in the Federation. Federation journalists have been
 beaten and verbally harassed in the ES. Bosniak journalists were harassed in West
 Mostar on several occasions. International journalists also have been harassed on
 several occasions in the S.
 Academic freedom was constrained. In the Federation, Serbs and Groats com-
 plained that SDA    art  members receive special treatment in appointments and
 promotions. Officials of the "Gultural Community of Herceg Bosna" ensure that
 Greats dominate the University of (West) Mostar.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Gonstitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly; however, there were some limits imposed on this
 right in practice. In the lead-up to the September municipal elections, opposition po-
 litical parties enjoyed greater atitude in staging rallies and campaigning than they
 had during the 1996 national elections.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, while this right is
 not directly limited, indirect pressure constrains its exercise. A wide range of social,
 cultural, and political organizations functioned without interference. Although politi-
 cal membership is not forced, membership in the ruling SDA and HDZ parties in
 Federation territory was viewed as a way to obtain and keep housing and high-level
 jobs in the state-owned sector of the economy.
 In the RS, SDS-controlled security and police demonstrated a clear attitude of in-
 tolerance toward opposition parties. Few opposition parties exist in Croat-majority
 areas, and in the Bihac area, former Abdic supporters continue to be harassed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing private and public worship, and in the Federation the authorities rarely inter-
 fered. In general, individuals in their ethnic majority areas, who constitute the reat
 majority of the population, enjoyed unfettered freedom of religion. However, there
 were some incidents that resulted in damage to religious edifices and cemeteries
 (see Section 5).
 In the RS, authorities repeatedly rejected efforts by minorities to visit religious
 sites and graveyards in their previous areas of residence, and international rep-
 resentatives had to negotiate on a case-by-case basis with authorities for the few
 such visits that did take place. In February Bosnian Croat police fired at retreating
 Muslims visiting a graveyard in West Mostar (see Section L.a.).
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for "the right to liberty of movement and res-
 idence." Freedom of movement-including across the inter-entity boundary line
 (IEBL)-improved significantly, although many people continue to fear crossing that
 line. Under prodding from the SFOR and the IPTF, fixed police checkpoints-par-
 
 
 1005
 ticularly those in the RS-were virtually dismantled, although some RS authorities
 continued to impede traffic by demanding unauthorized "visas" and transit fees. The
 UNHCR-funded IEBL bus lines begun in 1996 were expanded into new areas. The
 total number of passengers grew dramatically to nearly 2/2 million by August. The
 bus lines have been instrumental in encouraging minority return, allowing displaced.
 persons a secure opportunity to assess conditions at their places of origin. IEBL bus
 lines in many cases forced hard-line communities to deal with the fact of a minority
 presence. Even in such places as Stolac, Drvar and Prijedor, daily visits became a
 reality.
 For minorities in the Federation, freedom of movement remained restricted, but
 to a far lesser degree than in 1996.
 By midyear, some 52,000 refugees had returned to Bosnia and Herzegovina from
 their places of refuge abroad. Through May an additional 19,000 internally-dis-
 placed persons were estimated to have returned to their homes of origin. Of those
 returning from other countries, only a small number went to regions where they
 would be in the minority. The total number of returns fell far short of UNHCR ex-
 pectations.
 Returns from    Europe   further complicated  the  situation  within  Bosnia-
 Herzegovina, as most of such returnees were unable to return to their homes of ori-
 gin in the RS. They thus became internally displaced-and, through a combination
 of tightening regulations, limited accommodation, and political interests, ended up
 massed in a few areas. Chief among these is the Una-Sana Canton which, like Cro-
 atia, is openly soliciting those returning from Europe to take up residence there, a
 short distance from their original homes in the RS. The overcrowding of such places
 creates the potential for social tension and also provides a mass of persons who
 could be manipulated to agitate for return to the Serb republic.
 The pace of spontaneous returns by displaced persons increased somewhat in the
 late summer months, particularly in the wake of the UNHCR "open cities" initia-
 tive. Under this initiative, the UNHCR evaluates towns and cities using a set of cri-
 teria (including, inter alia, access to housing, freedom of movement, and police pro-
 tection) to determine 'whether the municipalities have dropped the barriers to return
 by displaced persons and refugees. More significant returns were impeded by a vari-
 ety of factors. Chief among these is the continuing use of the "law on abandoned
 apartments," which effectively deprives prewar owner/occupants of the right to re-
 turn to their homes by declaring such property to have been abandoned. Claims to
 such "socially-owned" property increased during 1997, but few reached positive reso-
 lution through the municipal court systen. Even decisions issued by the Commis-
 sion for Real Property Claims by Displaced Persons and Refugees relied on political
 will at the local level to issue and enforce eviction orders and to provide security
 for returnees. Another problem was the failure by both entities to pass amnesty
 laws that would stimulate the return process.
 The patterns of return and obstruction suggest that most problems do not origi-
 nate at the local level. While the RS intention to remain ethnically distinct and to
 bar repatriation of Serbs to non-Serb areas is clear, the highest levels of the Croat
 leadership also appear to be manipulating events in a similar direction. Accordingly,
 the Croat-majority areas between Stolac and Drvar remain opposed to more than
 the most token returns, and Croatian newspaper ads recruit settlers for areas in
 Bosnia-Herzegovina that are now under Croat control and ethnically "pure." In
 central Bosnia as well, a general policy of obstructing return has been in effect,
 along with a policy of recruiting Croat minorities to relocate to "Croat" areas. In
 Bosniak areas, policies on property negatively affected the possibility of return, par-
 ticularly in Sarajevo, where there-is paralysis in the settlement of property claims
 by intending returnees. -
 Official and popular attitudes toward minority returns are reflected in the rate
 at which they occurred in the various areas. Through mid ear 78 percent of all mi-
 nority returns were to Bosniak-controlled areas of the Federation, 19 percent to
 Croat-controlled areas of the Federation, and 3 percent to the RS.
 On the positive side, although high-level political figures continue to promote eth-
 nic separatism, popular attitudes are far more favorable toward reintegration and
 acceptance of prewar neighbors. Displaced persons other than former neighbors re-
 main a problematic social factor, however, and have often been used as the pretext
 for acts of intimidation and harassment against minorities. Authorities have manip-
 ulated displaced persons for this purpose.
 The Government grants asylum and refugee status in accordance with inter-
 national standards. It cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organi-
 zations in assisting refugees. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise
 in 1997. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a place where they
 feared persecution.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dayton Accords commit the parties to "ensure that conditions exist for the
 organization of free and fair elections, in particular a politically neutral environ-
 ment," and to ensure the right to "vote in secret without fear or intimidation." These
 rights were respected imperfectly in the national, entity, and Federation cantonal
 elections of September 1996. The three dominant nationalist parties harassed their
 rivals and impeded their campaigns. The coordinator for international monitoring
 oncluded that the elections nevertheless provided "a firnst and cautious step toward
 the democratic functioning of the governing structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
 Municipal elections were originally scheduled to take place at the same time as
 the 1996 national and provincial elections. However, logistical and political difficul-
 ties, including massive manipulation of Serb voter registration, resulted in their
 postponement until September 1997. The OSCE registered 2.5 million voters and
 approximately 20,000 candidates who ran in 136 municipalities.
 International supervision of the registration process disclosed irregularities and
 fraudulent attempts to register voters in certain areas: Banja Luka, Prijedor,
 Gradiska, Kotor Varos, Srpski Drvar, Srpski Kljuc/Ribnik, Brcko, Zepce, Jace,
 Stolac, and Capljina. Where fraud claims were substantiated, the OSCE reregistered
 voters and enforced sanctions that included striking candidates from party lists and
 removing members of local election commissions.
 There were few reports of politically motivated harassment or violence compared
 with the pre-electoral period in 1996.
 Croat and Serb nationalist parties threatened to boycott the process, but elections
 took p lace on September 13 and 14, and well over 70 percent of the population took
 part. Voters had a choice of voting in the municipality where they currently resided
 or in their prewar municipality, and if the y could show substantial ties to that mu-
 nicipality, in a p lace of future residence. Most of those voting cast their ballot for
 municipalities where they had lived prior to 1991.
 In certain areas, election results are proving difficult to implement, as majority
 groups attempt to prevent minority representatives from assuming their municipal
 government seats, and as opposition or minority parties block final certification for
 political purposes. Election results demonstrated that nationalist parties still re-
 main strong in beth entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but opposition parties made
 important gains in the western RS and parts of the Federation.
 RS assembly elections were called following President Plavsic's decision to dis-
 solve the assembly. On November 22 and 23 these elections were held under OSCE
 supervision. Voter turnout was approximately 70 percent. The Serb nationalist par-
 ties lost their parliamentary majority. The Pale hard-liners' SDS won 24 seats, the
 Bosniaks' Coalition for an Undivided Bosnia-Herzegovina (led by the SDA) 18, the
 Serb Radical Party and President Plavsic's SNS 15 each, the RS branch of
 Milosevic's Socialist Party 9, the Independent Social Democrats 2, and the Bosnian
 Social Democratic Party 2 seats as well. A government strongly supportive of the
 Dayton Accords, led by Milorad Dodik, a member of the Independent Social Demo-
 cratic Party, was elected on January 18 with the votes of moderate Serb parties and
 Bosniak and Croat representatives.
 Although Bosnian citizens have the right to change their government, ruling party
 control of the media and securit apparatus precluded full citizen participation with-
 out intimidation, especially in Bosnian Croat areas and parts of the RS. The SDS
 was intolerant of opposition political activity, and after tensions emerged between
 the SDS leadership in Pale and President Plavsic in Banja Luka, Pale-controlled
 media severely constrained her access to live and unedited broadcast time. To a
 lesser degree, the SDA also inhibited political expression in Bosniak areas. There
 was intimidation of non-ethnic based minority parties by the SDA and HDZ outside
 of Sarajevo in the Federation.
 Women are generally underrepresented in government and politics, although a
 few women, such as the President of the Republika Srska entity, occupy prominent
 positions. In the three legislatures, women are seriously underrepresented. Only two
 women were elected to the RS assembly in the November elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In general, the authorities permitted outside investi ations of alleged human
 rights violations. International and local NGO'S involved in human rights appear
 to operate fairly freely, with few reports of intimidation or harassment. The OHR
 reports that human rights monitors, both those associated with foreign governments
 and NGO's, were able to travel without restriction in all areas of the countr. The
 ECMM, the OSCE, and the IPTF were given widespread and for the most part
 
 
 1007
 unhindered access to detention facilities and prisoners in the RS as well as in the
 Federation.
 While monitors enjoyed relative freedom to investigate human rights abuses, they
 were less successful in persuading the authorities in all regions to respond to their
 recommendations, especially in cases in which the authorities were involved. Mon-
 itors' interventions often met with delays or outright refusal. For example, protests
 by the OHR and the Ombudsperson failed to obtain due process for the Zvornik
 Seven" (see Section i.e.) or to obtain the release of Tomislav Matanovic and his par-
 ents (see Section 1.d.).
 Cooperation with the ICTY in the Hague is a key factor in the implementation
 of the Dayton Accords, and the establishment of respect for human rights. The RS
 continued its policy of defiance of the Tribunal and the Dayton Accords by refusing
 to arrest and surrender persons suspected of war crimes, and by allowing former
 President Radovan Karadzic to retain important behind-the-scenes political influ-
 ence. Following massive international pressure ten Bosnian Croat indictees turned
 themselves in for surrender to the International War Crime Tribunal.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 In the Dayton Accords the parties agreed to reject discrimination on such grounds
 as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social
 origin, or association with a national minority. There were nevertheless many cases
 of discrimination.
 Women.-There is little legal or social discrimination against women, and women
 hold a few of the most responsible positions in society, including judges, doctors, and
 professors. A woman heads Bosnia radio and television. In general, however, male-
 dominated societies remain in all of the entities, with few women in positions of real
 economic power. Women are entitled to 12 months' maternity leave and are required
 to work no more than 4 hours per day until a child is 3 years old. A woman with
 underage children may not be forced to do shift work.
 Accurate Statistics on violence against women, spouse abuse, rape etc. are not
 available. Anecdotal evidence is of limited use, since reporting patterns vary widely.
 Compared to the war years, when violence against women was frequent and occa-
 sionally used as a weapon of war, the situation has improved dramatically.
 Throughout the country, rape or violent abuse are again considered criminal of-
 fenses. However, domestic violence is not usually reported to the authorities.
 Children.-The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is incorporated by ref-
 erence in the Dayton Accords and has the effect of law in both entities. The end
 of the fighting has brought a major improvement in the human rights of children.
 During the war nearly 17,000 children were killed, 35,000 wounded, and over 1,800
 permanently disabled.
 The domination by ethnic majorities adversely affects the children of minorities,
 who must attend schools in which the educational content is skewed toward the val-
 ues, history, and religious traditions of the local majority. Children also suffer from
 the extreme paucity of social services, especially the lack of adequate care for men-
 tally retarded children.
 There is no discrimination or societal pattern of abuse against children. Nonethe-
 less, they continue to suffer disproportionately from the societal stress being experi-
 enced in postwar Bosnia.
 People With Disabilities.-By law the Federation Government is required to assist
 people with disabilities in finding employment and protecting them against discrimi-
 nation. In the current situation there are few jobs available, and thousands of newly
 disabled victims entered the job market after the war. The Government has limited
 resources to address the special needs of the disabled. There are no legal provisions
 mandating that buildings be made accessible for the physically challenged.
 Religious Minorities.-Several Roman Catholic churches were vandalized or dam-
 aged by explosives in February, apparently in retaliation for the attack against
 Muslims in a West Mostar graveyard in which Bosnian Croat police participated
 (see Section l.a.). Another was bombed in Sarajevo in October. None of the mosques
 in the RS destroyed during the war have been rebuilt or repaired.
 During his April visit to Sarajevo, the Pope stressed the importance of reconcili-
 ation among religious and ethnic groups. About 45,000 Croat Catholics traveled to
 Sarajevo for the visit, despite some Bosnian Serbs' threats to block passage across
 RS territory or to charge transit fees. In advance of the Pope's arrival, Federation
 police found explosive devices placed along the route from the airport.
 In Herzegovina, Muslims felt pressure not to practice their religion in public. Sev-
 eral incidents of vandalism occurred against Muslim religious objects in general, as
 well as two attacks on the Tomislavgrad mosque.
 
 
 1008
 Throughout the country, religious minorities felt pressure by the ethnic/religious
 majority. On the positive side, after 2 days of talks in Vienna in early June, the
 country's main rehious leaders created an Interfaith Council composed of the four
 religious communities: Muslim, Serbian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Jewish. The
 agreement contained specific short-term and long-term objectives, including encour-
 aging freedom of movement, facilitating the return of refugees, and investigating
 human rights violations. The OSCE and the OHR facilitated many interfaith meet-
 ings at the local level as well.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic differences-based on religious dif-
 ferences-were at the heart of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After family ties,
 ethnic identity remains the most powerful social force in the country. Some leaders
 of both the SDS and HDZ parties have expressed support for the concepts of a
 "Greater Serbia" and a "Greater Croatia", even after having agreed in the Dayton
 Accords framework to abandon them. These parties, and to a lesser extent the pri-
 marily Bosniak SDA as well, have sought to manipulate the movement of people
 and the access to housing and social services they control to ensure that the ethnic
 groups with which they are associated consolidate their position in their respective
 geographic regions.
 In certain areas, such as Sarajevo and Tuzla, mixed communities exist peacefully,
 but frequent instances of harassment and discrimination against minorities con-
 tinue throughout the country. There include desecration of graves, damage to houses
 of worship, tossing of grenades into residential areas, harassment, threats, and as-
 saults.
 Incidents of ethnic discrimination often center on property disputes. An RS law
 on abandoned property permits the return of such property to the original owner
 only if any subsequent occupant willingly departs. This is unlikely given the lack
 of adequate alternative dwellings. In a number of areas, local authorities refused
 to accept returning ethnic minorities until members of their own group had been
 permitted to return to their homes outside the region, in effect blocking the return
 of refugees to all of the areas involved. Bosnian Serb and Croat political leaders dis-
 couraged displaced persons within their groups from returning to areas where they
 would be in the minority, and encouraged people to migrate to areas where they
 would be in the majority. In contrast, Bosniak authorities appear tacitly to support
 some resettlement efforts in "strategic" areas of the Federation, including by per-
 sons new to those areas.
 In some cases, opponents of refugee returns employed violence, including sporadic
 house burnings an d orchest rated demonstrations. In July a group of women dis-
 p laced from Srebrenica attacked a Serb visiting a grave in the Visoko area and beat
 imto death (see Section l.a.); on August la crowd of about 50 to 100 women
 mobbed the municipal building in the Sarajevo suburb of Vogosca, terrorizing a
 small group of Serbs visiting to discuss their return. Both the Serbs and Bosniak
 officials had to be evacuated under heavy police protection. The latter incident, like
 the house burnings, appeared to be orchestrated by extremist political elements.
 In Bosnian Croat areas, the homes of intending returnees were burned in Drvar
 and Jajce; one Bosniak man was found dead after the violence in Jajce(see Section
 l.a.).
 According to Federation ombudsmen, human rights violations based on ethnic ori-
 gin, which occurred early in the year, were faciitated by the continued existence
 of two ethnically pure police forces. By year's end, 6 of the 10 Federation cantons
 had integrated their police force with officers from the various ethnic groups and
 were conducting multiethnic patrols (ther re currently insufficient nubers of po-
 lice of some ethnic groups in some cantons, but their slots in the forces are being
 left open until police of the appropriate ethnic group can be recruited to ifill them).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Federation Constitution provides for the right
 of workers to form and join labor unions. The largest union is the Confederation of
 Independent Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heir of the old Yugoslav
 Communist Trade Union Confederation. Unions have the right to strike, but there
 were few strikes during the year because of the economic devastation and jobless-
 ness caused by the war throughout much of the Federation.
 More than 5,000 coal miners from Breza, Kakanj, Zenica, and Bila went on strike
 briefly in early August to demand mo arprompt payments by local power stations
 for delivered coal.
 Unions may affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and BarGain Collectively.-The practice of collective bar-
 gaining in labor-management negotiations was used only in a limited way in 1997.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 1009
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits ser-
 vitude or forced labor, including that performed by children, and despite rumors
 that work camps exist in isolated areas, investigations have not turned up any cor-
 roborating evidence. There were no credible reports of child labor in either entity.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children in the Federation was 16 years. Children
 sometimes assisted their families with farm work and odd jobs. The Government
 does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices
 are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage is $60 (100 DM)
 and the minimum pension is $46 (80 DM) per month. In principle this wage level
 is ensured, but it often is not rached in reality because the economy is only begin-
 ning to recover from the war. Many workers still have claims outstandin  or sala-
 ries earned during the war b ut are being paid in full only for current work. Simi-
 larly, many pensioners have outstanding claims.
 Occupational safety and health regulations were generally ignored because of the
 demands and constraints imposed by an economy devastatedby war.
