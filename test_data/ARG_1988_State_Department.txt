 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal, constitutional democracy with a
 president elected through an electoral college for a single
 6-year term, a bicameral legislature, and an independent
 ,udiciary. Traditionally, the executive is the dominant
 ranch in the Argentine Government. Since the end of military
 ule in 1983, there have been three national elections.
 'hrough most of 1988, the nation directed its political focus
 owards preparations for the 1989 presidential and
 .ongressional elections. Fair and hard-fought party primaries
 droduced three main presidential contenders, representing a
 I,)ad political spectrum from conservative to center-left.
 iL President is constitutional Commander-in-Chief and a
 Aivilian Defense Minister oversees the armed forces. The
 federal police report to the Interior Minister; provincial
 police are organized under provincial constitutions and report
 to locally elected provincial governors.
 Argentina has some serious economic problems. By some
 estimates, real purchasing power has dropped by as much as 40
 percent since 1983 and annual inflation has averaged well over
 100 percent during the past 3 years. Argentina has been
 unable to make payments on its more than $55 billion foreign
 debt without fresh infusions of external capital several times
 a year. The state-owned enterprises are generally
 inprofitable, foreign investment is weak, and capital flight
 Ss a problem. The economy continued to deteriorate in 1988,
 bit monthly inflation was reduced to 6 percent in November.
 ivilian-military relations dominated the human rights agenda
 for most of the year. In January, army Lt. Col. Aldo Rico,
 with many of the same officers .ho participated in the Easter
 week uprising of 1987, led a mutiny against the army high
 command. The mutiny was suppressed by forces loyal to
 President Raul Alfonsin, and most of its participants were
 arrested and at year's end awaited trial in Villa Devoto
 military prison. All of their cases remain in the lengthy
 judicial investigative stage, In December 1988, demands for
 changes in the army hierarchy, higher pay, and general amnesty
 for past human rights abuses led to another army mutiny.
 Forces associated with Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin seized army
 installations in the Buenos Aires area. Col. Seineldin
 returned from Panama to lead the rebellion, but the
 insurrection collapsed after 4 days. This mutiny resulted in
 4 deaths and more than 30 injuries. Col. Seineldin was under
 military detention at year's end. The fate of his other
 supporters remains unclear. The Government stated it did not
 agree to any conditions to end the rebellion.
 The Supreme Court dismissed charges for past abuses against
 all but 19 retired generals and admirals pursuant to the 1987
 'due obedience" law rescinding legal responsibility of
 officers who did not have independent command. Civilian and
 military courts convicted participants in an attempted
 takeover of the Buenos Aires domestic airport during the
 January mutiny. Six retired senior officers were tried in
 civilian court for negligence and incompetence in the 1982
 South Atlantic war.
 Human rights concerns in 1988 focused more on accounting for
 past abuses during military rule than on policies of the
 current civilian Government. Congress passed an important
 antidiscrimination law in August. Politically motivated
 
 
 439
 ARGENTINA
 bombings continued through 1988 at a disturbing, but not
 destabilizing, rate. In general, the Government continued its
 good record for protecting human rights during 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no credible reports of political killings carried
 out by the Government in 1988. Human rights organizations,
 political groups, and the press criticized police for several
 deaths 'which appeared to involve excessive use of force in
 dealing with criminal suspects. The Center for Legal and
 Social Studies twice issued public declarations condemning
 provincial police forces for specific unjustifiable killings.
 Critics charge that police routinely shoot to kill.
 Politically motivated bombings continued. Most were small
 explosions late at night, causing little damage or injuries,
 but there was a major upsurge of incidents in the Buenos Aires
 area in late March-early April. Targets through the year
 included national political parties, military, church, press,
 judicial officials, political figures of the extreme right and
 left, and public buildings. At least two people were killed
 in the bombings. Federal police arrested some suspects during
 the year, principally from the rightwing "Alerta Nacional"
 organization, but did not solve most of the incidents. The
 perpetrators never formally claimed responsibility for the
 bombings. In December, a bombing at the headquarters of
 Argentina's Communist Party caused major structural damage to
 the building and minor injuries to four persons working
 inside. No one claimed responsibility, but Communist party
 officials blamed rightwing paramilitary forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 disappearances linked to or condoned by the Government during
 1988. There were kidnapings for criminal extortion, some
 allegedly involving active duty police officers. The
 Government made progress in breaking up one kidnap gang
 involving the National Police and two involving the provincial
 police of Buenos Aires. Evidence before the courts suggests
 the accused police officers operated for economic gain and
 without political motives.
 The "Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo" human rights
 organization reported that 45 children whose parents
 disappeared during military rule (1976-1983) have been
 identified since 1984 (an increase of 6 over the previous
 year). Twenty-one were returned to their families, 12 remain
 with adoptive parents, 5 were determined to have died, and 7
 custody cases are before the courts. In August and September,
 a federal court rendered a controversial decision when it
 determined that Juliana Trevino, the child of two parents who
 disappeared in 1977, should remain with her adoptive parents
 rather than her blood relatives.. The case provoked intense
 public interest, and several Argentine human rights
 organizations have promised to appeal the judicial decision.
 In a related development, the Argentine Government continued
 to press the Government of Paraguay for the return of 4
 
 
 440
 ARGENTINA
 children tentatively identified as offspring of Argentines who
 disappeared during military rule, and cooperated with the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) efforts to
 investigate the cases in Argentina and Paraguay. The cases
 are pending Paraguayan court decisions on Argentine requests
 for return of the children and extradition of the persons who
 claim to be their natural or adoptive parents to face
 kidnaping charges.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. The criminal code
 provides penalties for torture which are similar to those for
 homicide. Argentina has ratified the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment. Human rights groups and critics accuse police of
 mistreatment of prisoners. Surviving family members charge
 that detainees died in police custody under suspicious
 circumstances in two instances: the Massone case in Rosario
 (in March) and the Viteleo case in Cordoba (in May). The
 accused police officers were suspended from active duty
 pending investigation of the charges. Investigations of
 claims of mistreatment are handled by the Undersecretariat of
 Interior for Human Rights and through judicial review. The
 number of formal claims of physical mistreatment filed in 1988
 was small, totaling fewer than 20 before the Interior Ministry.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed legal code containing explicit
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. Arrests require probable cause or a
 judicial order, and the law provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. However, the
 penal code gives the courts authority to detain individuals
 without notice or charges for up to 8 days during
 investigations. Even in the case of minor offenses, holding
 suspects without charges for several days is not uncommon.
 Involuntary exile is not permitted or practiced.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Argentina's judicial system is widely recognized as fair and
 independent, albeit slow and cumbersome. The Constitution and
 penal code provide for trials before judges and appellate
 review of all judicial rulings, including those of military
 courts. Federal courts interpret constitutional protection
 against "arbitrary" trial process to permit wide-ranging
 review of criminal prosecutions. As in most civil law
 countries, trial by jury does not exist; judges render
 verdicts.
 The police have legal authority to adjudicate misdemeanors,
 which are often settled by senior police officials. A reform
 pending before Congress would create small claims courts for
 cases which involve small fines. The legal system provides
 public defenders, but 1988 caseloads exceeded their capacity.
 The right to bail is provided by law and observed in practice.
 At the beginning of 1988, human rights organizations claimed
 there were 6 political prisoners incarcerated in Argentina,
 down from 12 at the start of 1987. The Government asserts
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 that these prisoners were convicted for violent crimes prior
 to the 1976 military coup, by constitutionally sanctioned
 courts whose verdicts could not be summarily overturned by the
 executive branch. Human rights groups charge that the
 prisoners were convicted under proceedings lacking in minimum
 due process, and the prisoners claim they confessed under
 torture or duress and were denied an adequate defense. Two
 prisoners were released in 1988 by applying a 1984 law which
 counts 1 year in prison since 1976 as 2 years served. Using
 the same formula, the remaining four should be released from
 prison by the end of 1989. The Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission (IAHRC) reviewed the case of one prisoner who had
 already been released and found deficiencies in the judicial
 process by which he had been convicted.
 The homicide and kidnaping convictions and life sentence for
 Argentina's best known political terrorist, Montonero leader
 Mario Firmenich, were upheld on appeal in 1988. He has asked
 for review by the IAHRC.
 In the course of the year, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled
 in a series of split decisions on the applicability of the
 "due obedience" law to all current and former military
 personnel accused of human rights abuses during military
 rule. Under that law, officers below a certain rank were
 presumed to have been acting under .direct orders and are not
 subject to prosecution. Reviewing all pending cases, the
 court ruled that prosecutions against all but 19 retired
 generals and admirals were extinguished by the "due obedience"
 doctrine, the "Punto Final" statute of limitations, or other
 procedural defects. Remaining cases ruled still justiciable
 were returned to the Federal appellate courts for trial. The
 human rights community criticized the court's broad
 interpretation of the "due obedience" law as it had earlier
 criticized passage of the law itself. In other judicial
 actions, a civilian federal court tried six civilians accused
 of participating in the attempted takeover of the Buenos Aires
 domestic airport during the January military mutiny and
 sentenced them to varying lengths of incarceration for
 attempted rebellion. A military court-martial tried and
 convicted the military participants in that same airport
 takeover attempt. A Federal appellate court tried six former
 senior officers for negligence and professional incompetence
 during the 1982 South Atlantic war. Early in 1988, navy Lt.
 Alfredo Astiz was promoted to Lt. Commander over the
 objections of the human rights community, which accused him of
 serious human rights violations during military rule.
 President Alfonsin recommended that Astiz be separated from
 the service; the navy decision on separation is pending.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is constitutional protection against unreasonable search
 and seizure. Few cases of arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private lives of persons were reported in 19-88. The
 actions by administrative prosecutor Ricardo Molinas in
 opening international commercial courier packages and
 envelopes as part of an investigation were declared an
 unreasonable violation of privacy by a federal court in 1988.

 ARGENTINA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A free and independent press covers a wide range of political
 viewpoints. Criticism of the Government is fully tolerated,
 and opposition viewpoints are vigorously expressed. The State
 owns 40 percent of the radio stations and controls the
 franchises on others. Three of the four nationally syndicated
 Buenos Aires television channels are government owned. In
 1988 the firing by a government-owned television station of an
 outspoken conservative commentator generated charges of
 government intervention. The commentator has since signed a
 contract with a private station, where he continues to speak
 out on public issues on an unrestrained basis.
 Argentina's national press association, the Association of
 Argentine Journalists (ADEPA), protested physical assaults by
 government security agents on members of the press at the
 National Congress in June and at a presidential event in
 September. The congressional and presidential press offices
 expressed regrets at both incidents. ADEPA also condemned a
 January incident in which a uniformed army officer pointed a
 pistol at a photographer covering events leading to the
 January Monte Caseros mutiny. The officer was subsequently
 identified and punished administratively within the army.
 Finally, ADEPA criticized the Government's proposed
 broadcasting regulatory law, singling out the provisions that
 give the right of reply to any political figure who is
 criticized on radio or television and a provision prohibiting
 simultaneous ownership of print and broadcast media.
 Government ownership of part of the electronic media is now a
 hotly disputed issue within government circles.
 At its March executive council meeting, the Inter-American
 Press Association (IAPA) called for no further
 radio-television licensing in Argentina until the simultaneous
 ownership issue was resolved. It also supported elimination
 of high customs duty on newsprint. Subsequently, the
 Government announced to the September ADEPA meeting that
 newsprint import taxes would be eliminated. Given current
 high tariffs, implementation of this measure will benefit most
 newspapers considerably.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. Argentine law requires political parties to support
 the Constitution and a democratic, representative, republican,
 and federal form of government in order to register for
 elections. At present, no party is denied registration.
 During the campaigns leading to the party primaries in 1988,
 all the major political parties held mass rallies without
 interference. The labor movement, human rights organizations,
 ethnic communities, and other groupings held frequent
 demonstrations and rallies without interference or incident.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 
 
 443
 ARGENTINA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 but also establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion.
 The Government provides financial support to the Roman
 Catholic church, and the Constitution requires the President
 and Vice President to be Roman Catholics. Other religions
 must complete a pro forma registration with the Government to
 obtain legal recognition. Missionaries from any religion are
 permitted to enter Argentina and proselytize, and the
 non-Catholic population is growing. Argentina's Jewish
 community (at an estimated 300,000, the largest in Latin
 America) practices its religion without interference.
 d.- Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 International and internal travel as well as emigration are
 unrestricted. Refugees are not forced to return to countries
 from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since September 1983, Argentina has held three national
 elections to choose a President, Vice President, provincial
 governors, all national deputies, provincial legislatures,
 mayors, and municipal councils. The elections were free,
 fair, and democratic. The Radical Party currently controls
 the executive branch, and the Radical and Peronist Parties
 share power in the Congress. Political parties ranging from
 left to right are represented in Congress as a result of the
 1987 elections. Additional parties hold office in individual
 provinces. From the powerful Peronists to miniscule
 provincial movements, Argentina's opposition parties operate
 without hindrance.
 Women and minorities have full political rights. Women
 participate actively in Argentine politics. There were scores
 of female candidates in the three national elections since
 1983. Thirteen women sit in the 254-member National Chamber
 of Deputies, and 3 women sit in the 46-member Senate.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, and other international human rights organizations
 enjoy unrestricted access in Argentina. Eleven domestic human
 rights organizations continued to operate openly in 1988,
 despite occasional and anonymous bombings, death threats, and
 harassment. Since 1983 the domestic human rights community
 has strongly and unanimously opposed all efforts to limit
 military accountability for abuses committed during military
 rule. The Government allowed full voice to the opposition,
 but in the end proceeded with the "Punto Final" and "due
 obedience" legislation.
 In November an Argentine Federal court ordered the extradition
 of suspected Nazi was criminal Josef Franz Leo Schwammberger
 to Germany. Schwammberger has appealed.
 Argentina plays an active role in both the UNHRC, where it
 chairs an important subcommittee of experts, and the
 
 
 444
 ARGENTINA
 Organization of American States Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission. The Government has facilitated efforts by
 domestic human rights organizations to address both of these
 international bodies in opposition to the Government's
 judicial policies towards the military. It has cooperated
 with UNHRC efforts to investigate cases involving missing
 children from the 1976-83 period of military rule. The
 Government has ratified the American Convention on Human
 Rights (1984) and the U.N. Conventions on torture, civil and
 political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights
 (all in 1986). Argentina has accepted compulsory jurisdiction
 by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Congress passed a law in 1988 that authorizes criminal
 penalties for discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
 religion, and other categories.
 Argentine women are active in government, the professions,
 politics, and private voluntary organizations. Although there
 is no official policy of discrimination against them, women
 have to contend with some bias that is rooted in cultural,
 economic, political, religious, and social structures. Women
 are underrepresented, for example, in senior government
 positions, the armed forces, police, and the business
 community. Working women generally have jobs that pay less
 than comparative jobs held by men. Argentina adheres to the
 U.N. Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against
 Women.
 There is a history of anti-Semitism in Argentine society
 producing occasional anti-Semitic incidents. In the course of
 1988, the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Associations (DAIA),
 Argentina's umbrella Jewish organization, condemned bombings
 against Jewish targets, anonymous threats, and threatening
 public statements by well-known public figures (none of them
 government officials). Senior government and political
 officials have condemned such acts. Many important officials
 attended DAIA's mass rally in repudiation of anti-Semitism
 early in 1988. DAIA has also criticized the unofficial but
 systematic exclusion of Jewish Argentines from important
 institutions such as the armed forces.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There is the free right of labor association in Argentina.
 The labor movement is a major independent, economic, and
 political force. About one-third of the national work force
 is unionized. Previous military regimes suspended laws
 governing labor relations and systematically blocked many
 trade union rights. Congress passed legislation in 1987
 enhancing the free right of labor association. It granted
 legal status to trade unions and guaranteed their right to
 strike, subject to compulsory arbitration by the Labor
 Ministry. Argentine organized labor enjoys the right of
 association with international organizations. The General
 Confederation of Labor (CGT), Argentina's national labor
 federation, participates actively in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in Geneva. In fact, the ILO honored
 Argentina's return to democracy in 1987 by inviting President
 Alfonsin to address its annual conference. Many Argentine
 
 
 445
 ARGENTINA
 unions are affiliated with trade union international groups.
 Unions have the right to strike--members have the right to
 receive their salaries while on strike until the Labor
 Ministry orders compulsory arbitration--and many exercised
 that right in 1988. The CGT led several strikes of 1 day or
 less, including controversial national strikes on September 9
 and September 12. On September 9, a labor rally in Buenos
 Aires, protesting the Government's economic austerity plan,
 degenerated into large-scale violence. Organizers accused the
 police of precipitating the violence, and the Government
 accused extremist groups in the crowd. The September 12 strike
 was called to protest alleged police repression at that rally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Legislation passed by Congress in 1987 introduced binding
 collective bargaining between labor and management and
 generally reduced state involvement in labor relations. The
 Government continues to offer wage guidelines under its
 national "Plan Primavera" economic recovery program and
 directly sets wages in state-owned enterprises. In addition,
 under the new legislation (as under the old), if a striking
 union refuses to accept compulsory arbitration by the Labor
 Ministry, the workers lose their right to continued receipt of
 salaries during the strike.
 Argentine labor law is uniformly applied throughout the
 country. Some provinces provide rights and obligations
 additional to those in federal legislation. There are no
 officially designated export processing zones.
 Legislation passed by Congress in 1987 provided for free
 collective bargaining and established ground rules for
 industrial relations and trade union activities. Argentina's
 largest labor organization, the CGT, and its individual unions
 engaged in consultations with employers and the Government on
 issues affecting labor and the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is illegal in Argentina and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 14 years of age may not work in Argentina
 except in the family. Minors of ages 14 and 15 may work, but
 not more than 6 hours a day or 35 hours a week. The same law
 applies to minors 16 to 18 years of age, although competent
 authority may allow an exception.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Argentina offers comprehensive protection of workers- rights.
 The maximum workday is 8 hours; the workweek is 48 hours.
 Premiums must be paid for work beyond those limits. Rules
 governing vacations, minimum wages, and occupational heaith
 and safety are comparable to those in Western industrial
 nations and are respected in practice.
 The minimum wage in Argentina is currently set at about $85
 per month. Most participants in the wage bargaining process
 agree this is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living for a worker and his family. It is subject to frequent
 revision.
