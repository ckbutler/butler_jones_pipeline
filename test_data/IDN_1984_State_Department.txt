 INDONESIA
 The 'New Order" Government, which came to power in 1966 in the
 wake of an abortive, Communist Party-backed coup, has its
 authority concentrated in a small group of active duty and
 retired military officers and civilian technocrats acting
 under the leadership of President Soeharto within the context
 of a limited Parliamentary system. Emerging from a period of
 sharp internal political conflict and economic chaos 20 years
 ago, the Government gives priority to economic development,
 stability, and equity and has been generally successful in
 these areas.
 With a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic and
 religious groups, successive Indonesian governments have faced
 the need to create a national identity and develop a governing
 system which can accommodate this diversity while maintaining
 national unity. In meeting this challenge, the Soeharto
 regime has made Pancasila the national social and political
 ideology and the centerpiece of its political program.
 Pancasila consists of five principles: belief in one supreme
 God, belief in a just and civilized humanity, nationalism,
 democracy, and social justice. Government based on it
 emphasizes harmony and the traditional Indonesian process of
 consultation and consensus as a major element in
 decision-making.
 Indonesia has a 'mixed economy' with the state involved in
 nearly all sectors. Ethnic Chinese Indonesian citizens are
 heavily represented in the modest but increasingly active
 private sector. Indonesia's national ideology and five-year
 economic plans stress improved social welfare for all without
 discrimination. Indonesia has experienced remarkable economic
 growth over the past decade, with just under five percent real
 growth in 1984, despite continuing weakness in demand and
 prices for oil, its major foreign exchange earner.
 During 1984, the anti-crime campaign of summary killings of
 suspected criminals significantly decreased and came to a
 virtual halt by the end of the year. It is widely believed
 that elements of the Government were involved in this
 campaign. Top government officials made conflicting
 statements about government involvement; some denying it and
 others suggesting criminals were engaged in 'gang warfare.*
 The unsettled security situation in East Timor persisted
 through the year with renewed allegations of human rights
 problems in the province. International humanitarian groups
 continued to have some access, as did some diplomats, but
 foreign journalists and others were blocked from visiting.
 Repatriation and family reunions of East Timorese continued
 with virtually all persons who had registered allowed to
 depart. By the end of the year, the Atauro Island detention
 facility population dropped below one thousand, with the
 provincial government determined to return the remainder to
 their homes as soon as conditions allow.
 There were also security disturbances in Irian Jaya early in
 the year, leading to the flight into Papua New Guinea of
 approximately 10,000 Indonesians. Bilateral negotiations for
 the return of the border-crossers continued through much of
 the year. Security officials, meanwhile, sought to curb the
 activities and limit the influence of small, unorganized
 dissident groups in the province.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Begun in late 1982 and peaking in 1983, an anti-crime campaign
 including covert, summary executions of suspected criminals
 tapered off and virtually stopped in 1984. Initially, the
 campaign responded to a sharp increase in violent crime,
 especially on Java, and the inability of the police, public
 prosecutors and courts to deal with the problem. In 1983,
 several high government officials acknowledged a role by
 security elements in the anti-crime campaign known as
 'mysterious killings.'
 In early 1984 the Foreign Minister, among others, denied
 summary executions were carried out as a matter of government
 policy. The Armed Forces Commander and other officials
 suggested many victims were killed in "inter-gang" fighting
 following a police crackdown on the underworld. Others
 claimed criminal groups mimicked the earlier official campaign
 to settle scores or to eliminate suspected police informers.
 In addition, some observers thought murders might be made to
 look like 'mysterious killings' and thereby divert attention
 from the murderers.
 Although press reporting on killings remained banned, several
 sensationalist dailies through the first half of the year
 carried regular stories of unidentified male corpses, often
 tattooed, found shot, stabbed, beaten, or strangled. There is
 no verifiable or reliable estimate of the total number of
 victims in 1984, but the total is significantly lower than the
 4,000 estimated for 1983. In spite of suggestions that
 summary executions of criminals might be reserved as an
 official policy option, there was a perceptible drop in
 killings and an apparent end to the campaign before the end of
 the year.
 Despite occasional claims that persons were killed for their
 political activities or views, no reliable evidence came to
 light to substantiate such claims. Most of those killed were
 persons with reputations for violent crime.
 Meanwhile, measures were instituted to improve recruitment,
 training, and performance of police and to boost the quality
 and responsiveness of criminal justice organizations.
 Officials acknowledged that concrete results of these efforts
 might not be evident for several years.
 In other areas, government officials noted some members of the
 Fretilin insurgency in East Timor refused to surrender out of
 fear they would be killed by government forces. As a matter
 of policy, the Government continued to offer amnesty to
 surrendering Fretilin members, although some faced criminal
 prosecution for crimes such as murder, arson, or theft,
 committed as members of the insurgency. Sentences for those
 convicted were relatively light. Captured Fretilin personnel
 and detainees are now tried in civil, not military, courts and
 are provided with counsel. A number have been released for
 lack of evidence.
 
 
 773
 INDONESIA
 In addition, there were allegations some adherents of the Free
 Papua Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya were summarily executed.
 In a widely-publicized case, a Cenderawasih University
 official accused of supporting the OPM died after being
 arrested and allegedly trying to escape. Although some groups
 outside Indonesia claimed the escape story was a ruse to cover
 up his killing by the Government, reliable accounts indicate
 that he was shot after escaping from detention and while
 attempting to join his family in Papua New Guinea. Evidence
 of significant casualties resulting from Indonesian security
 operations is unavailable.
 As a matter of policy, members of both the Fretilin and OPM
 insurgencies attack and hame killed government officials and
 local residents loyal to the Government. In March 1984, for
 example, OPM elements killed several Indonesian officials in
 Irian Jaya and kidnapped the Swiss pilot of a missionary
 aircraft. They released the pilot after demanding, but not
 receiving, a substantial ransom. Fretilin policy also
 involves burning of houses or villages of persons supporting
 the Government. These Fretilin actions reportedly have
 alienated many civilians and further reduced its popularity.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights groups both inside and outside Indonesia received
 reports of alleged disappearances during 1984. In many cases,
 follow-up efforts indicated that those alleged to have
 disappeared had been taken into custody by government
 authorities with powers to arrest or detain persons without
 informing families or attorneys. In East Timor, international
 humanitarian organizations have played an important role in
 tracing missing persons and advising families of their
 whereabouts. As a result of a new round of troubles in East
 Timor beginning in late 1983, there were new allegations of
 disappearances. Because of ongoing security disturbances
 during 1984, it was often difficult to determine if such
 persons had been arrested or detained, had fled to the
 forests, or had been killed either by officials or by Fretilin
 insurgents.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Government policy discourages torture and cruel punishment of
 prisoners, but cases of cruel treatment of prisoners are
 reported from time to time in the press and elsewhere. When
 cases come to light, offending police and other authorities
 often are disciplined. In an effort to reduce such incidents,
 top government security officials have instituted a long-term
 program to recruit and train better educated personnel.
 There have been allegations of torture during interrogation of
 prisoners in areas of continuing security disturbances, such
 as East Timor and Irian Jaya. No conclusive evidence has come
 to light to suggest torture is employed in these areas as a
 matter of policy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The December 1981 Criminal Procedures code [Kuhap] contains
 protections against arbitrary arrest and detention and
 specifies the right of prisoners to legal counsel and
 notification of family members. The provisions of the Kuhap
 
 
 774
 INDONESfA
 are honored more often in urban areas than in small towns or
 remote provinces, in large part because of a shortage of
 trained trial lawyers and the weakness or absence of legal and
 human rights associations in remote areas. Indonesian law
 does not specifically include rights of 'habeas corpus.'
 Martial law, declared in 1957, has never been lifted. Under
 special emergency provisions instituted in 1966, a military
 organization, the Command for the Restoration of Security and
 Order (Kopkamtib], has wide powers to detain and interrogate
 persons thought to endanger national security. These special
 arrest powers supersede the Kuhap protections and apply
 particularly to cases of suspected subversion, sabotage,
 secession, or corruption. At mid-year, the Minister of
 Justice ordered the release of 69 vagrants illegally detained
 in Jakarta's Pondok Bambu facility. The Minister claimed
 Kopkamtib had no authority to arrest and detain persons whose
 offenses were, at worst, misdemeanors.
 According to reports during 1984 from the press and human
 rights groups, military authorities continued to arrest some
 persons believed to be involved in subversive or secessionist
 activities. In some cases, persons detained are not allowed
 to contact their families or lawyers, although they usually
 are permitted to communicate after a period of days or weeks.
 Many of those detained for subversion are suspected Muslim
 extremists believed to have instigated or participated in
 illegal anti-government acts. In addition, others have been
 detained in connection with civil unrest, including riots,
 bombings and circulation of anti-government pamphlets. Most
 of these are charged with criminal code violations, although a
 dozen or more well-known Muslim preachers being held near
 Jakarta are charged with subversion.
 While precise estimates of the number of persons detained
 without trial are unavailable, human rights observers believe
 there may be as many as 500 throughout Indonesia, including
 Aceh, East and Central Java, and Irian Jaya.
 During 1984 the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) made a series of "protection' visits to places of
 detention in East Timor. The results of ICRC "protection'
 visits are not a matter of public record. Their
 representatives meanwhile continue to seek unfettered access
 to all detained persons during such visits.
 Many East Timorese detained in earlier years were tried in
 civilian courts this year. Represented by government-provided
 civilian attorneys and charged with criminal code violations,
 seventy persons were convicted and sentenced to terms ranging
 from one to eighteen years. Several dozen other persons were
 tried and acquitted, while prosecutors released still others
 for lack of evidence.
 Since 1981, Indonesian authorities have used Atauro Island off
 the coast of mainland East Timor as a detention facility for
 Timorese suspected of supporting, or of having family members
 fighting with, Pretilin. The number of Timorese detained on
 Atauro peaked at about 4,000 in the second half of 1982.
 Beginning in late 1982 and continuing through 1984, the
 provincial government has resettled detainees on the main
 island. Several hundred persons were resettled to their homes
 
 
 INDONESIA
 in June 1984, with another 600 returned to the Ainaro area in
 late October. Another 200 to 300 were scheduled to return to
 their homes before the end of the year leaving fewer than
 1,000 detained persons on Atauro, mainly from the Viqueque
 area. Government officials are committed to resettling these
 persons to their homes as soon as possible and closing the
 Atauro facility. In the meantime, the ICRC and Indonesian Red
 Cross continue to have regular access and provide nutritional
 and medical assistance to detainees.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Indonesia's criminal justice system lacks the number of
 courts, judges, prosecutors, and police needed to cope with
 the increase in crime in recent years. Accordingly, there are
 sometimes lengthy delays in scheduling trials. Trials are
 conducted by a three-judge panel which hears evidence, decides
 guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Although the
 right of appeal is not absolute, it is observed in most cases;
 most court sessions are open and most defendants have access
 to counsel.
 It is widely believed that political interference and
 corruption exists in the Indonesian legal system. In criminal
 proceedings, defendants are sometimes able to buy their way
 out of prosecution at various stages of the proceedings. In
 civil cases, court decisions are sometimes influenced by the
 payment of bribes. In response to these abuses, the Attorney
 General and Minister of Justice have directed disciplinary
 action be taken against officials involved in corrupt
 activities and have sought to increase salaries and benefits
 for judicial officials, with the aim of reducing the incentive
 for corruption.
 Some Indonesian legal figures regard persons held for
 subversion as political prisoners, including those sentenced
 to prison through trial procedures. They believe Kopkamtib is
 extra-constitutional and therefore has no legal powers of
 arrest or the right to hand persons over for trial. Some of
 the detained persons clearly participated in acts of violence;
 others have been convicted for expressions of anti-government
 or separatist sentiment. Although the Government has not
 announced data on the number of persons convicted and serving
 sentences for subversion, one reliable estimate suggests there
 may be several hundred such prisoners.
 Amnesty International contends persons tried and convicted for
 participation in the abortive 1965 Communist coup and for
 association with the Indonesian Communist Party failed to
 receive fair trials and should be considered "political
 prisoners." There are about 250 such prisoners. Indonesian
 authorities have permitted visits to these prisoners by the
 ICRC, which normally urges they be assured rights accorded
 other prisoners, including the right of appeal and routine
 remission of sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for
 suspected subversion, economic crimes, and corruption. In
 some instances, forced or surreptitious entry by security
 agencies has been alleged. Both local and international
 telephone calls by some persons are probably monitored by
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 50
 
 
 776
 INDONESIA
 government security agencies. Although, in general,
 correspondence is not monitored, all letter mail to and from
 East Timor is subject to official scrutiny.
 Permits are required for the import of foreign publications
 and video tapes. Some foreign newspapers and magazines,
 especially from Australia, cannot be imported. Foreign
 publications which do enter Indonesia are frequently
 censored. Communist literature is prohibited.
 Excepting one quasi-official daily newspaper which uses
 Chinese characters and claims a circulation of 120,000,
 Chinese language publications can neither be imported nor
 produced domestically. Chinese characters are routinely
 blotted out of foreign news photos and advertising. There are
 no laws against speaking Chinese, but the Government lays
 heavy stress on the learning and use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia, to promote national unity. All school
 classes and most radio and television broadcasts employ Bahasa
 Indonesia.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Indonesia's Constitution gives Parliament the authority to
 prescribe limits on freedom of speech and press. In recent
 years, Parliament has helped create a body of law delimiting
 the rights of individuals and of the Government. Government
 departments and agencies, however, continue to exercise
 considerable discretionary authority in this area both through
 tradition and because of the absence of specific laws
 protecting individual rights.
 Opposition groups are generally free to meet and formulate
 views, but they have difficulty disseminating their views
 publicly because of media reluctance to risk official
 disapproval or because of informal government instructions not
 to publish the opinions of or news about prominent opposition
 figures. Some opposition figures claim harassment by
 government agencies (telephones rendered inoperable,
 electricity cut, difficulty obtaining access to other
 government-provided services) and restrictions on their
 economic activities (e.g., refusal by government agencies to
 accept bids from companies in which they have an interest and
 pressure on private concerns not to do business with them).
 While there were restrictions on academic inquiry during the
 1982 election campaign, similar limits were not in effect
 during 1984. School faculties sometimes refrain from
 producing materials, including dissertations, which they
 believe might provoke government displeasures. Government
 officials occasionally stop publication or distribution of
 books regarded as critical of the Government or addressing
 sensitive subjects, such as human rights. Publishers also are
 unwilling to accept manuscripts dealing with controversial
 issues.
 The press in Indonesia is largely privately owned. While
 espousing a "free" press, the Government also expects the
 media to be *responsible' by supporting national economic
 development goals and domestic stability. Publishers and
 journalists, recognizing what they perceive as the limits of
 permissibility, often exercise considerable *self-censorship."
 
 
 777
 INDONESIA
 At the same time, the media is closely monitored, and editors
 routinely receive oral instructions from government officials
 about news which cannot be reported. There is a single,
 government-run television company, and private radio stations
 are required to use government-provided news reports.
 Editorials, however, do address sensitive issues, albeit
 gingerly, and stories are written so as to provide background
 about events which are not supposed to be reported.
 The Government is sensitive to foreign press reports of
 internal Indonesian developments, particularly those related
 to security, East Timor and Irian Jaya. During 1984, two
 foreign wire service correspondents and two other journalists
 were advised their visas would not be extended, and they had
 to leave. Late in the year, a fifth foreign journalist was
 expelled before the expiration of his visa. No action was
 taken, however, to prevent replacements from entering the
 country to occupy the same positions.
 During 1984, the Department of Information suspended
 publication licenses of three magazines. Two, accused of
 printing material which might increase ethnic tensions, closed
 and were not allowed to reopen. The third, a weekly, lost its
 publication permit for several weeks after an editorial which
 allegedly encouraged class conflict. Following an apology
 from the editor, the Department of Information allowed the
 magazine to reappear. Finally, a daily journal closed
 initially on order of Kopkamtib in March 1983, apparently for
 political reasons, has not had its license *unfrozen.'
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is freely permitted for social and ceremonial
 events and, as long as there is no perceived risk of violence,
 for political activities approved by the Government. However,
 regional and national meetings of virtually all organizations
 must have government permission. Youth groups concerned about
 requirements to accept "Pancasila" have experienced
 difficulties in obtaining such permission.
 In June, the Government submitted to Parliament a bill
 regulating all 'community organizations.' The bill, which
 generated considerable public controversy, would require all
 organizations to obtain a license from the Government. The
 license could be withdrawn if the organization is found to
 engage in Marxist or other activities antithetical to the
 national ideology of Pancasila. Another controversial section
 would require Government authorization before organizations
 receive funds from any foreign donor. Passage of the bill is
 expected in 1985.
 Indonesian labor is organized in a national federation (FBSI)
 composed of 21 national industrial unions, with a total
 membership of some 3 million out of a workforce of 65 million
 in which some 15 million persons are employed in the
 industrialized sector. FBSI is the only trade union legally
 permitted in Indonesia. Political activity by FBSI is
 forbidden. Nor is it permitted to organize civil servants or
 workers in government-owned enterprises and in major sectors
 of the economy declared as vital such as air transportation
 and oil. However, some professional organizations, such as
 those for teachers, do act as unions in some respects.
 
 
 778
 INDONESIA
 Restrictions on FBSI's autonomy included the imposition of
 government appointees in many of its positions, requirement
 that its senior officials be active members of the government-
 sponsored Golkar organization and extensive government
 intervention in labor-management relations. However, FBSI is
 slowly becoming more effective in representing its members.
 The law requires government permission for strikes, which as a
 matter of practice is never given.
 Indonesia has signed and ratified a number of International
 Labor Organization (ILO) conventions including those on the
 right to organize and bargain collectively and on forced
 labor. Government officials have made clear, however, that
 Indonesia's obligations under these conventions will not be
 allowed to interfere with 'Pancasila' labor relations.
 Indonesia was again asked at the 1984 ILO General Conference
 about forced labor and limitations on the employment rights of
 released political prisoners, and to provide information on
 forced labor. ILO concern about forced labor in Indonesia
 began in regard to political prisoners arrested in the 60's
 and early 70's (most of whom have now been released), but it
 now focuses on disputed claims by workers on remote
 plantations that they have been required to continue working
 and not been provided return fares after their contracts end.
 The claims are difficult to verify.
 .c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution. Although
 the Indonesian population is overwhelmingly Muslim, practice
 and teaching of other faiths is generally permitted.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila specifies belief in a
 supreme being, atheism is forbidden. Some animists in remote
 parts of Indonesia have reportedly been pressured to convert
 to Islam or Christianity in order to fulfill the requirement
 of belief in a supreme being. At the same time, mystic sects
 and beliefs are followed bf many in the Indonesian elite.
 Several small Muslim sects and certain other religious groups
 accused of contravening widely accepted moral standards are
 banned by the Department of Religion. There are no legal bars
 to religious conversion, and conversions between faiths are
 common. Proselytizing, though, is seen as potentially
 disruptive and is discouraged. For this reason, informal
 restrictions on the activities of foreign missionaries, such
 as difficulty in obtaining or renewing visas or residence
 permits, have increased in some areas in recent years.
 However, missionary activities in other areas are relatively
 unimpeded.
 Official holidays include Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist, as
 well as Muslim holy days. Indonesian Muslims, Christians and
 Buddhists maintain active links with coreligionists outside
 Indonesia. Travel to religious gatherings is permitted, and
 Muslims undertake the "Hajj" to Mecca without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Indonesia generally is unrestricted. The
 Government requires permits to change residence in certain
 areas, primarily to control the further shift of population
 from rural to urban locations. Since 1958-59, ethnic Chinese
 
 
 779
 INDONESIA
 have been denied the right to live in rural areas of Java
 (although the practical effect of the regulation is mitigated
 by the fact no such rural areas are more than 15 miles from a
 major town). Travel to certain regions, including most of
 Eastern Indonesia, requires a special permit. There are also
 restrictions on movement to and within East Timor and Irian
 Jaya. Former political detainees associated with the abortive
 1965 coup attempt are required to notify authorities of travel
 away from their homes. Members or alleged supporters of the
 Indonesian Communist Party outside Indonesia have not been
 allowed to return, except on a case-by-case basis.
 Emigration is unrestricted except that, since the 1976
 integration of East Timor into Indonesia, authorities have
 closely controlled emigration and repatriation of former
 Portuguese subjects. Through 1983 and early 1984 officially
 sanctioned emigration from East Timor continued at a brisk
 pace and, by mid-1984, nearly all of the persons who had
 registered for repatriation or family reunion were permitted
 to depart.
 Under its humane refugee policy, Indonesia has given first
 asylum to over 88,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. In
 cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the
 Government of Indonesia has also provided one of the region's
 two refugee processing centers, where Indochina refugees who
 have landed in Indonesia as well as those from other first
 asylum countries are given training to prepare them for
 permanent resettlement in other countries.
 In early 1984, as a result of security disturbances in areas
 near the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border, approximately
 10,000 Indonesians crossed the border. They apparently were
 prompted by warnings of wide disturbances from insurgent
 elements and a desire to move away from areas of possible
 military operations. The two Governments initiated
 discussions for return of the border crossers immediately, and
 by the end of 1984 initial steps for repatriation were
 underway.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Indonesia's government has its authority concentrated in a
 small group of active duty and retired military officers and
 civilian technocrats. President Soeharto is the decisive
 political figure. The Parliament and the political parties
 have little ability to influence government decisions.
 The Parliament is elected by all adult citizens except active
 duty members of the armed forces and convicted criminals
 serving in prison. Though the military is not permitted to
 vote, 96 out of 460 seats in Parliament are reserved for
 appointed members to represent its interests. Elections for
 Parliament are held every five years.
 The President is elected by the People's Consultative Assembly
 (MPR), which consists of Parliament plus an equal number of
 appointed members and sits in a special session every five
 years.
 Parliament considers laws presented to it by government
 departments and agencies and does not draft laws on its own.
 
 
 780
 INDONESIA
 Although bills are often changed slightly, little significant
 change or revision occurs during parliamentary consideration.
 Usually Parliament works on the basis of consensus and votes
 are less important than consultations during committee
 consideration of a bill.
 A 1975 law limits the number of political parties to three: a
 Muslim party made up of four former Muslim political parties;
 an association of former Nationalist and Christian parties;
 and the government-sponsored Golkar. In three national
 elections since 1971, Golkar has won each time with more than
 60 percent of the vote. Civil servants and their families are
 expected to vote for Golkar, and support for Golkar at the
 local level often results in additional government resources
 being devoted to development projects in the area.
 The two political parties and Golkar are prohibited from
 organizing and operating below the district level except
 during election campaigns. Critics contend this system gives
 Golkar an advantage, since its civil service members have
 constant access to small towns and villages because of their
 official duties. The Indonesian Communist Party and a
 formerly powerful Muslim party linked with separatist
 rebellions in the later 1950's are specifically banned.
 Members of the former and many leaders of the latter are not
 allowed to run for office or to play active political roles.
 An informal opposition group formed in 1980 and known as the
 'Petition of 50" group, consisting of retired military.
 officers, some prominent Muslims and former student activists,
 continues its efforts to exert political influence by
 circulating "statements of concern' and 'white papers'
 critical of government actions and leaders. In a related
 area, sermon givers in mosques are permitted to criticize
 government policies in their sermons as long as they do not
 encourage disruption of public order.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 violations of human rights to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Amnesty International representatives, for example,
 are refused official access to Indonesia because of the
 organization's past criticism of the Government and the
 Government's belief it is biased. There is no local chapter
 of Amnesty International, although individual citizens may
 have memberships.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a
 resident delegate in Jakarta heading its Southeast Asia
 Division. The ICRC, in conjunction with the Indonesian Red
 Cross, is engaged in a range of programs in East Timor. These
 include tracing, delivery of family messages, repatriation,
 and a nutrition and health services program for displaced
 persons on Atauro Island. The ICRC has made known its
 willingness to help resettle Atauro Island detainees to the
 main island and to provide relief assistance if necessary.
 The provincial government has taken responsibility for these
 activities.
 
 
 781
 TNDONESIA
 A number of domestic organizations are concerned with human
 rights. The Department of Justice has an agency charged with
 the drafting of legal codes to replace the colonial laws still
 in effect. This.agency also has responsibility for the
 establishment of legal documentation facilities and for
 programs to inform citizens of their legal rights. In
 addition to these government activities, private groups
 associated with mosques and churches are involved in providing
 legal counseling services. The trial lawyers association,
 Peradin, provides some legal services free to the
 disadvantaged. Some groups have expressed concern that
 provisions of the pending law on community organizations could
 affect the independence of human rights organizations in the
 future.
 There are private legal aid organizations which contest human
 rights violations by defending or representing aggrieved
 parties in court and by stimulating press attention and
 discussion. One of these was a leading critic of the
 "mysterious killings" campaign. Several took a prominent role
 in defending persons charged in connection with rioting in
 Jakarta in September. These private legal aid organizations
 have also established offices in many larger Indonesian cities
 and are looking to extend services to rural and remote areas.
 One also continues to prepare annual reports on human rights
 in Indonesia. Although no full report has been published
 since 1982, a summary statement for 1984 appeared in several
 newspapers in connection with Human Rights Day on December 10.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The fifth principle of Pancasila, social justice, is
 interpreted to mean that the basic human needs of all
 Indonesians should be satisfied without discrimination. In
 addition, the three "pillars* of President Soeharto's "New
 Order" Government have been economic development, stability,
 and equity.
 Government measures in early 1983 to counteract the effect of
 worldwide economic recession resulted in a higher than
 anticipated growth rate. for 1983 and the prospect of a 4.5
 percent real growth rate in 1984. The World Bank estimated
 per capita gross national product at $584 in 1982. Following
 the March 1983 devaluation of the rupiah, per capita income
 fell below $500, but is estimated at $580 for 1984. The World
 Bank estimated 26 percent of the urban population and 44
 percent of the rural population was below the absolute poverty
 level in 1980, a sharp drop since 1970.
 The fifth most populous country in the world and largest
 nation in Southeast Asia, Indonesia had an estimated
 population in 1984 of 169,442,000. Population pressures are
 especially great on the islands of Java, Bali, and Madura,
 even though the population growth rate is estimated at only
 two percent. Infant mortality rates improved to 91 per 1,000
 live births in 1984. Likewise, life expectancy at birth rose
 to 54 years in 1984, a significant increase since 1970.
 Indonesian women generally enjoy a high degree of economic and
 social freedom, and there is significant cultural latitude for
 women's participation in public life. Women occupy important
 mid-level positions in the civil service, educational
 institutions, labor unions, the military, the professions,
 private business, and Parliament. The Cabinet named in

 INDONESIA
 1983 includes two women: the Minister of State for Women's
 Affairs and the Minister for Social Affairs. Although
 legislation guarantees women equal treatment, women seldom
 receive equal pay for equal work. In addition to government-
 sponsored women's organizations in which membership and
 participation are mandatory, there are several voluntary,
 private groups which work to advance women's legal, economic
 and political rights. Chief among these is Kowani (Congress
 of Indonesian Women), an umbrella for some 55 women's groups.
 Ethnic Chinese are pressured to adopt Indonesian customs and
 take Indonesian names. While they are also encouraged to
 become citizens, some Chinese find legal avenues to
 citizenship blocked or are discouraged by the time-consuming
 and expensive task of obtaining citizenship documents.
 Government regulations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese
 schools and institutions of higher learning, teaching in
 Chinese languages, the formation of exclusively Chinese
 cultural groups in trade associations, and the use of Chinese
 characters on sign boards or in publications. However, social
 and religious groups which are, in effect, all Chinese are not
 proscribed and do exist.
 By 1981, virtually all primary school-age children were
 enrolled in schools, although the Government had difficulty
 recruiting and keeping teachers for schools in isolated
 areas. In 1984, the President announced compulsory education
 through primary grades and encouraged wealthy Indonesians to
 .adopt' poorer students and help them pay for schooling. The
 World Bank estimates that as of 1971 total adult literacy
 stood at 57 percent (69 percent of men and 45 percent of
 women; 77 percent of urban and 52 percent of rural dwellers).
 According to the 1980 Indonesian Government census, 72 percent
 of the population over 10 years of age could read and write
 (78.8 percent of men and 61.4 percent of women; 83.8 percent
 of the urban population and 65.7 percent of the rural
 population).
 Agricultural output has increased significantly in recent
 years, about 3.8 percent per annum. 1984 was particularly
 remarkable for increased food production after the preceding
 two years when drought conditions hurt government efforts to
 reach self-sufficiency in rice production. Partly as a result
 of improving output, the percentage of caloric supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 was 110 in 1981, according to World Bank figures. For the
 first time since independence Indonesia was self-sufficient in
 rice in 1984.
 Community health standards remain low, despite intensive
 government efforts to train doctors and other health
 specialists and to provide medical facilities and supplies.
 Tuberculosis, mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, and
 skin disease are endemic. In 1981, 23 percent of the
 population (40 percent in urban areas and 18 percent in rural
 areas) had access to safe water.
