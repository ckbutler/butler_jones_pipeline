 CUBA
 Cuba is a Communist state dominated by Fidel Castro, who is
 Chief of State, head of government, leader of the Communist
 Party, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. With
 support from a few long-time associates, President Castro
 exercises control over nearly all aspects of Cuban life
 through a network of directorates ultimately responsible to
 him through the Communist Party. The party is the only legal
 political entity and is headed by a self-perpetuating elite.
 All government positions, including judicial offices, are
 controlled by the party. Elections are held only to endorse
 party-approved candidates. Though not a formal requirement,
 party membership is a de facto prerequisite for high-level
 official positions and professional advancement in most areas.
 The Constitution states that civil liberties may not be
 exercised "contrary to the decision of the Cuban people to
 build socialism and communism" (Article 61). In practice, the
 top leadership determines the degree to which civil liberties
 are exercised and defines what is "against the revolution."
 The Ministry of Interior ensures political and social
 conformity, as well as internal security. It operates border
 and police forces, orchestrates public demonstrations,
 determines the legality of associations, investigates evidence
 of nonconformity, regulates migration, and maintains pervasive
 vigilance through a series of mass organizations and informers.
 The mass organizations attempt to extend Cuban government and
 Communist Party control over each citizen's daily activities
 at home, work, and school. Citizens are exhorted to ensure
 ideological conformity and to report deviation.
 The Cuban economy is highly centralized and managed by a group
 of advisors close to President Castro. The Government controls
 the means of production and is virtually the country's sole
 employer. In the late 1970's, Cuba began to use market
 mechanisms, but in 1986 the Government reversed course, began
 the "rectification of errors" campaign, and sought to stamp
 out an emerging informal private sector, while promoting
 antimaterialist "Socialist morality." The abandonment of the
 liberalization program in favor of more orthodox Communist
 policies has played a major role in the Cuban economy's recent
 downswing from stagnation to the 3.5 percent negative growth
 experienced in 1987.
 Cuba has made some gains on the social front since Fidel Castro
 seized power on January 1, 1959, particularly in health care,
 education, and more equitable income distribution. Progress
 has been made in literacy, but education remains heavily laden
 with political indoctrination. Political and military elites
 live comfortably, while many perceived opponents of the
 Government and party are denied suitable employment and
 education. The vast majority of Cubans must cope with severe
 scarcities of housing, food, and consumer goods. Even some
 Cuban leaders have acknowledged that inefficiency and worker
 apathy are major problems in the state sector, where the
 incentive to produce is small.
 In 1988 the human rights situation was characterized by
 continuing repression tempered by limited improvements in
 selected areas. In the face of international scrutiny, the
 Cuban Government sought to improve its human rights image by
 permitting internationally recognized human rights groups to
 visit the island, releasing many long-term political prisoners
 and allowing them to emigrate, showing limited tolerance for
 
 
 518
 CUBA
 unofficial and unrecognized domestic human rights groups,
 implementing some improvements in prison conditions, and
 granting concessions to the Catholic Church. The Government
 approved a revision of the Penal Code which introduced some
 improvements, such as the decriminalization of many petty.
 crimes, but had little effect on political offenses. The new
 code retains jail sentences as punishment for illegal exit
 from the country, "enemy propaganda," and "dangerousness," a
 vague concept of crimes against Socialist norms.
 These steps, however, have not altered in any basic manner the
 fundamentally repressive nature of the Cuban system. Many are
 easily reversible, one-time actions that do not constitute
 permanent recognition of the need to protect basic rights or
 bring about structural reform. Serious human rights violations
 continue across a wide spectrum of activity. Arrests and
 detentions for political crimes persist. There is no
 independent judiciary, due process safeguards can be
 constitutionally circumvented, and defense attorneys face
 severe disadvantages under the present judicial system.
 Cubans still do not possess equal protection before the law,
 the right freely to choose government representatives, freedom
 of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association,
 or freedom to travel to and from Cuba. All media are
 government owned and remain under tight control, and the
 practice of religion continues to be discouraged. Government
 efforts to monopolize control over many aspects of life remain
 very intrusive. Aside from the recognized churches, which are
 themselves monitored by the party, there is little
 institutional autonomy in Cuban society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports that the Government practiced summary
 execution of its opponents during 1988. The death in 1987 of
 political prisoner Eugenio Gonzalez Alvizar while in police
 custody and the death of human rights activist Antonio Frias
 Sosa in 1986 have never been fully investigated or resolved.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 occurring during 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no substantiated allegations of the use of
 systematic physical torture during 1988. Reliable reports of
 abuse and mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, especially
 those accused of political offenses, continued. Released
 prisoners described beatings by prison officials, inadequate
 diet, denial of appropriate medical care, withholding of
 access to fresh air and exercise, denials of family visits and
 mail, and extended periods of solitary confinement or
 incarceration in unlit punishment cells. Cuban authorities
 made some improvements in prison conditions in 1988, many of
 them just prior to visits by international human rights groups.
 
 
 519
 CUBA
 Harsh punishment cells, although somewhat improved in 1988,
 continue to exist in violation of international norms for
 prison conditions. Officials of Amnesty International (AI)
 and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, who
 visited Cuban prisons in 1988, severely criticized inhumane
 conditions in the so-called punishment cells of several
 prisons. The New York delegation visited one wing of
 punishment cells in the Combinado del Este prison's infamous
 "rectangle of death," and its report describes dark cells
 about 4 feet wide and 9 or 10 feet long with doors of metal
 bars partially covered by sheet metal to keep out light. The
 same report estimates that, based on information provided by
 former prisoners, there are 99 punishment cells in Combinado
 del Este alone. AI reported that former Interior Ministry
 security officer Rolando Martinez Valdes, convicted of crimes
 against state security in 1983, had been kept in a special
 isolation punishment cell at Combinado del Este supposedly
 because he possessed important security information.
 Eyewitnesses have stated that 44 of the "plantados historicos"
 (long-term political prisoners who have refused "reeducation")
 discovered and removed microphones hidden in the walls of
 their cells at Combinado del Este prison in May. Prison guards
 intervened with force, and several prisoners were allegedly
 beaten to obtain surrender of the microphones. Two prisoners
 reportedly were hospitalized as a result. A hunger strike
 initiated to protest these measures reportedly resulted in
 further beatings and confinement in punishment cells.
 The March 1988 report of the U.S.-based Institute for Policy
 Studies (IPS) noted that, in its recent prisoner interviews,
 there were frequent complaints that those who did not strictly
 conform to the prison regimen were beaten by guards with
 rubber hoses or fists. According to IPS, one such prisoner
 was allegedly kicked to death in 1987; the guards implicated
 are facing charges. There is no information available
 regarding the disposition of this case. Prison officials
 questioned by visiting human rights groups have been unable to
 cite other instances in which guards or prison officials were
 disciplined for prisoner mistreatment. The controlled Cuban
 press has never reported any such charges or any case of a
 guard being punished.
 After his release in May 1988, Alberto Fibla Gonzalez, a
 medical doctor imprisoned for over 26 years, denounced in
 detail the grossly inadequate medical care provided to 68
 fellow political prisoners in the past. Their illnesses
 include allergies, hearing disorders, hypertension, vision
 loss, gastric disorders, ulcers, heart disease, and diabetes.
 Dr. Fibla attributed most of the illnesses to long periods of
 confinement in unhealthy conditions, malnutrition, mental and
 physical stress, and in some instances physical abuse.
 Prison visitation rights continue to be habitually suspended.
 Family members and friends are given only limited access to
 prisoners. In the case of political prisoners, family visits
 to the "plantados historicos" were reportedly suspended for
 several months after the microphone search incident in May.
 General prison conditions have improved over the past 12 to 18
 months at Combinado del Este and several other prisons.
 Prisons were cleaned, cell blocks painted, cell conditions
 were upgraded, and visitor areas refurbished. Several
 prisoners pointed to better food service, improved medical
 care, and a halt to beatings, but they questioned whether
 
 
 520
 CUBA
 these changes would be lasting. Political reeducation courses
 are no longer mandatory. Nonattendance at such courses no
 longer results in punishment and, therefore, time in punishment
 cells has been reduced. The report of the New York City Bar
 Association delegation states that its visiting team was told
 by prisoners that the removal of sheet metal from the doors of
 some punishment cells in Combinado del Este prison coincided
 with visits by foreign delegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 245 of the Law of Penal Procedure requires police to
 file formal charges and either to release the detainee or to
 place him at the disposition-of the prosecutor within 96
 hours. Article 467 of the Law of Penal Procedure provides
 that persons held without chages beyond the period proscribed
 by law must be released upon petition to the court. However,
 arbitrary arrests and detentions, most notably in cases
 involving political offenses, occur despite these legal
 provisions for due process. Article 61 of the Constitution
 permits denial of all recognized civil liberties in the case
 of anyone actively opposing "the decision of the Cuban people
 to build socialism." This article has often been invoked to
 justify lengthy detention of dissidents.
 Authorities may detain a person for 10 days before granting
 the suspect the right to a defense attorney. For serious
 offenses, including those against state security, bail is not
 permitted, and the investigatory phase may be extended up to 6
 months by the prosecutor. During this investigative period,
 there is no requirement for the prisoner to be informed of the
 specific charges against him; he also may lack any legal
 assistance.
 The new Penal Code, which went into effect in April, reduced
 prison sentences for many crimes and decriminalized over 90
 offenses. Prisoners benefited from a retroactive provision,
 and more than 8,000 criminal offenders were released in the
 first half of 1988. In January the Cuban Government released
 an estimate of the prison population of 32,000.
 The new Code left virtually unchanged the catalog of political
 offenses, and it did not alter the earlier broad authorization
 for preventive detention for "dangerousness" (see Section
 i.e.). This provision is apparently rarely used, but by many
 accounts the threat of its imposition hangs over potential
 opponents of the regime and restrains the average citizen from
 associations with known dissidents and "capitalist" foreigners.
 There are numerous credible reports of persons ultimately
 charged with political offenses who, in direct violation of
 Cuban law, were detained incommunicado for prolonged periods
 without being either charged, or informed of the nature of the
 accusations against them, or brought before judicial hearings.
 While the Law of Penal Procedure theoretically provides a
 safeguard against unlawful detention, habeas corpus has found
 little use in Cuba. No detainee is known to have petitioned
 successfully for such release.
 Precise numbers of political prisoners in Cuban jails are
 difficult to determine because of differences in defining who
 is a political prisoner, the Government's secrecy about the
 prison population, and the effect of recent prisoner releases.
 Estimates range from AI's 1988 report (covering 1987) figure
 of some 300 to 400 to the Cuban Human Rights Committee's'claim
 
 
 521
 CUBA
 of "thousands." Government figures released in March claimed
 455 prisoners out of a total prison population of 32,000 were
 detained for crimes against state security, a category which
 does not encompass convictions for illegal exit, contempt, or
 offenses related to the practice of religion. Conscientious
 objectors to the draft are subject to imprisonment, but the
 Government has not disclosed the number of such prisoners, nor
 has it so far permitted visits to military prisons.
 In 1988 the Government released approximately 250 political
 prisoners, in effect acting favorably on the 1987 petition of
 the U.S. Catholic Conference and a 1988 request to President
 Castro by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York,
 to free specific political prisoners. Among the released
 political-prisoners were 65 "plantados historicos."
 Approximately 900 present and former political prisoners and
 their accompanying families were allowed to emigrate to the
 United States in 1988.
 The Government released a number of political prisoners on the
 condition that they immediately emigrate to the United States.
 In 1988 more than 50 political prisoners, including several
 "plantados historicos," were delivered directly from Combinado
 del Este prison to the airport for immediate departure to
 Miami. Many observers considered this to be, in effect,
 forced exile.
 All but four of the "plantados historicos" were released in
 1988. At the end of December, the Government announced it
 would let the remaining four "plantados historicos" go. Former
 political prisoners report that over 25 "new plantados," who
 refuse to accept the prison regime have in effect replaced the
 "plantados historicos" and are being held in Combinado del
 Este.
 Released political prisoners have provided examples of Cuban
 authorities' extension of sentences without any trial or due
 process. One such case is that of Juan Martinez Otano, who
 was sentenced to 10 years in 1972. He was released in 1987,
 after a total of 15 year's imprisonment, with 8 months off
 "for good behavior," according to his release letter. There
 were no additional specified charges or any evidence of a new
 trial to account for the extra 5 years' imprisonment.
 In its September visit to Cuba, the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC) Cuba Working Group interviewed 89 of
 over 1,500 private citizens who had sought to file complaints
 about human rights abuses. Cuban authorities assured the
 UNHRC Chairman, Ambassador Alioune Sene of Senegal, that there
 would be no reprisals against persons who testified before the
 Working Group. There are now multiple reports that some human
 rights activists who presented testimony to the Working Group
 have been harassed and detained by Cuban authorities subsequent
 to the Group's visit. On September 20, a group of 40 to 50
 persons peacefully demonstrated in front of the Working Group's
 hotel. The crowd wds dispersed by police, and 10 persons were
 reportedly detained. Among the detained was Gustavo Venta who
 was later sentenced to 6 months in prison for public disorder.
 Pablo Pupo Sanchez and Juan Garcia Cruz, leaders of the
 recently formed Free Art Association (APAL) who testified
 before the Cuba Working Group, were detained by Cuban
 authorities at a private APAL meeting in October. During a
 peaceful demonstration in October, six other APAL members were
 arrested and sentenced to from 6-month to 1-year prison terms
 
 
 522
 CUBA
 for "provocative* activity. Tania Diaz Castro, Secretary
 General of the officially unrecognized Cuban Human Rights
 Party, was involved in an altercation. with prison guards on
 November 29 during a visit to a prisoner at Combinado del Este
 Prison. She was reportedly beaten, and-was sentenced hours
 later to 1 year in prison on charges of disturbing the peace.
 Diaz had presented testimony to the Cuba Working Group in..
 September.
 The revised Penal Code retains internal exile as a sanction
 against convicted offenders, but no instances of forced removal
 or resettlement were reported in 1988. With regard to forced
 or compulsory labor., see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cuban law and trial practices do not meet international
 standards for fair and impartial public trials. The
 Constitution terms the courts independent, yet it explicitly
 subordinates them to the National Assembly and the Council of
 State (Article 122). Judges are elected by the National
 Assembly and its lower-level counterparts. The independence
 of the judiciary is compromised by the de facto subordination
 of the courts to the Communist Party: there is no known case
 in which a Cuban court has successfully ruled against the
 Government on any political or security matter.
 Civil courts exist at three levels--municipal, provincial, and
 the Supreme Court. All civil courts are presided over by
 panels composed of a mixture of professionally prepared judges
 and lay judges.  There is also a system of military tribunals
 which tries certain counterrevolutionary activity cases.
 Cuban law guarantees an accused the right to a defense
 attorney,- whose impartiality and independence are compromised
 by the absence of a private bar association and by ideological
 controls exerted over members of the state-controlled lawyers'
 collectives, especially in defending persons accused of crimes
 against state security. When the legal collectives were
 reorganized in 1984, some 15 percent of then-active attorneys,
 including many active in political cases, were denied
 readmission and thus effectively disbarred. The Association
 of the Bar of the City of New York reviewed the 1987 disbarment
 of Dr. Pablo Llabre Raurell, a zealous defender of the
 politically accused, and found the action appears to have been
 in part retaliation for his vigorous defense in a sensitive
 case. Llabre has been denied any work of a professional
 nature since his disbarment.
 In practice, government-appointed defense attorneys are poorly
 prepared and unsympathetic towards the defendant. In 1988 the
 visiting New York Bar Association delegation observed Cuban
 trials for common crimes and found the counsels ill-prepared
 and unaggressive. Former political prisoners have asserted
 that some clients saw their counsel for only 1 hour before
 trial, and others were unable to meet with counsel at all
 before the trial commenced. Attorneys themselves have been
 imprisoned for defending persons charged with political
 offenses. Attorney Domingo Jorge Delgado was released in May
 after serving an 8-year jail sentence subsequent to his
 defense of a group of asylum seekers. In-some cases former
 political prisoners alleged that the state security officials,
 not the courts, were the ones who really decided the fate of
 the detainee, and who were putting pressure on others involved
 in the judicial process.
 
 
 523
 CUBA
 Defendants have a general right of appeal at the municipal
 level and a conditional right at the provincial level. Cases
 involving the maximum prison term or the death penalty are
 always open to appeal. The Law of Penal Procedure provides
 that an appeal must be presented within 5 days.
 Rules of evidence do not meet generally recognized
 international standards. A trial for political offenses
 ordinarily consists of evidence given by the prosecution's
 witnesses, who are generally employees of state security
 organs. In some cases, the only evidence is the defendant's
 confession, obtained without due process safeguards against
 self-incrimination or coercion. There are usually no defense
 witnesses, although testimony on behalf of the defendant from
 a member of a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution (see
 Section l.f.) may be introduced and may contribute to a
 reduced sentence.
 The revised Penal Code (Law No. 62) implemented in April
 reduced the number of capital offenses and the length of
 sentences in some cases. The new Code does not, however,
 significantly modify the previous definition of political
 offenses, the punishment meted out for political offenses, or
 due process provisions for accused political offenders. Under
 provisions of the revised Code: defense lawyers may be
 excluded until an investigation is completed for reasons of
 state security (Article 249); illegal departure from Cuba
 remains punishable by 3 years' imprisonment or a fine of up to
 approximately $1,300 (Article 216); the prohibition of
 unregistered associations remains (Article 208); "enemy
 propaganda" is still defined vaguely as "written, oral, or any
 other form" of propaganda that incites against "social order,
 international solidarity, or the Socialist state," and is
 punishable by a sentence of up to 8 years (Article 103);
 clandestine printing is illegal and is punishable by a prison
 term of from 3 months to 1 year (Article 210); unregistered
 associations remain prohibited (Article 203); and contempt,
 which includes slander or insults, orally or in writing,
 against the dignity of an authority or public official,
 carries a sentence of between 3 months' and 1 year's
 imprisonment. If the abuse is directed against top government
 officials, the sanction is from 1 to 3 years' imprisonment.
 The concept of "dangerousness" remains intact (Articles 72-89)
 and is vaguely defined as "the special proclivity of a person
 to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest
 contradiction of Socialist norms." If the police determine a
 person is exhibiting such behavior, the offender can be
 brought before a court which may apply police surveillance,
 reeducation, or therapy lasting for from 1 to 4 years.
 Antiregime grafitti can be punished under the contempt
 provision (Article 144).
 The new Penal Code has had little tempering effect on crimes
 involving political offenses. In 1988 Joaquin Jemenez
 Bartelemi was sentenced to 6 months for operating a
 clandestine printing press. The contempt law, which is
 categorized as an offense against administration and
 jurisdiction rather than state security, is reportedly used
 against those caught writing or shouting antigovernment
 slogans.
 
 
 524
 CUBA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Official intrusion into private and family affairs remains one
 of the most repressive and pervasive features of Cuban life.
 The Cuban Government/Communist Party-directed mass
 organizations permeate Cuban society. The State has assumed a
 virtual right of interference and control, even for those who
 do not actively oppose the Government and its practices.
 The extensive apparatus of the Ministry of the Interior
 operates intelligence and police forces, decides on the
 legality of all private and public associations, and utilizes
 an intricate system of informers, block wardens, and block
 committees (Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, CDR)
 to monitor and control public opinion. Police searches are
 often carried out without warrants, as occurred in the homes
 of several human rights activists and dissident artists in
 1988. Telephones are routinely tapped and mail searched.
 The authorities possess a wide range of social controls. One
 example is the use of the Cuban educational system to teach
 that the State's interests have precedence over all other ties
 and commitments. Teachers, selected in part for their
 ideological commitment, espouse Communist Party doctrine and
 can take sanctions against students whose families question
 orthodox opinion. Teachers also assess the political and
 ideological character of their students.
 CDR's are neighborhood surveillance/security committees tasked
 with closely monitoring the daily lives of individual residents
 from an early age.in each neighborhood. Membership and
 participation in the 80,000 CDR's are.essentially involuntary
 in urban-areas. The Government announced the elimination of
 one CDR report on the beliefs of citizens-in 1988, but it is
 doubtful that this change significantly alters the role.of. the
 CDR's-as guardians of ideological conformity. CDR's apparently
 continue to report suspicious activities, such.as contact with
 foreigners, reception of-foreign broadcasting in the home,
 conspicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings, and criticism
 of the Government. In.1988 a government-produced form used to
 record critical comments in overheard conversations, was
 publicized by human-rights activists.
 Former political prisoners are subjected to discriminatory
 treatment. A mark on their identity documents (a triangle
 with the letters *CIRP"), identifying them as former political
 prisoners, makes it difficult for them to obtain employment,
 housing, and ration cards. Former prisoners are often
 relegated to menial, intermittently available work, no matter
 what their education or experience. Their children are
 reportedly harassed in schools and often barred from higher or
 even technical education.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Cuban authorities continue to place very extensive checks and
 controls on freedom of expression. No direct criticism of the
 basic policies and Marxist-Leninist orientation of the
 Government, party, or leadership is allowed. No public forums
 exist for airing one's views apart from the government-
 controlled media. Laws are enforced against antigovernment
 *propaganda," antigovernment grafitti, and slander and insults
 
 
 525
 CUBA
 against government officials. Local CDR's monitor and report
 on expressions of dissent or criticism.
 In 1988 there were signs of a modest increase in official
 tolerance of free expression. A few persons without official
 approval published newsletters or distributed press releases
 on human rights to the foreign and diplomatic community. A
 small "Eco-Pacifist Movement" distributed peace literature.
 Writers and artists were, with caveats, informally encouraged
 to be more experimental; some produced more risque theater
 works. But the Government has taken steps to discourage
 foreign visitors, such as U.S. Congressmen, from meeting with
 dissidents by refusing or threatening to cancel meetings with
 Government officials if the visitor has met with a dissident.
 Over 1,500 persons, some of whom represented domestic human
 rights groups, were allowed to seek to testify before the
 UNHRC Cuba Working Group during its visit in September.
 However, some persons reportedly were discouraged or prevented
 from testifying by the authorities, and the police presence
 near the Cuba Working Group's hotel tended to intimidate those
 who wished to testify.
 There is no free press in Cuba. The electronic and print
 media are owned by the State or party-controlled organizations
 and operate according to party guidelines. Clandestine
 publishing is against the law. Officially, nothing can be
 printed or said that harms the revolution--a dictate which the
 Government applies forcefully and frequently to guarantee its
 monopoly on information.
 The Communist Party furnishes strict guidelines to the media
 through established channels. The media does not comment or
 report on important matters not previously vetted through the
 party. The party's Central Committee provides guidance
 describing the year's political objectives to television and
 radio directors; the guidance for 1988 contained 43 objectives
 listing current sociopolitical, economic, and cultural issues
 of foremost ideological concern to the party.
 Periodicals from non-Communist countries are not available to
 the general public, and foreign broadcasts, apart from the
 U.S. Radio Marti, are not heard by significant numbers of
 people. Listening to Radio Marti, while not a crime, may
 result in serious informal sanctions and pressures from
 neighborhood CDR's. Even some publications from Communist
 countries are limited in circulation when the Government finds
 offense in their content.
 Artistic and literary freedom are also under government
 control. Party and state officials assure that Cuban art and
 literature do not, by implication or otherwise, criticize the
 state leaders. Pedro Luis Ferrer, a popular singer, was banned
 from performing in 1988 after making remarks favoring internal
 reforms in Cuba while on a tour abroad. His records were
 forbidden to be sold or played on the radio. The folk-duo
 Sindo and Maria Elena were chastised and prohibited from
 performing on radio or television for applying to leave the
 country.
 Academic freedom is severely limited. Education is the
 exclusive prerogative of the State, and the school system
 follows Marxist-Leninist precepts as interpreted by government
 guidelines. Academics can write freely only so long as their
 
 
 526
 CUBA
 work does not conflict with any policy or view of the
 Government or party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution does not provide for freedom of assembly or
 association. Apart from recognized churches, which are
 regulated by the Communist Party, and the small, unrecognized
 human rights groups which operate without legal sanction,
 there are no significant Cuban associations with autonomy from
 the State and party.
 The Ministry of Interior determines the legality of all
 organizations. There are legal mechanisms available for
 citizens to petition in order to organize new associations,
 but the Government has refused to recognize any such
 application from a private group for the past 30 years. Both
 the Cuban Human Rights Committee and the Cuban Committee for
 Human Rights and National Reconciliation have filed
 applications for recognition without success.
 There is no known instance in which approval was given to any
 nonchurch group outside of party-run mass organizations to
 hold a public meeting in 1988. Gatherings of more than a few
 people in a home are punishable by up to 3 months in prison.
 Organizers of "illicit or unrecognized groups" can receive a
 sentence of up to 9 months (Article 240 of the Penal Code).
 Membership in government or party-controlled associations,
 such as the CDR's, the Confederation of Cuban Workers, the
 Federation of Cuban Women, and the Union of Communist Youth,
 is expected; various social and economic benefits accrue to
 those having a good record of activity in mass organizations,
 while nonmembers live on the margins of social life.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government places restrictions on practicing religion and
 discriminates against religious believers, despite the
 Constitution's recognition of the rights of citizens to
 profess and practice any religious belief (Article 54).
 Religious believers are implicitly excluded from membership in
 the Communist Party and thus from almost all executive and
 leadership positions, including, for example, posts in the
 Government, courts, and the teaching profession. Religious -
 practitioners also face informal discrimination in the
 workplace, in seeking housing, and in admission-to higher
 education. In the 1985 book,-"Fidel and Religion," and at the
 1986 Third Congress of the Cuban Communist Party, President
 Castro admitted that discrimination exists against Cuban
 citizens practicing religious faiths. Cuban officials more
 recently have stated that the Government and party are working
 to eliminate religious discrimination. A perceived relaxation
 of official attitudes has resulted in small increases in both
 Catholic church attendance and baptisms.
 During 1988 the Government and party made several ad hoc
 concessions to the Catholic Church, including permission to
 augment the just over 200 priests now active in Cuba by some
 20 foreign clergymen, puthorization to operate telex links
 among the diocesan offices in Cuba and with church officials
 overseas, and the granting of the right to purchase a printing
 
 
 527
 CUBA
 press. Protestant churches were also allowed to import 50,000
 Bibles, and the Jewish community was permitted to import kosher
 food and wine for Passover. Cuban authorities tolerated the
 very limited circulation in Havana of La Religion en Cuba, a
 monthly information bulletin published on religion and human
 rights by an independent religious historian and journalist.
 However, churches have not been conceded "rights" but in most
 cases simply granted exceptions.
 Despite some conciliatory actions, the Government and
 Communist Party continued to maintain major restrictions and
 controls on the activities of organized churches.
 Church-state relations are. administered by the Religious
 Affairs Department of the Central Committee of the Cuban
 Communist..Party, which was established in 1985. Churches and
 other religious groups must register with the Government and
 be "recognized." Religious activities are authorized only
 within designated places of worship. Many Catholic and
 Protestant churches have been closed since the revolution, and
 construction of new churches is severely restricted. Four
 Protestant and two Catholic seminaries are allowed to operate,
 but no other religious schools are permitted at any level.
 Atheism rather than tolerance for religious beliefs is taught
 in the schools-and by youth organizations. No access to the
 media exists for churches. The observance of religious
 holidays is difficult, and the celebration of Christmas is
 expressly prohibited.
 The Government does not recognize some fundamentalist
 churches, and certain faiths have been singled out for
 additional punishment. In 1988 the Government still refused
 to register the Jehovah's Witnesses as a religious
 denomination. Its buildings have been confiscated, and
 adherents have been jailed for "illegal" religious
 activities. No exception to military service is made for
 conscientious objectors, although they may be assigned
 noncombat duties; those who refuse to serve for religious
 reasons are jailed. In May an evangelical minister of the
 Assembly of God Church, the Reverend Orson Vila Santoyo, was
 initially sentenced to a 5-month prison term after a trial for
 the illegal practice of medicine and for disorderly conduct
 during a "divine healing" service. On appeal, his sentence
 was reduced to a fine.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on domestic travel, although
 informal restraints continue. Permission is required both to
 leave and to reenter Cuba. Opportunities for nonofficial
 foreign travel are restricted, limited generally to elderly
 persons, church officials, and special humanitarian cases for
 serious family illness or death.
 Cuban authorities strictly control emigratton, but permitted
 several thousand persons, including.hundreds of former
 political prisoners, to leave the island in 1988. Draft-age
 males were generally not allowed to leave the country. During
 1988 the Government continued to deny exit permission without
 explanation to a few persons who had been accepted into
 immigration and refugee admissions programs of other countries.
 It is a crime to leave the country without authorization.
 Persons who attempt to flee on small boats or inner tubes face
 
 
 528
 CUBA
 sanctions ranging from fines to 3 years imprisonment. Cuban
 officials in 1988 claimed there were 140 prisoners convicted
 of "illegal" departure attempts.  Intending legal emigrants
 frequently suffer various forms of government discrimination.
 Persons who apply may lose their jobs, houses, and ration
 books. Some are asked to repay the Government the cost of
 their higher education. Once emigration formalities are -
 completed, all family possessions and property usually fall to
 the State.
 Cubans traveling as emigrants or refugees to other countries
 have no right to return for a visit or repatriation. The
 Government continues to restrict the number of persons of
 Cuban origin permitted to visit their families on the island.
 In October the Government announced that Cubans who emigrated
 after 1978, including those who fled on the Mariel boatlift,
 would be allowed to visit relatives in Cuba on a limited basis
 (initially 10 persons per week). In the past, Mariel refugees
 were routinely denied Cuban entry permits.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have no right to seek to change their government or
 to organize politically except through the Communist Party,
 the only legal party in Cuba. It completely dominates the
 political process under the leadership of Fidel Castro and the
 overlapping party and state hierarchy which has remained
 largely unchanged for 30 years. Members of the highest
 governing bodies, the Politburo and the Central Committee, are
 selected by a small group of party leaders. Although direct
 elections are held to fill municipal offices, provincial
 assemblies and the National Assemibly are elected indirectly.
 All candidates must in effect be approved by the Communist
 Party. Only the party and its affiliated mass organizations
 have the right to distribute political materials or to
 organize electoral meetings.
 When various human rights activists attempted to form the
 nuclei of political parties in the summer of 1988, President
 Castro rejoined in a major speech on July 26 that political
 parties, and the diversity of opinion they would represent,
 could never be tolerated by Cuba's revolutionary Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights monitoring groups are legally
 unrecognized and continue to lead a precarious existence. The
 Government tolerates them but circumscribes their activities
 and has repeatedly detained their members. There are two
 major domestic human rights monitoring groups in Cuba, the
 Cuban Human Rights Committee (CHRC) and the Cuban Committee
 for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (CCDHRN), plus a
 host of smaller human rights-related groups which appeared in
 the course of 1988. In a television interview in March, Fidel
 Castro reiterated that he would never allow his Government to
 recognize a human rights movement in Cuba. The domestic human
 rights groups are regularly excoriated in the
 government-controlled media as "illegal" and "subversive"
 counterrevolutionaries.
 Official policy towards the domestic human rights groups has
 fluctuated between repression and limited tolerance. The
 
 
 529
 CUBA
 Government's treatment of Cuba's two most prominent resident
 human rights activists since 1980 is illustrative: Ricardo
 Bofill, President of the CHRC, was imprisoned for enemy
 propaganda (1980-1982), imprisoned after speaking to French
 journalists (1983-1985), in refuge in the French Embassy for
 fear of arrest (1983; 1986-1987), and repeatedly harassed by
 "irate neighbors" (1987-1988). Bofill claimed he did not
 appear before the UNHRC Cuba Working Group in September
 because of fear of harassment. Bofill emigrated to West
 Germany in October. Elizardo Sanchez, President of CCDHRN and
 former CHRC deputy to Bofill, was imprisoned in the wake of
 French Pr-ss Agency (AFP) and Reuters interviews with a CHRC
 member (1986-1987). In 1988 Sanchez became the first Cuban
 human rights activist allowed to travel abroad, conduct
 interviews with the foreign press, and return to Cuba. He was
 subsequently denied permission to undertake a second trip
 abroad in October.
 Government tolerance of domestic human rights groups increased
 marginally in 1988. Cuban human rights leaders have been
 allowed to meet with foreign journalists and resident diplomats
 since mid-1987 without reprisals beyond vitriolic attacks in
 the press. Members of the CHRC, CCDHRN, and other groups were
 permitted access to the visiting UNHRC Cuba Working Group.
 After the Cuba Working Group visit, however, some human rights
 activists were harassed, arrested, and, in some cases,
 imprisoned for attempts to exercise freedoms of expression and
 assembly.
 In response to growing international pressure, Cuban
 authorities in 1988 permitted entry to several international
 organizations and foreign nongovernmental groups active in
 monitoring human rights practices. Delegations from the
 UNHRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
 AI, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and
 the U.S.-based IPS were allowed to visit Cuba and in many
 cases to tour some prison facilities and to interview inmates.
 Spokespersons for the UNHRC and other visiting delegations
 indicated that, in general, the Government did not impede
 their activities. Cuba has accepted continuing ICRC
 interviews of political prisoners. AI and the New York City
 Bar Association published reports on their observations in
 1988.
 The most significant international visit was made by the Cuba
 Working Group of the UNHRC. The 44th (1988) session of the
 UNHRC in Geneva decided to send a team to investigate human
 rights in Cuba. After initial resistance, the Cuban
 Government extended an invitation to UNHRC observers. A
 6-member UNHRC Cuba Working Group, led by UNHRC Chairman
 Alioune Sene, visited Havana from September 16 to 25 and
 conducted an extensive program of visits and meetings with
 government and party officials, with representatives of
 religious denominations, and with over 89 private Cuban
 citizens, including most of the prominent human rights
 activists. Some 1,500 individuals sought to put forward
 complaints to the group about human rights abuses-. The
 Government, however, imposed measures of intimidation to
 discourage Cubans from testifying before the Cuba Working
 Group and, despite an explicit commitment to the Working
 Group, took repressive actions against some who did testify,
 as described above. The Cuba Working Group's findings will be
 reported to the 45th UNHRC plenary.

 CUBA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution expressly forbids discrimination on the basis
 of race, sex, or national origin, and there were no known
 incidents of direct racial or sexual discrimination during
 1988. Outdated and ambiguous data make it difficult to
 determine statistically how fully racial minorities and women
 are integrated in society. The Third Congress of the Cuban
 Communist Party admitted in 1988 that both racial minorities
 and women are underrepresented in responsible government and
 party positions at all levels. At present about 18 percent of
 the full and alternate members of the Central Committee of the
 party are considered to be of black or mixed race, while these
 minorities appear to constitute roughly half of the general
 population. Eighteen percent of the Central Committee members
 are women.
 Recent social and economic statistics are not issued on the
 basis of race, but Cuban blacks appear to receive lower
 incomes, make up a greater percentage of prison inmates, and
 suffer poorer health than do Cuban whites proportionally.
 The most recent available official labor force statistics show
 women made up 30 percent of the labor force in 1980. Today,
 women appear well represented among medical and some other
 professional ranks, but most women are still engaged in
 traditional female occupations. The Family Code of 1975
 equalized pay scales, reversed sexual discrimination against
 promotions, provided generous maternity leave, and gave
 employed women preferential access to goods and services.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives priority to state or collective needs
 over individual choices regarding free association or provision
 of employment; the decision and choices of workers are
 subordinate to the "demands of the economy and society"
 (Article 44). Cuban labor organizations are not trade unions
 in a strict sense and do not act as a voice for workers'
 rights and benefits. By law, they possess no autonomy or
 rights, including the right to strike. Labor is organized
 under the control of the State and party through the
 Confederation of Cuban Workers (CTC), the umbrella group for.
 organized labor. The CTC is affiliated with the Prague-based
 World Federation of Trade Unions and its regional organization,
 the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America.
 The CTC serves primarily as an instrument of the State to
 enforce political and labor discipline, encourage productivity,
 hold down labor costs, and save raw materials. Some CTC
 member labor organizations have served as debating forums for
 the consideration of a limited range of labor issues such as
 worker safety and local working conditions.
 The right to form an independent union is prohibited, and even
 discussion of such a step is subject to punishment. In 1988
 there was no independent attempt at labor organization
 reported. The most recent known incident of government action.
 against efforts to form an independent union was the 1983 case
 of five workers who discussed an independent union with.
 colleagues and were charged with "industrial sabotage." The
 Government reportedly sought the death penalty in these cases,
 but an international outcry resulted in the eventual
 
 
 531
 CUBA
 commutation of their sentences to 30 years, imprisonment. The
 four defense attorneys in these cases were themselves
 prosecuted and received 30-year sentences. One of the
 lawyers, Aramis Taboada, died in jail in 1985 under
 circumstances which have never been fully disclosed.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Effective collective bargaining does not exist. The State
 Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. There are no known export processing
 zones in Cuba which are exempt from normal labor regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution and the Labor Code do not contain prohibitions
 on forced labor. Governmental restrictions on the freedom to
 choose or change employment are incompatible with International
 Labor Organizations (ILO) conventions banning forced labor.
 There are a series of measures aimed at promoting labor
 discipline and productivity which effectively amount to
 officially sanctioned coercion of workers. Workers do not
 have full freedom to change jobs without official approval.
 Every worker has to present a work identification card in
 seeking a new job. This card contains information on
 performance of "voluntary" work, protection of Socialist
 property, political conscience, failure to meet production
 goals, and negligence. In practice, any job change remains
 under the control of the authorities who grade and evaluate
 employee records that form the basis of the work identity
 cards. Labor requirements imposed on students are described
 in the following section.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age is 17; however, the Labor Code
 provides for exceptions for those aged 15 and 16 to obtain
 vocational training or to fill labor shortages. There is no
 evidence that authorities deviated from these rules in 1988.
 However, all students above the age of 11 are expected to
 devote 30 to 45 days of their summer vacations to agricultural
 work up to a maximum of 8 hours per day.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 During 1988 the Cuban minimum wage remained at $140 per month
 at the overvalued official exchange rate or about $20 in terms
 of black-market buying power, plus a "social wage" consisting
 of free medical care and education, along with subsidized
 housing and food rationed at very low prices. Even with the
 state subsidies, a worker needs to earn substantially more
 than the minimum wage to support a family. Most families make
 ends meet by having two wage earners. The value of the
 "social wage" in improving living standards is somewhat
 negated by the persistent shortages and tight rationing that
 are standard features of the Cuban economy. For example, most
 newly married couples must live with relatives for years
 before obtaining their own housing, the best medical care is
 reportedly allocated according to political loyalty, and the
 suppression of free farmers' markets in 1986 has exacerbated
 food shortages.
 Maximum hours of work are 44 regular hours per week, with
 shorter workdays for unusually demanding jobs such as
 underground mining. Overtime is limited by law and practice,
 
 
 532
 CUBA
 although workers are pressured to engage in additional unpaid
 *voluntary" labor. Workers receive 30 calendar days of
 vacation regardless of seniority or age. Provisions for worker
 safety and control of pollution generally appear inadequate.
 There is a lack of effective control mechanisms to ensure
 worker safety and industrial accidents are apparently frequent.
