 INDONESIA
 Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the world and
 the largest in Southeast Asia. Since independence, Indonesian
 leaders have sought to create a national identity and to
 accommodate ethnic, religious, linguistic, and geographical
 diversities, while fostering cohesion, internal security, and
 development. The Soeharto Government actively promotes
 allegiance to "Pancasila," five broad, guiding principles of
 national life: belief in one supreme God, a just and civilized
 humanity, Indonesian national unity, democracy, and social
 justice.
 President Soeharto and the military wield predominant political
 power; opposition groups exist but in fact have no real chance
 to obtain power. Since the mid-196G's, after an abortive coup
 backed by the Communist Party, retired and active-duty military
 officers and civilian technocrats have exercised centralized
 executive authority under President Soeharto's leadership. The
 partly elected, partly appointed Parliament (DPR) considers but
 does not initiate legislation, although it has the
 constitutional right to do so. The people's consultative
 assembly (MPR)--consisting of 500 appointed members and the 500
 DPR members--meets every 5 years to approve guidelines for
 government policy and to elect the President and Vice President.
 The armed forces (ABRI)L-which include the military services
 and the police--number about 445,000. The army constitutes
 about half of the armed forces and focuses mainly on internal
 security. Under a "dual function" concept, many military
 officers serve in the civilian bureaucracy at all levels and in
 Parliament. The military continued operations against
 separatist groups in East :Timor and'Irian Jaya, although at
 reduced levels, and intensified operations in the special
 district of Aceh. Security forces were responsible for
 numerous human rights abuses, including killings and torture of
 civilians.
 Although Indonesia's mixed economy involves the state in nearly
 all sectors, government policies are expanding the role and
 freedom of the private sector. Ongoing deregulation efforts
 helped the economy to continue its strong expansion in 1990,
 when Indonesia's inflation-adjusted gross domestic product
 (GDP) grew between 7.0 and 7.5 percent. Nonoil export growth
 slowed due to softening prices for Indonesia's major nonoil
 commodities, but exports of manufactured goods remained
 strong. The economy's growth was'expected to diminish in 1991,
 but still to maintain a real GDP'growth rate of between 5 and 6
 percent. Despite substantial increases in real incomes and in
 the standard of living of most Indonesians in the past 20
 years, the country is poor, there is significant unemployment,
 and wide disparities in wealth exist. Corruption and influence
 peddling are endemic and distort growth and economic
 opportunity.
 Insurgent sentiment and activity in Aceh led to the deaths of
 hundreds of civilians, dozens of subversion trials in which the
 rights of the defendants were limited, and numerous credible
 reports of torture at the hands of the police and military.
 Abuses ih Irian Jaya also continued, although at a reduced rate
 from past years. In East Timor, security forces opened fire on
 November 12 on a demonstration protesting Indonesian rule over
 East Timor at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the capital of Dili.
 The demonstration followed a memorial service for a Timorese
 killed on October 28 during a clash between Timorese for and
 against integration with Indonesia. Available evidence
 
 
 860
 INDONESIA
 indicates the violence employed by security forces on November
 12 was clearly disproportionate to the situation. Many believe
 the death toll was far higher than the officially acknowledged
 number of 19. A national investigatory commission was
 appointed to examine the incident. The commission issued an
 advance report on December 26 (see Section l.a.).
 While the DPR held several well-publicized hearings on freedom
 of the press and on the restrited civil rights of some of
 Indonesia's prominent dissidents, the hearings failed to reduce
 abuses in these areas. The DPR remained subordinate to the
 executive and the right of citizens to change their government
 remained significantly restricted. Official and informal
 discrimination against ethnic Chinese persisted. Indonesian
 workers were less hesitant about exercising their right to
 strike, especially to demand compliance with minimum wage
 standards. The Government continued its generous policy toward
 Indochinese refugees, allowed foreign parliamentary groups to
 visit East Timor, and released several long-time political
 prisoners. It also granted the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) access to prisoners in Aceh and to imprisoned
 Muslim extremists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and-Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have died in the special
 district of Aceh since mid-1989 as a result of a struggle
 between separatist rebels and government troops. The
 casualties, whose numbers have so far been impossible to
 establish with precision, have included police and army troops
 as well as rebel forces. A significant number of those killed
 in 1991, however, appear to have been civilians. During the
 first 6 morfths of 1991, dozens of bodies were found along
 roadsides, in market places, and in rivers. The military and
 other government leaders have claimed that rebel forces, which
 are called GPK (Security Disturbing Gangs) by the Government
 and Aceh Merdeka (Free Aceh) by their supporters, were
 responsible for these deaths. However, the ability of the
 rebel forces to inflict significant civilian casualties was
 severely limited in 1991 since, by the military's own
 assessment, most of the armed rebel elements had been
 eliminated or rendered ineffective. In fact, there are
 credible reports of a pattern of abuse against the civilian
 population of Aceh by security forces. Human rights groups
 have charged the security forces with serious violations of
 human rights in their anti-insurgency campaign in Aceh,
 especially during the first half of 1991. These include
 summary executions of suspected Aceh Merdeka supporters--part
 of an effort to intimidate or eliminate potential rebel
 sympathizers--as well as the incitement of villagers to
 summarily kill suspected guerrillas. Substantiation of
 individual cases is often lacking, and rebel forces doubtless
 have caused some civilian deaths, but government forces clearly
 appear responsible for the majority of these civilian deaths.
 While some military commanders have acknowledged privately that
 excessive force was sometimes employed by their troops, the
 Government has denied a pattern of abuse, and no charges have
 been brought against members of the security forces in
 connection with the civilian deaths.
 
 
 861
 INDONESIA
 In East Timor, where a shift from security operations to civic
 action projects by the armed forces had brought about a gradual
 reduction in human rights abuses, the situation deteriorated
 sharply beginning in October. On October 28, shortly after a
 proposed visit by Portuguese parliamentarians was canceled, a
 clash between youths for and against integration with Indonesia
 resulted in the deaths of two youths, one from each faction.
 After a memorial service for the anti-integration youth on
 November 12 in Dili, a procession formed to go to the cemetery
 where he had been buried. Some demonstrators carried flags of
 the Fretilin guerrilla group and chanted anti-Indonesia
 slogans. During the course of the march to the cemetery an
 army major was stabbed. After the procession reached the
 cemetery, security forces opened fire on the crowd, killing and
 wounding scores of civilians. There is no evidence that the
 use of such deadly force was justified. In addition, the
 acknowledged 19 killed were buried in unmarked graves and, for
 12 days after the incident, the army denied the ICRC access to
 the military hospital to which the dead and wounded had been
 taken.
 Within a week, President Soeharto appointed senior government
 officials to a national commission to investigate the incident,
 the first such commission in Indonesian history. The
 commission spent more than 2 weeks investigating in East
 Timor. In a preliminary report presented on December 26, the
 commission concluded that "about" 50 had been killed and
 acknowledged some eyewitness reports that the total was over
 100. The commission said that more than the previous official
 figure of 91 were wounded. The report went on to state that
 "the acts of a number of armed forces members'exceeded the
 bounds of appropriateness," and called for legal measures to be
 taken against all those suspected of violating Indonesian law.
 Two days after the issuance of the report, President Soeharto
 ordered that the military commanders in East Timor and the
 larger region which includes East Timor be relieved. He also
 ordered the Army Chief of Staff to form an "honorary council"
 to investigate how security forces handled the incident.
 In Irian Jaya, a leader of the banned Free Papua Organization
 (OPM), Malkranus Salosa, was found dead in the jungle 3 weeks
 after allegedly escaping from a military prison. Salosa was
 convicted in March of involvement in a 1988 attack on
 transmigrants in Irian Jaya and sentenced to life in prison.
 Salosa was buried on the spot by the military, allegedly with
 his family's approval. There reportedly was no autopsy or
 independent observation of the body.
 b. Disappearance
 Security forces periodically took'persons for interrogation,
 usually without notification to families, resulting in at least
 their temporary disappearance. This was especially true in
 Aceh, where people would sometimes disappear for months after
 being taken into police custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The use of torture to extract information from criminal
 suspects or witnesses is prohibited under the Indonesia
 Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP). Nonetheless, credible
 reports of torture and mistreatment, including rape, of
 criminal suspects, detainees, and prisoners were frequent.
 
 
 862
 INDONESIA
 This was especially true in Aceh, where there were numerous
 credible reports of systematic torture of suspected rebel
 symphathizers while in military or police custody.
 Police often resort to physical abuse, even in minor incidents,
 and prison conditions in Indonesia tend to be harsh. Pretrial
 maltreatment to obtain confessions is reportedly common. The
 practice in Medan of "shooting to wound" criminal suspects
 allegedly attempting to escape capture, and efforts by police
 in Jakarta to cope with increasingly brutal crimes raised
 concerns about excessive use of force against suspects. In
 August, for example, credible press reports indicate that 17
 suspects were shot by police in metropolitan Jakarta, 8 of whom
 died from their wounds. Nine other criminal suspects were
 reportedly killed by mobs who caught the suspects in the act of
 committing a crime.
 Officials have publicly acknowledged and condemned police
 brutality and harsh prison conditions and occasionally
 instigate disciplinary action, including transfer, dismissal,
 trial, and sentencing to prison terms. However, there were no
 known instances in 1991 of officials being punished for
 mistreatment of political prisoners or detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 While the KUHAP contains protections against arbitrary arrest
 and detention and specifies the right of prisoners to legal
 counsel and notification of family, these safeguards are often
 disregarded in practice. Detainees in cases of alleged
 subversion may be held up to a year without charges. Security
 agencies detain and arrest persons, including students and
 intellectuals, to intimidate them and inhibit activities judged
 undesirable. Legal mechanisms for redress of such actions are
 inadequate. The number of persons detained without trial is
 unknown, but in the Special District of Aceh the Government
 during the year released more than 600 people who had been held
 without trial for periods of up to several months on suspicion
 of subversive activity or knowledge thereof, and up to 100 more
 were believed to still be in custody at year's end. People
 were detained in East Timor for days or weeks and subsequently
 released without charges. Application of a 1987 presidential
 decree on remission of prison terms leaves uncertain the status
 of some prisoners, including several reportedly still in jail
 despite apparent expiration of their sentences. Two convicted
 members of the banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) were
 released in July, several years after their sentences were
 supposed to have expired.
 The Agency for Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation
 of National Security (BAKORSTANAS) operates outside the KUHAP
 and has wide discretion to detain and interrogate persons
 thought to threaten national security. Indonesian law does not
 provide for the right to judicial reyiew of such actions or for
 the right to protection or legal aid for the detainees. Their
 cases are rarely if ever publicized.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A quadripartite judiciary of general, religious, military, and
 administrative courts exists below the Supreme Court. The
 right of appeal from District Court to High Court to Supreme
 Court exists in all four systems of justice. The Supreme
 Court, with a current backlog of some 17,000 cases, does not
 consider factual aspects of a case, only the lower courts'
 
 
 863
 INDONESIA
 application of law. Initial judgments are rarely reversed in
 the appeals process, although sentences are sometimes increased
 or reduced. A three-judge panel conducts most trials, poses
 questions, hears evidence, decides guilt or innocence, and
 assesses punishment. The judiciary is not independent. While
 judges receive guidance from the Supreme Court on legal
 matters, they are civil servants employed by the executive
 branch. The Supreme Court cannot annul laws passed by
 Parliament. Most court sessions are open to the public, and
 most defendants have access to counsel although such access is
 sometimes significantly delayed. Destitute defendants can
 obtain private legal help, such as that provided by the Legal
 Aid Institute (LBH). Courts also can provide a limited amount
 of aid for those unable to afford legal assistance, but in
 practdce such aid is limited to defendants facing charges
 carrying sentences of 5 years or more. The State must ensure
 legal assistance in capital cases.
 Corruption permeates the Indonesian legal system. In civil and
 criminal cases, the payment of bribes can influence decisions,
 prosecution, conviction, and sentencing. The use in trials of
 forced confessions and limitations on the presentation of
 defense evidence are reportedly common. The Government has
 occasionally taken action against flagrant offenders, but by
 and large these abuses continue unchecked. The Government
 supports programs to improve legal awareness, training, and
 research. Conviction is virtually automatic in cases involving
 Indonesia's broad 1963 antisubversion law. Advocacy or actions
 in support of secession or creation of an Islamic state,
 criticism of Pancasila, and smuggling are classified as
 subversive offenses subject to a maximum penalty of death.
 Although the Government does not provide data on the number of
 persons serving subversion sentences, the best informed
 estimates suggest a total of more than 500. This figure
 includes persons sentenced for involvement in the 1965
 Communist coup attempt, alleged Muslim extremists, and those
 convicted of subversion in connection with separatist
 activities in Aceh, East Timor, and Irian Jaya, some of whom
 advocated or employed violence. In August the Government
 reduced the sentences of and released four persons convicted of
 subversion, including three Muslims accused of delivering
 inflammatory sermons in connection with the Tanjung Priok riots
 of 1984.
 More than 30 subversion trials were conducted in 1991, the
 majority of them in Sumatra, where more than two dozen people
 were tried in connection with separatist activities in Aceh.
 All were found guilty and received sentences of up to 20 years
 in prison. Although the fact that public trials were held
 represented an improvement over an earlier situation in which
 accused Aceh separatists were held without trial, the
 proceedings were in many cases seriously flawed. There are
 credible reports that many of the defendants had been tortured
 to elicit confessions, were arrested without warrants, and were
 not clearly told the crimes with which they were charged. Some
 of the defendants were unable to select their defense counsel
 freely, as guaranteed under KUHAP. The LBH, for example, had
 received powers of attorney from the families of 13 of the
 defendants asking for representation but was prevented by the
 authorities from doing so in all but one case. When other
 attorneys were found to represent them, they often met their
 clients on the day of the trial, and therefore had inadequate
 time to prepare a defense.
 
 
 864
 INDONESIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases
 involving suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by security
 agencies reportedly occurs regularly. Security agencies
 intimidate by conducting surveillance of persons and
 residences, and they are believed to monitor selectively local
 and international telephone calls without legal restraint.
 Correspondence generally is not monitored. Government security
 officials monitor the movements and activities of former
 members of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and its front
 organizations, especially persons the Government believes were
 involved in the abortive 1965 Communist-backed coup. The
 Government stated in late 1990 that this latter group then
 totaled 1,410,333 people. These persons and sometimes their
 relatives are subject to surveillance, required check--ins, and
 arbitrary actions by officials, including removal from
 government employment and threats of removal from such
 employment.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Significant restrictions on freedom of speech and press exist.
 Government agencies exercise broad discretionary authority in
 applying laws concerning the rights of persons, and effective
 judicial review is lacking. Public statements or publications
 which criticize the Government or are perceived as critical of
 Pancasila, top leaders, their families, or particular religious
 and ethnic groups are often harshly punished. For example, a
 young Moslem intellectual, M.H. Ainun Nadjib, was banned by
 authorities in central Java from holding lectures in the
 province apparently because of comments he made during a public
 discussion about the effectiveness of a government-run civics
 course on Pancasila. Earlier in the year, two students were
 detained and others questioned for their part in distributing a
 "land for the people" calendar that contained caricatures of
 President Soeharto, his wife, and other government officials.
 The Government operates the nationwide television network.
 Private television companies broadcasting in Jakarta and
 Surabaya expanded to other areas, and a private educational
 channel began operating nationally. Some 537 private radio
 broadcasting companies exist in Indonesia in addition to the
 Government's national radio network. Private television and
 radio stations, which have considerable programming latitude,
 are subject to official scrutiny and are required to use
 government-provided news programs. Private radio stations
 frequently supplement such news programs with their own
 reports. Foreign television and radio broadcasts are
 accessible to those who can afford the technology.
 The print media are largely privately owned. Officials state
 that the press is "free" but also "responsible." It is
 expected to support national development and stability, be
 educational, and uphold professional standards. The Government
 limits the number of newspaper licenses, the amount of
 advertising, and the number of pages, and exercises strong
 control over the press through its control of publishing
 permits, known by their Indonesian acronym, SIUPP. The power
 of the Government to revoke a newspaper's SIUPP was the topic
 of a parliamentary hearing in June. Editors who testified
 
 
 865
 INDONESIA
 protested that the Minister of Information has revoked SIUPP's
 in the past without giving the offending publications an
 adequate chance to defend themselves. They also protested
 punishing an entire organizationt for the alleged sins of one or
 several individuals. The Minister later told Parliament he had
 no intention of modifying his control over the SIUPP. A
 newspaper editor whose newspaper lost its SIUPP in 1990 for
 publishing a poll which was judged insulting to the Prophet
 Muhammad was sentenced in April to 5 years in prison, later
 reduced by 6 months, on criminal charges of insulting a
 religion.
 The Government occasionally censors publications and continues.
 the practices of telephoning editors to suppress stories and
 censoring foreign periodicals. An article about East Timorese
 workers in Java that was to appear in the prominent news weekly
 TEMPO, for example, was censored in early-September at the
 insistence of military officers who came to the magazine's
 offices.
 The Government closely regulates access to Indonesia by
 visiting and resident foreign correspondents and occasionally
 reminds the latter of its prerogative to deny requests for visa
 extensions. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, for
 example, was allowed to reopen a bureau in Jakarta after a
 lengthy break caused by controversy over Australian media
 coverage of Indonesia. The importation of foreign publications
 and video tapes, which must be reviewed by government censors,
 requires a permit. Importers usually avoid foreign materials
 critical of the Government or dealing with topics considered
 sensitive, such as human rights. Foreign periodicals and
 newspapers, readily available in Indonesia, are subject to
 censorship prior to distribution. The International Herald
 Tribune was allowed to resume distribution in March after a
 4-month hiatus caused by a 1990 article critical of the
 business dealings of members of the President's family. When
 the Government expressed outrage at the article, the
 newspaper's Indonesian distributor ceased distribution.
 The risk of official sanctions and informal government
 instructions generally influence the media to avoid or exercise
 great caution in disseminating views of government critics.
 However, coverage of opposition views conveyed to the
 Parliament in July during a meeting with the Petition of 50
 dissident group was extensive. Lack of clear guidelines on
 what is permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press.
 However, as in 1990, the limits of government tolerance were
 regularly tested in 1991 in published editorials, opinion
 pieces, cartoons, and public statements.
 While academic freedom is provided for in law, constraints
 exist on the activities of scholars. They sometimes refrain
 from producing materials which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers are often unwilling to
 accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues, and those
 that do sometimes find works banned long after they have been
 published. For example, an Indonesian translation of a
 Japanese scholar's work on Indonesia was banned in September, a
 year after its publication, because the Government felt it
 discredited President Soeharto. This was one of at least 15
 books the Government banned in 1991.
 
 
 866
 INDONESIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations must have government permission to hold
 regional and national meetings. Local jurisdictions often
 require prior approval for smaller gatherings as well. While
 obtaining such approvals is fairly automatic, authorities
 occasionally withhold permission. The Indonesian Lawyers
 Association, for example, was unable to get government
 permission to hold its national meeting. Meetings of
 nongovernmental organizations are sometimes subject to
 substantial official efforts to produce specific outcomes.
 Student gatherings have often been the target of disapprovals,
 and ostensible political activity at universities remains
 forbidden under the "Campus Life Normalization" (NKK) law of
 1978. The Government also banned political campaigning from
 university campuses in connection with the 1992 parliamentary
 elections.
 The 1985 Social Organizations (ORMAS) Law requires all
 organizations, including recognized religions and associations,
 to adhere to Pancasila. This provision, which limits political
 activity, is widely understood as prohibiting groups which seek
 to make Indonesia an Islamic state. The law empowers the
 Government to disband any organization it believes to be acting
 against Pancasila and requires prior government approval for
 any organization's acceptance of funds from foreign donors.
 Government attitudes towards human rights groups varied.
 Jakarta police in August entered a private home without a
 warrant and broke up a gathering of members of the dissident
 group known as the Petition of 50. The meetings had been held
 weekly in the same home for nearly 11 years without prior
 incidents. At the same time, three new discussion groups
 concerned with promoting democracy and human rights were formed
 and operated without government interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution recognizes and provides for religious freedom
 for Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and permits
 practice of the mystical, animistic beliefs of "Aliran
 Kepercayaan." Although the population is overwhelmingly
 Muslim, the practice and teachings of the other recognized
 faiths are.respected. The Catholic Church, for example,
 operates widely in East Timor, but the activities of some of
 its clergy are carefully monitored by security forces concerned
 with their political sympathies. Various restrictions on
 religious activity nonetheless exist. According to official
 statistics, nearly 400 "misleading religious cults" are banned,
 including some Islamic groups considered heretical. Existing
 bans affect many thousands of adherents, and new bannings by
 national or local authorities occur periodically. Ten of the
 books banned by the Government in 1991 concerned religious
 topics.
 Although banned, several thousand Jehovah's Witnesses are
 believed to practice in Jakarta alone. Adherents are
 periodically detained and their religious materials
 confiscated. A 1963 ban on the Baha'i faith continues in
 force. The private practice of banned religions is often
 tolerated, although authorities-periodically harass adherents
 or pressure them to convert to the recognized faiths. Because
 the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme being,
 atheism is forbidden. The legal requirement to adhere to
 Pancasila extends to all religious and secular organizations.
 
 
 867
 INDONESIA
 The Government strongly opposes Muslim groups which advocate
 establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only Islamic
 law, both of which are outlawed. Over 300 and possibly many
 more alleged Muslim extremists are estimated to be serving
 prison terms on subversion charges. Visiting Muslim
 fundamentalist teachers have been particularly susceptible to
 deportation.
 There is no legal bar to conversion between faiths, and
 conversions occur. However, proselytizing between the
 recognized religions or in areas heavily dominated by one
 recognized religion or another is considered potentially
 disruptive 'and is discouraged. Foreign missionary activities
 are relatively unimpeded. In recent years, however, some
 foreign missionaries have had difficulty renewing visas or
 residence permits--a few on unspecified "security grounds."
 Laws and decrees from the 1970's do not allow foreign
 missionaries to spend more than 10 years in Indonesia, with
 extensions to 15 in exceptional circumstances only. With rare
 exceptions, enforcement of this policy does not discriminate by
 sect or nationality. Exceptions to the 10-year rule have been
 granted to foreign religious 'workers since late 1987 in the
 remote areas of Irian Jaya and Kalimantan and, more recently,
 in other parts of the country. The Government says it intends
 over time to reduce the number of foreign missionaries in order
 to encourage employment of Indonesians. Foreign missionary
 work is subject to the funding stipulations of the ORMAS law
 discussed above. Indonesians practicing the recognized
 religions maintain active links with coreligionists inside and
 outside Indonesia and travel abroad for religious gatherings.
 The Government permits a set number of pilgrims to make the
 hajj annually.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Restrictions on freedom of movement exist. 'Permits to seek
 work in a new location are required in certain areas, primarily
 to control further population movement to crowded cities.
 Previously some ethnic Chinese encountered legal and
 bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining citizenship, although the
 Government's stated policy was to encourage them to apply. In
 connection with the 1990 renewal of diplomatic ties between
 Indonesia and China, officials announced that stateless
 Chinese--currently estimated to number 300,000--must adopt the
 citizenship of one country or the other and that Indonesia's
 procedures would be simplified and shortened. Restrictions on
 travel to China were lifted by the Government in August.
 Government officials acknowledged that some 17,000 Indonesians
 are under an absolute foreign travel ban. Included in this
 group are former political prisoners and government critics
 such as some members of the Petition of 50. Officials also
 acknowledged that a second list exists of persons whose
 permission to travel is decided only when they apply for an.
 exit permit. Some critics, however, are free to travel abroad,
 and a person prohibited at one time may be permitted to travel
 subsequently. Students wishing and able to do so can generally
 go abroad for study. Restrictions exist on movement by
 Indonesian and foreign citizens to and within parts of Irian
 Jaya. Security checks affecting transportation and travel in
 Aceh occurred sporadically in early 1991, and permission was
 required to visit certain districts considered sensitive for
 security reasons. Curfews were sometimes in force in
 connection with military operations in parts of East Timor and
 
 
 868
 INDONESIA
 Aceh. Family visits back to East Timor by East Timorese now
 living in Australia continued. Former political detainees,
 including those associated with the abortive 1965 coup, must
 notify authorities of their movements and may not change their
 place of residence without official permission.
 Indonesia continued its generous attitude regarding Indochinese
 asylum seekers. It has granted first asylum to over 123,000
 Indochinese asylum seekers since 1975, and the population of
 its Galang Island facility was about 20,000 through most of
 1991. Galang's Cambodian population was about 1,750.
 Indonesia considers the Cambodians illegal entrants rather than
 asylum seekers. Nevertheless, Cambodians have been allowed to
 remain in Indonesia, pending an international decision on how
 to resolve their situation. Indonesia also continued its
 cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and the ICRC on the return of residents of Irian Jaya
 who had fled to Papua New Guinea during separatist violence in
 the eastern portion of the province.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Parliament, political organizations, and the general public
 have only limited ability to influence government decisions,
 and citizens cannot change the system of government or its
 leadership. President Soeharto and a small group of active
 duty and retired military officers and civilian officials
 exercise governmental authority. The military has
 responsibility under a "dual function" doctrine for national
 defense and security plus sociopolitical affairs. The military
 is predominant in the political and security fields. The
 Constitution provides Parliament a mechanism to call the
 President to account in extraordinary circumstances.
 The Parliament considers bills presented to it by government
 departments and agencies but does not draft laws on its own,
 although it has the constitutional right to do so. The
 Government seeks to resolve potential parliamentary concerns
 before bills are officially presented. Parliament makes
 technical and (occasionally) substantive alterations to bills
 it reviews. Through consultations and hearings with ministers
 and other executive branch officials, press statements, and
 field trips, Parliament is contributing more actively to the
 content and execution of government policy than previously.
 This was especially true in 1991, when debates over "openness,"
 press control, land tenure, travel restrictions, and the role
 of Parliament itself were given wide publicity. Nonetheless,
 Parliament remains clearly subordinate to the executive
 branch.
 Only three political organizations are allowed by law. GOLKAR,
 a government-sponsored organization of diverse functional
 groups, dominates. Two small political parties--the United
 Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian Democratic Party
 (PDI)--also operate. By law they embrac6 Pancasila. They are
 not considered opposition parties and seldom espouse policies
 much different from those of the Government. The leaders of
 all these organizations are approved, if not chosen, by the
 Government, and their activities are closely scrutinized and
 often guided by government authorities. GOLKAR maintains close
 institutional links with the armed forces and KORPRI, the
 nonunion association to which all civil servants automatically
 belong. Civil servants may join either of the political
 parties with official permission, but most are members of
 
 
 869
 INDONESIA
 GOLKAR. Former members of the PKI and some other banned
 parties may not run for office or be active politically.
 General elections for Parliament and for provincial and
 district assemblies are held every 5 years. GOLKAR won 73
 percent of the national vote in the 1987 elections. New
 elections are scheduled to be held in June 1992. All adult
 citizens are eligible to vote, except active-duty members of
 the armed forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences,
 and 36,345 former PKI members. Voters may choose by secret
 ballot between the three approved political organization, who
 field candidate lists in each electoral district. Those lists
 must be screened by BAKORSTANAS (see Section l.d. above), which
 determines whether candidates were "involved in the abortive
 1965 Communist coup or adhere to other banned ideologies.
 Critics charge these screenings are unconstitutional, since
 there is no way to appeal the results, and note that.they can
 be used to eliminate government critics from Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government generally ignores calls by domestic human rights
 groups and activists for investigations of alleged human rights
 incidents. While various domestic organizations and persons
 interested in human rights operate energetically, the
 Government discourages public human rights activities. Some
 human rights activists have complained of government harassment.
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Amnesty International, for example, is banned from
 Indonesia. Nonetheless, the Government granted the ICRC access
 to political prisoners arrested in connection with the
 insurgency in Aceh and to jailed Muslim extremists. Under a
 1985 agreement, the ICRC is authorized by the Government to
 visit persons held for security reasons in East Timor.
 Nonetheless, the ICRC experienced significant delays in gaining
 access to those wounded or imprisoned, in the November 12 East
 Timor incident, and in getting permission to revisit prisoners
 in Aceh first seen in July. The ICRC annually visits and
 interviews the prisoners convicted of participation in the
 abortive, Communist-backed coup in 1965.
 Various foreign parliamentary groups visited trouble spots such
 as Aceh and East Timor, although a November visit by Portuguese
 parliamentarians to East Timor was canceled at the last minute
 because of a dispute over the inclusion of a foreign journalist
 the Indonesian Government considered biased. The prospects for
 a Portuguese visit were unclear at year's end. The U.N..
 Special Rapporteur for Torture visited Jakarta and East Timor
 in November, but a workshop on human rights jointly sponsored
 by the Government and the United Nations was postponed at the
 latter's initiative in December.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Indonesians exhibit considerable tolerance for ethnic, racial,
 and major religious differences, with the important exception
 of official and informal discriminatiod against ethnic
 Chinese. Since 1959 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied
 the right to run businesses in rural Indonesia. Regulations
 prohibit the operation of all-Chinese schools for ethnic
 
 
 870
 INDONESIA
 Chinese citizens, formation of exclusively Chinese cultural
 groups or trade associations, and public display of Chinese
 characters. Chinese-language publications, with the exception
 of one officially sanctioned daily newspaper, can neither be
 imported nor produced domestically. Private instruction in
 Chinese is discouraged but takes place to a limited extent. No
 laws prohibit speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy
 stress on the learning and use of the national language, Bahasa
 Indonesia.
 Many people of Chinese ancestry have nonetheless been
 successful in business and the professions, and the enforcement
 of restrictions is often haphazard. Some ethnic Chinese have
 enjoyed particular government favor. Social and religious
 groups exist which are, in effect, all-Chinese and not
 proscribed. Jakarta authorities have ended the practice of
 marking local identification cards to indicate Chinese
 ethnicity. However, 1991 saw a rise in anti-Chinese feeling in
 many quarters of Indonesian society, particularly against the
 affluent Chinese.
 Under the law, and as President Soeharto and other officials
 periodically affirm, women are equal to and have the same
 rights, obligations, and opportunities as men. Some Indonesian
 women enjoy a high degree of economic and social freedom and
 occupy important mid-level positions in the civil service,
 educational institutions, labor organizations, the military,
 the professions, and private business. Although women
 constitute one quarter of the civil service, they occupy only a
 small fraction of the service's top posts. Women make up about
 40 percent of the overall work force, with the majority in the
 rural sector. Despite legal guarantees of equal treatment,
 women seldom receive equal pay for equal work and
 disproportionately experience illiteracy, poor health, and
 nutrition. Traditional attitudes which limit women's
 aspirations, activities, and status undercut state policy in
 some areas. Several voluntary, private groups work actively to
 advance women's legal, economic, social, and political rights
 and acknowledge some success in gaining official cognizance of
 their concerns.
 Violence against women is an acknowledged though inadequately
 documented problem. The Government has recognized domestic
 violence as a problem in Indonesian society and provides some
 counseling, as do several private organizations. However,
 cultural, social, psychological, and other factors inhibit
 reporting of such abuse and recourse by victims to counseling
 and legal protection.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Private sector workers, including those in export-processing
 zones, are free to form or join unions without previous
 authorization, but in order to bargain on behalf of employees a
 union must meet the requirements for legal recognition and
 register with the Ministry of Manpower. The requirements for
 legal recognition are representation in at least 20 of the 27
 provinces, branch offices in at least 100 districts, and 1,000
 local units at plant level. The unions draw up their own
 constitutions and rules and elect their representatives while
 under close government scrutiny and subject to government
 approval prior to registration. Less than 6 percent of the
 estimated 78-million-member work force is organized. The All
 
 
 871
 INDONESIA
 Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI), which groups together private
 sector workers, is the only recognized intersectoral trade
 union body. In 1990 the SPSI reorganized into 13 autonomous
 divisions, covering broad industrial sectors and specialized
 institutes. It has about 10,000 local units at the plant level
 and claims over 3 million members, although only about 900,000
 actually pay dues.
 In November 1990, a number of human rights campaigners created
 the Setia Kawan (Solidarity) free trade union, alleging that
 the SPSI had failed to defend worker interests adequately.
 While the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
 Affairs initially stated that the Government would not approve
 the new trade union when it sought to, register because to do so
 would violate the Government's single-trade union policy, he
 later indicated that the Government would tolerate the new
 organization if it did not do anything illegal. The Government
 has made no formal move to ban Setia Kawan. However, the Setia
 Kawan is not able to function as a labor union since it does
 not meet the requirement for legal recognition referred to
 above. Setia Kawan organizers have been harassed, and in June
 Secretary General Saut Aritonang reported he was abducted by
 armed men and detained for several days. Prior to this
 incident, Aritonang had indicated he would be going to Geneva
 to bring Setia Kawan's case before the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) during the ILO's annual International Labor
 Conference at which the Indonesian Minister of Manpower would
 be president of the conference. The Indonesian Government has
 denied responsibility for Aritonang's disappearance, and
 Aritonang has not publicly speculated on the identity of his
 abductors.
 Prior to the 1990 SPSI National Congress; the Joint Secretariat
 of Industrial Unions carried out certain limited trade union
 functions which excluded collective bargaining. At the .1990
 Congress, however, a number of its principal leaders rejoined
 the SPSI and, while the Joint Secretariat continues to exist in
 name, it is not a functioning organization.
 In 1990 the Teachers' Association (PGRI) was allowed to
 register as a trade union with exclusive jurisdiction for this
 sector. The PGRI, which consists of 1.3 million teachers,
 including teachers in religious, private, and'public schools,
 has representation in all 27 provinces. It has not, however,
 attempted to bargain over wages and working conditions,
 preferring its traditional role of working with the Government
 to pursue the interests of its members. Some PGRI. officials
 are employees of the Ministry of Education.
 State enterprise employees and civil servants, including public
 school teachers, must belong to KORPRI, a nonunion association
 whose Central Development Council is chaired by the Minister of
 Home Affairs. In 1990, for the first time, a KORPRI subunit
 successfully negotiated four collective bargaining agreements
 with the state-owned coal company.
 The Government and employers have considerable influence over
 SPSI affairs; a retired military lieutenant colonel and GOLKAR
 district chairman with some prior union experience is chairman
 of the largest provincial branch of the SPSI, primarily due to
 government backing. The Minister of Manpower is a member of
 the SPSI Consultative Council. SPSI officials are pressured to
 join GOLKAR, and GOLKAR members dominate the SPSI leadership.
 Several SPSI leaders are in the DPR and are members of the
 GOLKAR faction.
 
 
 872
 INDONESIA
 Under the ORMAS law (see Section 2.b.), government approval is
 needed for meetings outside union headquarters. Permission is
 routinely given. A union may be dissolved if the Government
 believes it is acting against Pancasila. There are no laws or
 regulations laying out the procedures for the dissolution of a
 union, and there have been no cases of union dissolution. The
 SPSI is free to maintain international contacts.
 While Pancasila principles call for labor-management
 differences to be settled by consensus, all organized workers,
 with the exception of civil servants, have a legal right to
 strike. However, before a strike can occur in the private
 sector, the law requires intensive mediation by the Ministry of
 Manpower and prior notice regarding the intent to strike. Most
 disputes are settled through negotiation and consensus, due in
 part at least to fear of police and employer retaliation. In
 1991 there was a significant increase in the number of strikes,
 especially on the part of workers demanding employer compliance
 with the legal minimum wage. In a number of instances, the
 military or police were called to the scene of the strike. The
 nature of military and police involvement at work stoppage
 sites has been varied. Most often the security forces have
 limited themselves to protecting property and preventing
 violence, although there have been reports of conscious
 attempts to intimidate strikers. Their mere presence has no
 doubt had a dampening effect on the willingness of workers to
 pursue strike or other protest activity. However, there have
 also been reports that military officers have attempted to
 mediate at strike sites and worked to settle disputes to which
 they were called.
 The largest strike, involving approximately 12,000 workers
 engaged in the manufacture of automobile tires in the
 industrial area west of Jakarta, prompted the Minister of
 Political Affairs and Security to charge that "would-be heroes"
 and other unnamed parties were behind the recent strikes. On
 several occasions the Minister of Manpower stated the strikes
 were the result of workers' increasing awareness of their legal
 rights. During the first 11 months of 1991, there were 112
 officially recorded strikes compared to 45 for all of 1990.
 Most of these strikes were wildcat and so technically illegal,
 but there were no reports of strike leaders or workers being
 prosecuted for conducting them. Many strikes occur suddenly
 and without prior attempts to resolve problems and may not be
 included in official statistics. There have been a few reports
 of employer retaliation against strike leaders, but this seems
 to be the exception and not the rule. Most strikes are settled
 relatively quickly and all workers return to work.
 Strike outcomes varied. In some cases employers have quickly
 complied with worker demands that salaries be increased to the
 legal minimum wage. Others have been less successful with
 workers returning to work with only partial gains or none at
 all.
 In practice there are no clear, established procedures
 regarding the settlement of disputes. If'the parties cannot
 settle the matter, it is usually submitted to the Ministry of
 Manpower's Mediation and Conciliation Service. If the parties
 do not accept the mediator's decision, the mediator or either
 party may submit the matter to tripartite (government,
 employers, employees) administrative tribunals or to
 arbitration. The Minister of Manpower may nullify the
 decisions of administrative tribunals on legal or national
 interest grounds. Although technically the Minister's
 
 
 873
 INDONESIA
 decisions may be appealed to the courts, in practice it is
 rarely done.
 Indonesia has for many years been the subject of complaints in
 the ILO regarding the ban on organizing public sector unions,
 insufficient protection against antiunion discrimination,
 restrictions on the registration of trade unions and collective
 bargaining, and the exercise of the right to strike. The ILO
 Conference in June again regretted that IndonesiAn law was
 still not in conformity with the requirements of ILO Convention
 98, which Indonesia has ratified.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collelctive bargaining is provided for by law, but only
 registered trade unions can engage in it. The Ministry of
 Manpower vigorously promotes collective bargaining as an
 instrument of industrial relations in accordance with
 Pancasila. The overwhelming majority of the SPSI's collective
 bargaining agreements are negotiated and concluded bilaterally
 with employers. Once notified that 25 employees have joined a
 registered union, the employer is under an obligation to
 bargain. As a transitional stage to encourage collective
 bargaining, regulations require that every company which has 25
 or more employees must issue company regulations defining the
 terms and conditions of employment. Before a company can
 register or renew its company regulations, it must demonstrate
 that it has consulted with a committee consisting of employer
 and employee representatives, in the absence of a union. Of
 the approximately 10,,000 SPSI units, only about half have
 collective bargaining agreements. The degree to which these
 agreements are freely negotiated between unions and management
 without government interference varies. By regulation,
 negotiations are to be concluded within 30 days. If not, the
 matter is submitted to the Ministry of Manpower for mediation
 and arbitration. In practice, most negotiations are concluded
 within the 30-day period. Agreements are for 2 years and can
 be extended for 1 more.
 Labor law applies equally in export processing zones. While
 some companies in these zones have SPSI units, none have
 negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Regulations
 expressly forbid employers prejudging or harassing employees
 because of union membership, and employees are urged to report
 harassment to the Government. The SPSI claims that some
 employers discriminate against its members and those wishing to
 form SPSI units.
 Many strikes and protests take place in support of fired union
 officials. Charges of antiunion discrimination are handled by
 the administrative tribunals. Many union members believe that
 the tribunals generally side with the employer. Because of
 this perceived partiality, many workers reject or avoid the
 process and present their disputes before the Parliament and
 other agencies. Workers can organize without restriction in a
 private enterprise, even if it is designated vital by the
 Government. subject to the recognition procedures discussed
 above. If the State has a partial interest, the enterprise is
 considered to be in the public service domain, but this does
 not legally limit organizing. There are a significant number
 of government/private joint enterprises which have labor unions
 and which bargain collectively.
 
 
 874
 INDONESIA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law. However, in 1990 credible
 reports asserted that military and civilian officials in Irian
 Jaya cooperate with Jakarta-based timber companies to compel
 Asmat tribespeople to cut down trees and transport them
 downstream to waiting ships, and that the Government
 resettlement program raises serious questions of informed
 consent. There are also documented reports of labor
 contractors in Jakarta selling girls as domestic servants or to
 brothels near plantations, and of men sold as agricultural
 workers. The Government responded that it was investigating
 the allegations. The Government did not release the results of
 this investigation, however, in 1990 or 1991.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor continues to be a major problem. The Ministry of
 Manpower acknowledges that there is a class of children under
 age 14 who, for socioeconomic reasons, must work and notes that
 the child labor laws, which provide detailed safeguards, have
 not been fully enforced.
 Employers are supposed to report in detail on every child
 employed, and the Ministry of Manpower is supposed to carry out
 periodic inspections. Employers not complying with the law and
 regulations are legally subject to fines of $65 and/or up to 3
 months in jail for each infraction, but the Government still
 relies on persuasion and teaching employers rather than
 penalizing them. The Ministry of Manpower continues to admit
 that employer compliance with the regulations is inadequate
 (less than 50 percent of companies employing children have
 registered), and that it still lacks enough qualified
 inspectors to carry out inspections. Observers claim that over
 2 million children under the age of 14 are working half- to
 full-time, mostly in family-run businesses in the informal
 sector and at agricultural sites, where enforcement is
 difficult. Efforts to control child labor focus primarily on
 instituting educational programs for working children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks, with
 one-half hour of rest for each 4 hours of work. It provides
 for a 24-hour rest period each week. Regulations allow
 employers to deviate from the normal work hours upon request to
 the Minister of Manpower with the agreement of the employees.
 In the absence of a national minimum wage, minimum wages are
 established by regional wage councils working under the
 supervision of the National Wage Council. This is a
 quadripartite body consisting of representatives from labor,
 management, government, and universities. It also establishes
 a basic needs figure for each province--a monetary amount
 considered sufficient to enable a single worker or family to
 meet the basic needs of nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The
 minimum wage rates constantly lag far behind the basic needs
 figures and fall short of providing a decent standard of
 living.
 Observance of minimum wage and other laws regulating benefits
 and labor standards varies fr6m sector to sector and from
 region to region. Employer violations of these guarantees are
 considered-to be fairly common and often the subject of strikes
 and employee protests. Government supervision and enforcement
 have been weak or nonexistent. In May 1989, the Manpower
 
 
 875
 INDONESIA
 Minister issued regulations giving ministry officials a legal
 basis to carry out periodic inspections and providing for fines
 or imprisonment for employers who do not comply. In March
 1990, spurred on by an Asian-American Free Labor Institute/SPSI
 minimum wage compliance project, which showed that 50 to 70
 percent of employers in three targeted areas in Jakarta were
 paying less than the minimum wages, the Manpower Minister began
 to prosecute some employers for violating minimum wage
 regulations in order to set an example.
 Both law and regulations provide for minimum standards of
 industrial health and safety. In the more profitable and
 largely Western-operated oil sector, safety and health programs
 function reasonably well. However, safety and health programs
 in the country's over 100,000 large, registered companies in
 the nonoil sector are still hampered by the limited number of
 qualified inspectors from the Ministry of Manpower (less than
 1,300), the slowness with which the firms establish the
 required plant-safety committees, the need for more and better
 training of government inspectors and plant-safety personnel,
 and the lack of employee appreciation for sound health and
 safety practices. A National Health and Safety Council, an
 advisory body established under the Ministry of Manpower, was
 created in 1990 to oversee the enforcement efforts of over
 6,000 company safety committees. Workers are obligated to
 report hazardous working conditions, and employers are
 prevented by law from retaliating against those who do, but in
 practice enforcement is weak.
