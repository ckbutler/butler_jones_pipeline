 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands (Grand
 Comore, Anjouan, and Moheli) and claims a fourth, Mayotte, which is governed by
 France. While currently orepublic with a democratically-elected president, Comoros
 hag been prone to coups and political insurrection since independence in 1975.
 
 
 President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, elected in 1996, died in office on November
 6. In accordance with the Constitution, Tadjiddine ben Said Massounde, the Presi-
 dent of the High Council was named Interim President. On November 25, he formed
 a government of national unity and appointed the leader of the opposition, Abbass
 Djoussouf, as Prime Minister. Although the Constitution calls for the Interim Presi-
 dent to hold presidential elections within 90 days of the death of the elected presi-
 dent, an election timetable had not been set by year's end. Both the Interim Presi-
 dent and the Prime Minister took the position that the elections should be post-
 poned until the secessionist crisis on Anjouan was resolved. The judiciary is nomi-
 nally independent; both the executive and other elites influence court cases.
 The Anjouan secession crisis entered its second year. Earlier in the year, negotia-
 tions between the Taki Government and the Anjouan rebels had been hindered by
 both Taki's wavering interest in finding a negotiated solution and the Anjouan lead-
 ership's internal divisions. The split among those who favor the island's return to
 French colonial administration, those who want independence, and those who want
 a looser federation with the islands of Grand Comore and Moheli led to a week-long
 struggle among opposing factions in early December. The international community
 continues to recognize the Comorian Government's sovereignty over Anjouan. A 23-
 member Organization for African Unity (OAU) observer force is on the islands of
 Grand Comore and Moheli.
 The Comorian Defense Force (FCD) and the gendarmerie are responsible for inter-
 nal security. Both are under civilian control. The security forces committed some
 human rights abuses.
 The economy of this extremely poor country is dominated by agriculture. Reve-
 nues from the main crops-vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, and cloves-continue to
 fall while the population of 545,000 continues to grow at a rate of 3 percent annu-
 ally. Per capita income is approximately $450 per year. Comoros depends heavily
 on foreign assistance from Arab countries, France, and the European Union.
 The human rights situation remained poor. Security forces shot and killed one
 person and seriously wounded five others in clashes with protestors on Grand
 Comore between May 11 and 13. The protests began over the May 6 closure by the
 Government of Radio Tropique, an opposition radio station. Unemployed youths and
 civil servants demanding payment of several months of wage arrears joined the
 protesters. The protests paralyzed the federal capital of Moroni. At the beginning
 of the year, there were widespread political protests in Anjouan over the island's
 future after the Anjouan leadership signed an agreement to normalize trade and
 travel between Anjouan and the other two islands. In July there were more political
 protests on Anjouan concerning the date for national day celebrations. In August
 and September on Grand Comore, there were further strikes and demonstrations by
 teachers and students protesting wage arrears and the scheduling of baccalaureate
 exams despite inadequate schooling. Prison conditions remain poor. There were
 some infringements on citizens' privacy rights, freedom of religion and freedom of
 movement. Societal discrimination against women continued to be a serious prob-
 lem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces shot and killed one
 person and seriously wounded five others between May 11 and 13 during clashes
 with protesters on Grand Comore over the May 6 government closure of the opposi-
 tion party's Radio Tropique. Protestors were joined by unemployed youths and civil
 servants demanding payment of several months wage arrearages (see Section 2.a.).
 The protests paralyzed the federal capital of Moroni.
 Groups throughout Anjouan are armed. For a week in early December, rival mili-
 tias fought each other, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes to the
 countryside. At least 10 persons were killed and about 50 injured. A cease-fire re-
 mained in effect at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits these practices, and there were no substantiated reports
 of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Security
 forces fired tear gas at the home of the owner of Radio Tropique and set it on fire
 during protests following the Government's closing of the station in May. One per-
 son was shot and killed and five were seriously wounded by security forces during
 the protests (see Section l.a.).

 Prison conditions continued to be poor. A lack of proper sanitation, overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and poor diet are common problems. The Government
 has not taken action to remedy these problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment; however, it does not specify a time limit between arrest and
 appearance before a magistrate. The law does not specify how long prisoners held
 for security reasons may be detained without being charged.
 In May President Taki freed a secessionist accused of trying to hire mercenaries
 in Madagascar to fight government troops. Abmed Charikane, who had been in pris-
 on since February, stated that he agreed to work in favor of national reconciliation
 in return for his release. In February the Anjouan authorities released the last 18
 of the Comorian soldiers they had arrested following the September 1997 govern-
 ment attempt put down secession.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary enforced by the President; however, the executive and other elites exercise in-
 fluence over court cases. The President names magistrates by decree.
 The High Council, made up of four members appointed by the President, three
 members elected by the Federal Assembly, and a member of each island council,
 also serves as the High Court of the Republic and rules on cases of constitutional
 law.
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law of all citizens. It does not
 mention the right to counsel. Trials are open to the public except for limited excep-
 tions defined by law. The legal system incorporates Islamic law as well as French
 legal codes. There are very few lawyers in the country, making it difficult to obtain
 legal representation. The Government does not provide free legal counsel to the ac-
 cused. Most disputes are settled-by village elders or by a civilian court of first in-
 stance.
 In 1996 a man who had allegedly murdered a pregnant woman in front of several
 witnesses was found guilty in a public, 2-day trial before a lay penal court. He had
 paralegal counsel. Prior to the conclusion of the trial and sentencing, former Presi-
 dent Taki stated publicly that the trial process was unnecessarily slow and called
 for harsher punishments for criminals. The man was publicly executed, and was the
 first person to be sentenced to death since the late 1970's. In 1997 a second man
 was executed for a similar crime. He also had paralegal counsel. Both men appealed
 to a special tribunal established to hear their cases and to the President.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence, how-
 ever, former President Taki's bans on alcohol and immodest dress remain in effect.
 Nevertheless, alcohol can be imported and sold with-a permit from the Government.
 Security forces set the home of the owner of Radio Tropique on fire (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution does not provide for freedom
 of the press, but small independent journals exist side-by-side with the semiofficial
 weekly Al-Watwan. The independent newspapers freely criticize the Government,
 and even Al-Watwan published commentary critical of President Taki.
 The government-controlled radio station, Radio Comoros, is the only national
 radio station following the third closure by the Government of Radio Tropique, an
 opposition radio station. However, there are about 20 regional radio stations. Resi-
 dents also receive broadcasts from Mayotte Radio, as well as from French television,
 without interference. While there are about five private local television stations, sat-
 ellite antennas are popular and amateur radio licenses are issued without hin-
 drance. Foreign newspapers are available, as are books from abroad. Internet serv-
 ice was introduced by the Government in September. In response to violent clashes
 in the streets in Moroni after the Government forced Radio Tropique off the air on
 May 6, security forces fired tear gas at the home of the owner of the radio station.
 Part of the house was set on fire as a result. Security forces shot and killed one
 person and seriously wounded five others during clashes with youths over the clo-
 sure of the station (see Section 1.a.).
 There is no university, but secondary students and teachers speak freely and criti-
 cize the government openly. Public schools remained closed through most of the year
 on Grand Comore.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution does not pro-
 vide for freedom of assembly and association, but the Government generally re-
 spected these rights in practice, except during the height of the crisis in Anjouan,
 when it banned antigovernment demonstrations.
 
 
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on reli-
 gion or religious belief but establishes an Ulamas Council, which advises the Presi-
 dent, Prime Minister, President of the Federal Assembly, the Council of Isles, and
 the island governors on whether bills, ordinances, decrees, and laws are in conform-
 ity with the principles of Islam. The Government infringes on freedom of religion
 to some extent. An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni Muslim; how-
 ever, the Government permits non-Muslims to practice their faith, and Christian
 missionaries may work in local hospitals and schools, but they may not proselytize.
 Former President Taki's 1996 bans on alcohol and immodest dress remain in ef-
 fect. However, alcohol can be imported and sold with a permit from the Government
 (see Section 1.f.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--One week after President Takifs death, the Government rescinded its
 ban on sea and air links between Grand Comore/Moheli and Anjouan. These prohi-
 bitions had been in effect since late August, with the result that travelers to
 Anjouan had to go via the French island of Mayotte. Air links with Anjouan were
 severed again when fighting on the island broke out in early December. Commercial
 air service to Anjouan had not resumed at year's end. The Government imposed a
 night curfew during the height of the demonstrations in May on Grand Comore.
 While any citizen can apply for a passport, the Government has run out of new
 passports.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In theory, citizens have the right to change their government, but it has not been
 fully demonstrated that they, in fact, have the ability to change it peacefully
 through free and fair elections. The Constitution stipulates that sovereignty resides
 in the people and is to be exercised by elected representatives or through referen-
 dum. The crises that have beset the country since its independence in 1975, includ-
 ing a series of foreign-led coups and coup attempts, have made it difficult for citi-
 zens to exercise that right.
 Former President Taki was elected in 1996 in polling that international observers
 reported to be free and fair. Legislative elections were held in December 1996.
 Former President Taki dissolved his Government in September 1997, following the
 military confrontation in Anjouan and assumed full political powers, an act per-
 mitted by the Constitution, if new elections are held within 90 days. They were not.
 Former President Taki again dissolved his government in May. He charged his new
 Government of seven ministers with bringing about national reconciliation. He did
 not name a new Prime Minister and assumed that portfolio. After Taki's death in
 November, the President of the High Council of the Republic succeeded him as stip-
 ulated in the Constitution. The Constitution calls for elections to be held within 90
 days of the death of the elected president, however, both the.jnterim President and
 the Prime Minister took the position that the election should be postponed until the
 secessionist crisis on Anjouan was resolved.
 In October 1996, former President Taki's proposed Constitution was approved in
 a national referendum. The Constitution mandates that all political parties that did
 not win at least two seats per island in the 1996 legislative elections are automati-
 cally dissolved unless they join other parties validly represented in the Federal As-
 sembly. If only one party is represented in the Assembly, the party or group obtain-
 ing the second largest number of votes is permitted to continue its activities.
 Village chiefs and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics. Tradi-
 tional social, religious, and economic institutions also importantly affect the coun-
 try's political life.
 Although women have the right to vote and to run for office, Comorian society
 is male-dominated, making it difficult for women to become involved in politics. No
 women hold senior government positions or are members of the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Comoros Human Rights Association, established in 1990, continues to func-
 tion, but many members are unwilling to criticize the Government vigorously for
 fear of losing their civil service positions. The Government cooperates with inter-
 national human rights organizations, including the International Committee of the
 Red Cross.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law without discrimination
 based on race, religion, or religious belief but is silent on sex, disability, language,
 and social status. The Government generally respects these provisions in practice
 but discourages the practice of religions other than Islam. Islamic fundamentalism
 is growing inpopularity as more students return to Comoros after studying in coun-
 tries such as Sudan and Libya.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but medical authorities, the police, and
 women's groups believe that it is rare. In theory a woman could seek protection
 through the courts in the case of violence, but in fact the problem is most often ad-
 dressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Men have the dominant role in society, and few women hold positions of respon-
 sibility in government or business. Societal discrimination against women is most
 apparent in rural areas where women have onerous farming and child-rearing du-
 ties,-with fewer opportunities for education and wage employment. In contrast
 change in the status of women is most evident in the major towns where growing
 numbers of women are in the labor force and generally earn wages comparable to
 those of men engaged in similar work. While legal discrimination exists in some
 areas, in general inheritance and property rights do not disfavor women. For exam-
 ple, the house that the father of the bride traditionally provides to the couple at
 the time of their marriage remains her property in the event of divorce.
 Children.-The Government, while committed to the protection of children's rights
 and welfare in principle, has extremely limited ability to put this commitment into
 practice. Population pressure and poverty force some families to place their children
 in the homes of others. These children, often as young as 7 years of age, typically
 work long hours as domestic servants in exchange for food and shelter. The few
 legal instruments, which address the rights and welfare of children, are not enforced
 because of a lack of inspectors.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not generally prac-
 ticed. Child abuse appears to be rare.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of widespread discrimination
 against the disabled in the provision of education or other services. No legislation
 is in force or pending concerning accessibility to public buildings or services for peo-
 ple with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution does not provide for the right to
 unionize and strike, but these rights are practiced freely. Farming on small land
 holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily activity of most
 of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is small, and numbers less than 7,000
 including government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding. them. Teachers,
 civil servants, and dock workers are unionized. Unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment. Teachers and hospital workers strike intermittently, mostly because they
 are not paid for months. There are no laws protecting strikers from retribution, but
 there were no known instances of retribution.  -
 There are no restrictions on unions joining federations or affiliating with inter-
 national bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain collectively, and strikes are legal. Wages are set by employers in the small pri-
 vate sector and by the Government, especially the Ministries of Finance and Labor,
 in the larger public sector. The Labor Code, which is only loosely enforced, does not
 set up a system for resolving labor disputes, and it does not prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not mention
 forced or compulsory labor, but it is not practiced. There are no reports of forced
 or bonded labor by children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code defines the minimum age for employment as 15 years of age. The Min-
 istry of Labor has few resources to enforce this provision, but except for domestic
 work, child labor is not a problem, due to the general lack of wage employment op-
 portunities. There are no reports of forced or bonded labor by children. Children
 generally help with the work of their families in the subsistence farming and fishing
 sectors (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in over a decade
 
 
 and no longer reflect economic realities. The monthly minimum wage for a laborer
 is about $67 (30,000 Comorian francs). The Government periodically reminds em-
 ployers to respect the Labor Code, which specifies 1 day off per week, plus 1 month
 of paid vacation per year, but it does not set a standard workweek. There are no
 safety or health standards for the minuscule manufacturing sector.
