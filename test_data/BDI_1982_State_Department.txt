 BURUNDI
 Burundi is a one-party state under the leadership of President
 Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, who came to power in 1976 in a bloodless
 coup d'etat. The Government proposed a new Constitution in 1981,
 which was the- subject of a popular referendum on November 18 of
 that year. The new Constitution provides for basic civil rights
 guarantees, an elected National Assembly, and confirmation
 (called an election) of the President for a five-year term by
 universal suffrage.    Elections for the National Assembly,
 the first in 17 years, were held on October 22, 1982, and
 while the presidential election has not yet been scheduled, it is
 predicted to take place in 1984 in conjunction with the National
 Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA) conference.
 Politically, a crucial factor is the country's social structure.
 While all Burundians speak the same language and have the same
 culture, the minority Tutsi, traditionally cattle herders, have
 for centuries dominated the political, social, and economic life
 of the country.   From time to time -this domination has led to
 violence as- the majority Hutu, who are traditionally farmers,
 have tried to increase their power. The most recent and devastat-
 ing example of this occurred in 1972, during the government-sanc-
 tioned massacres, which left over 200,000 Burundians, mostly
 Hutu, dead or refugees in neighboring countries. The Government
 was overthrown in 1976, and under President Bagaza the Second
 Republic has sought to address these problems by giving major
 emphasis to economic development and to various political reforms
 designed to win the confidence of the Burundi people as a whole.
 Other key problems facing the country are economic.      Land-
 locked Burundi is a poor, densely populated country, with most
 people living at a subsistence level on tiny farms scattered over
 the country's hilly terrain. The nation has few natural resources,
 and the remaining unused arable land and forests are under
 increasing pressure because of rapid population growth. The
 literacy rate and general education levels are low. Health care
 is meager.
 Traditionally having a poor but well-managed economy, Burundi has
 in recent years received Increasing amounts of foreign assistance,
 much of it concentrated in the key agricultural sector. Political
 reforms have included the abolition of the head tax, the promulga-
 tion of a new legal code on the family giving increased rights to
 women, a substantial reduction in the role of the military in
 government affairs, and the strengthening of UPRONA, Burundi's
 sole political party.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Preedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports or allegations of killings for
 political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports or allegations of disappearances.
 c. Torture
 Several articles of the Burundi penal code deal with the treat-
 ment of prisoners. Torture is forbidden by law, and there were
 no reports of the severe forms of torture in 1982. 3eatings
 
 
 40
 occasionally occur during the arrest and questioning of prisoners,
 particularly those who threaten violence against the police,
 resist arrest, or are arrested in connection with violent crimes.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are overcrowded and dirty, although a recent inspection
 by the International Committee of the Red Cross found the conditions
 improved from previous years. Prisoners are left to themselves or
 put to work in a penal labor program. Prisoners arrested for
 violent crimes such as rape or murder, and those who resist
 arrest may be ill-treated. The Government claims to discipline
 police and prison officials guilty of abusing prisoners.
 There is no independent information to confirm or refute these
 claims.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The state has broad police powers which permit arbitrary arrests
 and imprisonment, but these powers are used sparingly. Legally,
 a person may be held for only five days before being charged, but
 some are detained for longer periods of time. Preventive detention
 exists but is not common.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Burundian law provides for speedy public trials with counsel. The
 law specifies that charges must be stated formally within five
 days of an arrest. The lack of trained legal personnel often
 causes delays from several weeks to more than a year. By law
 the judiciary is independent of the executive and the military,
 but there are indications that occasional manipulation on purely
 political grounds does occur.
 A state security court was established by presidential decree on
 April 17, 1980, and was provided for in the new Constitution.
 However, no cases have been brought before the court since its
 establishment. Should this court ever be used, it would have
 jurisdiction over both civilian and military personnel who are
 accused of acts against the state. The mandate of the court
 allows it jurisdiction over almost any ferony case the Government
 chooses to refer to it. The court would be presided over
 by the President of the Supreme Court and four counsellors
 appointed by the President.   The counsellors would be nominated
 by the Minister of Justice. The counsellors would comprise one
 representative from the judiciary, one from the military, and two
 public members. The supreme prosecutor would represent the state
 before the security court as well. The main difference between
 the state security court and civilian courts is that state
 security court proceedings need not be public, and the only form
 of appeal is a motion for reconsideration before the same court.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Court warrants are required by law for an official to enter
 a private residence. Exceptions sometimes occur in politically-
 related cases, e.g., if an individual is suspected of
 plotting against the state, but this has been a very rare
 occurrence under the current Republic.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government controls all domestic media. The French-
 language daily "Le Renouveau" and the Kirundi language weekly
 
 
 "Ubumwe" are published by the Ministry of Information, which also
 runs the only domestic radio station. Editorial direction comes
 from the presidency and is pro-government, but occasionally
 editions have featured muted criticisms of government mismanagement
 or policies and or programs and have raised political and economic
 issues. There is no television station in Burundi. In November
 1980 the Government seized all television sets used by Burundi
 nationals to watch telecasts fiom Zaire. Foreign movies are
 subject to censorship, but cuts are generally made only on
 material deemed sexually explicit. Normally there is no interfer-
 ence with the distribution of foreign publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The express authorization of the Government is required for all
 political meetings or speakers, and this effectively guarantees
 government control of public fora. The labor movement is a part
 of the country's only political party and follows government
 policy. Wildcat strikes lasting a few hours have occured.
 However, there is a controlled mediation process to facilitate
 negotiation of disputes. A presidential decree issued in 1981
 prohibits strikes by government officials. Despite these con-
 straints, members of the labor movement assemble often and have
 frank discussions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is somewhat restricted in Burundi. Government
 insistence that religious groups meet only on Sunday and in
 churches has met with opposition. In addition, the involvement
 of many foreign missionaries in social work with the poor, who
 are overwhelmingly Hutu, has at times aroused government suspicion
 and led to the expulsion of missionaries from the country.
 However, very few expulsions have taken place since 1979 when 74
 missionaries were forced to leave.  (At that time, the Government
 did not prevent church and missionary groups from replacing
 expelled missionaries, nor did it refuse admission to new arrivals.)
 The Government has made it clear that churches are free to
 carry out their work, but must confine their activities to
 religion and stay out of political matters. When missionaries
 stray beyond this ground rule, they face expulsion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi. There is no curfew.
 Foreign travel and emigration are open to all. The Government
 encourages voluntary repatriation. Burundi's refugee and asylum
 practices are humane, and returnees have full rights as citizens.
 Cooperation with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
 (UNHCR) is close. The country's estimated 70,000 refugees,
 primarily Tutsis of Rwandan origin who fled to Burundi in the
 early sixties, receive good treatment, and most have been success-
 fully resettled, although they are not very often awarded
 citizenship.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government of Burundi is dominated by President Jean-
 Baptiste Bagaza, who rules by decree with the advice and agreement
 of the Council of Ministers. In November 1982 a new National
 Assembly was seated. It is comprised of 52 deputies elected by
 the population and 13 appointed directly by the President. Its
 announced role is to consider legislation. Only one political
 party, the government-sponsored UPRONA Party, is permitted.
 
 
 42
 
 During the October 1982 elections for the National Assembly
 the politbureau of the Party approved the list of candidates
 preselected by provincial electoral colleges composed of Party
 members and government officials, before it was made public. Two
 candidates for each elective seat were permitted.    Candidates
 are not required to be members of the Party, but in fact every
 candidate who was selected to run for office in 1982 was a
 member.
 The UPRONA party is open to all Burundians who profess allegiance
 to its principles.   The Government announced in 1979 that a
 membership drive, largely conducted by local Party officialsi had
 resulted in over one million new members, or over half of the
 adult population of the country.  The position of the Party in
 the structure of the Government was strengthened substantially at
 the time of the Party's National Congress in December 1979,
 when the 49-member UPRONA Central Committee and its eight-member
 politbureau replaced the Supreme Revolutionary Council, composed
 of 29 senior military officers who had ruled Burundi from late
 1976. Both the politbureau and the Central Committee are chaired
 by the President, who is also president of the Party.      The
 membership of the Central Committee, and to a lesser extent the
 politbureau, includes men, women, youth, and labor.   Hutus are
 represented at the ministerial level of Government and are
 represented in the senior ranks of the Party, but only to a
 minor extent given the proportion of Hutus in the population.
 The military is represented in each major Party body and among
 the ministers.
 The Party undertook in 1980 to draft a constitution that was
 approved in a national referendum in November 1981. The referen-
 dum, organized by the Government, did permit secret opposition
 votes, although 98.6 percent of the voters were in favor of the
 Constitution.  The new Constitution contains basic civil rights
 guarantees and explicitly states that women have the same rights
 as men. The Constitution provides for a strong presidency and a
 National Assembly.   Both the President and four-fifths of the
 members of the National Assembly are to be elected by universal
 suffrage. The sole candidate for President permitted by the
 Constitution is the President of the UPRONA Party. Since a
 national Party congress is to be held every five years and the
 last congress was held in 1979, it is anticipated that the first
 presidential election under the current Government will take
 place in 1984, following the Party congress scheduled to take
 place that year.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 In 1982 the International Committee of the Red Cross visited
 Burundi to investigate prison conditions, but there have been no
 other reports to indicate that the Government has received
 requests for outside assessments on human rights.
 This past year Amnesty International was concerned about the
 detention without trial of seven Zairian refugees and the use of
 the death penalty.   In July 1982 the refugees were arrested
 after demonstrating outside the office of the United Nations High
 Commission for refugees in Bujumbura. Although detained for
 more than two months on charges of "making threats and bad
 behavior*, they were eventually released without being brought to
 trial. Freedom House rated Burundi "Not Free" in 1982.

 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries and has a per
 capita GNP of approximately $203 (1980).  Population density is
 among the highest in Africa, and the population is growing at
 an estimated rate of 2.7 percent (1980).
 The percentage of the population below the absolute poverty
 level was estimated in 1979 at 55 percent for the urban population
 and 85 percent for the rural population. The economy is overwhel-
 mingly dependent on a primitive agricultural sector which supports
 95 percent of the population.  Low world coffee prices coupled
 with varying annual production have led to a significant decline
 in hard currency earnings. The low level of development affects
 both Hutu and Tutsi, with differences in economic status between
 the two groups generally not discernable in the countryside. In
 the few urban areas, Tutsi have long dominated government and
 education and continue to have a significant edge.
 Health care and nutrition are inadequate. The latest available
 statistic on infant mortality shows a rate of 121 deaths per 1000
 live births (1980). While the percentage of the small urban
 population with access to safe water is high, estimated at 94
 percent access to safe water of the much larger rural population
 is very low. Life expectancy at birth is 41.9 years (1980).
 Calorie supply available for consumption was estimated to be at
 97 percent (1977).
 Education, despite considerable government efforts, remains
 far below the needs of the population.     The adult literacy
 rate is 25 percent. Enrollments at the primary school level
 in 1977 were only 23 percent of the relevant age group (28
 percent for males; 18 percent for females).      Only a small
 fraction of those completing primary school can obtain places in
 the nation's 35 secondary schools.  An even smaller percentage
 of students win places in the nation's sole university, but once
 there, they receive high quality instruction in a competitive
 environment.
 The role of women in society is undergoing considerable change.
 However, women traditionally hold a secondary position.  Their
 legal status was improved in the 1980 legal code on families, and
 the Constitution eliminated any further legal basis for discrimi-
 nation. Fewer women than men manage to attain an education, but
 once an education is attained, women can generally find suitable
 employment. In the political life of the country, women are
 represented at all levels. The Union of Burundian Women,
 the women's affiliate of the UPRONA party, is engaged in several
 social programs and is regularly called upon to stimulate mass
 support.
