 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of the President and Head
 of the Supreme Military Council, Colonel Seyni Kountche.
 He took power in 1974 from a civilian government which had
 lost credibility because of widespread corruption. He
 rules by decree, and the freedoms of expression, assembly,
 and political activity remain restricted.
 The Kountche Government has taken steps in the past year to
 widen its basis of support through the proposed creation of
 a hierarchical network of councils linking all segments of
 society. The Government plans that, through this network,
 grass roots concerns will be communicated to the President,
 and government policies and programs will be communicated to
 the people. Once a national development council is estab-
 lished, it is to become a constituent assembly with a
 mandate to present a draft constitution for national con-
 sideration.
 The state of human rights in Niger is mixed. Civil and
 political rights are circumscribed. There are a few pol-
 itical prisoners, but the Government does not engage in
 assaults against the integrity of the person.
 Aside from the slight move already noted in the direction of
 greater public participation in the political process, there
 has been no significant change in the state of human rights
 in Niger in the past year. In the short term, the human
 rights situation could worsen if the Government decided to
 react to renewed efforts of destabilization launched openly
 or covertly by neighboring Libya. Over the longer term,
 however, the human rights situation in Niger could improve
 if the Kountche Government were to implement return to
 constitutional rule.
 The Goverment of Niger faces a strong and persistent threat
 from Libyan aggression. Qadhafi has reportedly stated that
 Niger would be his next conquest after Chad. Libya is
 believed to have backed an assassination attempt against the
 Nigerien president in August 1981. Libya broadcasts anti-
 government radio propaganda directed at the largely Tuareg
 population of northern Niger. In April 1982 a group of
 Tuaregs, reportedly trained in Libya, were captured and
 admitted they had planned to sabotage the uranium mines
 and take hostages. The most recent incident involving Libya
 occurred in August 1982 during the Islamic Conference in
 Niamey. Nigerien security officials, alarmed at the size
 of the Libya delegation (forty strong where other delega-
 tions were about ten) demanded to search the delegates
 luggage. The Libyans refused and departed before the
 Conference convened. This touched off further Libyan verbal
 assaults on Niger and exhortations that the Nigerien Govern-
 ment must be overthrown. This unremitting tension contri-
 butes to the security preoccupation of the Nigerien Govern-
 ment and limits its toleration of dissent within Niger.
 Niger is a large, landlocked, and sparsely populated country
 in the arid Sahel region of West Africa. Pour major ethnic
 groups, each with its own language, make up the bulk of the
 population. Islam is the predominant religion. One of the
 world's least developed nations, Niger's economy is based on
 subsistence agriculture, livestock, and a few cash crops.
 
 
 225
 Erratic rainfall levels cause wide variations in food pro-
 duction, and in the drought years of the early Seventies
 massive emergency food imports were necessary to avoid
 wide-scale starvation. Since then improvements in the
 agricultural and livestock sectors have brought Niger to the
 point where it is marginally self-sufficient in food produc-
 tion when rainfall is adequate. In the late Seventies the
 economy also benefited from the exploitation of the nation's
 extensive uranium reserves. In the early Eighties, however,
 world uranium prices and demand declined sharply and Niger
 is again highly dependent on the agricultural sector.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of killing for political purposes
 either by the Government or by terrorist groups. The mili-
 tary and police are regarded as disciplined and unlikely to
 engage in excesses.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports nor indications of disappearances in
 Niger in 1982, nor is it believed to occur.
 c. Torture
 There were no reports of the use of torture in Niger in
 1982, nor is torture believed to occur.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment in Niger
 under the current government, nor of summary execution. Pris-
 ons are over-crowded and facilities are generally inadequate,
 but this is a reflection of the economy of the country and
 of the government's scarce financial and human resources.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 It is estimated that less than 20 political prisoners are
 being held in Niger. Former President Hamani Diori remains
 under house arrest in Niamey, and some former members of his
 administration, as well as opposition leader Djibo Bakary
 and other members of the banned Sawaba (freedom) Party, re-
 main in detention, With the Constitution suspended, there
 is no specific statutory protection against arbitrary arrest
 or imprisonment, nor does habeas corpus exist.
 Instances of arrest and imprisonment without due process are
 rare, however, as are cases of preventive detention. Pre-
 ventive detention, when it occurs, varies in duration but is
 usually short-term. The law provides for a suspect to be
 charged within 48 hours, but slight delays in processing sus-
 pects often occur as the result of a lack of trained legal
 officials.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a public trial is observed for civil and
 criminal cases not involving political acts. Legal counsel
 is provided for indigent defendants accused of felonies or
 
 
 226
 other major offenses if they are under 18 years of age,
 handicapped, or faced with a possible sentence of 10 years
 or more. Formal charges are usually made within a week of
 arrest. There is no evidence that courts are subject to
 political influence or pressure in ordinary criminal cases
 against the state. Cases involving political acts, such as
 those of the plotters executed in connection with an attemp-
 ted coup in 1976, are handled by a specially designated
 state security court. Security trials are held in secret
 and little is known of them. It is generally supposed that
 security courts reviewed the sentences of those persons
 currently held in detention, but there is no available
 information about rules or procedures followed or if defen-
 dants are entitled to counsel. There are no military
 courts; civilian justice applies to all. Defendants may
 appeal verdicts first to an appellate court and if desired,
 to the nation's highest tribunal, the state court. The
 state court, however, decides only on the legality of lower
 court decisions, not the decisions themselves. The President
 has the right of pardon in penal cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5:00 a.m.
 and 9:00 p.m. but will enter at other times if they believe
 they have sufficient cause. No court warrants are required.
 There have been no reports of forced entry and none of pub-
 lic security forces engaging in other violations of the
 home.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is rarely
 voiced; the institutions which might promote dissent, a
 legislature or privately-controlled media, do not exist.
 There are no evident organized opposition groups either
 inside or outside Niger. Some minor criticism of govern-
 ment actions occurs in the government-controlled vernacular
 press. Individual citizens also have the opportunity to
 question senior government officials at public meetings held
 about twice monthly in the capital. Foreign films are
 subject to censorship, with bans imposed on the basis of
 public moral standards. There have been no recent reports of
 banned books or periodicals, but the Government is under no
 restraint should it discover material it deems offensive.
 Academic freedom generally has existed since independence,
 except in the domain of national politics. The Government
 effectively controls the press, radio, and television
 through outright ownership and policy guidance. The main
 function of these media is to communicate government poli-
 cies and engender public support for them as well as the
 government leadership. There have been no reports of
 journalists being intimidated, harassed, or arrested.
 Journalists know the parameters within which they must
 operate as government employees and to that extent practice
 self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Some forms of voluntary association and expression, such as
 trade unions, churches, and other religious groups function
 freely with the understanding that they remain non-political
 
 
 227
 and support government policy. The trade union movement is
 at a rudimentary level, but it is regarded as fairly demo-
 cratic. Most salaried workers belong to a union, and
 meetings occur often. Unions have the right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike. The Government tolerates unions but
 does not give them strong suppport. As a result, unions are
 ill-financed and relatively weak, Nonetheless, in 1982 a
 strike at a uranium mine and a student strike were both
 successful. Unions maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is over 90 percent Muslim, but Christian churches
 operate and are given free access to Niger's radio service
 to broadcast weekly religious programs. Several Christians
 hold high government positions. Conversion from one relig-
 ion to another is permitted but is very rare in practice.
 There have been no reports of outright discrimination
 against minority religions, but adherence to Islam very
 likely gives a slight advantage in civil, economic, politi-
 cal, military, and secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Niger.
 Nigeriens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate must obtain
 exit visas, which are granted routinely without discrimina-
 tion. The repatriation of Nigerien nationals is unre-
 stricted. A small number of refugees from other coun-
 tries have been accepted.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is limited
 by the nature of the political system. Niger is an author-
 itarian military regime with most power concentrated in the
 hands of President Seyni Kountche, the Head of the Supreme
 Military Council. The Council is composed of the army
 officers who organized the 1974 coup which brought Kountche
 to power. Some of the members of the Council serve as
 ministers or governors of Niger's seven departments. Other
 members of the 18-man cabinet are civilian technocrats,
 including most of those directly concerned with economic
 development.
 The Government is in the process of organizing a "Develop-
 ment Society" that would involve Nigeriens at all levels in
 economic and social development decision-making by providing
 channels for grass-root concerns to be brought to the
 attention of national political leaders. This "Society"
 consists of representitive councils at local, regional and
 national levels. At the base of this hierachy are locAl
 socio-professional membership groups, some of which already
 exist and some of which are being formed. These include
 local labor groups, women's groups, merchant groups, agricul-
 tural cooperatives, traditional youth groups, and other
 special interest associations. These groups will send
 representatives to a village council which will send repre-
 sentatives to a sub-regional council, and so on. The
 National Development Council, which will be at the pinnacle
 of this hierarchy, is targeted for formation in April 1983.
 Its charge, President Kountche has said, will be to develop
 
 
 228
 a new Constitution for Niger to replace the one suspended
 in 1974. The Government sees this process as a strategy for
 mobilizing the populace for development goals but not as a
 forerunner of a return to civilian politics. Political
 parties remain suspended.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Niger is not an active participant in international and
 regional human rights bodies. The Government has not been
 the subject of resolutions, investigations, or other human
 rights actions by official international organizations.
 Amnesty International reported in 1981 that it had appealed
 to the Nigerien Government to bring to trial or release
 political detainees but that no response was received.
 There are no reports of visits by non-governmental human
 rights groups. There are no government or private organi-
 zations in the country which attempt to protect individual
 liberties.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Niger is one of the world's poorest countries. Most of the
 population of 5,419,000 (1981 est.) live at a subsistence
 level. Gross national product per capita was $331 for
 1980. Other social indicators are also low. The adult
 literacy rate is 8 percent. Infant mortality is 146 deaths
 for 1,000 live births. Life expectancy is 48 years. On the
 average, Nigeriens receive 91 percent of daily nutritional
 requirements.
 Given these conditions, the Government has made economic
 development its top priority. The bulk of funds derived
 from the uranium boom of the late Seventies was channeled
 into projects in health, agricultural, and rural develop-
 ment. Foreign assistance has largely gone to these sectors.
 Substantial progress resulted from these efforts. Economic
 growth rates in the late Seventies kept well ahead of the
 population growth rate of 2.9 percent. Nevertheless, the
 current and future economic prospects for Niger are deci-
 dedly clouded. Uranium revenues have declined substantially
 as world demand and prices tumbled in the early Eighties.
 No improvement in uranium prices is expected, and Niger has
 no other easily exploitable, known mineral resource. As a
 result, the Government has cut back economic develpment
 programs to a fraction of their former size. The one bright
 spot is that continuing improvements in the agricultural
 sector make it possible for Niger to approach food self-
 sufficiency when rainfall is good.
 The Government has indicated that it is determined to
 weather the difficulties ahead through a program of belt-
 tightening, more efficient management, effective use of
 foreign assistance, and increased efforts to exploit Niger's
 mineral reserves. The burden of these measures is to be
 distributed fairly evenly among all parts of the population,
 just as the benefits of the uranium boom were fairly evently
 distributed.
 Niger's social and cultural situation has mixed effects on
 human rights. The bulk of the population lives much as it
 has for centuries. The low literacy and educational levels
 
 
 229
 have made it difficult for modern forms of political thought
 and organization to take root. The essentially traditional
 nature of society helps ensure that family and ethnic group
 ties remain strong and supportive, but traditional attitudes
 limit movement towards modernization of the country. The
 Tuareg group (approximately 12 percent of the population)
 remains unconvinced of the value of formal education,
 particularly for females. Women throughout the population
 traditionally have not enjoyed equal rights or opportunities.
 Male children still have a far better chance of being
 educated, and they possess substantially greater property
 rights. In case of divorce, custody of all children under
 eight years of age is given to the husband. Nonetheless,
 improvements in the status of women are being made. Some
 women have been promoted to management positions within the
 administration; and the Government sponsors and supports the
 Nigerien Women's Association. An Office of Women's Affairs
 exists in the Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Culture. In
 addition, significant media attention is given to successful
 women in non-traditional careers.
 The Government has made a considerable effort to ensure that
 benefits of economic development are fairly distributed
 throughout the population. The largest ethnic group, the
 Hausa, dominates commerce while the second largest group,
 the Djerma, dominates the Government. The nomadic Tuaregs
 have traditionally lived apart from central government
 authority, but this is gradually changing as the Tuaregs
 begin to see benefits from government programs. The Govern-
 ment of Niger is very conscious of the need to preserve
 ethnic harmony, play down ethnic differences, and work for
 the equal application of justice. As a result of this
 deliberate policy, ethnic tensions are currently low.
