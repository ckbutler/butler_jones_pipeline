 ESTONIA
 Estonia is a parliamentary democracy. With its statehood widely recognized as
 continuous for more than 70 years, Estonia regained its independence in 1991 after
 50 years of Soviet occupation. The Constitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, es-
 tablished a 101-member unicameral legislature (State Assembly), a prime minister
 as Head of Government, and a president as Head of State. Free and fair indirect
 presidential elections took place in two rounds in August and September. A cabinet
 crisis was resolved in Decemhber.
 The official conversion of the Soviet militia into the Estonian police preceded the
 reestablishment of the country's independence by about 6 months. Its conversion
 into a Western-type police force committed to procedures and safeguards appro-
 priate to a democratic society is proceeding, with police leadership actively working
 to professionalize the force. The police, who are ethnically mixed, are subordinate
 to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Corrections personnel are subordinate to the
 Ministry of Justice. The security service, called Security Police, is subordinate to the
 Interior Ministry but also reports to the Prime Minister. Police and corrections per-
 sonnel continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Estonia has a market economy. Reflecting the extent of its post-1992 reforms, Es-
 tonia signed a Europe Agreement with the European Union in 1995, which granted
 associate member status without a transition period. Services, especially financial
 and tourism, are growing in importance compared to historically more prominent
 light industry and food production. Privatizati~on of small and medium firms is vir-
 tually complete, and privatization of large-scale enterprises is underway. The econ-
 omy continues to grow steadily with gross domestic product (GDP) estimated to in-
 crease by about 3 percent in 1996. Although prices continue to rise, incomes are ris-
 ing faster than the rate of inflation. Per capita GDP is about $2,400 per year. Two-
 thirds of Estonian exports (textiles, food products, wood and timber products) are
 now directed to Western markets. Unemployment remained fairly low overall (unof-
 ficially about 8 percent) but was significantly higher in rural areas.

 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens and the
 large noncitizen community, but problems remained in some areas. The major
 human rights abuses continued to be mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, and
 the use of excessive force by the police. Prison conditions are poor. The deadline for
 noncitizens to fie for permanent residency expired in 1996, after being extended
 twice. An undetermined number of noncitizens have still not filed for residency.
 Problems remain in processing the applications for permanent residency of some
 19,000 Russian military retirees and family members. Processing of applications for
 alien passports continued. There were complaints about the low rate of issuance
 which, however, picked up late in the year. The Government continued to issue tem-
 Rorary travel documents and to accept former Soviet internal passports as identity
 documents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kdiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are prohibited by law. However, there continued to be credible re-
 ports that police used excessive force and verbal abuse during the arrest and ques-
 tioning of suspects. Punishment cells ("kartsers") continued to be used, in contraven-
 tion of international standards.
 Two cases of hazing were prosecuted in the military; one perpetrator was pun-
 ished; charges against another were dropped for lack of evidence. There were re-
 ports of more instances of recruit mistreatment.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Overcrowding continued in the Tallinn Central
 Prison built in 1765. The Government continued measures to address poor prison
 conditions and to make prison staff more professional. The first group of profes-
 sionally trained corrections officers graduated from the National Defense Academy
 in June. Following several widely reported prison escapes, the head of the Correc-
 tions Department resigned in August. By late September, 3 prisoners had been
 killed by other prisoners, in contrast to 1992 when there were 32 such killings. Op-
 portunities to study or work in prison were limited.
 The Government has drafted a multiyear p lan to refurbish and restructure all the
 country's prisons and to close the Tallinn Central Prison, but it had not yet been
 implemented by year's end. Some suggestions to improve prison conditions made by
 Council of Europe (COE) representatives in 1993 have been implemented, but fulfill-
 ment of others is still hampered by lack of resources and high turnover among pris-
 on staff.
 The Government permits human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and laws forbid arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes this prohi-
 bition. Under the Constitution, warrants issued by a court are required to make ar-
 rests. Detainees must be informed promptly of the grounds for the arrest and given
 immediate access to legal counsel. If a person cannot afford counsel, the State will
 provide one. A person may be held for 48 hours without formally being charged; fur-
 ther detention requires a court order. A person may be held in pretrial detention
 for 2 months; this may be extended up to a total of 12 months by court order. Police
 rarely violate these limits. At midyear 1,555 of the 4,406 persons held in prisons
 were awaiting trial
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The Constitution establishes an independent judi-
 cial branch and the judiciary is independent in practice. It operates through a three-
 tier court system: rural and city courts; district courts; and- the State Court (which
 functions as a supreme court). The district and state courts are also courts for 'con-
 stitutional supervision." At the rural and city levels, court decisions are made by
 a majority vote with a judge and two lay members sitting in judgment. All judges
 and lay judges must be citizens. The President nominates and the State Assembly
 confirms the Chief Justice of the State Court. The Chief Justice nominates State
 Court judges who are subject to confirmation by the State Assembly. He also nomi-
 nates the district, city, and rural court judges who are then appointed by the Presi-
 dent. Judges are appointed for life.
 The Constitution provides that court proceedings shall be public. Closed sessions
 may be held only for specific reasons, such as protection of state or business secrets,
 an(din cases concerning minors. The Constitution further provides that defendants
 may present witnesses and evidence as well as confront and cross-examine prosecu-
 
 
 929
 tion witnesses. Defendants have access to prosecution evidence and enjoy a pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 Estonia continued to overhaul its criminal and civil procedural codes. An interim
 Criminal Code that went into effect in June 1992 basically revised the Soviet Crimi-
 nal Code by eliminating, for example, political and economic crimes. The Code of
 Criminal Procedure was adopted in 1994. New codes in a variety of fields were
 being drafted at year's end. A multiyear plan is being compiled to replace present
 criminal codes with new penal codes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. In September former dissident Tilt
 Madisson was sentenced to 26 months in prison for attempting to organize an
 armed overthrow of the Government. The sentence is being appealed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires a search warrant for search and seizure of property. During the investiga-
 tive stage, warrants are issued by the prosecutor upon a showing of probable cause.
 Once a case has gone to court, warrants are issued by the court. The Constitution
 provides for secrecy of the mail, telegrams, telephones, and other means of commu-
 nication. Police must obtain a court order to intercept a person's communications.
 illegally obtained evidence is not admissible in court. In a widely reported case, the
 police in the summer of 1995 destroyed a field of alleged opium poppies without a
 warrant. A criminal case was ified against the owner of the field for growing opium
 poppies; the owner asserted that he was growing oil poppies. The case was settled
 out of court with the owner receiving compensation. At year's end, security police
 and parliamentary investigations were continuing into the 1995 case involving then-
 Interior Minister Savisaar who was implicated in making unauthorized recordings
 of conversations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government generally respects constitu-
 tional provisions providing for freedom of speech and the press. The media routinely
 do probing and thorough investigative reporting. Foreign newspapers and maga-
 zines are widely available. Most newsprint, printing, and distribution facilities are
 now private companies. There are four major national Estonian language and two
 Russian language dailies.
 State broadcast media, including one nationwide television (TV) channel, continue
 to receive large subsidies, and the State has assured that these subsidies will con-
 tinue. There are several major independent television and radio stations. Several
 Russian language programs, mostly Estonian produced, are broadcast over state and
 private television channels. Russian state TV and Ostankino programs are widely
 available via cable.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble freely, but noncitizens are prohibited from joining political
 parties, although they may form social groups. Permits for all public gatherings
 must be obtained 3 weeks prior to the date of the gathering. The authorities have
 wide discretion to prohibit such gatherings on public safety grounds but seldom ex-
 ercise it. There were no reports of government interference in mass gatherings or
 political rallies.
 c. Freedom of Religon.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 The 1993 Law on Churches and Religious Organizations requires all religious or-
 ganizations to have at least 12 members and to be registered with the Interior Min-
 istr and the Board of Religion. Leaders of religious organizations must be citizens
 ith at least 5 years' residence in Estonia.
 The majority of Estonians are nominally Lutheran, but following deep-seated tra-
 dition there is wide tolerance of other denominations and religions. People of vary-
 ing ethnic backgrounds profess Orthodoxy, including communities of Russian Old
 Believers who found refuge in Estonia in the 17th century. The Estonian Apostolic
 Orthodox Church (EAOC), independent since 1919, subordinate to Constantinople
 since 1923, and exiled under the Soviet occupation, reregistered under its 1935 stat-
 ute in August 1993. Since then, a group of ethnic Estonian and Russian parishes
 preferring to remain under the authority of the Russian Orthodox Church structure
 imposed during the Soviet occupation has insisted that it should have claim to the
 EAOC name. This group has refused to register under any other name, although
 its refusal to register violates the law. During 1996 representatives of the Moscow
 and Constantinople Patriarchates formed a joint commission to resolve the question.
 The dispute, which centers on property issues, is the subject of ongoing discussions.
 The Government has taken a hands off approach to the issue but has assured par-
 
 
 930
 ishes aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church that they may continue to worship
 unimpeded. Free worship has occurred in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law permits free movement within the country, and it is honored
 in practice. It also provides for the right of foreign travel, emigration, and repatri-
 ation for citizens. There are no exit visas.
 In July 1993, Parliament enacted a Law on Aliens that defines an alien as a per-
 son who is not a citizen of Estonia, i.e., a citizen of another country or a stateless
 person. The majority of noncitizens are ethnic Russians. The law provided a 1-year
 period during which noncitizens who came to Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, and
 were permanent residents of the former Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, could
 apply for temporary residence permits. They could also apply for permanent resi-
 dence at the same time. Following delays and confusion in implementation as well
 as criticism by international human rights observers, the application deadline was
 extended by a year, until July 12, 1995. By that date the vast majority of aliens-
 327,737 of the estimated 370,000-had filed applications. The Government extended
 the registration period until April 30, 1996. An indeterminate number of nonciti-
 zens-estimates range from 20,000 to 50,00O-still have not registered.
 There were complaints about the slow pace with which the Government was proc-
 essing residence applications for some 19,000 Russian military pensioners. The proc-
 ess was complicated by the lack of Russian-provided passports in which to affix the
 permits. An estimated 35 percent of the first group of military pensioners missed
 the deadline to present their passports for residence permits. Technically, the Citi-
 zenship and Migration Board could move to have them deported. In fact, however,
 the Government is moving on a case-by-case basis to solve the outstanding issues.
 Late in the year, the Government decided to issue alien passports to those who
 could not or did not want to take out Russian citizenship.
 No restrictions are placed on the right of noncitizens to foreign travel, emigration,
 or repatriation, although some noncitizens complain of delays in obtaining travel
 documents. The Government began issuing temporary travel documents valid for a
 single departure and reentry into the country to resident aliens in 1994. To accom-
 modate entry visa requirements of other countries, the validity period of the docu-
 ment was extended in August 1994 from 6 months to 2 years. tlate 1994, the Gov-
 ernment began         a en passports. These are issued to resident aliens not in
 possession of any other valid travel document. Such aliens included. (1) persons who
 are designated as stateless; (2) foreign citizens who lack the opportunity to obtain
 travel documents of their country of origin or of another state; (3) persons who file
 for Estonian citizenship and pass the language examination if required; and (4)
 aliens who are permanently departing Estonia. The Government plans to expand
 the classes of noncitizens eligible for alien passports. It has already approved their
 issuance to noncitizens intending to study abroad and has agreed to issue them to
 former militar personnel who cannot or do not want to take out Russian citizen-
 ship. By early December, the Government had received about 130,000 applications
 for alien passports; it had issued more than 65,000. Estonian officials admitted that
 the pace of issuance had been unsatisfactory initially, but picked up late in the year.
 The Citizenship and Migration Board planned to issue virtually all the documents
 bypyear's end.
 The Government has deported a relatively small number of illegal aliens, usually
 those caught in criminal acts. By late September, 46 illegal aliens were held as in-
 ternees, pending deportation or a court order granting them residence. Aiter a large-
 scale escape from the internment prison, most internees were moved to a regular
 prison. In Marh 1995, the Government expelied Russian citizen and longtime resi-
 dent of Estonia, Pytr Rozhok, for repated antistate activities. Rozhok was the rep-
 resentative of Vladimir Zhirinovskys Russian Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia.
 He appealed the decision; after the case was adjourned in September, a hearing was
 held in October, and the court ruled that Rozhok's deportation had been proce-
 duraly flawed. The Citizenship and Migration Board did not appeal the decision,
 and Rozhk resides in Estonia.
 The Government has no asylum law and does not accord refugee status or asylum.
 The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) in the Nordic and Baltic states continues to urge Estonia to develop and
 adopt legislation distinguishing between refugees, applicants for asylum, and~ iegal
 immigrants. In 1995 he distrib~uted Estnian  anguae copies of the UNHOR Hand-
 book for Determing Refugee Status. Legislation that would bring Estonian law
 into conformance with the 1951 U.N. Protocol on the Status of Refugees and its
 1967 Protocol has been presented to the Parliament. There were no reports of refu-
 gees being returned to areas where they would face persecution.
 
 
 931
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their Government. In March 1995, free and fair
 elections to the second post-Soviet Parliament were held. Among the deputies are
 six ethnic Russians. Indirect presidential elections were held in August and Septem-
 ber. When the Parliament failed to muster the required two-thirds majority to elect
 the President, an Electoral Assembly consisting of parliament members and rep-
 resentatives of local governments convened and reelected the incumbent, Lennart
 Meri.
 Local elections were held in late October. The Local Elections Law permits resi-
 dent noncitizens to vote but not to run for office. About one-third of qualified non-
 citizens registered to vote in local elections, and the vast majority of these turned
 out to vote. The local elections were free and fair, although due to technical mis-
 haps, some qualified voters were left off the rolls. In May the President rejected the
 draft of the local elections law that would have required language testing of those
 candidates who had not acquired an Estonian language education. Parliament
 agreed to drop this stipulation. All candidates must certify that they know Estonian
 sufficiently to be able to function in local government. Theoretically, elected council
 members can be removed from office for insufficient Estonian skills, but no such
 case has occurred. However, in late December the State Electoral Commission began
 hearings into a complaint fied by Sillamae town council members against the coun-
 cil chairman who, the complaint alleged, could not speak Estonian.
 The Citizenship Law enacted in February 1992 readopted the 1938 Citizenship
 Law. According to that law, anyone born after 1940 to a citizen parent is a citizen
 by birth. The parent does not have to be an ethnic Estonian. The Government esti-
 mates that under this provision some 80,000 persons not ethnically Estonian have
 obtained citizenship. The law included requirements for naturalization, such as a 2-
 year residency requirement, to be followed by a 1-year waiting period, as well as
 knowledge of the Estonian language.
 In January 1995, Parliament adopted a new Citizenship Law revising the 1992
 law and combining into one statute provisions regarding citizenship that were scat-
 tered among several pieces of legislation. This law became effective in April 1995.
 It extended the residency requirement for naturalization from 2 to 5 years and
 added a requirement for knowledge of the Constitution and the Citizenship Law.
 Persons who had taken up legal residence in Estonia prior to July 1, 1990, are ex-
 empt from the 5-year legal residence and 1-year waiting period requirements. The
 law allows the Government to waive the language requirement but not the civic
 knowledge requirement for applicants who have Estonian language elementary or
 higher education, or who have performed valuable service to Estonia.
 According to the latest law, the following classes of persons are ineligible for natu-
 ralization: those filing on the basis of false data or documents; those not abiding by
 the constitutional system or not fulfilling the laws; those who have acted against
 the State and its security; those who have committed crimes and been punished
 with a sentence of more than 1 year or who have been repeatedly brought to justice
 for felonies; those who work or have worked in the intelligence or security services
 of a foreign state; or those who have served as career soldiers in the armed forces
 of a foreign state, including those discharged into the reserves or retired. (The latter
 includes spouses who have come to Estoma in connection with the service members
 assignment to a posting, the reserves, or retirement.) A provision of the law allows
 for the granting of citizenship to a foreign military retiree who has been married
 to a natve citzen for 5 years.
 Between 1992 and late October, some 85,300 persons had received citizenship.
 Some observers attribute this growing but still relatively low number to indecision
 over whether to apply for Estonian citizenship or citizenship of another country,
 such as Russia. By August Russian Embassy data showed that more than 110,0000
 persons had obtained Russian citizenship, however, the Embassy refused to supply
 the Government with a list. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Eu-
 rope (OSCE) Mission believes that the actual number of Russian citizens may be
 lower since the Embassy does not seem to keep records on those who die or depart
 Estonia.
 The Citizenship Law was criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry and by some
 in the local Russian community as discriminatory. Some Western observers also
 urged that there be some flexibility shown, especially regarding language require-
 ments for the elderly. However, numerous international fact-finding organizations,
 including the Finnish Helsinki Committee and the Organization for Security and
 Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), confirm that the Citizenship Law conforms to inter-
 national standards.
 
 
 932
 Bureaucratic delays and the Estonian language requirement are also cited as dis-
 incentives for securing citizenship. The Government has established language train-
 ig centers, but there is a lack of qualified teachers, financial resources, and train-
 ig materials. Some allege that the examination process, which 75 to 90 percent
 pass, is arbitrary.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics. However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are
 12 women among the 101 members of Parliament. One of the presidential can-
 didates was also a woman. Two female ministers assumed office after the cabinet
 reshuffle at the end of the year. There are six ethnic Russian deputies in Par-
 liament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the formation or functioning of human rights
 organizations. In response to allegations of poor treatment of ethnic minorities, the
 President established a Human Rights Institute which first convened in 1992. The
 purpose of the Institute is to monitor human rigits in Estonia and to provide infor-
 mation to the international community. It investigates reports of human rights vio-
 lations, such as allegations of jpolice abuse and inhuman treatment of detainees. In
 September the Institute established an information center in the heavily ethnic Rus-
 sian town of Kchtla-Jarve. In addition because of tensions surrounding the adoption
 of the Elections Law and the Aliens Law in 1993, the President established a round
 table composed of representatives of Parliament, the Union of Estonian Nationali-
 ties, and the Russian speaking population's Representative Assembly. An analogous
 but independent round table meets in the county of East Virumaa. In addition with
 initial funding from the Danish government, a nongovernmental legal information
 center in Tallinn provides free legal assistance to individuals--citizen and nonciti-
 zen alike-seeking advice on human rights-related issues.
 In the context of repeated Russian allegations of human rights violations among
 the noncitizen population, both the OSCE mission in Estonia and the OSCE High
 Commissioner on National Minorities have declared that they could not find a pat-
 tern of human rights violations or abuses in Estonia. Although the Government pre-
 viously had expressed concern about what it termed biased reporting by the OSCE
 mission, government relations with the mission were cordial.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, social status or for any other reason. The Government reports that no
 court cases charging discrimination have been filed.
 Women.-Violence against women, including spousal abuse, was the subject of in-
 creasing discussion and media coverage. According to women's groups and law en-
 forcement officials, family violence is not pervasive. Rape and attempted rape occur
 relatively infrequently. In the first 11 months, there were 93 reported rapes and at-
 tempted rapes, compared with 97 for the same period in 1995. However, studies
 show that 40 percent of crime in Estonia goes unreported, including domestic vio-
 lence. Even when the police are called, the abused spouse often declines to press
 charges.
 Discussion of the role and situation of women has been extensive, especially in
 the wake of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995, as well
 as former Social Affairs Minister Siiri Oviir's run for the presidency. Women possess
 the same legal rights as men and are legally entitled to equal pay for equal work.
 Nevertheless, although women's average educational level was higher than men's,
 their avere pay was lower, and the trend did not seem to be imprving. There
 continue to be female- and male-dominated professions. Most women carry major
 household responsibilities in addition to comprising slightly more than one-ha of
 the work force.
 _Chi/dren.-The Government's strong commitment to education is evidenced by the
 high priority it gives to building and refurbishing schools. The Government provides
 tree medica care for children and subsidizes school meals. In 1992 the Government
 adopted a Law on Child Protection patterned after the U.N. Convention on the
 Rights of the Child.
 �There is no societal pattern of child abuse, but a 1995 research project conducted
 by te nongovernmental Estonian Union for Child Welfare on children and violence
 at home found that a significant proportion of children had experienced at least oc-
 casional violence at home in schools, or in youth gangs. A 1996 poll reports that
 percent oi surveyed children had been sexually molested. Finnish press reports
 
 
 933
 alleged large-scale child prostitution in Estonia; the Government called these re-
 ports exaggrtdbut admitted that underage prostitution occurs.
 People         D  itie.-While the Constitution contains provisions to protect
 disabled persons against discrimination, and both the State and some private orga-
 nizations prvide them with financial assistance, little has been done to enable dis-
 abled people to participate normally in public life. There is no public access law, but
 some effort to accommodate the disabled is evident in the inclusion of ramps at
 curbs on new urban sidewalk construction. Public transportation firms have ac-
 quired some vehicles that are accessible to the disabled, as have some taxi compa-
 mes.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities-The OSCE mission in Estonia, established
 in 1993, continued to promote stability, dialog, and understanding among commu-
 nities in Estonia. In addition the President's Round Table, also established in 1993,
 which is corpsed of members of Parliament, representatives of the Union of Esto-
 nian Nationaities, and the Representative Assembly of the Russian Community,
 continued to work toward finding practical solutions to problems of noncitizens, as
 did the analogous but independent round table that met in the northeastern part
 of the country (see Section 4).
 The Law on Cultural Autonomy for citizens belonging to minority groups was
 adopted by Parliament and went into effect in 1993. There is a tradition of protec-
 tion for cultural autonomy going back to a 1925 law. Some noncitizens termed the
 law discriminatory, since it restricts cultural autonomy only to citizens. The Govern-
 ment replied that noncitizens can fully participate in ethnic organizations and that
 the law includes subsidies for cultural organizations.
 Ethnic Russians total approximately 29 percent, and nonethnic Estonians as a
 whole some 37 percent, of the population of slightly less than 1.5 million. During
 the years of Estonia's forced annexation by the Soviet Union, large numbers of non-
 Estonians, predominantly ethnic Russians, were encouraged to migrate to Estonia
 to work as laborers and administrators. They and their descendants now make up
 approximately one-third of the total population; about 40 percent of them were born
 in Estonia. About 8 percent of the population of the pre-1940 Republic was ethnic
 Russian.
 Some noncitizens, especially Russians, continued to allege job, salary, and housing
 discrimination because of Estonian language requirements. Russian government of-
 ficials and parliamentarians echoed these charges in a variety of forums. The law
 makes no distinction on the basis of lack of citizenship concerning business or prop-
 erty ownership other than for land. A 1996 law on land ownership further liberal-
 ized land ownership by foreigners; such ownership is now restricted only in certain
 strategic areas. All legal residents of Estonia may participate equally in the privat-
 ization of state-owned housing.
 Estonian language requirements for those employed in the civil service went into
 effect in 1993. The new Law on Public Service as originally passed required state
 employees to be proficient in Estonian by the end of 1995. In December 1995, Par-
 liament amended the Law on Public Service to allow noncitizen local and national
 government employees without adequate Estonian to continue working until Feb-
 ruary 1, 1997. No noncitizens were to be hired after January 1, 1996. This amend-
 ment reflected the Government's awareness that in some sectors, the number of em-
 ployees with inadequate Estonian remained high. Two railroad employees were dis-
 missed for claiming adequate command of Estonian on the basis of fraudulent cer-
 tificates. The employees fied suit: one was ordered reinstated and the other's case
 was pending at year's end.
 The language office liberally grants extensions to persons who can explain their
 failure to meet their requisite competence level in 4 years. Estonian language train-
 is available but, some claim, too costly. Some Russian representatives have
 aed for free language training. They also charge that the language requirement
 for citizenship is to difficult, and there has been talk of making the language re-
 quirement less rigorous. The examination fee for either language test-for employ-
 ment or citizenship--is 15 percent of the monthly minimum wage, although it is
 waived for the unemployed.
 Legislation and a government decision provide that in districts where more than
 one-half of the population speak a language other than Estonian, the inhabitants
 are entitled to receive official information in that language. Moreover, the local gov-
 enent may conduct business in that language. In practice city governments of
 predominantly Russian speaking communities conduct most internal business in
 Russian.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join a union or employee association. The Central Organization of Estonian Trade
 Unon          came into being as a wholly voluntary and purely Estonian organi-
 zation in 190 to replace the Estonian branch of the official Soviet labor confed-
 eration, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (AUCCTL). The EAKL has
 120,000 members. Another trade union, The Organization of Employee Unions
 (TALO), split from the EAKL in 1993 and has 50,000 members. About one-third of
 the country's labor force belongs to one of the two labor federations.
 The right to strike is legal, and unions are independent of the Government and
 political parties. The Constitution and statutes prohibit retribution against strikers.
 There was a 1-day strike by employees of cultural institutions. Some worker dem-
 onstrations occurred to protest low salaries, poor working conditions, or public and
 private sector enterprise layoff p lana.
 Unions may join federations freely and affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-While Estonian workers now
 have the legally acquired right to bargain collectively, collective bargaining is still
 in its infancy. According to EARL leaders, few collective bargaining agreements
 have been concluded between management and workers of a specific enterprise. The
 EAKL has, however, concluded framework agreements with producer associations,
 which provide the basis for specific labor agreements, including the setting of the
 minimum wage. The EAKL was also involved with developing Estonia's new Labor
 Code covering employment contracts, vacation, and occupational safety. The Labor
 Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees have the right to go to court
 to enforce their rights. In 1993 laws covering collective bargaining, collective dispute
 resolution, and shop stewards were enacted.
 There are no eort processing zones.
 c. Prohibition o Forced or Cormpulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Labor Inspections Office effectively enforces this prohibi-
 tion.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum for em-
 ployment is 16 years of age. Minors 13 to 15 years of age may work with written
 permission of a parent or guardian and the local labor inspector, if working is not
 dangerous to the minor's health or considered immoral, does not interfere with stud-
 ies, and if the type of work is included on a government-prepared list. Government
 authorities effectively enforce minimum age laws through inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government, after consultations with the
 EAKL and the Central Producers Union, sets the minimum wage. The monthly min-
 imum wage is $62 (680 Estonian crowns). The minimum wage is not sufficient to
 provide a worker and family with a decent standard of living. About 3 percent of
 the work force receive the minimum wage. The average monthly wage in the second
 quarter was about $250.
 The standard workweek is 40 hours, and there is a mandatory 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. According to EAKL sources, legal occupational health and safety standards are
 satisfactory, but they are extremely difficult to achieve in practice. The National
 Labor Inspection Board is responsible for enforcement of these standards, but it has
 not been very effective to date. In addition the labor unions have occupational
 health and safety experts who assist workers into bringing employers in compliance
 with legal standards. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
