 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is ruled by a small group of men who led the
 country to independence in 1975 following 500 years of
 Portuguese rule. This group which directs Cape Verde's
 single political party, the African Party for the Indepen-
 dence of Cape Verde, selects the president, who is nominally
 elected by the national assembly. Election to the national
 assembly is from a single list of candidates selected by the
 party. No other political parties are permitted. The
 guiding political role of the party is formally set forth in
 the Constitution which restricts freedom to participate
 meaningfully in the political process. However, the Cape
 verdean authorities have generally shown respect for the
 integrity of the person.
 The major human rights development in 1982 was the conviction
 of 19 persons for wattempting to alter the Constitution
 by violent means.* They had been arrested after a disturbance
 in 1981 which arose out of a political protest. There are
 no other persons known to be imprisoned for politically
 related offenses. No significant trends in human rights
 can be discerned from the events in 1982.
 Cape Verde lacks natural resources, has a poorly-developed
 economy, and is suffering through its fourteenth year of
 drought. The Government is the largest employer and
 controls banking:, commodity imports, mass transit, the
 press, and schools. Although the ideology of the party is
 socialist, there is a substantial private sector. Most
 shops, farms, and the fishing industry are in private
 hands, and private doctors and lawyers practice their
 professions. The Government, in implementing its programs
 for economic and social development, has refrained from
 arbitrary expropriation of private property, and confiscatory
 tax laws. Government economic and social programs are run
 in a nondiscriminatory fashion.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no reports of politically motivated killings
 during the year.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no confirmed instances of any mysterious
 disappearances, abductions, or persons held in clandestine
 detention during the year.
 c. Torture
 In 1981 an opposition group outside Cape Verde alleged
 that some persons were tortured after being arrested following
 a disturbance which arose out of a protest against the
 Government's proposed agrarian reform legislation. A public
 request to the Government by a local association of Cape
 Verdean lawyers for a public inquiry into allegations of
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners was refused. There
 were no reports of torture in 1982.
 
 
 54
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The severity of sentences is not considered to be unacceptable
 under international standards. Prison conditions are austere
 reflecting conditions of life in the country.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 About 25 persons were arrested in 1981, after a disturbance
 on the island of Santo Antao arising out of protests
 against the Government's proposed land reform legislation.
 In March 1982, 19 of these persons were tried and were
 sentenced to periods of imprisonment ranging from six months
 to ten years for "attempting to alter the Constitution by
 violent means". There are no other persons known to be
 imprisoned for politically-related offenses. Habeas
 corpus exists in Cape Verde and appears to be observed for
 nonpolitical offenses. Cape Verde law requires that arrestees
 be charged within 48 hours of arrest, or in exceptional
 cases, and with the concurrence of a procurator or judge,
 within five days. However, in cases of alleged crimes
 against state security, persons may be detained for up to
 five months without trial upon a judge's ruling.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have a right to counsel. If they cannot afford
 counsel, the court will assign them an attorney.
 The judiciary does not have the authority to determine the
 constitutionality of legislation. Although according to
 the Constitution judges are independent,!one former judge
 now living out of the country has-claimed that one-party
 rule in practice has hampered the functioning of. a truly
 independent judiciary. Most evidence suggests, however,
 that the courts protect individual riqhts in criminal
 cases.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution recognizes the inviolability of domicile,
 and the law requires that search warrants be issued by a
 judge. There have been no known instances during the
 year of illegal entry of homes or other violations of
 domicile.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and intellectual
 creativity, including the rights of authorship. The
 Constitution also stipulates that none of the rights and
 freedoms granted in it may be exercised "contrary to national
 unity" or the Constitution's principles and objectives.
 Since the principle of the party's political leadership is
 stated in the Constitution, criticism of the government's
 policies is considered by it to be unconstitutional. The
 newspaper and radio are government-owned and news is edited
 to reinforce support for the Government's policy. During
 1982, a former Cape Verdean government official, now in
 exile, charged that the newspaper refused to print his
 rebuttal to attacks the paper made against him.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees these freedoms, including
 the right to strike. In practice "mass associations,"
 such as the labor union and youth groups, function to
 mobilize popular support for government policies. The
 leadership of the labor union is closely tied to the party
 but claims to be independent. Although the union has the
 structure and some functions of a traditional trade union
 and is not part of the state structure, the right to strike
 has rarely, if ever, been exercised. There are no associa-
 tions in Cape Verde organized to oppose government policies.
 During the year, there were no known instances of persons
 assembling to express opposition to government policies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution separates church and state. Religious
 leaders do not participate in political affairs, and the
 Government would not allow such participation. The Government
 respects freedom of worship, and members of all religous
 groups in Cape Verde practice their religion without harass-
 ment. There is no evidence that adherence to a particular
 faith disadvantages the adherent in secular activities.
 About two-thirds of the population is Roman Catholic.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal or administrative restrictions on
 either travel or residence within the country. All resident
 Cape Verdeans wishing to leave the country, either temporarily
 or.permanently, must obtain exit permission from the Government.
 Such &ermission has not been denied for political reasons.
 Emigra-tion has long been an important escape valve from
 harsh Aconomic conditions in the country. Repatriation is a
 constitutional right of the citizen, and the Government does
 not discourage intending repatriates. The law allows for
 revocation of citizenship on several grounds, including
 activities contrary to the interest of the country. However,
 there are no known cases of persons having lost citizenship for
 political reasons. There are no foreign refugees in Cape Verde.
 e. Freedom To Participate In the Political Process
 Cape Verde is a single-party state. The head of state,
 the President, is nominally elected by the national assembly.
 However, it is believed that his election ratifies a decision
 already taken at the party's superior council level.
 Although the Constitution vests supreme political authority
 in the national assembly, which meets for several weeks a
 year to review decisions made by the executive, real power
 appears to rest with the small group of men who led Cape
 Verde to independence. They are the President, the Prime
 Minister and members of the national council of the party.
 Participation in the party is open to all without coercion,
 and about two percent of the population belongs. Party
 membership is not required to hold senior positions in the
 
 
 Government. Most high officials are party members, although
 several are not. In the first national elections for
 the assembly in December, 1980 there was only a single
 voting list which was compiled by the party. Voters had the
 option of rejecting the list and eight percent did so.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There is evidence that the Government is receptive to
 visits by private organizations to check on conditions of
 persons imprisoned for politically related offenses. There
 are no known instances in which the Government has been the
 subject of resolutions, investigations or other human rights
 actions by official international organizations. The major
 private human rights organizations have not reported on Cape
 Verde.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Government of Cape Verde is committed to improving
 the economic condition of its citizens. However, its
 ability to help its citizens attain a minimum level of
 well-being is'severely restricted by the islands' lack of
 natural resources and the continuation of severe drought.
 The Government's first priority is the prevention of famine,
 which it has successfully warded off since independence
 with food aid, primarily from Western countries. The
 Government has given priority to emergency developmental
 programs, financed primarily by foreign grants, to provide
 jobs for agricultural workers displaced by drought. Water-
 and soil conservation programs and road and school constrc-
 tion are given emphasis. Over the past 150 years recurrent
 droughts and high unemployment, currently about 33 percent,
 have led to emigration and have resulted in a large Cape
 Verdean overseas community estimated at about 500,000, of
 whom some 300,000 live in the United States. Emigrant
 remittances and official aid account for two-thirds of the
 country's gross national product. (US food and development
 aid since independence totals $50 million.) Per capita
 gross national product is estimated at about $300. The
 population of the Cape Verde Islands is about 300,000,
 growing at an annual rate of less than one percent a year.
 With an infant mortality rate of about eight percent in
 1980, life expectancy at birth is 61 years. The adult
 literacy rate is 37 percent.
 Racial discrimination is not a problem in Cape Verde,
 and the vast majority of the population shares various
 proportions of Portuguese-African ancestry. Sex discrimi-
 nation exists, because many of the traditional, male-
 oriented values in the Portuguese and African heritages of
 Cape Verde are still part of the islands' culture. Women
 have been customarily excluded from certain types of
 work, and are often paid less than men for comparable
 work. The Government has included women in the labor
 intensive economic development projects financed by foreign
 grants. The Constitution bans sex discrimination. Both the
 Government and the party are making efforts to bring women
 into various economic and social activities where they have
 
 
 57
 been traditionally absent. The Organization of Cape Verdean
 Women was founded in 1980, with party encouragement, to
 sensitize the Government and Cape Verdeans on issues affecting
 women. The Code of the Family, enacted in October 1981,
 prescribes full. legal equality of men and women, including
 equal pay for equal work.
