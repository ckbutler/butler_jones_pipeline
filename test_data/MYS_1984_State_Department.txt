 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a multiethnic society. Malays dominate political
 affairs. The Malaysian parliamentary system of government is
 based on free elections, contested by a number of parties
 representing a broad range of political opinion. Although the
 ruling National Front (composed of ethnically based parties
 representing the majority Malay, the Chinese, and the Indian
 communities) has won a two-thirds or better majority in the
 federal Parliament in every election since Malaysia achieved
 independence, opposition parties are active and vocal
 participants in the political system and have occasionally
 held power at the state level. A strong free
 enterprise-oriented economy and abundant natural resources
 have helped Malaysia become one of the most prosperous of the
 developing countries.
 Malaysia's internal security has been seriously threatened
 twice. A major Communist insurrection began in 1948 and
 peaked in the early fifties; it still smolders in a few border
 areas. In 1969, inter-communal rioting followed national
 elections: several hundred persons were reported to have died.
 The remnants of the Communist insurgency and the possibility
 of renewed communal conflict are cited by the Malaysian
 Government as justification for laws that allow detention
 without trial of persons suspected of subversive activity or
 of other activities that threaten general civil order.
 Prime Minister Mahathir's administration has been relatively
 restrained in its use of Malaysia's internal security
 legislation in comparison to previous regimes. The number of
 political detainees has been reportedly reduced by more than
 two-thirds, to about 168, since Mahathir took office in 1981.
 The Malaysian Government has insisted, however, that it will
 maintain the framework of security legislation for the
 foreseeable future and has warned that Malaysia's laws
 restricting individual rights will be enforced when the
 Government believes it necessary to do so.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports during 1984 of political killings by the
 Government or by any other organizations.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1984 there was no evidence of abduction, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detention attributable to the
 Government or to non-governmental or opposition forces.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of torture or cruel, inhuman, and
 degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malaysian Constitution provides for the proclamation of a
 state of emergency during which individual rights may be
 limited by law. A state of emergency was proclaimed in
 
 
 823
 MALAYSIA
 May 1969 during communal rioting, and has not been rescinded.
 Legislation granting extraordinary powers to the Government
 permits arrest and imprisonment without benefit of trial or
 judicial review. The Home Minister said in September 1984
 that the number of detainees had dropped from 540 when Prime
 Minister Mahathir took power in 1981 to 168; in 1984 the
 Government is known to have ordered the detention of 52
 Malaysians; of whom 11 remained in detention as of
 December 1984. Among those released this year was the Prime
 Minister's former political secretary, detained in 1981 on
 suspicion of cooperating with Soviet Intelligence. Nearly all
 of the unreleased detainees are alleged members or supporters
 of the Communist Party of Malaya. However, government leaders,
 who have repeatedly warned the country about Muslim 'religious
 extremists,' ordered the detention of three members of the
 opposition Parti Islam Sa-Malaysia (PAS) in June 1984. In
 September two of these three detainees were released, but
 another PAS activist was detained.
 Malaysia's Internal Security Act (ISA) permits arrest and
 detention without trial of persons suspected of subversive
 activity or other actions contributing to domestic instability.
 It provides for initial preventive detention for up to two
 years, extendable indefinitely. A person detained under the
 emergency laws has no recourse to the courts, but must be told
 the reason for his detention and given an opportunity to
 challenge the detention order as soon as possible after arrest.
 The Government reserves the right to refuse requests for
 information on specific individuals detained under security
 legislation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malaysian judiciary is generally regarded by the public
 and the legal community as committed to the rule of law.
 Although the courts have rarely challenged legislation, they
 have not hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in
 specific cases, both civil and criminal.
 With the exception of security cases not brought to trial,
 defendants have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to
 represent clients without penalty to themselves. Most civil
 and criminal cases are tried under the regular judicial
 system, derived from British jurisprudence, and thus public
 trial and a fair hearing occur in all but the cases which are
 security-related. In all other cases, the courts apply
 criminal law and procedures, including strict rules of
 evidence. Charges must be levied against a defendant within
 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide within 14 days
 whether to bring the case to court. Defendants may appeal
 lower court decisions to the federal courts and, in criminal
 cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or to local
 state rulers, as appropriate.
 Persons detained for security reasons and for certain classes
 of crimes, however, may be held and given hearing under special
 procedures outside the ordinary court system. These procedures
 allow suspects to be detained without charge for a period which
 may, in practice, be extended indefinitely. If brought to
 trial under the internal security regulations, the accused does
 not receive a statement of the evidence, trial is by a single
 judge without a jury, and witnesses may be examined in the
 absence of the accused. Admissible evidence includes hearsay
 and secondary evidence, testimony of children and spouses,
 self-incriminating statements to police, and information from
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 53
 
 
 824
 MALAYSIA
 seized records or communications. If the accused is found
 guilty, the judge must impose the maximum penalty. For certain
 internal security crimes, including the possession of firearms
 or ammunition, the mandatory sentence is death. In 1984
 five persons were executed in Malaysia for illegal possession
 of firearms.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the ISA the police may enter and search the homes of
 individuals suspected of threatening national security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are circumscribed in Malaysia.
 Following the 1969 communal disturbances and the subsequent two
 year suspension of parliamentary democracy, laws were enacted
 to reduce the risk of communal violence by forbidding public
 exacerbation of racial tensions. Since then, under the
 Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1971, certain 'sensitive"
 issues touching on ethnic origins or on privileges the
 Government accords to ethnic Malays may not be questioned in
 public or in Parliament.
 All radio stations and two of the three television channels
 are government-controlled. The third channel, which began
 broadcasting in 1984, and most of the press are owned by
 groups closely connected with the Government. Government
 control over publishing licenses has inclined the press
 towards considerable self-censorship. In March, moreover,
 Parliament passed the Printing and Publications Act of 1984,
 which further strengthens government control over both local
 and imported foreign publications.
 Despite old and new government restrictions on the freedom of
 speech and the press, the activities and statements of
 opposition political figures and domestic political
 developments are reported in some detail. Critical reporting
 on controversial issues and public policies appears to have
 increased. On the other hand, the ruling party receives much
 more extensive coverage of its activities, and reports on the
 activities of opposition parties have occasionally been
 misleading. The distribution of a respected regional
 publication has been delayed for up to a month for most of
 1984; this is generally believed to be retaliation for its
 incisive coverage of controversy surrounding recent amendments
 to the Constitution that limited the privileges of the monarchy
 to delay legislation.
 Student associations must be approved by the Ministry of
 Education, and are prohibited from engaging in political
 activity. Professors are forbidden to make public comments on
 controversial issues. However, government interpretation of
 these strictures appears to be gradually easing. In February
 several government leaders threatened the withdrawal of
 scholarships from those Malaysian students abroad who allegedly
 sought the "overthrow of the government by force," but later
 stated that students are encouraged "to criticize, no matter
 how much it may sting.'

 MALAYSIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association. It also grants the
 Government extensive powers to limit those rights by
 legislation in the interest of security and public order.
 After the 1969 communal riots, the Government passed laws
 greatly limiting the right to public assembly by large
 groups. In recent years, these laws have often been ignored.
 However, in August 1984, responding to-a wave of political
 rallies by the opposition PAS party, the Government banned
 .political meetings" in four Malaysian states. Government
 statements at the time asserted that the ban was motivated
 primarily by a PAS disposition to mix religion and politics in
 its denunciations of the Government and its dominant Malay
 party, UMNO. According to government leaders, the PAS
 campaign put national security at risk by sowing division
 within the Malay community. The ban was lifted in October,
 1984.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 governs the rights of
 workers to engage in trade union activity. More specifically,
 it prohibits any person from interfering with, restraining, or
 coercing a worker in the exercise of the right to form or
 participate in the lawful activities of a trade union. In
 1980, this was amended to give the Government more power to
 deal with disruptive strikes. These amendments have been
 criticized by Malaysian unions. In 1983 the International
 Labor Organization urged the Malaysian Government to amend
 several sections of the Industrial Relations Act to bring it
 into conformity with the Convention on the Right to Organize
 and Collective Bargaining.
 The Government's attitude towards unions ranges from
 questioning their necessity to grudging acknowledgement of
 their contribution to Malaysia's economic development. In
 1983-1984, the Government actively encouraged the formation of
 'house unions,' and advocated a Malaysian work ethic based on
 a Japanese model of worker-employer cooperation.
 There are approximately 380 unions in Malaysia, representing
 approximately 600,000 workers, or about 15 percent of the
 salaried work force. About 40 percent of these unions are
 'house' unions. These represent about 25 percent of the total
 membership.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam and Malays are
 legally bound by Islamic religious laws which are the province
 of state, rather than federal, authorities. Nonetheless, the
 federal Constitution guarantees freedom of religion for all.
 Religious minorities, which include large Hindu, Buddhist,
 Sikh and Christian communities, are free to practice their
 faith without interference by the Government. Conversion is
 permitted, but proselytization of Muslims is very strongly
 discouraged. Although an Islamic religious establishment is
 supported by government funds and it is government policy to
 infuse "Islamic values' into the administration of Malaysia,
 the Government has refused to accede to demands for the
 imposition of Islamic religious law in cases involving
 non-Muslims. Non-Muslims are excused from public school
 instruction in the Muslim religion.
 
 
 826
 MALAYSIA
 There is an unwritten government policy of barring 'Israeli
 influences.' Although this policy, a result of strong
 anti-Zionist feeling among the majority Muslim population, is
 politically oriented, it occasionally has religious
 overtones. In August 1984, the New York Philharmonic
 Orchestra canceled its Malaysian tour after objections were
 raised to the inclusion in the program of a piece by Ernest
 Bloch entitled "Schelomol and subtitled I A Hebrew Rhapsody.'
 This incident, viewed by many responsible Malaysians as an
 aberration, apparently arose because of an overzealous
 interpretation of this unwritten policy. The Malaysian
 Government does attempt to ban works which are judged to be
 spro-Israell or 'pro-Zionist," but does not have a systematic
 policy of discriminating against works of Jewish origin.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the Government terms
 security grounds. The Government also attempts to control
 closely travel to China by ethnic Chinese citizens below the
 age of 65. According to the Malaysian Director General of
 Immigration, 85 Malaysians have had their passports withdrawn
 for traveling to China without permission.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to 200,000 Vietnamese
 refugees since 1975. It has cooperated fully with
 international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to those
 countries. Malaysia itself has resettled over 5,000 Khmer
 Muslim refugees, but has not accepted non-Muslim refugees for
 permanent settlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British model.
 The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible to Parliament.
 Elections must be held at least once every five years. The
 opposition concedes that elections to date have been free and
 fair; votes are cast secretly and recorded accurately.
 Through the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Malays
 dominate the ruling National Front coalition of ethnic-based
 parties which, in turn, has controlled Parliament since
 independence. Malays fill most important cabinet posts. The
 National Front parties occasionally benefit from gerrymandered
 electoral districts. In April 1982, the National Front won 132
 of the 154 seats in the House of Representatives. Although the
 opposition regularly criticizes the Government in Parliament,
 it rarely succeeds in influencing legislation.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Malaysian Government is not a member of any international
 or regional human rights body. The Government was not the
 subject of resolutions, investigations, or other action by
 human rights organizations in 1984. In February 1984 the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission discontinued its
 investigation of alleged abuse of human rights in Malaysia,
 and expressed its appreciation for the Malaysian Government's
 cooperation in this matter. Although Amnesty International
 
 
 827
 MALAYSIA
 has noted that most detainees held under the ISA have been
 released in recent years, its 1984 Report again criticizes the
 Malaysian Government for detention without trial under this
 act and it has called for the unconditional release of specific
 "long-term* detainees. The Government has taken the position
 that Malaysia is the best and sole judge of its security needs
 and that the act will remain in effect. The Freedom House
 1984-85 report lists Malaysia as "partly free.'
 There are no government or private organizations in Malaysia
 which deal specifically with protection of individual
 liberties. The Bar Association, a Muslim youth movement, and
 a social reform group all devote some time to the subject,
 usually in reaction to government actions that they believe
 endanger civil liberties. The Bar Association also
 investigates some cases of possible violation of human rights,
 but more on an ad hoc basis than through set procedures.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Malaysia in 1984 was reported to be
 approximately 15.3 million, and the population growth rate
 is 2.2 percent. Government policy encourages a high birth
 rate. In 1984, life expectancy at birth is 67 years and infant
 mortality runs at about 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. In
 1976, sixty-two percent of the population had access to safe
 drinking water, and the caloric supply per person in 1977
 met 116 percent of nutritional requirements. Education is
 free, compulsory for nine years, and available to all. The
 Government provides scholarships at special boarding schools
 and at universities abroad for gifted students, particularly
 Malays. The adjusted primary school enrollment is 96.5
 percent. The adult literacy rate in 1977 was estimated at 59
 percent, with the rate for the entire population probably
 around 75 percent.
 Per capita GNP in Malaysia was estimated at $1,862 in 1982.
 About 38 percent of the rural population and 13 percent of the
 urban population in 1980 was considered to be below the World
 Bank's poverty line.
 The Government practices "affirmative action' on an extensive
 scale in favor of the politically dominant but still
 economically weaker ethnic Malay majority. Many non-Malays
 consider this policy discriminatory. As a result of these
 government programs and policies, non-Malay opportunities for
 education, government employment, and ownership of new
 homesteads are limited. Institutions of higher learning are
 required to use the national language, Malay, as the medium of
 instruction for non-technical courses.
 There are no restrictions on the political rights of Malaysian
 women, and government policy supports their full and equal
 participation in the Government, in education, and in the work
 force. In accordance with a national policy of rapid
 population growth, women are guranteed ample maternity leave
 and reemployment rights. Eight of the 154 members of the
 lower house of Parliament are women. The position of women in
 Malaysian society is, however, conditioned by the cutural and
 religious traditions of the country's major ethnic groups.
 With a general resurgence of Islamic piety among Malays, Malay
 women have in recent years tended toward close conformity with
 Koranic stipulations on women's roles.
