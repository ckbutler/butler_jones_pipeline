 REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 Essentially a one-party state, the Republic of China
 (ROC) on Taiwan operates under martial law conditions
 which the government states are required by its contin-
 uing confrontation with the People's Republic of China
 (PRC). While human rights violations continue to occur,
 their frequency has diminished. Also, island-wide
 elections were held recently which opponents of the govern-
 ment described as fair, and which saw the election of a
 significant number of non-party candidates.
 1. Respect for theIntegrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Publicly stated government policy prohibits torture.
 Reports about the use of torture or other cruel treat-
 ment have been relatively rare in recent years. When
 such reports do occur, they have usually been associated
 with pretrial detention and the extraction of confessions.
 For example, Amnesty International, in its Briefing
 Paper on Taiwan (No. 6, October 1976), maintains that
 during the pretrial detention period, "...political
 prisoners are held in solitary confinement, generally
 in underground cells without a bed and without exercise.
 They are denied books, pen and paper, except for the
 purposes of writing a confession." This type of
 mistreatment probably occurs, although it is difficult
 to verify.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading forms of punishment
 are now rare. Imprisonment is the usual form of
 punishment in the ROC. While those convicted of
 sedition can be sentenced to death, the government
 reports that only one person has been executed on
 sedition charges in recent years. A few individuals
 convicted of non-political crimes have also been given
 the death sentence. Prison conditions on Taiwan have
 been improving lately, but reports alleging inadequate
 medical care continue. We do not have means of indepen-
 dently verifying these reports.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In the 1950's, there were reports of people disappearing
 without word of their fate. Now, arbitrary arrests are
 infrequent, although some individuals suspected of
 "sedition," as defined in martial law provisions, have
 been detained and held incommunicado for weeks and at
 times months without being formally charged or tried.
 The general practice is either to indict detainees
 after an initial period of detention, or to-release
 them. In December 1976, Prime Minister Chiang Ching-kuo
 stated that 254 persons were in prison on sedition
 charges. We do not have means of verifying that number.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The ROC believes that the ongoing state of civil war
 with the PRC requires continuation of martial law.
 Opposition to basic national policy is considered
 to be seditious behavior, punishable under martial
 law, and the ROCcontinues -to try civilians suspected
 of "sedition" in military courts. Normal habeas corpus
 procedures do not appear to be applied in a consistent
 fashion in sedition cases. In military court trials
 and appeals, the accused has only limited opportunity
 to defend himself. In the recent past, members of the
 accused's family have been-allowed to attend these
 military court trials, and occasionally even carefully
 selected members of the public as well. While appeals
 to higher military courts in some cases result in reduced
 sentences, lower military court convictions have not been
 reversed.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 In contrast with the situation two decades ago, unjustified
 invasion of the home is not a common practice in the ROC.
 Non-violent searches do occur in connection with arrests;
 these usually, though not always, are authorized by a
 warrant.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 230
 Taiwan has an impressive record in helping to fulfill
 the basic needs of its people. The gap between the
 rich and poor is steadily narrowing. The ratio of
 per capita income between the top 20 percent and
 bottom 20 percent of the population has been reduced
 to about 4 to 1, against a background of rapid economic
 growth in a relatively free market economy. The
 government has designed programs to ensure that rapid
 industrialization does not exacerbate the moderate
 disparity that exists between the rural and urban sectors.
 Rapid and large-scale urbanization results in somewhat
 congested housing in Taiwan's major cities. Nevertheless,
 slum conditions are gradually ameliorating and housing
 in both rural and urban areas is generally adequate.
 An increasing number of families are beginning to
 enjoy modern conveniences and luxury items familiar
 in industrially advanced societies.
 The ROC has developed an effective public health pro-
 gram and a system of health stations throughout Taiwan.
 All major epidemic diseases have been brought under
 control. The government provides health promotion
 programs that include maternal and child health, family
 planning, school health, dental health, special care
 for disabled children, communicable diseases control
 and environmental sanitation. According to 1974
 statistics, there are 53,000 licensed doctors, of whom
 87 percent are in Western medicine and 13 percent are
 in traditional Chinese medicine.
 Adult literacy on Taiwan is 93 percent. About 4.4
 million people, 27 percent of the population, are
 presently in school. In 1968, a 9-year free education
 system was instituted; 6 years of elementary school
 is compulsory, and at least 90 percent of the students
 continue on through 3 years of junior high school.
 Taiwan's system of university, college, junior college,
 technical and vocational schools has grown rapidly
 in recent years. There are now 300,000 students at the
 undergraduate level.
 People in Taiwan enjoy a good diet. Per capita calorie
 and protein intakes have been increasing in recent years,
 reaching 2,727 calories and 74.5 grams of protein
 in 1975. While maintaining self-sufficiency in its
 
 
 231
 staple rice crop, the ROC has become an important
 participant in world food trade by exporting sugar,
 pineapple, and various fruits and vegetables, while
 importing wheat and feed grains.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Individuals are generally free to speak and publish
 on most issues not involving basic national policy.
 Nevertheless, martial law gives the government authority
 to limit freedom of speech and freedom of the press,
 and there are generally well-understood limits on
 both with respect to certain basic political issues.
 Expressing views contrary to the government's claim
 to represent all China, advocating accommodation
 or contacts with the PRC or supporting independence
 for Taiwan are punishable under martial law. The
 government conducts post-publication censorship
 and recalls articles and publications that oppose
 basic national policy. Some outspoken periodicals
 have been suspended or banned by the government. The
 government censors foreign publications but in recent
 years has lessened restrictions and allowed greater
 access to information about developments abroad.
 There is no meaningful tradition of trade unionism
 on Taiwan, and labor unions do not exercise signi-
 ficant influence in either the economic or political
 sphere. While labor unions are permitted to organize,
 the right to strike is prohibited under martial law.
 There is freedom of religion in Taiwan. The pre-
 dominant religion is a combination of Buddhism and
 Taoism. Other religions include Catholicism, Islam,
 and Protestantism. The government has banned some
 pseudo-Buddhist sects and Reverend Moon's Christian
 Unification Church. These bans appear to reflect the
 government's concern about the social policies of
 these sects rather than their religious beliefs.
 
 
 232
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly.
 However, the government has used its martial law powers
 to ban public meetings by those it suspects of dissi-
 dent views.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is general freedom of internal travel in Taiwan
 except to sparsely populated mountainous areas, for
 which a police pass is required on security grounds
 and to protect the aborigines from exploitation.
 Travel abroad or emigration is relatively free, with
 most of the restrictions related to economic considerations.
 As Taiwan's economy has prospered in recent years,
 the number of people traveling and living abroad has
 increased dramatically. Nevertheless, a small number
 of people have been denied exit permits for security
 reasons, and a few foreigners have been denied entry
 visas on political grounds.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since 1950, democratic institutions have been established
 at the provincial and local levels and have functioned
 reasonably well. Elections have been held regularly
 over the past two decades (universal suffrage for all
 citizens 20 years of age and older) for all local
 (i.e. Taiwan province) legislative officials and for
 the chief executives of cities, counties and villages
 on Taiwan. However, the Governor of Taiwan province
 and the Mayor of Taipei city are both appointed by
 the central government.
 Since the Republic of China maintains its claim to
 be the sole legal government of all China, there
 are a series of national congressional entities over
 and above those which pertain solely to the island
 of Taiwan. These are the National Assembly (which
 elects the President and Vice President of the
 Republic) and the Legislative Yuan, which is the
 national legislature. There have been no general
 elections to these two bodies since 1948 and the ROC
 takes the position that such elections cannot be
 held until it reestablishes control over the main-
 land. However, since 1969 the government has held
 
 
 supplementary elections for these national bodies in
 order to choose additional officials from Taiwan and
 adjacent islands. These elections: have not substantially
 altered the composition of the national bodies.
 Despite the theoretical existence of two opposition
 parties, the ROC is effectively a one-party state.
 Candidates who oppose the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang,
 or KMT) run as independents. Even though the majority
 of the candidates elected are from the KMT, indepen-
 dent candidates are not infrequently successful. The
 success of KMT candidates rests partly on the govern-
 ment's accomplishments in promoting social and
 economic programs and partly on the restrictions
 placed on the civil and political rights of its opponents,
 e.g., the limitations on free speech, assembly, and
 political organization.
 In the November 19, 1977 local elections independent
 candidates made unprecedented gains. Independents
 won four out of twenty positions as mayors and county
 magistrates, and twenty-one out of seventy-seven seats
 in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. Non-KMT candidates
 have described the elections as the fairest that have
 been held in Taiwan.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigatic.i of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 International organizations, such as Amnesty Inter-
 national, have visited Taiwan and met with government
 officials. In 1976, the government offered to allow
 U.S. Congressmen to visit ROC prisons and publicly
 invited impartial international organizations to
 observe prison conditions on Taiwan. Thus far, these
 offers have not been taken up.
