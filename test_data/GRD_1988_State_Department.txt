 GRENADA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Grenada's parliamentary
 system in which a Governor General is titular head of state,
 was suspended in 1979 by the Marxist People's Revolutionary
 Government (PRG) and then restored in October 1983. The New
 National Party (NNP), which won free and fair elections in
 1984, continues in power. Political and civil rights are
 provided for by the Constitution, although the Emergency
 Powers Act of 1987 gives the Government authority to suspend
 most civil rights should the Governor General declare a state
 of national emergency. Opposition politicians objected
 strenuously to the Act, implying that the Government already
 had sufficient control by dominating both Parliament and the
 media. The Government argued that similar legislation exists
 elsewhere in the Commonwealth and that the Act was part of an
 ongoing effort to reinstitute protective measures for
 society. The provisions of the Act have never been applied.
 Security in Grenada is maintained by the 600-strong Royal
 Grenada Police Force, which includes a 75-man paramilitary
 Special Services Unit and a 30-man coast guard unit.
 Since the fall of the PRG in 1983, the country has made major
 strides in improving its infrastructure and has enjoyed
 healthy economic growth, averaging 5 percent annually in real
 terms. Economic development has been spurred by production
 gains in agriculture, construction, tourism, transportation,
 and communications. Return of Grenadian capital and
 substantial economic assistance following restoration of
 democratic government in 1983 have also helped. Grenadians
 enjoy substantial freedom to pursue economic goals in a free
 market environment.
 Grenada's overall human rights record remained good during
 1988.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reported incidents of such abuse. Allegations of
 beatings by prison officials were raised in December by four
 of the people convicted of the murder of Maurice Bishop and
 others. Government officials maintained that the prisoners
 were injured as a consequence of prison officials reasserting
 discipline over the unruly prisoners.
 The prisoners also alleged they were denied private
 independent medical examinations. The Government asserted
 that the prisoners received prompt attention from prison
 doctors and ultimately were examined by a private doctor.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Grenadian police have the right under law to detain persons on
 suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This legal time limit is adhered to
 in practice. If the detainee is not charged within this time,
 he must be released. In 1988 no one was detained for
 political reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal
 charge. Formal arraignment or release of the arrestee must be
 determined within 60 days. These procedures were generally
 followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with
 treason can only be accorded bail upon recommendation of the
 Governor General.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1988. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 observed in practice. Those arrested and charged are brought
 before an independent judiciary and are allowed access to a
 lawyer of their choice. For capital crimes, the courts
 appoint lawyers when the accused cannot pay for his defense.
 In other cases, the defendant is assigned counsel if the case
 reaches the appellate stage. Following a determination by a
 judicial hearing that there is sufficient evidence to
 substantiate a criminal charge, the defendant is remanded for
 trial. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a lack of judges
 and court facilities, a significant amount of time can pass
 before those charged are brought to trial.
 The Government has taken particular care to afford a fair
 public trial, including a lengthy appeal process in the case
 of former People's Revolutionary Government and Army officials
 convicted of the murder of Maurice Bishop and 10 others on
 October 19, 1983. The defendants were sentenced to death or
 long prison terms. A three-member panel of Caribbean jurists
 is currently hearing the 32-count appeal, which began in 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference in a person's private
 life. Warrants for searching homes are normally required by
 law except in cases of hot pursuit. In practice, warrants are
 obtained in the majority of cases before a search is
 conducted. There were no reports of arbitrary monitoring of
 telephones or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the
 Constitution and freely exercised. There are five weekly
 newspapers and several other papers published irregularly.
 Most of the papers are affiliated with political parties, but
 the two most widely circulated newspapers are independent.
 
 
 572
 GRENADA
 Flyers are occasionally distributed by remnants of the
 Revolutionary Military Council and the New Jewel Movement.
 Grenada has one government-operated radio station. There are
 no regulations regarding equal access to the radio station by
 opposition political parties. In practice, the official
 opposition party was given occasional air time, but there were
 complaints that the time given was inadequate. Also, there
 have been complaints dating to 1985 that the Government has
 impeded the licensing of a private radio station. In May
 1988, charges of operating a station without a license that
 had been brought against the station's owners were dropped,
 but the radio equipment was not released from police custody.
 A counter-suit for damages is currently before the court.
 The Government retained the Calypso Censorship Committee, set
 up in 1987 to censor Calypso songs submitted for airing over
 the government-controlled radio station. The Committee, which
 was asked to eliminate those songs which were vulgar,
 libelous, or politically sensitive, largely replicated
 existing censorship responsibilities at the radio station.
 There were no appreciable complaints from the press or
 Calypsonians in 1988, following strong criticism in 1987.
 There were no reports of any Calypsos being banned for
 political reasons, and antigovernment Calypsos were heard
 regularly over the radio during the Carnival season.
 In October the Government seized four cartons of books
 imported in connection with memorial services for former Prime
 Minister Maurice Bishop. Citing national security as the
 grounds for the seizure, the Government pointed out that the
 Constitution allows limitations on freedom of speech and the
 press when reasonably required to defend the nation and/or to
 safeguard public safety, order, morality, and health. Pending
 a final decision, the confiscated books remain in police
 custody.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any peaceful
 purpose, including the public protest of policies or actions
 of the Government. Supporters of political parties, including
 those which were in power prior to October 1983, meet
 frequently and hold public rallies. There are no controls on
 private or public associations, and permits are not required
 for public meetings.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All groups enjoy freedom of religion. The Roman Catholic and
 Anglican faiths predominate, but there are many Presbyterian
 and Methodist as well as Evangelical church members. In
 addition, there is a small Baha'i community and an Islamic
 center which serves the Muslim community. Complete religious
 freedom extends to the Rastafarians, who were harassed under
 the PRG regime. Clergy, including missionaries, travel and
 prosyletize freely. No apparent advantages or disadvantages
 are conferred by adherence to a particular faith, although
 Christian prayers and hymns form part of many governmental and
 political meetings. Representatives of the Mormon church are
 free to travel to and proselytize in Grenada. There have been
 no further repercussions following the deportation of an
 
 
 573
 GRENADA
 American Mormon couple in September 1987 for violation of
 immigration laws. The deportation had followed an
 unsuccessful meeting between the couple and Grenadian
 officials aimed at clarifying both their immigration status
 and the Mormon church's teachings on certain racial matters.
 Although Grenadian officials were eventually satisfied that
 there is nothing malevolent about the church's present
 position on race, they were not sympathetic to a request for a
 prolongation of the couple's temporary visitor's status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada and, in principle,
 the right to enter and leave the country is guaranteed to all
 Grenadian citizens, except in special circumstances as
 outlined and limited by the Act to Restrict the Freedom of
 Movement of Certain Persons, passed in 1986. The law allows
 the minister responsible for national security to restrict
 travel out of Grenada of any person whose aims, tendencies, or
 objectives include the overthrow of the democratic and
 parliamentary system of government. Anyone so restricted may
 appeal after 3 months to an independent and impartial tribunal
 presided over by an accredited lawyer chosen by the Chief
 Justice. The law was enacted after the Grenadian Appeals
 Court upheld a government action withholding the passport of a
 former member of the PRG who sought to leave the country in
 1985. There were no reported cases of this law being applied
 in 1988.'
 No one was forcibly repatriated to Grenada in 1987, and there
 were no official applications for refugee status. The
 Government has allowed students and others to return from Cuba
 and other Communist countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for free and fair elections to be
 held at least every 5 years. The majority party in Parliament
 is the New National Party (NNP), led by Prime Minister Herbert
 Blaize. Formed by the union of 3 parties to contest the
 December 1984 elections, the NNP won 14 of the 15
 Parliamentary seats in an'election in which 85 percent of the
 voters participated. The NNP's majority was reduced to 9
 after the resignation of 2 members in 1986, and further
 defections in 1987 left the NNP with a 9 to 6 majority. These
 defections were followed in 1987 by the establishment of a new
 national opposition party, the National Democratic Congress
 (NDC), composed of the five defectors plus the original one
 opposition Parliamentarian. The spectrum of political parties
 ranges from the moderate NNP and the NDC to the Marxist
 Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement (MBPM), organized by the
 pro-Bishop survivors of the October 19, 1983, anti-Bishop
 coup, and the Grenada United Labor Party (GULP) of former
 Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy. These parties actively espouse
 their views and seek support from the electorate.
 Constitutionally, Parliament must dissolve no later than
 December 1989, and elections must be held no later than the
 spring of 1990. Local government elections promised by the
 NNP in the campaign remain a topic of public debate but have
 yet to be held. The political system is not dominated by any
 particular ethnic group, nor are there any restrictions which
 limit participation of any elements of the Grenadian
 
 
 574
 GRENADA
 population. Women are a clear minority in political life,
 although two members of Parliament are women. They are both
 junior ministers in the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The present Government has welcomed visits of several human
 rights organizations in the past, including Amnesty
 International. In August the Government participated in a
 symposium on human rights cosponsored by the Caribbean
 Institute for the Promotion of Human Rights (CARICARE) and the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. CARICARE is active
 in Grenada. It has called on the Government to recognize and
 accept the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of
 Justice.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of official discrimination in health
 care, employment, or education. There have been some reported
 incidents of unofficial job discrimination against Guyanese
 and other foreign-born residents. Women frequently earn less
 than men performing the same work and tend to occupy jobs
 which pay less. Wage differences are less prevalent for more
 highly paid jobs, but there are fewer women in such
 positions. A notable exception is the civil service where
 women account for a substantial percentage of the work force
 up to and including the Permanent Secretary/Department
 Headlevel. There are a few women in important positions in
 the private sector, including a female president of the
 Grenada Manufacturing Association.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize independent labor unions.
 Workers in the public as well as private sector can and do
 strike legally if they give advance notification. Parliament
 is considering legislation which would limit the ability to
 strike in essential services, but that legislation includes
 provisions for binding arbitration by a tribunal which could
 include arbitrators nominated by labor. Union leaders play a
 significant role in the political process, and one labor
 leader serves in the Senate at the nomination of the governing
 party. In 1988 all unions were free of government control,
 and none was given government support.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to participate in collective bargaining.
 Legislation compels employers to recognize a union wnich
 represents the majority of workers in that particular
 business. Labor Ministry officials estimate approximately 25
 percent of the total work force is unionized, although this
 figure may be low.
 There are no areas in which union organization and collective
 bargaining are discouraged or impeded by the Government,
 including export processing zones.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced labor, and no
 such incidents were reported in 1988.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 I
 The statutory minimum age for employment in all sectors is
 16. It is observed in practice in the industrial sector,
 although younger persons typically work on family farms or in
 family-run shops.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no effective regulation of work hours, wages, or
 occupational safety standards, but normal work hours rarely
 exceed 40 hours per week. The Government's own wage rate and
 vacation allowances are comparable to those in the rest of the
 Eastern Caribbean; and common law allows employers to be sued
 for negligence.
