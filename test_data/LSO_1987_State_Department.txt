 LESOTHO
 On January 20, 1986 the regime of Prime Minister Leabua
 Jonathan, which had ruled Lesotho since 1966, was ousted by
 the Lesotho Paramilitary Force (LPF). The coup leaders
 established a Military Council, abolished the post of prime
 minister, and formally conferred all legislative and executive
 power on Moshoeshoe II, the previously powerless King of
 Lesotho. Since the 1986 coup, the Military Council, led by
 Major General J. M. Lekhanya, and the King have ruled by
 decree; however, an appointed Council of Ministers, which
 includes civilians, administers the day-to-day operations of
 government. During 1987 the new regime continued its ban on
 "political activity," giving no indication when Lesotho might
 revert to constitutional rule.
 Since its rise to power, the military Government has promoted
 a policy of national reconciliation. In 1987 it again called
 for the return of Basotho nationals who had exiled themselves
 for political or economic reasons. Ntsu Mokhehle, the aging
 exiled leader of the Basotho Congress Party, and the outlawed
 Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA) continued to reject the
 Government's general amnesty. The Government has placed
 special emphasis on pragmatic, cooperative relations with
 South Africa, attempting to balance geographic and economic
 realities with commitments to African regional cooperation.
 A landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa,
 Lesotho is almost entirely dependent on its neighbor for
 trade, finance, employment, and access to the outside world.
 About half of the male labor force is employed in South
 Africa's mines, and remittances from workers (more than $300
 million annually) are a critical factor in the economy,
 especially in financing imports.
 Human rights continue to be circumscribed under the military
 Government, but its goal of national reconciliation receives
 strong popular support. In this reconciliation effort, the
 Government did not bring legal actions against former members
 of the Jonathan Government and has welcomed back some 500
 exiles, mainly from South Africa and Botswana. (Jonathan died
 in 1987 of cancer in a South African hospital.) However, the
 Government reportedly discharged in 1987 a number of
 "politically incompatible individuals," both in the military
 and civil services, for suspected loyalty to the previous
 Government. While the climate of personal security improved
 in 1987, the 1986 deaths of two senior military officers who
 had opposed the coup, and two former ministers and their
 wives, have never been satisfactorily explained or
 investigated. Also, in 1987 there were several unexplained
 but clearly politically motivated "warning" attacks (no
 casualties) against suspected members of the African National
 Congress and the Pan African Congress still residing in
 Lesotho.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The brutal 1986 murders of former Ministers of Information and
 Foreign Affairs, Desmond Sixishe and Vincent Makhele and their
 wives, still have not been resolved, A government
 investigation has failed to identify the perpetrators of the
 
 
 147
 LESOTHO
 crime,'and there has been a lack of official disclosure about
 it. Similarly, there have been no further revelations
 concerning the deaths in March 1986 of two senior Royal
 Lesotho Defense Force officers who had opposed the coup and
 who subsequently died while in official custody on charges
 related to events during the 1986 coup.
 Amnesty International, in its 1987 Report, indicated that the
 two former ministers and their wives had been victims of
 politically motivated kil'lings, alleged to have been carried
 out by government agents, and that the deaths of the two
 senior military officers had been caused by ill-treatment.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no'known instances of disappearance of Basotho
 nationals. Although there were several confirmed
 disappearances of South African refugees in 1986, none-were
 reported during 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The advent of the new military Government resulted in stricter
 discipline over police forces, and accordingly there has been
 a decrease in the number of allegations of improper police and
 military conduct. However, isolated beatings and harsh
 interrogations of criminal suspects are still reported to
 occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 In August 1986, the nilitary Government restricted the
 movements of several former ministers, including former Prime
 Minister Jonathan, to their home areas, allegedly for plotting
 to overthrow the new Government. This "home area" detention
 was lifted in 1987. Jonathan was somewhat belatedly allowed
 to leave Lesotho for medical treatment in-April 1987; he died
 of natural'causes while undergoing treatment in South Africa
 shortly thereafter.
 Established procedures remain in effect under the new
 Government for normal civil and criminal cases, including the
 right of a detainee to an early determination of the legality
 of his detention. The 1981 Criminal Procedures and Evidence
 Act, as amended in 1984, prohibits bail in cases of armed
 robbery.
 In political cases, the Internal Security (General) Act of
 1984 applies. This Act provides for preventive detention
 without charge or trial for up to 42 days (the first 14 days
 on order of the police; the second 14 days on order of the
 police commissioner; and the final 14 days only on order of a
 government minister). Detainees may be held incommunicado for
 up to 14 days. During the second stage of the detention,.
 ministerially appointed "advisors" (all. government employees
 to date) report on the health of the detainee, investigate
 whether the detainee has been involved in subversive
 activities, and advise the Minister of Justice and Prisons on
 the need for continued detention. Detainees under the Act may
 make representations on their own treatment only through the
 advisors. The 1984 Internal Security Act also allows for
 detention of witnesses in security cases.
 
 
 148
 LESOTHO
 Observers report that there were only two cases of preventive
 detention under the Act during 1987. Both detainees sought
 redress through established judicial procedures and
 subsequently were released.
 As one of its first major actq, the military Government
 declared a general amnesty fot all Basotho in exile, which was
 specifically aimed at Ntsu Mokhehle, exiled leader of the
 Basotho Congress Party (BCP), and his followers. The
 Government continues to maintain that they are free to return
 without fear of retaliation for past activities, and in fact
 has privately urged Mokhehle to do so. However, Mokhehle
 rejected the Government's offer of amnesty, and continued to
 call for free elections.
 In spite of Mokhehle's attitude, the Government's amnesty
 program for political exiles continued to receive a fair
 response over the past year; returnees since the coup now
 number over 500, mostly from South Africa and Botswana, and
 they have generally been received without harassment or
 political retribution.
 There is no forced labor practiced in Lesotho.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Lesotho remains independent under the
 military Government. The courts have acted to limit
 infringements of law and procedure on numerous occasions in
 past years, as in the case of two 1987 detentions. Court
 decisions and rulings are respected by the authorities.
 Accused persons have the right to counsel. Under the system
 of Roman-Dutch law applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by
 jury. The judiciary consists of a Court of Appeal, the High
 Court, magistrate courts, and customary or traditional courts
 which exist largely in rural areas to administer customary
 tribal laws. Members of the High Court serve in an advisory
 capacity to military tribunals and provide guidance on
 questions of legal procedure and substance. This service is
 available to both prosecutors and the accused.
 The military regime did not prosecute Jonathan or other
 members of his regime for political or other crimes. A number
 of soldiers from the Lesotho Paramilitary Force who, in
 effect, mutinied against the force command structure prior to
 the January 1986 coup were reportedly put on trial. However,
 no judgment in their case has yet been made public. As noted
 in Section l.a., two of those persons died while in custody,
 possibly as a result of ill-treatment by government
 officials. Court martial proceedings were reportedly
 instituted against several other military personnel in
 November 1986, but the status of these proceedings had not
 been revealed at the end of 1987.
 The new Government continued programs in 1987 to increase
 familiarity with the law and its protection of individual
 rights through the educational system. The King's "practical
 law project," which is backed by the Ministers of Law and
 Education as well as by the judiciary, has begun to introduce
 a basic course on these subjects into the Lesotho high school
 curriculum.

 LESOTHO
 f., Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, these rights are respected in Lesotho, although
 under the Internal Security Act, the police have wide powers
 to stop and search persons and vehicles and to enter homes or
 other places for a similar purpose without a warrant. There
 were no reports of forced entry by authorities into private
 homes in Lesotho in 1987.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Hunlan Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of
 expression but subordinates this-freedom to the protection of
 national-security. -Following the January 1986 coup, a formal
 ban on politics was announced. This placed stringent
 restrictions on freedom of speech and political assembly. In
 particular, government Edict No. 4 prohibits individuals and
 groups from making political speeches and from publishing or
 distributing political party materials. In spite of this ban,
 however, leaders of Lesotho's five principal political parties
 made at least one joint public statement during 1987, calling
 for a-prompt end to the present Government and -an immediate
 return to civilian rule. There were no known reprisals, and
 the statement was broadcast on the government-run national
 radio.
 Moreover, opposition viewpoints are routinely expressed in two
 Sesotho-language weekly newspapers published by the Roman
 Catholic Church and the Lesotho Evangelical Church, the only
 privately owned newspapers in the country. The Government
 controls-the official media (one radio station and a weekly
 newspaper) but rarely uses those media to attack its critics.
 b. -Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The military Government's ban on "politics" has not been
 interpreted to require the dissolution of existing political
 parties, but it precludes political meetings and rallies.
 Nonpolitical organizations and professional groups continue to
 hold regular meetings. Numerous persons meet privately to
 discuss politics. The military Government made no attempt in
 1987 to inhibit such political discussion.
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. The 1964 Trade Union and
 Trade Disputes Law enumerates lengthy procedures which must be
 followed before a strike is called. The last general strike
 was in 1961. However, there were wildcat strikes in 1987
 against foreign companies linked to the Lesotho National
 Development Corporation over minimum wage rates. A compromise
 offer ended the work action, and the Government raised minimum
 wage rates in August 1987.  Historically trade unionism has
 played a rdlatively minor role in society, largely because of
 the small size of the manufacturing, retail, and service
 sectors.
 Since 1984 the Government has supported the formation of a
 single new umbrella trade union confederation. Subsequently,
 24 of Lesotho's 28 independent trade unions joined the Lesotho
 Congress of Free Trade Unions (LCFTU), which held its first
 convention in May 1985 and elected the existing leadership'to
 a 3-year term. The LCFTU also helped redraft Lesotho's badly
 
 
 150
 LESOTHO
 outdated labor laws, which reportedly were still under review
 in 1987 by the Lesotho Employers Federation.
 The military-Government has supported non-LCFTU unions in the
 formation of another federation, the Lesotho Federation of
 Trade Unions (LFTU). In 1987 the military Government
 designated the LFTU, the much smaller rival federation, to
 represent Lesotho at the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) annual conference in Geneva. The Secretary General of
 the LCFTU challenged the credentials of the LFTU delegation at
 the Geneva ILO meeting, and on his return to Lesotho the
 Government confiscated his passport. While LCFTU labor
 activities have not been curtailed, the Secretary General's
 passport has not been returned, and he is unable to travel
 outside of the country. The LCFTU is a member of the
 democratically oriented International Confederation of Free
 Trade Uaions as well as of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity.
 In 1987 Lesotho hosted meetings of the Southern African Labor
 Commission and a Southern African Development Coordination
 Conference ministerial meeting -of manpower officials.
 Although South African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)
 officials visit Lesotho regularly, two NUM officials, both
 Basotho nationals, were briefly detained in Lesotho during the
 South African miners' strike, allegedly for involvement in
 "political activities.* During the strike, the military
 Government urged Basotho workers not to engage in political
 activities in South Africa.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open
 religious practice is permitted. Christianity is the dominant
 faith of the majority of Basotho, with the principal
 denomination being Roman Catholic. There is a significant
 Protestant minority as well, which is composed of the Lesotho
 Evangelical Church (Presbyterian), the Anglican Church, and a
 number of other smaller denominations. Conversion is
 permitted, and there is no indication that there is any social
 or political benefit or stigma attached to belonging to any
 particular church.
 Most church groups support the military Government's call for
 national reconciliation -nd some groups have been outspoken in
 1986 and 1987 in asking the Government to redouble its efforts
 to reintegrate Ntsu Mokhehle and his exiled LLA into the
 country's political life.
 In 1987 church leaders disagreed with government policy which
 allowed South African mining companies to recruit Basotho
 replacements for striking miners during the South African
 mineworkers strike. Clerical leaders issued a joint public
 statement exhorting potential recruits not to join this
 strikebreaking effort. Several church officials reportedly
 were questioned and watched by the police but otherwise were
 not harassed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Citizens generally are allowed to move freely within the
 country and across national boundaries, although the Government
 does not hesitate to restrict passports in political cases,
 such as that of the Secretary General of the LCFTU.
 
 
 151
 LESOTHO
 The refugee flow into Lesotho from South Africa has continued
 at a slow but steady pace, currently numbering 10 to 20
 refugees per month. These persons have been accorded fair
 treatment, in line with Lesotho's-international obligations,
 and have been given expeditious transit to third countries for
 resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The military Government which assumed power in January 1986
 announced that it intends to remain in place until a process
 of national reconciliation has been completed. No time frame
 for this process has been announced, nor has any schedule been
 set foi return to civilian rule, elections, or constitutional
 revision. Thus, the Basotho people currently do not have the
 freedom to replace the existing regime, nor do they play an
 active role in the governing process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for investigation of human rights
 abuses since the present Government assumed power, and hence
 its attitudes toward outside investigations are unknown. In
 the past, the Jonathan Government permitted representatives of
 Amnesty International to visit Lesotho to investigate human
 rights conditions and to have access to some security
 detainees who complained of abusive treatment. In 1987
 Lesotho completed a term on the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Station.
 Most citizens of the Basotho nation speak a common language
 and share a common historical and cultural tradition.
 Nonindigenous citizens have generally married in the Basotho
 ethnic group, which tends to be inclusive and assimilative in
 character. Expatriate communities are small and not
 considered to be a major factoi in the country's political
 life. Asians (primarily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and white
 South Africans are active in the country's commercial sector
 and are less favored than Basotho nationals. The military
 Government has announced a policy aimed at "indigenization" of
 the country's retail commercial sector and has called upon
 expatriate owners to transfer their businesses to Basotho
 nationals. Apparently, this transfer would be done with
 compensation. Exiles from South Africa have from time to time
 encountered some discrimination, since they are often viewed
 as magnets for real or imagined South African political or
 armed intervention.
 In the areas of property and contracts, married women's rights
 are limited by law and custom. For example, a married woman
 cannot apply for a loan without her husband's written
 consent. Women in Lesotho traditionally have been the
 stabilizing force in the home and in the agricultural sector,
 given the absence of over 100,000 Basotho men who work in
 South Africa. More female than male children complete primary
 and secondary schools. Better use of women's talents and
 abilities will depend on their access to credit, changes in
 land tenure laws, and cultural practices. The Government has
 
 
 152
 LESOTHO
 not yet seriously addressed the issue of women's rights,
 although there are a number of self-help projects initiated by
 Basotho women themselves.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Roughly 90 percent of the labor force in Lesotho is employed
 in traditional agriculture. More than half of Lesotho's male
 labor force work in the Republic of South Africa, mainly in
 gold and coal mines. Lesotho's Employment Act of 1967 spells
 out basic workers' rights, including a 45-hour workweek, a
 weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 11 to 12 days' paid
 leave per year, and pay for public holidays. Employers are
 required to provide adequate light, ventilation, and sanitary
 facilities for employees and to install and maintain machinery
 to minimize the risk of injury. Children under 14 years of
 age are prohibited from employment in other than family
 businesses. Children under 16 are not allowed to work in
 excess of 8 hours a day, and employers are prohibited from
 employing any child in hazardous conditions. The Government
 sets minimum wages for various types of work. In practice,
 these regulations are generally followed only within the
 wage-scale economy. Enforcement mechanisms, however, are
 limited.
 In the nation's traditional society, life and working
 conditions for the country's young "herdboys" tend to be much
 more rigorous and demanding than conditions in the modern
 sector. Their quasi-pastoral life, however, is considered a
 prerequisite to eventual manhood and is a fundamental feature
 of Sotho life, tradition, and culture.
