 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a monarchy with a parliament and an
 independent judiciary. Ultimate authority, however, rests with the King, who may
 at his discretion terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the Parliament, and
 rule by decree. The present Parliament was created in 1993 through a two-stage
 process: 222 deputies were elected by direct universal suffrage, and an additional
 111 were selected by labor syndicates, professional organizations, and local authori-
 ties. The Cabinet continues to be composed largely of technocrats. Parliamentary
 elections are expected in 1997, following the September 13, 1996 referendum on the
 creation of a second legislative chamber. The referendum was approved by 99 per-
 cent of the vote. The Government reported that 82 percent of the electorate voted,
 although most observers believe this figure is exaggerated.
 The security apparatus includes several overlapping police and paramilitary orga-
 nizations. The border police, the national security police, and the judicial police are
 departments of the Ministry of Interior, while the Royal Gendarmerie reports di-
 rectly to the Palace. The security forces continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Morocco has a mixed economy based largely on agriculture, fishing, light industry
 phosphate mining, tourism, and remittances from citizens working abroad. Illegal
 cannabis production is also a significant economic activity. While a series of debili-
 tating droughts has challenged generally strong economic growth in recent years,
 good rainfall during the year was expected to contribute to an economic upswing.
 The Government's human rights record remained largely the same as the preced-
 ing year. Security forces occasionally abuse and torture detainees and prison condi-
 tions remain harsh. The Government's anti-contraband (assainissement) campaign
 resulted in numerous violations of citizen's human rights. Allegations of arbitrary
 
 
 1343
 
 arrest and physical abuse increased in the wake of this campaign, and the Govern-
 ment failed to investigate thoroughly allegations of abuse by security forces. The
 then-Minister for Human Rights resigned, citing excesses committed by security
 forces during this campaign. The King then appointed the Minister of Justice as
 Minister of Human Rights, although the Ministry of Justice is considered by some
 to be one of the primary obstacles to improved human rights.
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. The judiciary is sub-
 ject to corruption and Interior Ministry influence. The authorities at times ignore
 due process rights and infringe on citizens' privacy rights. The Government restricts
 freedom of speech and the press in certain areas, and limits the freedoms of assem-
 bly, association, religion, and movement. While the Government generally tolerates
 peaceful protests and sit-ins, it does not tolerate marches and demonstrations. On
 three occasions during the year, including on the eve of a 1-day general strike in
 June and during a female textile workers demonstration in March, several protest-
 ers were seriously beaten, and scores were arrested. Discrimination and domestic
 violence against women are common. Child labor is a problem, and the Government
 has not acted to end the plight of young girls who work in exploitive domestic ser-
 vitude. Unions are subject to government interference.
 A large number of the allegations of governmental human rights abuse involve
 the Minstry of Interior. The Ministry is responsible for The direction of most secu-
 rity forces; the conduct of elections, including cooperation with the United Nations
 in a referendum on the Western Sahara; the appointment and training of many
 local officials; the allocation of local and regional budgets; the oversight of university
 campuses; and the licensing of associations and political parties. Less formally, the
 Ministry exerts substantial pressure on the judicial system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra)judicial Killing.-Although no deaths of persons in po-
 lice custody could be conclusively attributed to security force brutality, there were
 several instances of death under suspicious circumstances that remain unresolved.
 In January Yahya Salbi was found dead in the Oujda gendarmerie detention center.
 Salhi had been arrested 2 days earlier for theft. Officials allege that Salhi commit-
 ted suicide.
 In February Babeha Lahssen died while in custody at the gendarmerie center in
 Khemisset. According to human rights activists, Lahssen was arrested following a
 fight with a tribal chief. Several days after the arrest, Lahssen's family was in-
 formed that he had committed suicide. The Lahssen family's request for an autopsy
 was reportedly denied by the Court of First Instance.
 In May 16-year-ld Abdelamid M'rabet died while in police custody in Tangier.
 Press reports state that M'raet was arrested durin g t with a local police offi-
 cer's son. In the        he arrest, M'raet was reportedly severely beaten about
 the head. He died shortly after arriving at the police station. Tangier officials de-
 tained the arresting officer and launched an investigation. The outcome of the inves-
 ti gation has not been made public.
 Hussein El Mernissi was arrested on July 11 and died the next day at Asfi police
 station, purportedly taking his own life. The Moroccan Organization for Human
 Rights (OMDH) has fied a court action regarding this case, demanding that a sec-
 ond autopsy be  rformed.
 In May Jalal Mohamed died in prison. Human rights activists attribute his death
 to official negligence (see Section 1.c.).
 Human rights organizations continue to complain that security forces too often act
 with impunity; deaths in custody and other instances of potential abuse are not
 thoroughly investigated. None of the cases outstanding from 1995 have been pub-
 licly resolved, These include the deaths in custody of Hama Daghdagh and
 Mustapha Benderweesh. However, in October a court acquitted two police officers
 accused of the 1993 torture death of Mustapha Hamzaui and earlier cases. Since
 October local media reported four other cases of persons who died while in police
 custody: Mohamed Fedaoui; Omar Bouhdoun; Said Hammouch; and Rachid Rami.
 Detainees claimed that several prisoners died during the year due to harsh prison
 conditions and inadequate medical care (see 1.c.).        d        r
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new cases of disappearance during the year.
 This contrasts with 1995 when there were reports of over 20. However, the practice
 of the forced disappearance of individuals who opposed the Government and its poli-
 cies dates back several decades. Many of those who disappeared were members of
 the military who were implicated in attempts to overthrow the Government in 1971
 and 1972. Others were Sabrawis or Moroccans who challenged the Government's
 
 
 1344
 
 claim to the Western Sahara or other government policies. Many of those who dis-
 appeared were held in secret detention camps. To this day, hundreds of Saharan
 and Moroccan families do not have any information about their missing relatives,
 many of whom have been missin over0 years.
 The Government continues to deny that it has any knowledge of the whereabouts
 of those still missing. In recent years it has quietly released several hundred per-
 sons who had disappeared, including about 300 in June 1991, but no explanation
 for their incarceration has ever been provided. Local human rights monitors have
 concluded that many others died while at the notorious Tazmamart Prison, which
 has since been closed. The Government has acknowledged 34 of these deaths and
 has provided death certificates to the families of all but 1 of the 34 who died.
 OMDH and other human rights organizations continued to pursue the issue of un-
 resolved disappearances. OMDH reports that its efforts to meet with the Minister
 of Justice and Human Rights to discuss this issue have been unsuccessful.
 There were no developments in the disappearance of Abdullah Sherrouq, a stu-
 dent, who was reprtedy detained by security services on June 22, 1981. After 15
 years, his family has still been unable to learn anything of his whereabouts or his
 fate, despite appeals by Amnesty International.
 A group representing Tasmamart prison survivors and the families of.persons who
 disappeared continues to call for an accounting of unresolved cases, compensation
 to families of those who disappeared, proper burial of victims' remains, and prosecu-
 tion of responsible officials. The Government has not responded to their demands.
 The Government continued to pay a small monthiy stipend to the 28 former pris-
 oners who survived 18 to 20 years in solitary confinement at Tazmamaart prison-
 without health care or sanitary facilities. The 28 are former military men who had
 been arrested in connection with the failed coup attempts in 1971 and 1972. After
 their release, the Government prohibited them from spaking out publicly about
 their detention. In exchange, the Government gave the 8 assurances that it would
 help them find jobs and reintegrate them into society.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Morocco ratified the U.N. Convention against Torture in 1993. The Government
 claims that the use of torture has been discontinued, but newspapers and other
 sources indicate that security forces still abuse and torture detainees. The fact that
 detainees are not allowed to have contact with family or lawyers during the first
 48 hours of incarceration (see Section 1.d.) increases the likelihood of torture and
 abuse.
 According to local human rights advocates, one of the problems in documenting
 torture and abuse is that autopsies are not routine. They are only carried out at
 the request of the state prosecutor and at the order of a judge. The lack of autopsies
 indicates that follow-up investigations into deaths in custody are inadequate.
 In June OMDH issued a report charging that torture is still prevalent. OMDH
 officials attribute the phenomenon to officials' attempts to elicit information from
 detainees in the anticontraband and antinarcotics campaigns. In addition, the report
 charges that allegations of abuse are frequently not investigated, and that officials
 often act with impunity.
 In January the press and human rights organizations reported eyewitness ac-
 counts that those arrested during the Government's anticontraband campaign were
 subjected to physical abuse and torture during interrogation. There were also re-
 orts of due process violations and irregularities in the course of their trials (see
 ction 1.e.). Government officials have denied that any abuses occurred.
 In April defendants arrested during a government antinarcotics crackdown
 charged that they had been subjected to abuse while in police custody. They also
 alleged that their signed confessions had been obtained through police pressure and
 coercion.
 Although prison conditions remain harsh, they have reportedly improved in recent
 years, due in part to reforms undertaken at the suggestion of the Royal Consultative
 Council of Human Rights. Nonetheless, credible reports indicate that harsh treat-
 ment and conditions continue, with stat security prisoners more likely to be victim-
 ized. On October 24, detainees at Kenitra central prison sent an open letter counter-
 ing the Government's assertions that the prisons are being reformed and detailing
 the poor conditions at Kenitra. The prisoners, mostly political and Islamist detain-
 ees, alleged that the prison lacks the most basic need, including ventilation and
 medical care. The letter states that seven prisoners died this year and alleged medi-
 cal neglect. Causes of death ranged from cancer and tuberculosis to injuries sus-
 tained through physical assault. In May Jalaal Mohamed, a prisoner at El-Jadida
 Civil Prison, died while unloading a supply truck. Mohamed reportedly suffered
 from heart and other health problems. Human rights activists charge that his death
 was due to the negligence of prison officials.
 
 
 1345
 
 The Government does not generally permit prison visits by human rights mon-
 itors. Notable exceptions occurred in February and March 1995, when human rights
 monitors, along with several journalists and an investigating commission, visited
 prisons in Tangiers, Mohammedia, El-Jadida, Casablanca, and Khenifra following a
 prison riot in Khenifra.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal provisions for due process have
 been revised extensively in recent years, although reports indicate that the
 authorties sometimes ignored them (see Section 1.c.). Although police usually make
 arrests in public, they do not always identify themselves and do not always obtain
 warrants. Incommunicado (garde-a-vue) detention is limited to 48 hours, with one
 24-hour extension allowed at the prosecutor's discretion. In state security cases, the
 garde-a-vue period is 96 hours; this may also be extended by the prosecutor. It is
 during this initial period, when defendants are denied access to counsel, that the
 accused is interrogated and abuse is most likely to occur. Some members of the se-
 curity forces, long accustomed to indefinite precharge access to detainees, continue
 to resist the new rules.
 Lawyers are not always informed of the date of arrest, and thus are unable to
 monitor compliance with the garde-a-vue detention limits. While the law provides
 for a limited system of bail, it is rarely used. Defendants are, however, sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. The law does not provide for habeas corpus or
 its equivalent. Under a separate code of military justice, military authorities may
 detain members of the military without warrants or public trial.
 Although the accused are generally brought to trial within2 months, prosecutors
 may order up to five 2-month extensions of pretrial detention. Thus, an accused per-
 son can be kept in pretrial detention for up to 1 year.
 There are no known instances of enforced exile, although a number of dissidents
 live abroad in self-imposed exile. Their number has been steadily diminishing, how-
 ever, as many returned to Morocco following a broad-based amnesty decree issued
 by the Government in 1994.
 In May Mamoun Balghiti Alaoui returned to Morocco after30 years of exile in
 Syria. Alaoui was a dissident in the 1960's who was forced to flee the country. He
 was later tried and sentenced to death in absentia. He was included in the global
 roy  pardon issued by the King in 1994.
 any human rights groups consider Abraham Serfaty to be a Moroccan exile. A
 member of the (now defunct) Communist Party and a supporter of Saharan inde-
 pendence, Serfaty was released in 1991 after 17 years in prison. Upon his release,
 the Government declared that Serfaty was a Brazilian rather than a Moroccan citi-
 zen because his father was a naturalized Moroccan citizen originally from Brazil.
 Based on this Serfaty was expelled from Morocco. This decision has been widely
 criticized by human rights groups. In July Serfaty's wife was stopped at the Casa-
 blanca airport and prohibited from entering the country.
 e. Deniai of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but all courts are subject to extrajudicial pressures, including bribery and gov-
 ernment influence.
 There are three levels in the court system, courts of first instance, the appeals
 Court, and the Supreme Court. While in theory there is a single court system under
 the Ministry of Justice, two other courts also operate: the Special Court of Justice
 that handles cases of civil servants implicated in corruption and the Military Tribu-
 nal for cases involving military personnel and on certain occasions matters pertain-
 ing to state security, although state security also falls within the jurisdiction of reg-
 ular court system.
 Although there is a single court system for most nonmilitary matters, family is-
 sues such as marriage, divorce, child support and custody, and inheritance are adju-
 dicated by judges trained in Islamic law, or Shari'a. Judges considering criminal
 cases or cases In non-family areas of civil law are generally trained in the French
 legal tradition. All judges trained in recent years are graduates of the National In-
 stitute for Judicial Studies, where they undergo 2 years of study heavily focused on
 human rights and the rule of law. It is not necessary to be a lawyer to become a
 judge and the ma4ority of judges are not lawyers.
 In general detainees are arraigned before a court of first instance. If the infraction
 is minor and not contested, the judge may order the defendant released or impose
 a light sentence. If an investigation is required, the judge may release defendants
 on their own recognizance. Cases are often adjudicated on the basis of confessions,
 some of which are obtained under duress, according to reliable sources.
 All courts are subject to extrajudicial pressures. Salaries for both judges and their
 staffs are extremely modest; as a result, petty bribery has become a routine cost of
 court business. In many courts, especially in minor criminal cases, defendants or
 
 
 1346
 their families pay bribes to court officers and judges to secure a favorable disposi-
 tion.
 A more subtle corruption derives from the judiciary's relationship with the Min-
 istry of Interior. Judges work closely with the Ministry's network of local officials,
 or caids, who serve as members of the judicial police and often assume personal re-
 sponsibility for the questioning of criminal detainees. They also frequently prepare
 the written summary of an arrest and subsequent interrogation. The summary is
 admissible in court and may be the only evidence introduced at trial, effectively ren-
 dering it an instruction passed from the caid's office to the court. Credible sources
 report that judges who hope for higher salaries and career advancement follow the
 cd's gudance closely.
 The law does not distinguish political and security cases from common criminal
 cases. In serious state security cases, communications between the Ministry of Inte-
 rior and the court are more direct. At the Government's discretion, such cases may
 be brought before a specially constituted military tribunal which is subservient to
 other branches of the Government, notably the military and the Ministry of Interior.
 Aside from external pressures, the court system is also subject to resource con-
 straints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses often
 receive only cursory hearings, with judges relying on police reports to render deci-
 sions. Although the Government provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes (i.e., when the offense carries a maximum sentence of over 5 years), ap-
 pointed attorneys often provide inadequate representation.
 In January the OMDH charged that defendants arrested in the anticontraband
 crackdown were denied access to attorneys during interrogation and that defendants
 were not allowed to submit evidence (some of which investigators had earlier re-
 quested they present) to counter charges against them (see Section 1.c.). Later, the
 attorneys for nine of the defendants walked out of court in protest after charging
 that they had not been given enough time to study the case against their clients.
 One of the more extreme examples involved the trial of David and Simon Chetrit,
 father and son importers, who were pronounced guilty at 3:30 AM after the defense
 team had spent more than 17 hours in the courtroom without a rest or food break,
 and were repeatedly denied an opportunity to present a defense. The Chetrits were
 each sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment and received one of the largest fines of any
 of those convicted during the campaign on charges of importing contraband and
 bribing customs officials. Among those criticizing the way      in  which  the
 anticontraband campaign was conducted was Human Rights Minister Mohamed
 Ziane. Ziane's outspoken disapproval of the campaign led to his resignation from the
 Ministry in January, and the human rights portfolio was assumed by the Minister
 of Justice. However, some observers consider the Ministry of Justice to be a major
 obstacle to an improved human rights record. Although their missions are not com-
 pletely incompatible, combining the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Human
 Rights portfolios does not advance the stated objective of the Government and the
 King to protect and promote human rights.
 The Moroccan Organization of Human Rights (OMDH) estimates that there are
 some 60 political prisoners, of which 50 are Islamists and the remainder are leftists.
 Among the 50 alleged Islamists are 16 members of the "Group of 26." Three of this
 group were convicted of arms smuggling in 1986, but the others were apparently
 arrested for Islamist activities. International human rights groups estimate of the
 number of persons in prison for advocating independence for the Western Sahara
 vary from none to 700.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant. The law stipulates that a search warrant
 may be issued by a prosecutor on good cause. Nonetheless, during the Government's
 recent anticontraband campaign several businesses and places of-residence were en-
 tered without the reauisite search warrant.
 Government security services monitor certain persons and organizations, both for-
 eign and Moroccan and government informers monitor activities on university cam-
 puses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, the Government seriously restricts press freedom in certain areas.
 The Government owns the official press ageng, Maghreb Arab Press, and the Ar-
 abic daily Al-Anbaa. A 1958 decree grants the Government the authorit to register
 and license domestic newspapers and journals. Authorities can use the licensing
 process to prevent the publication of materials that they believe cross the threshold
 of tolerable dissent. Offending publications may be declared a danger to state secu-
 
 
 1347
 rity, seized, and the publisher's license suspended and equipment destroyed. The
 Ministiy of Interior can control foreign public"ations by ollecting "banned" publica-
 tions aer they have been distributed. Ia general, however, the Government does
 not employ extreme measures since the media regularly engage in self-censorship
 to avoid the Government's attention and possible sanctions.
 The Press Code empowers the Minister of Interior to confiscate publications that
 are judged offensive by the Government. Under the Code the Prime Minister may
 order the indefinite suspension of a publication. On November 19 the Government
 formally banned the Arabic-language weekly A1-Usbu Al-Safi Wal Siyassi, and de-
 clared all distribution of this weely illegal. The police notice banning the paper of-
 fered no justification, but credible sources confirm that the Minister of Interior and
 the Prime Minister were both angered by a series of articles on the "business activi-
 ties" of the Moroccan elite, including their sons. The publisher was warned several
 weeks earlier to "lay off people who work closely with the King." The Moroccan
 Press Syndicate and a Moroccan human rights organization are filing a court case
 in an effort to rescind the Government's decision.
 The Press Code empowers the Government to censor newspapers directly by or-
 dering them not to report on specific items or events. In most instances, government
 control of the media generally is exercised through directives and "guidance" from
 the Ministry of the Interior. Nonetheless, the Government generally tolerates satiri-
 cal and often stinging editorials in the opposition parties' dailies. However, both law
 and tradition prohibit criticism on three topics: the monarchy, Morocco's claim to the
 Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam.
 There were some notable instances of censorship during the year. The Govern-
 ment continues its November 1995 ban on Jeune Arique, which had published an
 article describing the King's health and its impact on the political scene. Since Octo-
 ber Jeune Afrique has been distributed, but has--perhaps not coincidentally-re-
 cently refrained from publishing any negative stories about the royal family.
 In January the OADP daily, Anousi, was seized twice by local authorities in Casa-
 blanca. No reason was given for the seizure. Also in January, the weekly magazine
 Maroc Hebdo was sued or defamation at the request of the Prime Minister. Maroc-
 Hebdo had reprinted selections from  a report by the European Observatoire
 Geopolitique Des Drogues implicating high-level Moroccan officials in drug traffick-
 In LFebruary comedian Ahmed Snoussi (also known as Bziz) was prohibited from
 performing in Casablanca. Bziz, Morocco's best-known political satirist, has been
 banned from television appearances for the past 5 years. In April the government-
 owned television station dismissed its editor-in-chief after she participated in a sem-
 inar on the role ofjournalism in the democratic process and the protection of human
 rights. The dismissal was severely criticized by press and human rights groups.
 The Government owns the only television station whose broadcasts can be re-
 ceived nationwide without decoder or satellite dish antennas. The Government pur-
 chased a majority share in 2M, the country's sole private station, which can be re-
 ceived in most urban areas with the rental of an inexpensive decoder. The ostensible
 reason for the Government's action was to save 2M from bankruptcy; the Govern-
 ment now owns 68 percent of 2M stock and the Minister of Information by virtue
 of hsi position has become the chairman of the board. Dish antennas are available
 on the market and permit free access to a variety of foreign broadcasts. Residents
 of the north can receive Spanish broadcasts with standard antennas. The Govern-
 ment does not impede the reception of foreign broadcasts.
 The universities enjoy relative academic freedom in most areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and association, the law also permits the Government
 to suppress even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings. Most conferences
 and demonstrations require the prior authorization ofthe Ministry of Interior, os-
 tensibly for security reasons.
 In January members of the Association of Unemployed University Graduates, an
 unofficial organization not sanctioned by the Government, began a sit-in in front of
 the Ministry of Education to protest high unemployment and government inaction.
 There was little official reaction until March, when security forces dispersed the
 group, allegedly injuring14 persons.
 The unemployed gaduates resumed their sit-in in May. For several weeks, police
 barricaded the building where the youths were assembled,preventing them from
 leaving as a group to demonstrate in the streets. Occasionally the police and the
 unemployed graduates clashed, most notably on May 24 when the protesters tried
 to march out of the building that they were occupying. Police blocked their exit and
 injured some6O demonstrators. On June 4, on the eve of a nationwide general strike,
 police beat and injured numerous demonstrators, including humorist Bziz, who had
 
 
 1348
 gone to the sit-in to express his support for the unemployed graduates. The sit-in
 continued until late June, when the graduates voluntarily returned to their homes.
 The right to form organizations is limited. Under a1958 decree, persons wishing
 to create an organization must obtain the approval of the Ministry of Interior before
 holding meetings. In practice the Ministry uses this requirement to prevent persons
 suspected of advocating causes opposed by the Government from forming legal orga-
 nizations. Islamist and leftist groups have the greatest difficulty in obtaining official
 approval, although there are over 20 active Islamist groups. The Government has
 prohibited membership in two, Justice and Charity and Jama'a Islamia, due to their
 perceived antimonarchy rhetoric. Political parties must also be approved by the Min-
 istry of Interior, which uses this power to control participation m the political proc-
 ess.
 On January 9, a group of university professors, lawyers, and journalists formed
 an association, called Transparency Maroc, dedicated to fighting corruption at all
 levels. This organization is also not sanctioned by the Government. Transparency
 is operating, but always in concert with other organizations that are recognized by
 the Government.
 c. Freedom of Relition.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of wor-
 ship, only Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are tolerated in practice.
 Islam is the official religion. Ninety-nine percent of Moroccans are Sunni Muslims,
 and the King bears the title Commander of the Faithful. The Jewish community of
 approximately 6,000 is allowed to practice its faith, as is the somewhat larger for-
 eign Christian community. The Baha'i community of 150 to 200 people has been for-
 biaden to meet or hold communal activities since 1983.
 Islamic law and tradition calls for strict punishment of any Muslim who converts
 to another faith. Any attempt to induce a Muslim to convert is similarly illegal. For-
 eign missionaries either limit their proselytizing to non-Muslims or conduct their
 work quietly.
 The Ministry of Islamic Affairs monitors Friday mosque sermons and the Koranic
 schools to ensure the teaching of approved doctrine. The authorities sometimes sup-
 press the activities of Islamists, but generally tolerate activities limited to the prop-
 agation of Islam, education, and charity. Security forces commonly close mosques to
 the public shortly after Friday services to prevent use of the premises for unauthor-
 ized political activity.
 d. Freedom of Moeient Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although the Constitution provides for redom of movement, inprac-
 tic security forces set up checkpoints throughout the country and stop traffic at
 will. In some regions the checkpoints have been maintained in the same places for
 years, creating what some characterize as internal frontiers. Reports persist that po-
 lice use these checkpoints to demand monetary payments. In the Moroccan-adminis-
 tered portion of the Western Sahara, movement is restricted in areas regarded as
 militarily sensitive.
 The Ministry of Interior restricts freedom to travel outside Morocco in certain cir-
 cumstances. OMDH, a human rights group, has compiled a list of individuals who
 have reportedly been denied passports. In addition, all civil servants must obtain
 written permission from their mimsatries to leave te country.
 In June Maria Oulkir, who had spent 14 years under house arrest, was able to
 leave Morocco and emigrate to France. Oufkir is the daughter of Mohamed Oufkir,
 a general and Interior Miister during the 1960's who was implicated in the 1971
 coup attempt against King Hassan. Oulkir died under mysterious circumstances in
 1972. His family spent the following 14 years under house arrest. Although they
 were nominally released in 1986, the ufkir family remained barred from traveling
 outside Morocco until Maria Oufkir's move to France. While her flight has been de-
 scribed as an escape, sources report that the Oulkirs were issued passports shortly
 before her departure, and it is acknowledged that she departed with at least the
 tacit consent of the Government.
 Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship, but the King retains the power-
 rarely used-to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold more than one citi-
 zenship and travel on passports from two or more countries. While in Morocco, they
 are regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government has sometimes re-
 fused to recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals
 or even to be informed of their arrest and imprisonment. Dual nationals sometimes
 complain of harassment by immigration inspectors.
 The Government welcomes voluntary repatriation of Jews who have emigrated.
 Moroccan Jewish emigres, including those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Mo-
 rocco. The Government also encourages the return of Sahrawis who have departed
 Morocco due to the confict in the Western Sahara -provided they recognize the
 Government's claim to the region. The Government does not permit Saharan nation-
 
 
 1349
 
 alists who have been released from prison to live in the disputed territory. The Gov-
 ernment cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status. While Morocco
 has from time to time provided political asylum to individuals, the issue of first asy-
 lum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Constitutional provisions notwithstanding, in practice citizens do not have the
 right to change their national government by democratic means. The King, as Head
 of State, appoints the Prime Minister, who is the titular head of government. The
 Parliament has the theoretical authority to effect change in the system of govern-
 ment, but has never exercised it. Moreover, the Constitution may not be changed
 without the King's approval. The Ministry of Interior appoints the provincial gov-
 ernors and local caids. Municipal councils are elected.
 Constitutional changes in 1992 authorized the Prime Minister to nominate all
 oVernment ministers, but the King has the power to replace any minister at will.
 ificant surrender of power from the Crown to the Prime Minister's office
 was further diluted when the King transferred to the Secretaries General, who serve
 at the King's pleasure, many of the powers previously vested in the ministers.
 Morocco has a unicameral legislature, two-thirds directly elected, and another
 third indirectly selected by various labor and professional organizations. Eleven par-
 ties have members in Parliament. The opposition partieshave consistently urged
 that all members of Parliament be directly elected by the people. Instead, the King
 propsed creating a bicameral legislature, whereby all members of the lower chain-
 er would be directly elected by the people and all members of the second chamber
 indirectly selected. On September 13, a referendum was held in which voters ap-
 proved a constitutional amendment creating this bicameral parliament. The referen-
 dum was approved by 99 percent of the vote. The Government reported that 82 per-
 cent of the electorate voted, although most observers believe this figure is exagger-
 ated. There were no restrictions on the electorate and there were no serious accusa-
 tions of fraud. Allegations of fraud during the 1993 electPons are still pending before
 the Supreme Court.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are no female
 ministers, and there are oniy two women among the 333 members of Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Vioaions of Human Rights
 Ther are mthree officially recognized nongovernmental human rights groups: The
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization, the Moroccan League for the Defense of
 Human Rights (LDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association (AMDH). A
 fourth group, the Committee for the Defense of Humanights (CDDH), was formed
 in 1992 by fotr Ap  members.
 The Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), an advisory body to
 the King, exists in sometimes uneasy coordination with the Ministry of Human
 Rights, which was established by Parliament. While their common mission provoked
 an adversarial relationship in the past, a clearer division of roles has emerged, with
 the CCDH issuing advice on matters such as prison reform, and the Ministry of
 Human Rights exercisin a rincipally executive role.
 Amnesty International (A) has local chapters in Rabat, Casablanca, and Marra-
 kech. These chapters participate in Ar international letter campaigns outside Mo-
 rocco.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution states that all citizens are equal, non-Muslims and
 women face discrimination in the law and traditional practice.
 Women.-The law and social practic concrning violene a ainst women reflects
 the importance society places on the honor of the family. The Criminal Code in-
 cludes severe punishment for men convicted of rape or violating a woman or a girl.
 The defendants in such cases bear the burden of proving their c nocence. However,
 sexual assaults often go unreported because of the stigma attached to the loss of
 virginity. A rapist may be offered the opportunity to marry his victim in order to
 preserve the honor of the victim's family. The law is more lenient toward men with
 respect to crimes committed against their wives; for example, a light sentence or
 reprimand may be accorded a man who has murdered his wife after catching her
 in the act of adultery.
 
 
 1350
 Spousal violence is common. Although a battered wife has the right to complain
 to the police, as a practical matter she would do so only if prepared to bring crimi-
 nal charges.
 Women suffer various forms of legal and cultural discrimination. The civil law
 status of women is governed by the Moudouwana, or Code of Personal Status, which
 is based on Islamiclaw. Although the Moudouwana was reformed in 1993, women's
 groups still complain of unequal treatment, particularly under the laws governing
 marriage and divorce.
 In order to marry, a woman is generally required to obtain the permission of her
 "tuteur" or legal guardian, usually her father. Except in unusual circumstances,
 only if her father is deceased may she act as her own "tuteur."
 It is far easier for a man to divorce his wife than for a women to divorce her hus-
 band. Rather than asking for a divorce, a man may simply repudiate his wife.
 Under the 1993 reforms to the Moudouwana, a woman's presence in court is re-
 quired in order for her husband to divorce her, although women's groups report that
 this law is frequently ignored. The divorce can be finalized even over the woman's
 objections, although in such cases the court grants her unspecified allowance rights.
 A woman seeking a divorce has several alternatives. She may offer her husband
 money to agree to a divorce (known as a Khol'a divorce). The husband must agree
 to the divorce and is allowed to specify the amount that he will be paid-without
 limit. According to women's groups, many men pressure their wives to pursue this
 kind of divorce. A woman may also file for a judicial divorce if her husband chooses
 to take a second wife, if she has been abandoned by her husband, or if she is a vic-
 tim of physical abuse. However, divorce procedures in these cases are lengthy and
 complicated. For example, while physical abuse is a legal ground for divorce, the
 court will only grant it if the woman can provide two witnesses to the abuse. Even
 medical certificates are not sufficient. If the court finds against the woman, she is
 returned to her husband's home. Consequently, few women report abuse to the au-
 thorities.
 Under the Criminal Code, women are generally accorded the same treatment as
 men, but this is not the case for family and estate law, which is based on the
 Malikite school of Islamic law. Under this law, women inherit only half as much
 as male heirs. Moreover, even where the law guarantees equal status, cultural
 norms often prevent a woman from exercising those rights. When a women inherits
 property, for example, male relatives may pressure her to relinquish her interest.
 While many well-educated women pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and
 government service, few make it to the top echelons of their professions. Women
 comprise approximately35 percent of the work force, with the majority in the indus-
 trial- service, and teaching sectors. The illiteracy rate for women is 78 percent, com-
 pared with 51 percent for men. Women in rural areas suffer most from inequality.
 ural women perform most hard physical labor, and the literacy rate in the country-
 side is significantly lower for women than for men. Girls are much less likely to be
 sent to school than are boys. Women who do earn secondary school diplomas, how-
 ever, have equal access to university education.
 Children.-The Government has taken little action to end child labor (see Section
 6.d.). Young girls in particular are exploited as domestic servants. Some orphanages
 are knowing accmp ices to the practice of adoptive servitude, in which families
 adopt young girls who perform the duties of domestic servants in their new homes.
 Credible reports of physical abuse are widespread. The practice is often rationalized
 as a better alternative to keeping the girls in orphanages. This practice is socially
 accepted, attracts little criticism and is unregulated by the Government.
 Another problem facing orphans of both sexes is lack of civil status. Normally,
 men are registered at local government offices; their wives and unmarried children
 are included in this registration, which confers civil status. Civil status is necessary
 to obtain a birth certificate, passport, or marriage license. If a father does not reg-
 ister his child, the child is without civil status and the benefits of citizenship. It is
 possible for an individual to self-register, but the process is long and cumbersome.
 People With Disabilities.-A high incidence of disabling disease, espcialy polio
 has produced a large population of disabled persons. While the Ministry of Scial
 Affairs contends that the Government endeavors to integrate the disabled into soci-
 ety, in practie this is left largely to private charities. However, even charitable spe-
 cial education programs are priced beyond the reach of most families. Typically, dis-
 abled persons survive by begging. The Government ontinued a pilot training pro-
 gram  orthe bind sponsored in part by a member of the royal family. There are
 no laws mandating physical changes to buildings to facilitate access by the disabled.
 NationalRacia       nic    norities.-The Constitution affirms, and the Govern-
 ment respects, the legal equality of all citizens. The official language is Arabic. Both
 French and Arabic are used in the news media and educational institution. Science
 
 
 1351
 and technical courses are taught in French, thereby eliminating the large,
 monolingual Arabic-speaking population from these programs. Educational reforms
 in the past decade have stressed the use of Arabic in secondary schools. Failure to
 similarly transform the university system has effectively disqualified many students
 from higher education in lucrative fields. This is especialy true among the poor, for
 whom French training is not always affordable.
 Some 60 percent of the population claim Berber heritage. Berber cultural groups
 contend that Berber traditions and the three remaining Berber languages are rap-
 idly being lost. Their repeated requests to the King to permit the teaching of Berber
 languages in the schools led to a royal decree authorizing the necessary curriculum
 changes, although no changes have yet occurred.
 In June a number of Berber associations issued a communique petitioning the
 Government to recognize their language, Amzaghi, as an official language and to ac-
 knowledge the Amzaghi culture as a part of Moroccan society. The Government thus
 far has made no response to the petition.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although workers are free to establish and join trade
 unions, the unions themselves are not completely free from government interference.
 Perhaps half a million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized in 17 trade
 union federations. Three federations dominate the labor scene: the Union Marocain
 de Travail (UMT), the Confederation Democratique de Travail (CDT), and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political affiliation,
 but the CDT is affiliated with the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and the UGTM
 to the Istiqlal Party.
 In practice the Ministry of Interior is believed to have informants within the
 unions who monitor union activities and the election of officers. Sometimes union
 officers are subject to government pressure. Union leadership does not always up-
 hold the rights of members to select their own leaders. There has been no case of
 the rank and file voting out its current leadership and replacing it with another.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so. Work stoppages are normally intended
 to advertise grievances and last 48 to72 hours or less. Secondary school teachers
 and university professors held several strikes throughout the year and there were
 a number of limited duration strikes in the phosphate, banking, and health care sec-
 tors, and at the port of Casablanca.
 On June 5, the CDT and UGTM labor federations joined forces to stage a 24-hour
 general strike throughout Morocco to protest perceived government indifference to
 the economic and social situation of the workers. The strike was relatively quiet and
 violence-free except in a neighborhood of the northern city of Tangier, where there
 was sporadic violence involving teenagers and young adults, rather than union ac-
 tivists. The UMT did not participate in the strike and, overall, an estimated 50 to
 60 percent of shops and factories nationwide closed in compliance with the call to
 strike.
 UMT unionists at a yeast production company in Casablanca began a strike in
 February, when management fired a union representative. The strike continues as
 the plant owner received permission to import yeast to make up for shortages in
 the market.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties with inter-
 national trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is implied in the constitutional provisions on the right to strike
 and the right to join organizations. Trade union federations compete among them-
 selves to organize workers. Any group of eight workers may organize a union and
 a worker may change union affiliation easily. A work site may contain several inde-
 pendent locals or locals affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In general the Government ensures the observance of labor laws in larger compa-
 nies and in the public sector. In the informal economy, and in the textile and handi-
 crafts industries, both the Government and management routinely ignore labor laws
 and regulations. As a practical matter, unions have no judicial recourse to oblige
 the Government to enforce labor laws and regulations.
 The laws governing collective bargaining are inadequate. Collective bargaining
 has been a long-standing tradition in some parts of the economy such as the indus-
 trial sector, especially heavy industry, but the practice has not spread to other sec-
 tors such as the service and informal sectors. The wages and conditions of employ-
 ment of unionized workers are generally set in discussions between employer and
 worker representatives. However, wages for the vast majority of workers are unilat-
 erally set by employers.
 
 
 1352
 
 Employers wishing to dismiss workers are required by law to notify the provincial
 governor through the labor inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to re-
 place dismissed workers, a government labor inspector provides replacements and
 mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker dismissed
 for committing a serious infraction of work rules is entitled by law to a court hear-
 ing.
 There is no law specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination. Employers com-
 monly dismiss workers for union activities regarded as threatening to employer in-
 terests. The courts have the authority to reinstate such workers, but are unable to
 ensure that employers pay damages and back pay.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor dis-
 putes, but they are few in number and do not have the resources to investigate all
 cases. Unions have increasingly resorted to litigation to resolve labor disputes.
 The labor law applies equally to the small Tang*er export zone. The proportion
 of unionized workers in the export zone is about the same as in the rest of the econ-
 omy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention 29, which was
 adopted by royal decree. When authorities become aware of instances of forced
 labor, courts enforce the decree. However, in practice, the Government lacks the re-
 sources to inspect all places of work to ensure that forced labor is not being used.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Abuse of the child labor laws is
 common. The law prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of any child under 12
 years of age. Education is compulsory for children between the ages of 7 and 13
 years. Special regulations cover the employment of children between the ages of 12
 and 16 years. In practice, children are often apprenticed before age 12, particularly
 in the handicraft industry. The use of minors is common in the rug-making industry
 and also exists to some extent in the textile and leather goods industries. Children
 are also employed informally as domestics and usually receive little or no wages.
 Safety and health conditions as well as wages in enterprises employing children are
 often substandard.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor regulations,
 which are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector of the econ-
 omy. However, the inspectors are not authorized to monitor the conditions of domes-
 tic servants.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The June 5 general strike led to negotiations
 among the Government, the manufacturers' association, and the labor confed-
 erations over increasing the minimum wage and improving health benefits, social
 benefits, and housing. In August all three parties agreed to a 10 percent increase
 in the minimum wage retroactive to July 1, raising it to approximately $193 (1,661
 dirhams) per month in the industrialized sector and to approximately $9.41 (80.96
 dirhams) per day for agricultural workers. Neither provides a decent standard of liv-
 ing for a worker and family-even with government subsidies for food, diesel fuel,
 and public transportation. In many cases, several family members combine their in-
 come to support the family. Most workers in the industrial sector earn more than
 the minimum wage. They are generally paid between 13 and 16 months salary, in-
 cluding bonuses, each year.
 The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and handicraft sec-
 tors, and even the Government pays less than the minimum wage to workers at the
 lowest civil service grades. To increase employment opportunities for recent grad-
 uates, the Government allows firms to hire them for a limited period at less than
 the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a 48-hour maximum workweek with no more than 10 hours
 in any single day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and
 minimum conditions for health and safety, including a prohibition on night work for
 women and minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are not universally
 observed in the informal sector.
 Occupational health and safety standards are rudimentary, except for a prohibi-
 tion on the employment of women in certain dangerous occupations. Labor inspec-
 tors endeavor to monitor working conditions and accidents, but lack sufficient re-
 sources. While workers, in principle, have the right to remove themselves from work
 situations that endanger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued em-
 ployment, there were no reports of any instances in which a worker attempted to
 exercise this right.
